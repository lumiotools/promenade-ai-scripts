For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a material impact on its future GAAP financial results.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Details**\n\nBrightSpring will host a conference call today, November 1, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and financial performance. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements may relate to matters which include, but are not limited to, industries, business strategy, goals and expectations concerning our market position, future operations, margins, profitability, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources and other financial and operating information. In some cases, we have used words such as “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “future,” “will,” “seek,” “foreseeable,” “target,” “guidance,” the negative version of these words, or similar terms and phrases to identify these forward-looking statements.\n\nThe forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements relate to the future and are therefore subject to various risks, uncertainties, assumptions, or changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict or quantify. Our expectations, beliefs, and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs, and projections will result or be achieved. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to changes in global, regional, or local economic, business, competitive, market, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that these factors include but are not limited to the following:\n\n  * our operation in a highly competitive industry;\n  * our inability to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or establish new referral sources;\n  * changes to Medicare and Medicaid rates or methods governing Medicare and Medicaid payments for our services;\n  * cost containment initiatives of third-party payors, including post-payment audits;\n  * the implementation of alternative payment models and the transition of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries to managed care organizations may limit our market share and could adversely affect our revenues;\n  * changes in the case mix of patients, as well as payor mix and payment methodologies, and decisions and operations of third-party organizations;\n  * our reliance on federal and state spending, budget decisions, and continuous governmental operations which may fluctuate under different political conditions;\n  * changes in drug utilization and/or pricing, PBM contracts, and Medicare Part D/Medicaid reimbursement, which may negatively impact our profitability;\n  * changes in our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers, including changes in drug availability or pricing;\n  * reliance on the continual recruitment and retention of nurses, pharmacists, therapists, caregivers, direct support professionals, and other qualified personnel, including senior management;\n  * compliance with or changes to federal, state, and local laws and regulations that govern our employment practices, including minimum wage, living wage, and paid time-off requirements;\n  * fluctuation of our results of operations on a quarterly basis;\n  * harm caused by labor relation matters;\n  * limitations in our ability to control reimbursement rates received for our services if we are unable to maintain or reduce our costs to provide such services;\n  * delays in collection or non-collection of our accounts receivable, particularly during the business integration process;\n  * failure to manage our growth effectively, which may inhibit our ability to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and satisfaction or adequately address competitive challenges;\n  * our ability to identify, successfully complete and manage acquisitions, joint ventures, and other strategic initiatives;\n  * our ability to continue to provide consistently high quality of care;\n  * maintenance of our corporate reputation or the emergence of adverse publicity, including negative information on social media or changes in public perception of our services;\n  * contract continuance, expansion and renewal with our existing customers, including renewals at lower fee levels, customers declining to purchase additional services from us, or reduction in the services received from us pursuant to those contracts;\n  * effective investment in, implementation of improvements to and proper maintenance of the uninterrupted operation and data integrity of our information technology and other business systems;\n  * security breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions, which could compromise sensitive business or patient information; cause a loss of confidential patient data, employee data or personal information; or prevent access to critical information and thereby expose us to liability, litigation, and federal and state governmental inquiries and damage our reputation and brand;\n  * risks related to credit card payments and other payment methods;\n  * potential substantial malpractice or other similar claims;\n  * various risks related to governmental inquiries, regulatory actions, and whistleblower and other lawsuits, which may not be entirely covered by insurance;\n  * our current insurance program, which may expose us to unexpected costs, particularly if we incur losses not covered by our insurance or if claims or losses differ from our estimates;\n  * factors outside of our control, including those listed, which have required and could in the future require us to record an asset impairment of goodwill;\n  * a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease, including the ongoing effects of COVID-19;\n  * inclement weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, riots, civil insurrection or social unrest, looting, protests, strikes, or street demonstrations;\n  * our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights\n\n\n\nThe forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only as of the date of this press release, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise, except as required by law. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive, and should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward- looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, investments, or other strategic transactions we may make.\n\nFor additional information on these and other factors that could cause BrightSpring’s actual results to differ materially from expected results, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which are accessible on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ludTB-xnEYZ9TCwMWDBpm9tIyHQ078NjhIYOOGn2G8AEn03gkB5sm-TbVeMw6bJp4MdOw1gaLTW6KluVZ2ppV6c-z6u-t-T527JrZVmI5R8scdp3w2E0zdvSqCmjUa3Q0vC6BbsQfScKoM4iyTSg0tW8VzvW5tvOvfAn18iOuPmQuR27Ecrpoddjae0NaE7Fw1snEBzt7uoX8IUNKGu17UvlEn_imCGRFtuncHjnjabagA6NMrRmnFIl0jYCqOEOxcFX6h1nh4fk6SPKbFYxRyVMaMsPbMX40yY5vAWjax--nTQg7eEzENejLBhME4lBT5RS0_iO59aQoUmQIysK3tCJJyO7bx_0aG4FwYUQ6QmYq4ZvcMRjm2uGgVXFqBg9).\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures,” including “EBITDA” and “Adjusted EBITDA,” which are financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP.\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have been presented in this release as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP, because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management also believes that these measures are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish and award discretionary annual incentive compensation, and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\n\nManagement supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not GAAP measures of our financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these measures are not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management’s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, total capital expenditures, and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future.\n\nManagement defines EBITDA as net loss before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, and depreciation and amortization. Management also defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude non-cash share-based compensation, acquisition, integration and transaction-related costs, restructuring and divestiture-related and other costs, goodwill impairment, legal costs and settlements associated with certain historical matters for PharMerica, significant projects, management fees, and unreimbursed COVID-19 related costs.\n\nThe presentations of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company. Please see the end of this press release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**BrightSpring
