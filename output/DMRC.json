Looking back, we acknowledge Q3 revenue doesn’t reflect the reality just described. The gap between what lies ahead and what lies behind has never been this large and we look forward to providing additional information to bridge that gap as soon as reasonably possible.”\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\nAnnual recurring revenue(1) as of September 30, 2024 decreased to $18.7 million compared to $19.6 million as of September 30, 2023. The $0.9 million decrease reflects a $5.8 million decrease due to the delayed timing in the anticipated renewal of a commercial contract, partially offset by new annual recurring revenue from entry into new commercial subscription contracts and increased subscription fees on existing commercial contracts.\n\nSubscription revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $5.3 million compared to $4.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting higher subscription revenue from new and existing commercial contracts, partially offset by the delayed timing in the anticipated renewal of a commercial contract.\n\nService revenue for the third quarter of 2024 remained flat, compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting higher service revenue from HolyGrail recycling projects, partially offset by lower service revenue from the Central Banks.\n\nTotal revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $9.4 million compared to $9.0 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGross profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 62% compared to 58% for the third quarter of 2023. Excluding amortization expense on acquired intangible assets, subscription gross profit margin increased to 86% from 85% and service gross profit margin increased to 61% from 54% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 78% compared to 76% for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $17.3 million compared to $16.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting $0.6 million of cash severance costs and $0.4 million of lower labor costs allocated to cost of revenue due to the amount and mix of billable labor hours incurred.\n\nNon-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $14.1 million compared to $13.2 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.8 million or ($0.50) per share compared to $10.7 million or ($0.53) per share for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNon-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $6.1 million or ($0.29) per share compared to $5.9 million or ($0.29) per share for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $33.7 million compared to $27.2 million at December 31, 2023.\n\n(1) Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is a company performance metric calculated as the aggregation of annualized subscription fees from all of our commercial contracts as of the measurement date.\n\n**Conference Call** Digimarc will hold a conference call today (Thursday, November 14, 2024) to discuss these financial results and to provide a business update. CEO Riley McCormack, CFO Charles Beck, and CLO George Karamanos will host the call starting at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific time). A question and answer session will follow management’s prepared remarks.\n\nThe conference call will be broadcast live and available for replay [here](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/e44zkb6q/) and in the investor section of the company’s [website](/company/investors). The conference call script will also be posted to the company’s website shortly before the call.\n\nFor those who wish to call in via telephone to ask a question, please dial the number below at least five minutes before the scheduled start time: \n\nToll Free number: 877-407-0832International number: 201-689-8433Conference ID number: 13743904\n\n**Company Contact** :Charles BeckChief Financial OfficerCharles.Beck@digimarc.com+1 503-469-4721 \n\n**About Digimarc**[Digimarc Corporation](/) (NASDAQ: DMRC) is the pioneer and global leader in [digital watermarking](/product-digitization/data-carriers/digital-watermarks) technologies.

These forward-looking statements are statements of management’s opinion and are subject to various assumptions, risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied from the statements in this release as a result of changes in economic, business and regulatory factors, including, without limitation, the terms and timing of anticipated contract renewals. More detailed information about risk factors that may affect actual results are outlined in the company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in subsequent periodic reports filed with the SEC. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management’s opinions only as of the date of this release. Except as required by law, Digimarc undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this release.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures** This release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross profit margin, Non-GAAP operating expenses, Non-GAAP net loss, and Non-GAAP loss per share (diluted). See below for a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These non-GAAP financial measures are an important measure of our operating performance because they allow management, investors and analysts to evaluate and assess our core operating results from period-to-period after removing non-cash and non-recurring activities that affect comparability. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.\n\nDigimarc believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, together with the reconciliation to GAAP, helps management and investors make comparisons between us and other companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding GAAP measures provided by each company under applicable SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of its consolidated historical operating results, investors should examine Digimarc’s non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with its historical GAAP financial information, and investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered as alternatives to, GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of the Company nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future results.\n\n### Financial Results\n\n### Earnings Script\n\nShare this Press Release\n\n  * ![Share on LinkedIn](/themes/custom/digimarc/templates/dist/images/share-linkedin.svg)\n  * ![Share on Facebook](/themes/custom/digimarc/templates/dist/images/share-facebook.svg)\n  * ![Share on Twitter](/themes/custom/digimarc/templates/dist/images/share-twitter.svg)\n\n\n\n![Close](/themes/custom/digimarc/templates/assets/images/close-btn.svg)\n\n![leadership-team](/themes/custom/digimarc/templates/dist/images/riley.png)\n"

          "content": "Digimarc Corporation (DMRC) Conference Call\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nNovember 14, 2024\nWelcome [George Karamanos]\nWelcome to our Q3 conference call. Riley McCormack, our CEO, and Charles\nBeck, our CFO, are with me on the call. On the call today, we will provide a\nbusiness update and discuss Q3 financial results. This will be followed by a\nquestion and answer forum. We have posted our prepared remarks in the investor\nrelations section of our website and will archive this webcast there.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nBefore we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-\nlooking statements that have risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press\nrelease for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially.\nRiley will now provide a business update.\nBusiness Update [Riley McCormack]\nThank you, George, and hello everyone.\n1\nLooking forward, Q3 was the most significant quarter I have witnessed since I joined the\ncompany. Invention and market development are the twin pillars upon which all future\nopportunities are built. In both of these critical areas, we not only made significant\nprogress on things underway, we also opened new areas of opportunity we previously\ndidn’t believe addressable in the near term.\nLooking back, we acknowledge Q3 revenue doesn’t reflect the reality just\ndescribed. The gap between what lies ahead and what lies behind has never been this\nlarge. As noted in the 10-Q that we published today, our third quarter results were\nimpacted by the delayed renewal of a commercial contract. The financial component of\nthis deal is meaningful, as it represents a significant upsell. The strategic component\nwill prove transformational, not only to our company but also to the massive industry it\nwill revolutionize.\nIn fact, it is exactly this broad industry impact that has led to this deal taking longer to\nclose than all involved originally believed. Trading time-to-close for strategic scope is\nan outcome I unequivocally support. We run our business to maximize long-term value,\nand we expect our current path to do exactly that. In addition, our decision to invest a\nlarge amount of company resources in Q3 to support this deal versus other\nopportunities is another decision behind which I unequivocally stand, even knowing as\nwe do now that the expenditure of those resources wouldn’t fall in the same quarter in\nwhich the deal was signed.\nBecause of the transformational nature of this deal from both a financial and strategic\nperspective, if it closes before our next scheduled call as we currently believe is likely,\nwe will hold an interim call. On any such call, we will provide more details on this\nspecific deal as well as a more complete discussion on what lies ahead, providing the\ncontext we know we owe you as to why we believe the gap between looking forward\nand looking backward has never been this large. For reasons that will be clear, our\nability to provide the full picture today is impacted by our inability to discuss the specifics\n2\nof this deal. Instead of providing a partial picture by discussing the other important\ndevelopments I noted earlier, I will reserve the rest of my prepared remarks for this\ninterim call.\nI will now turn the call over to Charles to discuss our Q3 financial results.\nFinancial Results [Charles Beck]\nThank you, Riley, and hello everyone.\nI normally begin my discussion of our financial results by providing a snapshot of our\nkey financial metrics because I believe this overview provides useful context ahead of\ndiscussing each metric in turn. As a result of the significance of the delayed contract\nRiley just referenced, today I am going to forgo providing that snapshot because Q3\nresults are not a true representation of the state of our business.\nIn addition to having an outsized impact on ending ARR1, the delay in resigning resulted\nin no revenue being recognized nor any cash collected from this contract during Q3. By\nsignificantly impacting some of our most important financial metrics, this delay means\nquarterly financial results are not reflective of our expected go-forward performance,\neven before considering this contract renewal is expected to include a large upsell.\nEnding ARR was $18.7 million compared to $19.6 million at the end of September last\nyear. ARR decreased $900 thousand, which reflects a $5.8 million decrease due to the\ndelayed contract I just referenced, as the original contract has expired and is therefore\nexcluded from ending ARR. The decrease in ARR from this contract was partially offset\nby net new additions to ARR. While some companies include forecasted renewals in\ntheir ARR metric, we take a more conservative approach by only including contracts\nthat are booked in ARR.\n1 Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is a company performance metric calculated as the aggregation of\nannualized subscription fees from all of our commercial contracts as of the measurement date.\n3\nTotal revenue for the quarter was $9.4 million, an increase of $500 thousand or 5% from\n$9.0 million in Q3 last year.\nSubscription revenue, which accounted for 56% of total revenue for the quarter, grew\n9% from $4.8 million to $5.3 million year-over-year. The increase reflects subscription\nrevenue recognized on new customer contracts as well as upsells on existing customer\ncontracts, offset by no revenue being recognized from the impacted contract as I\nmentioned earlier. Subscription revenue growth would have been significantly higher if\nthe delayed contract had closed within Q3 as originally expected.\nService revenue was flat at $4.2 million year-over-year, reflecting higher commercial\nservice revenue from HolyGrail recycling projects partially offset by lower government\nservice revenue due to timing.\nSubscription gross profit margin2 improved slightly to 86% in Q3 this year, compared to\n85% in Q3 last year and 89% in the prior quarter. The sequential drop in subscription\ngross profit margin is due to the absorption of fixed costs over a lower subscription\nrevenue number. This metric would have been significantly higher on both a year-over-\nyear and sequential basis if the aforementioned contract had closed in Q3.\nService gross profit margin improved from 54% in Q3 last year to 61% in Q3 this year,\nreflecting a favorable change in labor mix. We expect to generate mid-50 percent\nservice gross profit margins on a normalized basis, with some fluctuation quarter to\nquarter.\nOperating expenses for the quarter were $17.3 million compared to $16.4 million in Q3\nlast year, an increase of 5%. Included in Q3 operating expenses this quarter was $600\nthousand of one-time cash severance costs for organizational changes made during the\n2 Subscription gross profit margin excludes amortization expense on acquired intangible assets.\n4\nquarter to better align our operations. Additionally, operating expenses were $400\nthousand higher due to lower labor costs allocated to cost of revenue due to the amount\nand mix of billable labor hours incurred during the quarter. Total expenses, which\nexclude the impact of allocations, were flat year-over-year when removing the $600\nthousand of one-time severance costs.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude non-cash and non-recurring items, were\n$14.1 million for the quarter, up 7% compared to $13.2 million in Q3 last year. The\nincrease in non-GAAP operating expenses closely mirrors the increase in GAAP\noperating expenses that I just explained, and like total GAAP expenses, total non-GAAP\nexpenses were flat when excluding one-time severance costs and the impact of\nallocations.\nNet loss per share for the quarter was 50 cents versus 53 cents in Q3 last year. Non-\nGAAP net loss per share was 29 cents in both periods.\nWe ended the quarter with $33.7 million in cash and short-term investments.\nFree cash flow3 usage was $7.3 million for the quarter, compared to $400 thousand in\nQ3 last year. The variation year-over-year is primarily due to the timing of cash receipts\nfrom the contract we have been referencing throughout our prepared remarks. If this\ncontract, as currently drafted, had been executed and paid within the third quarter, free\ncash flow would have been positive in Q3.\nWhile we are working diligently to finalize this contract in Q4, the receipt of payment will\nlag contract execution by standard payment terms. Even if we do not receive payment\nfrom this contract before the end of the year, we expect Q4 free cash flow usage to be\n3 Free cash flow includes cash used in operating activities, the purchase of property and equipment and\ncapitalized patent costs.\n5\nsignificantly improved from Q3. If we do receive payment before the end of the year, we\nexpect Q4 free cash flow to be significantly positive.\nFor further discussion of our financial results, and risks and prospects for our business,\nplease see our Form 10-Q that has been filed with the SEC.\nI will now turn the call back over to Riley for final remarks.\nFinal Remarks [Riley McCormack]\nThank you, Charles. I will keep my closing remarks as brief as my opening\nremarks. Q3 was the most significant quarter I have witnessed since I joined the\ncompany. What lies ahead looks much different than what can be seen in any lagging\nindicator. We look forward to closing this gap as soon as we are able. We will now\nopen the call up to questions.\n6"

Looking\nback, we acknowledge Q3 revenue doesn’t reflect the reality just described. The gap between what\nlies ahead and what lies behind has never been this large and we look forward to providing additional\ninformation to bridge that gap as soon as reasonably possible.”\nThird Quarter Financial Results\nAnnual recurring revenue(1) as of September 30, 2024 decreased to $18.7 million compared to\n$19.6 million as of September 30, 2023. The $0.9 million decrease reflects a $5.8 million decrease\ndue to the delayed timing in the anticipated renewal of a commercial contract, partially offset by new\nannual recurring revenue from entry into new commercial subscription contracts and increased\nsubscription fees on existing commercial contracts.\nSubscription revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $5.3 million compared\nto $4.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting higher subscription revenue from new\nand existing commercial contracts, partially offset by the delayed timing in the anticipated renewal of\na commercial contract.\nService revenue for the third quarter of 2024 remained flat, compared to the third quarter of 2023,\nprimarily reflecting higher service revenue from HolyGrail recycling projects, partially offset by lower\nservice revenue from the Central Banks.\nTotal revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $9.4 million compared to $9.0 million for\nthe third quarter of 2023.\nGross profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 62% compared to 58% for the third\nquarter of 2023. Excluding amortization expense on acquired intangible assets, subscription gross\nprofit margin increased to 86% from 85% and service gross profit margin increased to\n61% from 54% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023.\nNon-GAAP gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2024 increased to 78% compared to 76% for\nthe third quarter of 2023.\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $17.3 million compared to $16.4 million\nfor the third quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting $0.6 million of cash severance costs and $0.4 million\nof lower labor costs allocated to cost of revenue due to the amount and mix of billable labor hours\nincurred.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 increased to $14.1 million compared to\n$13.2 million for the third quarter of 2023.\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.8 million or ($0.50) per share compared to $10.7 million\nor ($0.53) per share for the third quarter of 2023.\nNon-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $6.1 million or ($0.29) per share compared\nto $5.9 million or ($0.29) per share for the third quarter of 2023.\nAt September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $33.7 million\ncompared to $27.2 million at December 31, 2023.\n(1) Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is a company performance metric calculated as the aggregation\nof annualized subscription fees from all of our commercial contracts as of the measurement date.\nConference Call\nDigimarc will hold a conference call today (Thursday, November 14, 2024) to discuss these financial\nresults and to provide a business update.

See below for a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measure. These non-GAAP financial measures are an important\nmeasure of our operating performance because they allow management, investors and analysts to\nevaluate and assess our core operating results from period-to-period after removing non-cash and\nnon-recurring activities that affect comparability. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures in evaluating its financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate\nperiod-to-period comparisons.\nDigimarc believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, together with the reconciliation\nto GAAP, helps management and investors make comparisons between us and other companies. In\nmaking any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use\ndifferent non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close\nattention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and\nthe corresponding GAAP measures provided by each company under applicable SEC rules. These\nnon-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under\nGAAP. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of its consolidated historical operating results,\ninvestors should examine Digimarc’s non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with its historical\nGAAP financial information, and investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in\nisolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-\nGAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered as\nalternatives to, GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the\nhistorical operating results of the Company nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future\nresults.\nDigimarc

Results\nNovember 14, 2024\nWelcome [George Karamanos]\nWelcome to our Q3 conference call. Riley McCormack, our CEO, and Charles\nBeck, our CFO, are with me on the call. On the call today, we will provide a\nbusiness update and discuss Q3 financial results. This will be followed by a\nquestion and answer forum. We have posted our prepared remarks in the investor\nrelations section of our website and will archive this webcast there.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nBefore we begin, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-\nlooking statements that have risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press\nrelease for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual\nresults to differ materially.\nRiley will now provide a business update.\nBusiness Update [Riley McCormack]\nThank you, George, and hello everyone.\n1\nLooking forward, Q3 was the most significant quarter I have witnessed since I joined the\ncompany. Invention and market development are the twin pillars upon which all future\nopportunities are built. In both of these critical areas, we not only made significant\nprogress on things underway, we also opened new areas of opportunity we previously\ndidn’t believe addressable in the near term.\nLooking back, we acknowledge Q3 revenue doesn’t reflect the reality just\ndescribed. The gap between what lies ahead and what lies behind has never been this\nlarge. As noted in the 10-Q that we published today, our third quarter results were\nimpacted by the delayed renewal of a commercial contract. The financial component of\nthis deal is meaningful, as it represents a significant upsell. The strategic component\nwill prove transformational, not only to our company but also to the massive industry it\nwill revolutionize.\nIn fact, it is exactly this broad industry impact that has led to this deal taking longer to\nclose than all involved originally believed. Trading time-to-close for strategic scope is\nan outcome I unequivocally support. We run our business to maximize long-term value,\nand we expect our current path to do exactly that. In addition, our decision to invest a\nlarge amount of company resources in Q3 to support this deal versus other\nopportunities is another decision behind which I unequivocally stand, even knowing as\nwe do now that the expenditure of those resources wouldn’t fall in the same quarter in\nwhich the deal was signed.\nBecause of the transformational nature of this deal from both a financial and strategic\nperspective, if it closes before our next scheduled call as we currently believe is likely,\nwe will hold an interim call. On any such call, we will provide more details on this\nspecific deal as well as a more complete discussion on what lies ahead, providing the\ncontext we know we owe you as to why we believe the gap between looking forward\nand looking backward has never been this large. For reasons that will be clear, our\nability to provide the full picture today is impacted by our inability to discuss the specifics\n2\nof this deal. Instead of providing a partial picture by discussing the other important\ndevelopments I noted earlier, I will reserve the rest of my prepared remarks for this\ninterim call.\nI will now turn the call over to Charles to discuss our Q3 financial results.\nFinancial Results [Charles Beck]\nThank you, Riley, and hello everyone.\nI normally begin my discussion of our financial results by providing a snapshot of our\nkey financial metrics because I believe this overview provides useful context ahead of\ndiscussing each metric in turn. As a result of the significance of the delayed contract\nRiley just referenced, today I am going to forgo providing that snapshot because Q3\nresults are not a true representation of the state of our business.\nIn addition to having an outsized impact on ending ARR1, the delay in resigning resulted\nin no revenue being recognized nor any cash collected from this contract during Q3. By\nsignificantly impacting some of our most important financial metrics, this delay means\nquarterly financial results are not reflective of our expected go-forward performance,\neven before considering this contract renewal is expected to include a large upsell.\nEnding ARR was $18.7 million compared to $19.6 million at the end of September last\nyear. ARR decreased $900 thousand, which reflects a $5.8 million decrease due to the\ndelayed contract I just referenced, as the original contract has expired and is therefore\nexcluded from ending ARR. The decrease in ARR from this contract was partially offset\nby net new additions to ARR. While some companies include forecasted renewals in\ntheir ARR metric, we take a more conservative approach by only including contracts\nthat are booked in ARR.\n1 Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is a company performance metric calculated as the aggregation of\nannualized subscription fees from all of our commercial contracts as of the measurement date.\n3\nTotal revenue for the quarter was $9.4 million, an increase of $500 thousand or 5% from\n$9.0 million in Q3 last year.\nSubscription revenue, which accounted for 56% of total revenue for the quarter, grew\n9% from $4.8 million to $5.3 million year-over-year. The increase reflects subscription\nrevenue recognized on new customer contracts as well as upsells on existing customer\ncontracts, offset by no revenue being recognized from the impacted contract as I\nmentioned earlier. Subscription revenue growth would have been significantly higher if\nthe delayed contract had closed within Q3 as originally expected.\nService revenue was flat at $4.2 million year-over-year, reflecting higher commercial\nservice revenue from HolyGrail recycling projects partially offset by lower government\nservice revenue due to timing.\nSubscription gross profit margin2 improved slightly to 86% in Q3 this year, compared to\n85% in Q3 last year and 89% in the prior quarter. The sequential drop in subscription\ngross profit margin is due to the absorption of fixed costs over a lower subscription\nrevenue number. This metric would have been significantly higher on both a year-over-\nyear and sequential basis if the aforementioned contract had closed in Q3.\nService gross profit margin improved from 54% in Q3 last year to 61% in Q3 this year,\nreflecting a favorable change in labor mix. We expect to generate mid-50 percent\nservice gross profit margins on a normalized basis, with some fluctuation quarter to\nquarter.\nOperating expenses for the quarter were $17.3 million compared to $16.4 million in Q3\nlast year, an increase of 5%. Included in Q3 operating expenses this quarter was $600\nthousand of one-time cash severance costs for organizational changes made during the\n2 Subscription gross profit margin excludes amortization expense on acquired intangible assets.\n4\nquarter to better align our operations. Additionally, operating expenses were $400\nthousand higher due to lower labor costs allocated to cost of revenue due to the amount\nand mix of billable labor hours incurred during the quarter. Total expenses, which\nexclude the impact of allocations, were flat year-over-year when removing the $600\nthousand of one-time severance costs.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude non-cash and non-recurring items, were\n$14.1 million for the quarter, up 7% compared to $13.2 million in Q3 last year. The\nincrease in non-GAAP operating expenses closely mirrors the increase in GAAP\noperating expenses that I just explained, and like total GAAP expenses, total non-GAAP\nexpenses were flat when excluding one-time severance costs and the impact of\nallocations.\nNet loss per share for the quarter was 50 cents versus 53 cents in Q3 last year. Non-\nGAAP net loss per share was 29 cents in both periods.\nWe ended the quarter with $33.7 million in cash and short-term investments.\nFree cash flow3 usage was $7.3 million for the quarter, compared to $400 thousand in\nQ3 last year. The variation year-over-year is primarily due to the timing of cash receipts\nfrom the contract we have been referencing throughout our prepared remarks. If this\ncontract, as currently drafted, had been executed and paid within the third quarter, free\ncash flow would have been positive in Q3.\nWhile we are working diligently to finalize this contract in Q4, the receipt of payment will\nlag contract execution by standard payment terms. Even if we do not receive payment\nfrom this contract before the end of the year, we expect Q4 free cash flow usage to be\n3 Free cash flow includes cash used in operating activities, the purchase of property and equipment and\ncapitalized patent costs.\n5\nsignificantly improved from Q3. If we do receive payment before the end of the year, we\nexpect Q4 free cash flow to be significantly positive.\nFor further discussion of our financial results, and risks and prospects for our business,\nplease see our Form 10-Q that has been filed with the SEC.\nI will now turn the call back over to Riley for final remarks.\nFinal Remarks [Riley McCormack]\nThank you, Charles. I will keep my closing remarks as brief as my opening\nremarks. Q3 was the most significant quarter I have witnessed since I joined the\ncompany. What lies ahead looks much different than what can be seen in any lagging\nindicator. We look forward to closing this gap as soon as we are able. We will now\nopen the call up to questions.\n6"

This non-GAAP financial measure is an important measure of our operating\nperformance because it allows management, investors and analysts to evaluate and assess our core operating results from period-to-period after removing non-cash and\nnon-recurring activities that affect comparability.Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, amongst others, in evaluating our financial and operational\ndecision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.\nDigimarc believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures, together with the reconciliation within our SEC filings to GAAP financial measures, helps management and\ninvestors make comparisons between us and other companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different\nnon-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between\nsuch measures and the corresponding GAAP measures provided by each company under applicable SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures are not\nmeasurements of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of its consolidated historical operating results, investors should\nexamine Digimarc’s non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with its historical GAAP financial information, and investors should not consider non-GAAP financial\nmeasures in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental\nto, and should not be considered as alternatives to, GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of the\nCompany nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future results.\n(4) ARR at 12/31/21 includes ARR from EVRYTHNG for comparative purposes as the acquisition closed on January 3, 2022.\n(5) Commercial subscription revenue was adjusted to add EVRYTHNG subscription revenue for FY'2021 for comparative purposes.\n(6) Commercial subscription revenue was adjusted to remove Piracy Intelligence subscription revenue for FY'2021 and FY’2022 for comparative purposes as the product has\nbeen end-of-lived with no revenue in FY’2023 and beyond.\n(7) The decrease in subscription gross profit margins from FY'2021 to FY'2022 reflects the impact of the EVRYTHNG acquisition.\n19\n©2024 Digimarc Corporation • digimarc.com\n2200"
