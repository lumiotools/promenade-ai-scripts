(NASDAQ: SBT) (“Sterling” or the “Company”), the holding company of Sterling Bank and Trust, F.S.B. (the “Bank”), today reported its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **Net loss of $(0.1) million, or $(0.00) per diluted share**\n  * **Net interest margin of 2.30%**\n  * **Nonperforming loans of $13.2 million, 1.08% of total loans and 0.54% of total assets**\n  * **Provision for (recovery of) credit losses of $(2.3) million; ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans of 2.04%**\n  * **Non-interest expense of $15.6 million**\n  * **Shareholders’ equity of $334.6 million**\n  * **Company’s consolidated and Bank’s leverage ratio of 14.18% and 13.72%, respectively**\n  * **Total deposits of $2.1 billion**\n  * **Total gross loans of $1.2 billion**\n\n\n\nThe Company reported a net loss of $(0.1) million, or $(0.00) per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $1.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\nAs previously disclosed, on September 15, 2024, Sterling, the Bank and EverBank Financial Corp (“EverBank”) entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement providing for the purchase by EverBank of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Bank from Sterling (the “Transaction”) for cash consideration of $261.0 million. Also on September 15, 2024, Sterling’s board of directors unanimously approved a plan of dissolution providing for the dissolution of Sterling under Michigan law following the closing of the Transaction. The Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. The Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, among which include the approval of the definitive stock purchase agreement, the Transaction and the plan of dissolution by the requisite vote of the Company’s shareholders and the receipt of required regulatory approvals. \n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n**Total Assets** – Total assets were $2.4 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $63.8 million, or 3%, from June 30, 2024. \n\nCash and due from banks increased $110.6 million, or 18%, to $710.4 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $599.8 million at June 30, 2024 primarily due to net cash inflows from the growth in deposits and the decline in loans. Debt securities decreased $5.5 million, or 1%, to $436.4 million at September 30, 2024. All debt securities are available for sale, have a relatively short duration and are considered part of our liquid assets. \n\nTotal gross loans of $1.2 billion at September 30, 2024 decreased $40.5 million, or 3%, from June 30, 2024. Residential real estate loans were $904.4 million, a decrease of $67.9 million, or 7%, from June 30, 2024. Commercial real estate loans were $306.9 million, an increase of $29.7 million, or 11%, from June 30, 2024. \n\n**Total Deposits** – Total deposits were $2.1 billion at September 30, 2024, an increase of $53.7 million, or 3%, from June 30, 2024. Money market, savings and NOW deposits were $1.1 billion, a decrease of $12.3 million from June 30, 2024. Time deposits were $972.2 million, an increase of $67.0 million from June 30, 2024. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $31.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $32.2 million at June 30, 2024. Total estimated uninsured deposits to total deposits were approximately 22% at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our current strategy is to continue to offer competitive interest rates on our deposit products to maintain our existing customer deposit base and maintain our liquidity. \n\n**Capital** –Total shareholders’ equity was $334.6 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $5.7 million compared to $328.9 million at June 30, 2024, primarily due to a $5.3 million reduction in the unrealized loss on our debt securities portfolio included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, the consolidated Company’s and Bank’s leverage ratios were 14.18% and 13.72%, respectively. Both the Company and the Bank are required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9.0% to have satisfied the minimum regulatory capital requirements as well as the capital ratio requirements to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes. \n\n**Asset Quality and Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses** – A provision for (recovery of) credit losses of $(2.3) million was recorded for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $(2.1) million for the second quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, the recovery of credit losses related to loans of $(2.6) million was primarily due to the reduction in the commercial real estate portfolio’s allowance reflecting the continued strong credit quality of the portfolio. In addition, the residential mortgage portfolio’s allowance had a reduction primarily due to continued run-off of that portfolio. A provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 of $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 was $25.0 million, or 2.04% of total loans, compared to $27.6 million, or 2.18% of total loans at June 30, 2024. \n\nRecoveries of loan losses during the third and second quarter of 2024 were $10 thousand and $440 thousand, respectively, with no charge offs in either quarter. \n\nNonperforming loans, comprised primarily of nonaccrual residential real estate loans, totaled $13.2 million, or 0.54% of total assets at September 30, 2024, compared to $12.2 million, or 0.51% of total assets at June 30, 2024. \n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin** – Net interest income for the third quarter of 2024 was $13.6 million compared to $14.4 million for the second quarter of 2024. The net interest margin was 2.30% and 2.44% for the third and second quarter of 2024, respectively. The decrease in net interest income during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a $1.3 million increase in interest expense. This increase in interest expense reflects an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of $42.0 million, or 2%, as well as a 15 basis point increase in the rate paid on deposits during the third quarter of 2024 over the rate paid during the second quarter of 2024. This increase in interest expense was partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in interest income earned on our average balance of investment securities and other interest-earnings assets. Interest income on loans declined $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior quarter as a decline in the average loan portfolio balance of $28.2 million, or 2%, was offset in part by an 11 basis point increase in the yield on the average loan portfolio. The increase in the yield was due primarily to a 7 basis point increase in residential mortgage rates resetting in the higher interest rate environment and a 46 basis point increase in commercial real estate loan yields due to the growth in the portfolio at yields higher than the second quarter portfolio yield. \n\n**Non-Interest Income** – Non-interest income for the third quarter of 2024 as comparted to the second quarter of 2024 was essentially unchanged as an unrealized gain on an equity security of $0.2 million was offset by $0.2 million less in funds received from the Federal Home Loan Bank based on the performance of loans previously sold to them. \n\n**Non-Interest Expense** – Non-interest expense of $15.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 reflected an increase of $0.7 million, or 5%, compared to $14.9 million for the second quarter of 2024. This increase was primarily due to a $0.9 million increase in professional fees which included increased professional fees incurred in connection with the Transaction. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased $0.3 million, or 4%, primarily due to the annual merit increase and adjustments to certain employees’ base compensation. Partially offsetting the increases in professional fees and salaries and employee benefits, other expenses decreased $0.5 million, or 32%. \n\n**Income Tax Expense** – For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $0.9 million. Income tax expense includes an additional $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 to reverse a tax position previously taken on the deductibility of interest earned on U.S. government obligations under applicable state tax law. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $0.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 33.0%. Our effective tax rate varies from the statutory rate primarily due to the correction in the third quarter of 2024 discussed above as well as the impact of non-deductible compensation-related expenses. \n\n**About Sterling Bancorp, Inc.**\n\nSterling Bancorp, Inc. is a unitary thrift holding company.

These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and they are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control.

Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. The risks, uncertainties and other factors detailed from time to time in our public filings, including those included in the disclosures under the headings “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 14, 2024, subsequent periodic reports and future periodic reports, could affect future results and events, causing those results and events to differ materially from those views expressed or implied in the Company’s forward-looking statements.

Other sections of this Press Release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Press Release.

(NASDAQ: SBT) (“Sterling” or the “Company”), the holding company of Sterling Bank and Trust, F.S.B. (the “Bank”), today announced that the Company has entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement with Jacksonville, Florida-based EverBank Financial Corp (“EverBank”), pursuant to which EverBank would acquire all of the stock of the Bank for fixed cash consideration of $261,000,000. The sale transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by Sterling’s shareholders. Sterling’s board of directors has unanimously approved the sale transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. As a condition for EverBank to enter into the sale transaction, trustees for family trusts representing approximately 38% of the outstanding common stock of the Company have entered into agreements pursuant to which they have committed to vote their shares in favor of the sale transaction. \n\nAs another condition for EverBank to enter into the sale transaction, the Bank entered into a definitive mortgage loan purchase agreement with Bayview Acquisitions LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Bayview”), which provides for the sale to Bayview of all of the Bank’s residential tenant-in-common mortgage loans. The closing of the loan sale is to occur immediately prior to the closing of the sale of the Bank. \n\nIn connection with its approval of the sale of the Bank to EverBank, the Company also adopted a plan of dissolution for the Company following closing of the sale (the “Plan of Dissolution”). The Company expects to wind down as quickly as possible after the sale, consistent with Michigan law and the Plan of Dissolution. Cash distributions to shareholders pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution will likely occur in two stages, with an initial distribution to shareholders of substantially all of the proceeds from the sale of the Bank to occur shortly following the closing. The final distribution would occur following the resolution of all of the Company’s obligations and liabilities in accordance with Michigan law and the Plan of Dissolution. It is anticipated that the earliest the final distribution would occur is six months following the closing of the sale of the Bank to EverBank. \n\nThomas M. O’Brien, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented: \n\n“The board of directors of the Company has been considering various strategic initiatives for several years. \n\nWe retained outside consultants to help model scenarios where we would maintain various versions of independent operations. In December 2022 we engaged Keefe Bruyette & Woods to act as our financial advisor to assist us in exploring and evaluating potential opportunities for a strategic combination with another bank. As that process began we were finalizing the settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. Almost simultaneously, the banking industry experienced the collapse of three large depository institutions beginning in March 2023, which roiled the market for acquisitions of banks. Consequently, our strategic process was significantly extended over time as this has been the environment in which we have been operating and evaluating our options. \n\nUltimately, Sterling’s board of directors determined that there was no practical way to pursue any form of stand-alone independent operations given the extremely high costs required and the multiple years needed to execute a new strategic vision without risking ongoing losses and substantial loss of capital. The financial risk and potential need for a dilutive equity raise made those options impractical. In the difficult capital market environment for banks post-March 2023, and with the assistance of our financial advisors, we conducted multiple outreach efforts to dozens of other financial institutions to assess the interest and value of a combination with Sterling. We publicly announced that we engaged a financial advisor to assist the board in evaluating strategic alternatives in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC in August of 2023. However, for a variety of reasons particular to each institution, including lack of capacity, diminished market capitalizations, desired patience for future alternatives arguably more attractive than Sterling, their own regulatory concerns and potentially other reasons not shared with us, no interest was forthcoming that we believed was actionable. We were focused on finding a transaction that would be fully funded and not likely to raise regulatory concerns in the application process, while also providing our shareholders with as attractive a consideration as we could develop. In EverBank, we believe that we have found solutions to each of those corporate imperatives. EverBank has been cooperative and forthcoming in all of our negotiations and we have confidence in their ability to execute the transaction in a timely fashion. EverBank has both the cash and capital to execute without need of further financing and we do not anticipate unusual delays in the regulatory approval process. \n\nThe situation at Sterling since the difficult days of 2020 has changed dramatically. At that time, we were facing serious existential threats, which has evolved into a situation where our capital and liquidity positions are strong and the multiple governmental investigations have finally concluded, though our earnings capacity has diminished. The mono-line nature of the Bank’s legacy Advantage Loan Program business model has created a significant revenue void for us. While our current financial condition stands in stark contrast to that of a few years ago, the legacy absence of a diversified business model has constrained the Company’s ability to generate meaningful earnings and growth. As noted above, the projected time and costs in reinventing the Bank would be punitive. Additionally, our strategic efforts have been further complicated by the business conditions in the community banking space. Such conditions have been very unsettled since the crisis in March 2023. This has precipitated a dearth of merger and acquisitions activity and a significant decline in valuations. All of that continues to this day. \n\nSterling will be soliciting shareholder support for this transaction at a special meeting of Sterling’s shareholders. In the proxy statement to be distributed in connection with this meeting, we will explain in greater detail the extensive process that we have undertaken to arrive at this point and the business rationale for avoiding a “go it alone” strategy. Since the engagement of financial advisors as part of our strategic planning process, the Company’s board of directors and management team have been deeply involved in evaluating potential options. After multiple meetings to consider the economic and operating alternatives, and after consultation regarding legal and financial matters with counsel and our financial advisors, the Company’s board of directors has unanimously concluded that the EverBank proposal represented the best available outcome for our shareholders, who have patiently supported us in our remediation efforts these past several years.” \n\nUpon completion of the proposed sale of the Bank, the Bank will be merged into EverBank, which will operate the Bank’s branch offices, other than our Michigan branch, as offices of EverBank. We will shortly commence efforts to close the Michigan branch at the time of completion of the sale transaction in accordance with applicable law. All of the Bank’s deposit accounts at the time of the closing will continue to enjoy the benefits of FDIC coverage as customers of EverBank and loan customers will be serviced on EverBank’s platform following a transition period. \n\n**Purchase Agreement Terms**\n\nUnder the terms of the stock purchase agreement, EverBank would acquire all of the capital stock of the Bank from the Company for fixed cash consideration of $261,000,000. Subsequent to EverBank’s purchase of the stock of the Bank, the Bank will merge with and into EverBank, National Association, with EverBank, National Association as the surviving entity, and the separate existence of the Bank will cease. The stock purchase agreement contains customary representation, warranties and covenants and includes closing conditions for EverBank’s obligation to complete the transaction that (i) the average daily closing balance of the Bank’s deposits (other than brokered deposits) for the monthly period ending on the last day of the month before closing is not less than 85% of the average daily closing balance of such deposits for the monthly period ending on July 31, 2024 and (ii) the Bank has sold its portfolio of residential tenant-in-common loans, which had an aggregate principal balance of $372,880,890 at June 30, 2024, to Bayview, which is an affiliate of an experienced private equity sponsor firm, at the purchase price agreed with Bayview. \n\nImmediately following the closing of the sale transaction, Sterling is expected to voluntarily delist its common stock from Nasdaq, with trading in the stock intended to cease at such time or immediately thereafter, and deregister its common stock in order to terminate and suspend its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The closing date of the sale would be the record date for the shareholder distributions under the Plan of Dissolution. \n\n**Plan of Dissolution**\n\nThe Company plans to seek shareholder approval and adoption of the Plan of Dissolution at the same special meeting of shareholders at which the sale of the Bank to EverBank will be voted upon. If the Plan of Dissolution is approved by Sterling’s shareholders, Sterling intends to file a certificate of dissolution with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs and distribute all remaining assets, expected to be all cash, to its shareholders according to their respective rights and interests, with the final distribution subject to first completing the wind down of the Company and paying or providing for the Company’s creditors and existing and reasonably foreseeable debts, liabilities, and obligations in accordance with Michigan law and the Plan of Dissolution. Cash distributions to shareholders pursuant to the Plan of Dissolution will likely occur in two stages, as described earlier in this release. Sterling expects that liquidating distributions made to its shareholders would not be treated as dividends for tax purposes, but rather as return of capital. Selected members of the Company’s executive management team along with outside advisors will oversee the Company’s wind down and dissolution. \n\n**Advisors**\n\nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods, _A Stifel Company_, acted as financial advisor to the Company, and Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP served as legal advisor to the Company. Hovde Group, LLC also acted as financial advisor to the Company solely to provide certain additional financial advisory services to the Company’s board of directors. \n\n**About Sterling Bancorp, Inc.**\n\nSterling Bancorp, Inc. is a unitary thrift holding company. Its wholly owned subsidiary, Sterling Bank and Trust, F.S.B., has primary branch operations in the San Francisco and Los Angeles, California metropolitan areas and New York City.

(NASDAQ: SBT) (“Sterling” or the “Company”), the holding company of Sterling Bank and Trust, F.S.B. (the “Bank”), today reported its unaudited financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **Net income of $1.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share**\n  * **Net interest margin of 2.44%**\n  * **Nonperforming loans of $12.2 million, 0.97% of total loans and 0.51% of total assets**\n  * **Provision for (recovery of) credit losses of $(2.1) million; ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans of 2.18%**\n  * **Non-interest expense of $14.9 million**\n  * **Shareholders’ equity of $328.9 million**\n  * **Company’s consolidated and Bank’s leverage ratio of 14.26% and 13.80%, respectively**\n  * **Total deposits of $2.0 billion**\n  * **Total gross loans of $1.3 billion**\n\n\n\nThe Company reported net income of $1.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $(0.2) million, or $(0.00) per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. \n\n“Our focus remains fixed on protecting book value and Sterling’s financial position while we continue to explore opportunities to prudently reposition the Company and increase net income. The margin compression experienced by Sterling is generally consistent with what is being felt in much of the community banking industry. Additionally, our substantial level of liquidity continues to exert some downward pressure on earnings. Credit quality remains strong as do our capital ratios. The capital markets have seen some welcome signs of life and recent activity continues to encourage us to maintain the course of action that we are on. Deposit levels remain essentially flat which is our preferred position at this time. While the residential portfolio continues to decline through prepayments and amortization, we are seeing some growth in our commercial portfolio as several very attractive opportunities have come to fruition,” said Thomas M. O’Brien, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. \n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n**Total Assets** – Total assets were $2.4 billion at June 30, 2024, a decrease of $39.8 million, or 2%, from March 31, 2024. \n\nCash and due from banks decreased $46.4 million, or 7%, to $599.8 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $646.2 million at March 31, 2024. Debt securities increased $47.1 million, or 12%, to $441.9 million at June 30, 2024. All debt securities are available for sale, have a relatively short duration and are considered part of our liquid assets. \n\nTotal gross loans of $1.3 billion at June 30, 2024 decreased $39.0 million, or 3%, from March 31, 2024. Residential real estate loans were $972.3 million, a decrease of $68.1 million from March 31, 2024. Commercial real estate loans were $277.3 million, an increase of $32.7 million from March 31, 2024. \n\n**Total Deposits** – Total deposits were $2.0 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of $7.6 million from March 31, 2024. Money market, savings and NOW deposits were $1.1 billion, an increase of $3.9 million from March 31, 2024. Time deposits were $905.2 million, an increase of $4.2 million from March 31, 2024. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $32.2 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $32.7 million at March 31, 2024. Total estimated uninsured deposits to total deposits were approximately 22% at June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Our current strategy is to continue to offer competitive interest rates on our deposit products to maintain our existing customer deposit base and maintain our liquidity. \n\n**Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings** – In May 2024 the Company repaid with existing cash $50.0 million of a long-term fixed rate borrowing that the Federal Home Loan Bank called, as expected. \n\n**Capital** –Total shareholders’ equity was $328.9 million at June 30, 2024, an increase of $1.6 million compared to $327.3 million at March 31, 2024. \n\nAt June 30, 2024, the consolidated Company’s and Bank’s leverage ratios were 14.26% and 13.80%, respectively. Both the Company and the Bank are required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9.0% to have satisfied the minimum regulatory capital requirements as well as the capital ratio requirements to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes. \n\n**Asset Quality and Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses** – A provision for (recovery of) credit losses of $(2.1) million was recorded for the second quarter of 2024 compared to a provision for credit losses of $41 thousand for the first quarter of 2024. In the second quarter of 2024, the recovery of credit losses related to loans of $(2.1) million was primarily the result of a reduction in the allowance for credit losses on our residential loans due to a decline in this portfolio and lower future loss rates on one of our residential loan products. A recovery of credit losses related to loans of $(0.1) million was recorded in the first quarter of 2024. A provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments was recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024 of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The allowance for credit losses at June 30, 2024 was $27.6 million, or 2.18% of total loans, compared to $29.3 million, or 2.24% of total loans, at March 31, 2024. \n\nNet charge offs (recoveries) during the second quarter of 2024 and first quarter of 2024 were $(0.4) million and $0, respectively. \n\nNonperforming loans, comprised primarily of nonaccrual residential real estate loans, totaled $12.2 million, or 0.51% of total assets at June 30, 2024, compared to $9.3 million, or 0.39% of total assets at March 31, 2024. Nonperforming loans at June 30, 2024 included a $1.1 million matured commercial real estate loan, which was extended subsequent to the end of the quarter and is included in loans 90 days past due and still accruing. \n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin** – Net interest income for the second quarter of 2024 was $14.4 million compared to $14.9 million for the first quarter of 2024. The net interest margin was 2.44% and 2.52% for the second and first quarter of 2024, respectively. The decrease in net interest income during the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a $1.3 million increase in interest expense on our average balance of interest-bearing deposits since the rate paid during the second quarter of 2024 increased 22 basis points. This decrease was partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in interest income earned on our average balance of investment securities and other interest-earnings assets. Interest income on loans declined $0.3 million in the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior quarter as a decline in the average loan portfolio balance of $58.7 million, or 4%, was offset in part by the 18 basis point increase in the yield on the average loan portfolio. The increase in the yield was due primarily to residential mortgage rates resetting in the higher interest rate environment. \n\n**Non-Interest Income** – Non-interest income for the second quarter of 2024 and first quarter of 2024 was $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, an increase of $0.2 million, primarily due to funds received from the Federal Home Loan Bank based on the performance of loans previously sold to them. \n\n**Non-Interest Expense** – Non-interest expense of $14.9 million for the second quarter of 2024 reflected a decrease of $0.5 million, or 3%, compared to $15.4 million for the first quarter of 2024. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.3 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits. In the prior quarter, we completed staff reductions in various support positions which resulted in a decline of $0.2 million in salaries and employee benefits expense compared to the first quarter of 2024. Also, favorably impacting the first quarter of 2024 was a reversal of a liability for deferred compensation. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice advised the Company in May 2024 that it had closed all of its investigations focused on the Bank’s former Advantage Loan Program. Accordingly, we no longer expect to incur any future costs to cooperate with these completed government investigations or in connection with claims for the advancement or reimbursement of legal fees to third parties due to such investigations. \n\n**Income Tax Expense (Benefit)** – For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $0.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 33.0%, compared to an income tax (benefit) of $(0.1) million, or an effective tax rate of 34.3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our effective tax rate varies from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of non-deductible compensation related expenses. \n\nMr. O’Brien said, “The year is progressing quickly and we believe there are some hopeful signs of easing inflation, moderating interest rates, and lessening financial stress in the economy. The Company will continue to move forward and explore its opportunities. We believe this is the most prudent course of action given our unique circumstances and the current market dynamics.” \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nManagement will host a conference call on Wednesday, July 24, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s unaudited financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.

These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance, including any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “might,” “should,” “could,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “anticipate,” and “would” or the negative versions of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature, though the absence of these words does not mean a statement is not forward-looking.

(the “Bank”), today reported its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. \n\n**First Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * **Net loss of $(0.2) million, or $(0.00) per diluted share**\n  * **Net interest margin of 2.52%**\n  * **Nonperforming loans of $9.3 million, or 0.72% of total loans and 0.39% of total assets**\n  * **Provision for credit losses of $41 thousand; ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans of 2.24%**\n  * **Non-interest expense of $15.4 million**\n  * **Shareholders’ equity of $327.3 million**\n  * **Company’s consolidated and Bank’s leverage ratio of 14.10% and 13.58%, respectively**\n  * **Total deposits of $2.0 billion**\n  * **Total gross loans of $1.3 billion**\n\n\n\nThe Company reported a net loss of $(0.2) million, or $(0.00) per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to net income of $5.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. \n\n“Sterling’s first quarter of 2024 financial results are essentially break-even and are consistent with our plan to protect both book value and liquidity during this period of financial uncertainty. We believe Sterling’s credit quality, liquidity and capital levels are robust and are the beneficial product of the decisions made since 2020 to aggressively attack significant legacy credit and operating deficiencies. Notwithstanding those prudent actions, market interest rate movements continue to exert pressure on the margin as deposit costs have increased somewhat faster than earning asset yields, further inhibiting meaningful profitability. It is our intention to continue to manage the Company in such a way as to provide the most optimal flexibility as we navigate this uncertain economy. \n\n“The results also reflect an increase in professional fees in the quarter due primarily to the absence of the insurance reimbursements received in the prior quarter and current quarter costs of what we believe are the bulk of the reimbursement of remaining third-party legal expenses. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency appears to have completed its investigations of various Institution Affiliated Parties with the public announcement last week of enforcement actions against Sterling’s former CEO and its controlling shareholder. Taken together with similar public actions taken by the agency over the past few months, we believe the picture drawn for all to see is consistent with what we have been reporting throughout my tenure as CEO. These current regulatory orders, civil money penalties and banking industry prohibitions are a stark reminder of the damage caused by certain individuals. The price we have paid was steep and it is only through the hard work of Sterling’s board and management that the Company and the Bank are today in the strong position that both enjoy,” said Thomas M. O’Brien, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n**Total Assets** – Total assets were $2.4 billion both at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. \n\nCash and due from banks increased $68.2 million, or 12%, to $646.2 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $578.0 million at December 31, 2023. Debt securities, all of which are available for sale, are of relatively short duration and which we consider part of our liquid assets, of $394.9 million at March 31, 2024 decreased $24.4 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2023. \n\nTotal gross loans of $1.3 billion at March 31, 2024 declined $45.7 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2023. \n\n**Total Deposits** – Total deposits were $2.0 billion both at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Time deposits were $901.0 million, an increase of $27.8 million, or 3%, compared to $873.2 million at December 31, 2023. Money market, savings and NOW deposits were $1.1 billion, a decrease of $23.3 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $32.7 million at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 7%, compared to December 31, 2023. While total deposits increased less than 1%, certain customers migrated balances from their money market accounts into time deposits, primarily into maturity tenors up to thirteen months, which we believe was likely to lock in current rates in anticipation of possible future rate decreases. Total estimated uninsured deposits were approximately 22% of total deposits both at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We have continued our current strategy to offer competitive interest rates on our deposit products to maintain our existing customer deposit base and help manage our liquidity. \n\n**Capital** –Total shareholders’ equity was $327.3 million at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $0.4 million compared to $327.7 million at December 31, 2023. \n\nAt March 31, 2024, the consolidated Company’s and Bank’s leverage ratios were 14.10% and 13.58%, respectively. Each of the Company and the Bank is required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9.0% to be considered to have satisfied the minimum regulatory capital requirements as well as the capital ratio requirements to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes. \n\n**Asset Quality and Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses** – A provision for credit losses of $41 thousand, consisting of a recovery of credit losses related to loans of $(0.1) million and a provision of credit losses for unfunded commitments of $0.2 million, was recorded for the first quarter of 2024 compared to a recovery of credit losses of $(4.4) million consisting of a recovery of credit losses related to loans of $(4.9) million and a provision of credit losses for unfunded commitments of $0.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The recovery of credit losses related to loans was the result of the decline in the loan portfolio during the present quarter partially offset by changing economic conditions which increased model assumptions used to forecast credit losses, keeping the overall allowance for credit losses relatively flat. The allowance for credit losses at March 31, 2024 was $29.3 million, or 2.24% of total loans, compared to $29.4 million, or 2.18% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. \n\nNet charge offs (recoveries) during the first quarter of 2024 and fourth quarter of 2023 were $0 and $(64) thousand, respectively. \n\nNonperforming assets, comprised primarily of nonaccrual residential real estate loans, at March 31, 2024 totaled $9.3 million, or 0.39% of total assets, compared to $9.0 million, or 0.37% of total assets at December 31, 2023. \n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin** – Net interest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $14.9 million compared to $15.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The net interest margin was 2.52% for both the first quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest income during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to a $0.5 million increase in interest expense on our average balance of interest-bearing deposits since the rate paid during the first quarter of 2024 increased 21 basis points, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in interest income earned on our average balance of investment securities and other interest-earnings assets. Interest income on loans was flat in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior quarter as the impact of the 22 basis point increase in the yield on the average loan portfolio was offset by a $47.8 million, or 3%, decline in the average loan portfolio balance. The increase in the yield was due primarily to residential mortgage rates resetting in the higher interest rate environment. \n\n**Non-Interest Income** – Non-interest income for the first quarter of 2024 and fourth quarter of 2023 was $199 thousand and $213 thousand, respectively, a decline of $14 thousand. \n\n**Non-Interest Expense** – Non-interest expense of $15.4 million for the first quarter of 2024 reflected an increase of $2.6 million, or 20%, compared to $12.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily due to a $3.1 million increase in professional fees. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we received $3.8 million from our insurance carriers for expenses previously incurred relating to the governmental investigations of the Company and Bank related to the previously terminated Advantage Loan Program. While the Department of Justice’s investigation of the Bank and Company was resolved in 2023, we continued to incur significant costs in connection with our ongoing cooperation with governmental investigations of certain individuals and the advancement or reimbursement of third parties for the legal costs pursuant to requests for indemnification and advancement of expenses. We were informed in late 2023 that any future costs would not be covered by our insurance carriers. Excluding insurance proceeds received in the fourth quarter of 2023, our professional fees in the first quarter of 2024 declined from the fourth quarter of 2023. \n\n**Income Tax Expense (Benefit)** – For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded an income tax (benefit) of $(0.1) million, or an effective tax rate of 34.3%, compared to an income tax provision of $1.8 million, or an effective tax rate of 26.0%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Our effective tax rate varies from the statutory rate for the current quarter primarily due to the impact of non-deductible compensation related expenses. \n\nMr. O’Brien said, “Lyle Wolberg recently resigned as a director of the Company and the Bank and the board elected our Chief Operating Officer, Christine Meredith, to fill the vacancy on both the Company and Bank boards. While the composition of our board remains heavily weighted with independent members, we believe the addition of Ms. Meredith will provide management continuity and depth as we continue in our efforts to evaluate and implement a new strategic direction.” \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nManagement will host a conference call on Wednesday, April 24, 2024 at 11:00 AM Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s unaudited financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

(NASDAQ: SBT) (“Sterling” or the “Company”), the holding company of Sterling Bank and Trust, F.S.B. (the “Bank”), today reported its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. \n\n**Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Highlights**\n\n  * **Fourth quarter net income of $5.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share; full year net income of $7.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share**\n  * **Fourth quarter net interest margin of 2.52%; full year net interest margin of 2.68%**\n  * **Fourth quarter provision for (recovery of) credit losses of $(4.4) million; full year provision for (recovery of) credit losses of $(8.5) million**\n  * **Nonperforming assets of $9.0 million, or 0.37% of total assets**\n  * **Ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans of 2.18%**\n  * **Total gross loans of $1.3 billion**\n  * **Fourth quarter non-interest expense of $12.8 million; full year non-interest expense of $65.7 million**\n  * **Total deposits of $2.0 billion**\n  * **Shareholders’ equity of $327.7 million**\n  * **Company’s consolidated and Bank’s leverage ratio of 13.95% and 13.38%, respectively**\n\n\n\nThe Company reported net income of $5.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, net income was $7.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $(14.2) million, or $(0.28) per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n\nThomas M. O’Brien, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer commented: \n\n“Sterling’s fourth quarter reflects continuing improvement in our expense management as the government investigations directed at Sterling have been resolved. However, we continued to bear expenses from certain indemnified individuals who are responding to government inquiries. In the fourth quarter, those expenses were approximately $0.7 million, which was more than offset by the receipt of $3.8 million of insurance reimbursements for certain prior invoices. Our directors and officers insurance covering these matters was ultimately exhausted with these payments, and we do not expect any future defense costs to be covered by insurance. We will also continue to bear modest legal, compliance and administrative costs related to our commitments under the Plea Agreement with the DOJ. Our loan portfolio declined throughout the year as we have not introduced new lending products, yet we generally maintained our total assets by increasing our short-term liquid assets at rates above our funding costs. Resulting net income for the quarter and the year further enhanced our strong capital position. \n\nGoing forward, we believe the impact of the elevated interest rate environment, particularly on deposit prices, will not likely improve in the near-term, although the pace of the rise in deposit costs has slowed. We continually evaluate our strategic position and alternatives, and currently believe that prevailing economic conditions and the lack of a robust capital market for community banks create significant limitations on pursuing a new strategic direction. Accordingly, we have elected to be patient and wait for market conditions to improve before pursuing new strategies. This approach could also create opportunities for potential strategic combinations. In the meantime, we believe we have positioned Sterling well to protect our strengths, namely: strong capital, strong liquidity and solid credit quality.” \n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n**Total Assets** – Total assets were $2.4 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $30.7 million, or 1%, from September 30, 2023 and a decrease of $28.7 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2022. \n\nCash and due from banks increased $14.3 million, or 3%, to $578.0 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $563.6 million at September 30, 2023 and increased $198.2 million, or 52%, from $379.8 million at December 31, 2022.

Our current strategy is to continue to offer market interest rates on our deposit products to maintain our existing customer base and our liquidity position. \n\n**Borrowings** – Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings were $50 million at December 31, 2023, which were unchanged from September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company redeemed all of its subordinated notes with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $65.0 million at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. \n\n**Capital –** Total shareholders’ equity was $327.7 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $316.1 million at September 30, 2023 and $312.6 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in shareholders’ equity since September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to a $5.8 million reduction in the unrealized loss on our investment securities portfolio included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of lower market yields of U.S. Treasury securities with longer maturities during the fourth quarter of 2023, along with net income of $5.1 million for the fourth quarter. \n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s consolidated and the Bank’s leverage ratio were 13.95% and 13.38%, respectively. The Company and the Bank elected to opt into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio framework, effective January 1, 2023. As such, each of the Company and the Bank is required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9.0% to be considered to have satisfied the minimum regulatory capital requirements as well as the capital ratio requirements to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes. \n\n**Asset Quality and Recovery of Credit Losses** – A recovery of credit losses of $(4.4) million was recorded for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a recovery of credit losses of $(1.9) million for the third quarter of 2023. The recovery of credit losses during the fourth quarter primarily reflects general improvement in our economic forecast as well as the decline in our loan portfolio from the prior period. The allowance for credit losses was $29.4 million, $34.3 million and $45.5 million, or 2.18%, 2.42% and 2.74% of total loans held for investment, at December 31. 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. \n\nRecoveries during the fourth and third quarter of 2023 were $64 thousand and $1 thousand, respectively, with no charge offs in either quarter. \n\nNonperforming assets at December 31, 2023 totaled $9.0 million, or 0.37% of total assets, compared to $6.2 million, or 0.25% of total assets, at September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase of $3.9 million in nonaccrual residential real estate loans, partially offset by the extension of a $1.1 million construction loan in the fourth quarter which was over 90 days past its maturity at September 30, 2023. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2023 declined by $29.3 million, or 77%, from December 31, 2022 mainly due to the sale of nonperforming and chronically delinquent residential real estate loans in the second quarter of 2023. \n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin** – Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $15.1 million compared to $16.0 million for the prior quarter of 2023 and $18.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The net interest margin of 2.52% for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased from the prior quarter’s net interest margin of 2.62% and decreased from the net interest margin of 3.09% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in net interest income during the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to the decline in the average balance of our loan portfolio of $69.4 million, or 5%, during the fourth quarter and a 26 basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits during the same period, partially offset by a 9 and 39 basis point increase in the average yields on loans and investments, respectively. The decrease in net interest income during the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily due to a 204 basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a 95 basis point increase in the average yield on total interest-earning assets during the same period. \n\nNet interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $65.0 million, a decrease of $13.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2022. The net interest margin of 2.68% for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased from the prior year’s net interest margin of 3.06%. The decrease in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily attributable to a 216 basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, reflecting the effects of the increasing rate environment during 2022 which continued into the first half of 2023. This was partially offset by the impact of a 365 basis point increase in the average yield of other interest-earning assets (primarily cash and cash equivalents) and 136 basis point increase in the average yield on investment securities. Interest income on loans decreased $0.7 million primarily due to the impact of a $315.2 million, or 17%, decline in the average balance of loans, despite a 96 basis point increase in the average yield on loans. \n\n**Non-Interest Income** – Non-interest income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $0.2 million compared to $0.4 million for the prior quarter and $0.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. \n\nNon-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $2.8 million, an increase of $1.5 million from $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to a $1.6 million gain on the sale of all loans that were held for sale, comprised primarily of nonperforming and chronically delinquent residential real estate loans, which occurred in the second quarter of 2023. \n\n**Non-Interest Expense** – Non-interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $12.8 million, a decrease of $4.9 million, or 28%, compared to $17.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, and a decrease of $24.3 million, or 65%, compared to $37.1 million the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $5.2 million decrease in professional fees. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we received $3.8 million from our insurance carriers for expenses previously incurred relating to the government investigations which was primarily due to ongoing investigations against selected individuals and our decision to cover legal costs with respect to certain of these individuals. Professional fees also decreased as the Office of Comptroller of the Currency and U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) investigations into the Company and Bank were resolved. We expect to incur future legal expenses relating to ongoing government investigations against selected individuals, which will not be covered by our insurance carriers as the policy limits have been reached. \n\nNon-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $65.7 million, a decrease of $31.9 million, or 33%, compared to $97.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to an $18.2 million provision for contingent losses recognized during the fourth quarter of 2022 reflecting our revised estimate of the financial impact of the resolution of the DOJ investigation. Professional fees were $13.8 million lower in 2023 compared to 2022 due in part to receiving $5.9 million more in 2023 compared to 2022 in payments from our insurance carriers for expenses previously incurred relating to the government investigations. Professional fees for 2023 also decreased as the government investigations against the Company and Bank were resolved. Other expenses declined $2.4 million, or 24%, in 2023 primarily due to a $2.3 million loss in 2022 to record the fair value discount on $65.6 million of repurchased Advantage Loan Program loans. Salaries and employee benefits expense in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $2.4 million, or 7%, primarily due to a $4.0 million reversal in the second quarter of 2022 of liabilities upon the surrender of certain split-dollar and company-owned life insurance policies. \n\n**Income Tax Expense –** For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of $3.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 30%, which differs slightly from our statutory rate of 28% due primarily to non-deductible compensation and other non-deductible expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $6.6 million on a loss before income taxes of $(7.6) million. Our income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 included $3.6 million in income tax on the increase in the cash surrender value of certain split-dollar and company-owned life insurance policies as a result of the surrender of these policies and the effect of the provision for contingent losses in 2022 being non-deductible. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nManagement will host a conference call on Wednesday, January 24, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s unaudited financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.

The partnership will offer Sterling customers a fully digital home loan experience, providing homebuyers with a convenient and easy way to purchase or refinance a home. \n\nChristine Meredith, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer, described the partnership as a strong option for Sterling’s customers who would like to become a homeowner or tap into their home’s equity. “Rocket Mortgage has earned more J.D. Power awards for client service than any other home lender. This gives us confidence that Rocket’s tech-driven and simplified mortgage experience is the best choice for Sterling customers and is a perfect fit with our ongoing mission to find opportunities that make banking easy for our customers.” \n\nAs a testament of the care Rocket Mortgage provides its clients, the lender has earned 21 total accolades from J.D.

Rocket Mortgage upheld this high level of service while closing more loan volume than any other lender in 2022. \n\nThrough this partnership, Sterling customers will receive dedicated resources throughout the mortgage process as well as discounts on loan costs to make homeownership more accessible. This dynamic collaboration will enable Sterling to provide its customers market-leading home loan products and customer service with home financing solutions from Rocket Mortgage. \n\nAll loans offered through this new channel will be originated by Rocket Mortgage, and Sterling does not anticipate any such loans will be added to Sterling’s balance sheet in the near future.

These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance, including any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “might,” “should,” “could,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “seek,” “intend,” “plan,” “goal” and “would,” or the negative versions of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature, though the absence of these words does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. All statements other than statements of historical facts, including but not limited to statements regarding, the economy and financial markets, government investigations, credit quality, the regulatory scheme governing our industry, competition in our industry, interest rates, our liquidity, our business and our governance, are forward-looking statements. We have based the forward-looking statements in this Press Release primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, business strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and they are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. There can be no assurance that future developments will be those that have been anticipated. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. The risks, uncertainties and other factors detailed from time to time in our public filings, including those included in the disclosures under the headings “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 9, 2023 and “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2023, subsequent periodic reports and future periodic reports, could affect future results and events, causing those results and events to differ materially from those views expressed or implied in the Company’s forward-looking statements. These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Press Release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Press Release.

(NASDAQ: SBT) (“Sterling” or the “Company”), the holding company of Sterling Bank and Trust, F.S.B. (the “Bank”), today reported its unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023. \n\n**Third Quarter 2023 Highlights**\n\n  * **Net income of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share**\n  * **Net interest margin of 2.62%**\n  * **Recorded provision for (recovery of) credit losses of $(1.9) million; ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans of 2.42%**\n  * **Nonperforming assets of $6.2 million, 0.25% of total assets**\n  * **Total gross loans of $1.4 billion**\n  * **Total deposits of $2.0 billion**\n  * **Non-interest expense of $17.7 million**\n  * **Shareholders’ equity of $316.1 million**\n  * **Company’s consolidated and Bank’s leverage ratio of 13.41% and 12.93%, respectively**\n  * **Completed redemption of all subordinated notes with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $65.0 million**\n\n\n\nThe Company reported net income of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to net income of $2.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The decrease in our net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to a decrease in our recovery of credit losses, the absence of any gains on the sale of loans during the quarter, and an increase in our professional fees. As previously disclosed, we have engaged both a consulting firm and an investment bank to help us develop a comprehensive range of viable strategic options available to us. The new plan will be prepared in light of our election to be a “covered savings association” under applicable law, which became effective this quarter and generally allows us to operate as a commercial bank without the constraints applicable to a thrift institution. We expect these engagements may, among other alternatives, consider the build-out of our presence in California and the relocation of certain operational and executive oversight functions. In that scenario, we expect that repositioning the Bank in this fashion will take significant time and expense. \n\nThomas M. O’Brien, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer commented: \n\n“Sterling’s third quarter reflects the lingering impacts from the long running government investigations. We continue to bear expenses from certain indemnified individuals who are responding to government inquiries. In this quarter, those expenses were approximately $1.7 million. While we anticipate receiving insurance reimbursements for certain prior invoices, our directors and officers insurance was ultimately exhausted during this quarter, and we do not expect any future defense costs to be covered by insurance. \n\nMargins remain tight, and we anticipate that continued upward pressure on interest rates and deposit prices will not likely improve in the near-term. I believe the most prudent course of action for us, at this time, remains protecting our strengths, namely: strong capital, strong liquidity and solid credit quality. There continues to be some ominous signs in certain real estate sectors and geographies. We believe that we have positioned Sterling well to confront those challenges should conditions deteriorate. Nonetheless, the capital markets remain very cautious with many smaller and regional banks trading at discounts to tangible book value.” \n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n**Total Assets** – Total assets were $2.4 billion at September 30, 2023, reflecting a decrease of $85.3 million, or 3%, from $2.5 billion at June 30, 2023. \n\nCash and due from banks decreased $91.8 million, or 14%, to $563.6 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $655.4 million at June 30, 2023. In the third quarter of 2023, we made cash payments of $66.8 million to redeem the subordinated notes including accrued interest and $27.2 million as restitution for the benefit of non-insider victim shareholders pursuant to the Company’s Plea Agreement with the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”). The Plea Agreement was approved by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in the third quarter of 2023, which resolution releases the Company, as well as the Bank, from further prosecution for securities fraud and underlying mortgage fraud in the Advantage Loan Program. \n\nDebt securities, all of which are available for sale, which we consider part of our liquid assets, were $398.3 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $334.5 million at June 30, 2023, an increase of $63.8 million, or 19%. During the third quarter of 2023, the Bank purchased $9.0 million of capital stock of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in connection with becoming a member of the Federal Reserve System. \n\nTotal gross loans held for investment of $1.4 billion at September 30, 2023 declined $68.7 million, or 5%, from $1.5 billion at June 30, 2023. \n\n**Total Deposits** – Total deposits were $2.0 billion at September 30, 2023, virtually unchanged from June 30, 2023. Money market, savings and NOW deposits were $1.1 billion, an increase of $112.3 million, or 11%, from June 30, 2023. Time deposits were $872.1 million, a decrease of $109.2 million, or 11%, compared to $981.3 million at June 30, 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $40.8 million and $44.8 million at September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Total estimated uninsured deposits to total deposits were 21.4%, 24.2%, and 20.8% at September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. Our current strategy is to continue to offer market interest rates on our deposit products to maintain our existing customer base and our liquidity position. \n\n**Capital** –Total shareholders’ equity was $316.1 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $317.7 million at June 30, 2023. The decrease in shareholders’ equity is primarily attributable to a $(2.7) million increase in the unrealized loss on our investment securities portfolio included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, partially offset by $0.8 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.3 million of net income in the present quarter. \n\nThe Company and the Bank elected to opt into the Community Bank Leverage Ratio framework, effective January 1, 2023. As such, each of the Company and the Bank is required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9.0% to be considered to have satisfied the minimum regulatory capital requirements as well as the capital ratio requirements to be considered “well capitalized” under applicable prompt corrective action requirements. At September 30, 2023, the Company’s consolidated and the Bank’s leverage ratio were 13.41% and 12.93%, respectively. \n\n**Asset Quality and Recovery of Credit Losses** – A recovery of credit losses of $(1.9) million was recorded for the third quarter of 2023 compared to a recovery of credit losses of $(2.9) million for the second quarter of 2023. The recovery of credit losses during the third quarter reflects the decline in our loan portfolio over the period. In addition, we moderated the severe economic forecast component of our economic outlook. The allowance for credit losses was $34.3 million at September 30, 2023, or 2.42% of total loans held for investment, compared to $36.2 million, or 2.43% of total loans held for investment, at June 30, 2023. \n\nRecoveries during the third and second quarter of 2023 were $(1) thousand and $(402) thousand, respectively, with no charge offs in either quarter. \n\nNonperforming assets at September 30, 2023 totaled $6.2 million, or 0.25% of total assets, compared to $2.1 million, or 0.08% of total assets, at June 30, 2023 due to an increase of $3.0 million in nonaccrual residential real estate loans and a $1.1 million matured construction loan, which was extended subsequent to September 30, 2023. \n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin** – Net interest income for the third quarter of 2023 was $16.0 million compared to $16.2 million for the second quarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest income during the third quarter of 2023 compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in interest expense on our average balance of interest-bearing deposits since the average rate paid during the third quarter of 2023 increased 50 basis points as deposits continued to reprice upward in the prevailing high interest rate environment. The impact of the increased rates on deposits was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on the subordinated notes of $1.5 million due to the redemption of the notes early in the third quarter of 2023. Interest income earned on our average balance of interest-bearing assets increased 24 basis points during the third quarter of 2023 from the prior quarter. \n\nThe net interest margin of 2.62% for the third quarter of 2023 decreased slightly from the net interest margin of 2.64% for the second quarter of 2023. \n\n**Non-Interest Income** – Non-interest income for the third quarter of 2023 decreased by $1.5 million compared to the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to the $1.7 million gain on the sale of all loans held for sale in the second quarter of 2023, consisting primarily of nonperforming and chronically delinquent residential real estate loans and the $0.2 million gain on the extinguishment of the subordinated notes in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**Non-Interest Expense** – Non-interest expense of $17.7 million for the third quarter of 2023 reflected an increase of $0.4 million, or 2%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. Professional fees were $0.7 million higher in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the prior quarter, which was primarily due to ongoing government investigations against selected individuals and our decision to cover defense costs with respect to these individuals. We were recently informed that our directors and officers insurance for these matters was exhausted based on invoices submitted prior to and during the third quarter of 2023. Therefore any future costs will not be reimbursed by our insurance carriers. We expect to receive our final insurance reimbursement payment in the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in professional fees was partially offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2023 as compared to the prior quarter reflecting revisions in compensation programs, including the restructuring of our chief executive officer’s compensation that took effect during the third quarter of 2023, as well as continued staff reductions in various support functions. \n\n**Income Tax Expense** – For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of $0.3 million, or an effective tax rate of 49.2%, and an effective tax rate of 36.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of $1.1 million, or an effective rate of 30.6%. Our effective tax rate in 2023 varies from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of non-deductible compensation. \n\nMr. O’Brien said, “The uncertainty that continues to cloud the economy, coupled with the recent tragedies in Israel and the ensuing escalation of armed conflict in the Middle East along with the continuing conflict in Ukraine, will likely cause volatility in commodity prices, especially oil, and further strain fiscal and monetary policy in the U.S. and among its allies. We believe the level of regional armed conflicts along with flashpoints in other high tension geographies are a cause for very serious concern. The risk of contagion appears to be very high. Taken together these conditions will likely exert further pressures in many capital market sectors. At some point, I believe the markets stabilize around whatever the new normal might be and activity returns. In the coming quarters, I expect to see credit weakness in many office backed mortgage bonds and, in selected markets, growing instability in multi-family loans. While never immune, those conditions are not expected to have noticeable impact on Sterling since we disposed of many higher risk commercial and residential product in prior periods.” \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nManagement will host a conference call on Wednesday, October 25, 2023 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s unaudited financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.
