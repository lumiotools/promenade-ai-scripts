          "content": "Q3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 2\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we made progress advancing R2 development, driving greater\nefficiency in operating expenses, launching new R1 variants, investing in our go-to-market\ninfrastructure, and introducing new services to further improve the customer experience.\nWe continue to see cost progress from our second generation R1 vehicles which we expect to\nbe represented in the fourth quarter when we anticipate achieving modest positive gross profit.\nRivian produced 13,157 vehicles and delivered 10,018 vehicles during the third quarter of 2024.\nAs previously disclosed, Rivian is experiencing a production disruption due to a shortage of\na shared component within our Enduro motor system on the R1 and RCV platforms. Our team\nhas a strong sense of urgency in finding a solution as we work in close partnership with the\nsupplier to ramp additional capacity to accommodate planned production.\nOver the long-term we believe Rivian’s value will be determined by the scale it can reach with its\nmidsize platform including the R2, R3, and R3X, as well as our ability to continue to reduce costs\nand develop differentiated technologies. Our midsize platform is expected to address global market\nsegments and is designed to build upon our industry-leading technology platform as well as our focus\non reducing manufacturing complexity and cost efficiency. Our team is laser-focused on executing\nthe development plan for R2. The recent transition to our second generation R1 vehicles has\nimplemented multiple new technologies which will serve as the foundation for our midsize platform\nsuch as our zonal network architecture and Rivian Autonomous Platform, positioning R2 for a\nsimplified launch.\nWe believe the formation of the expected joint venture with Volkswagen Group will be a landmark\ndevelopment for the industry. The joint venture will benefit from Rivian's differentiated and well-\nproven zonal network architecture and full-stack software technologies as well as enhanced software\nand electrical architecture innovation. The upcoming partnership with Volkswagen Group validates\nRivian’s technology leadership and creates new growth opportunities for Rivian to be a technology\npartner to other manufacturers.\nThe joint venture is expected to provide a meaningful financial opportunity for Rivian with a total\ndeal size of approximately $5 billion, in addition to the annual operating expense savings Rivian\nexpects to realize. The planned investments by Volkswagen Group in addition to our current cash,\ncash equivalents, and short-term investments are expected to provide the capital to fund Rivian’s\noperations through the ramp of R2 in Normal, as well as the midsize platform in Georgia – enabling\na path to positive free cash flow and meaningful scale.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 3\nWe believe the introduction of our second generation R1, along with the formation of the joint venture,\nwill enhance execution against our core value drivers:\nFocus on demand generation and enhancing the customer experience: Demand for R1 vehicles\nwas negatively impacted in the third quarter of 2024 by the production disruption and a challenging\nconsumer backdrop. We remain focused on maximizing the levers within our control and strategically\ninvesting in our go-to-market strategy. We continue to make progress expanding our commercial\nfootprint and enabling the opportunity for more potential customers to experience Rivian vehicles.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we increased our total demo drives by approximately 20% as compared\nto the second quarter of 2024.\nOptimize operational efficiency: We continue to focus on maximizing spend efficiency across all\naspects of the organization. As compared to the second quarter of 2024, third quarter of 2024\nGAAP operating expenses were down $147 million, marking our lowest quarter in the last three years.\nExcluding stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization, our adjusted operating\nexpenses1 for the quarter were down $77 million as compared to the prior quarter.\nTechnology leadership: We believe technology is a competitive differentiator for Rivian. Our midsize\nplatform is designed to build upon our industry-leading technology platform. We expect the midsize\nplatform to benefit from the key vertically integrated technologies developed for R1 including our\nin-house software stack, propulsion technology, network architecture, and vehicle electronics.\nDrive towards profitability: We are seeing meaningful progress on our second generation R1 material\ncosts due to the new technologies incorporated into the vehicle and manufacturing process. The\nintroduction of the second generation R1 platform combined with commercial cost improvements and\ncommodity tail winds are expected to enable a 20% material cost reduction when comparing an R1\nDual-Motor with Large Pack produced in the first quarter of 2024 versus the same vehicle produced\nin fourth quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, we have already seen reductions in our material\ncost in line with our target. In addition, we have made meaningful progress in sourcing components\nfor R2. We are approximately 85% through the sourcing of R2 bill of materials and are currently in line\nwith our cost targets. We anticipate the material cost of an R2 AWD Large vehicle to be 45% lower than\na second generation R1 Dual Large vehicle.\nWe want to thank our employees, customers, suppliers, partners, communities, and shareholders for\ntheir continued support of our vision.\n¹A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided later in this letter.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 4\nRivian and Volkswagen Group\nTechnology Joint Venture\nRivian and Volkswagen Group’s technology joint venture expects to create the next-generation of\nelectrical architecture and vertically integrated software for electric vehicles. The joint venture will\nbe highly complementary, combining Rivian’s industry-leading software and electrical hardware\ntechnology and Volkswagen Group’s significant global scale and diverse range of vehicles and price\npoints. The combination of strong brands and breadth of offerings is expected to enable Rivian’s core\ntechnology to reach a broader set of global customers.\nOver the past few months, we have successfully integrated Rivian’s zonal controls and infotainment\nsystems into a prototype Volkswagen Group driveable demonstrator. Through our software, we have\nbeen able to integrate several functions including vehicle core controls, different drive modes, and\ninfotainment features as well as enable remote controls and over-the-air updates.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 5\nInnovation: The joint venture is expected to develop industry-leading software enabled features\nand capabilities to address global markets and a variety of vehicle platforms; from mass market\nto premium.\nScalable technology platform: The joint venture has been made possible by the years of investment\nand development in vertically integrating Rivian’s scalable network architecture, topology of ECUs,\nand associated software platforms.\nPartner of choice for differentiated technology: Over the long-term, we see Rivian as the partner\nof choice for differentiated technologies in the industry. The partnership with Volkswagen Group\nvalidates Rivian’s technology approach and demonstrates our capability to create new growth\nopportunities. From the beginning, we have taken the approach to vertically integrate certain key\nareas of the vehicle including propulsion, autonomy, electrical hardware, and software.\nImproved cost efficiency: The joint venture is expected to leverage the scalable technology across\nboth the Volkswagen Group and Rivian’s combined EV volumes and lower Rivian’s operating\nexpenses while driving greater progress and innovation.\nCapital roadmap for growth: Subject to the formation of the joint venture and certain milestones, the\ntotal deal size of approximately $5 billion in addition to our current cash, cash equivalents, and short-\nterm investments are expected to provide the capital to fund Rivian’s operations through the ramp of\nR2 in Normal, as well as the midsize platform in Georgia supporting our path to positive free cash flow\nand meaningful scale.\nWe expect to close the joint venture in the fourth quarter of this year.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 6\nR2 Progress\nWe believe R2 will be a fundamental driver of Rivian’s growth and profit potential. It allows Rivian\nto address global market segments and is designed to build upon our industry-leading technology\nplatform. R2 will benefit from vertically integrated technologies developed for R1 including our in-\nhouse software stack, propulsion technology, network architecture, and vehicle electronics.\nR2 development has focused on reducing the number of parts, joints, and fasteners in a focused effort\nto drive manufacturing simplicity. This includes a structural battery pack that serves as the floor of the\nvehicle, large structural die castings, further electronics consolidation enabling harness simplification,\nand a wide range of design decisions to enable low cost execution. We have made meaningful\nprogress in sourcing components for R2. We are approximately 85% through the sourcing of\nR2 bill of materials and are currently in line with our cost targets.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 7\nIn addition, we continue to make rapid progress in Normal constructing our facility expansion which\nwill house the general assembly, body shop, and end of line for R2 production. This is a critical step\nto achieve our target of launching R2 in the first half of 2026.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 8\nUpdate on R2 Propulsion\nToday we announced an important strategic partnership with LG Energy Solution (LGES) to supply\nUS manufactured cells for our upcoming R2 vehicle. LGES will provide 4695 cylindrical batteries\nenabling high-quality, advanced battery technology to our vehicles, ensuring long range and\nsegment-leading performance.\nThe agreement also pioneers a plethora of supply chain innovations and strengthens domestic\nsourcing for battery materials. Within the first year of production, the batteries are expected to\nbe manufactured at LGES' Queen Creek, Arizona plant, aligning with Rivian's focus on U.S. domestic\nmanufacturing and IRA compliance.\nOur battery pack architecture is expected to continue to evolve and improve with R2 and R3. It will be\nbased upon a simplified pack structure which reduces weight, complexity, and cost while also having\ngreater energy density. We expect a meaningful reduction in dollar per kilowatt hour (kWh) at the\npack level when compared to the R1 platform. In addition, the 4695 is a larger cell form factor than R1\nwhich allows for reduced cell count for improved manufacturability. We expect battery pack assembly\nprocessing to improve by approximately 45%.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 8\nSoftware\nOur intentional decision to own the software and technology hardware stack in the vehicle has\nbeen focused on an improved experience for our customers. Rivian customers enjoy continuous\nenhancement to their vehicles via frequent over the air updates, with over 35 updates made to the\nvehicles since launching.\nRivian’s software platform allows seamless integration of the services for simple, convenient, and\nimmersive infotainment experience. Available applications now include Apple Music and Audible\nwith Google Cast and YouTube coming later this year.\nThis quarter we introduced Connect+, a streaming and connectivity service providing customers\nmusic, audio, in-vehicle hotspot, and video streaming connectivity with an easy monthly or annual\nsubscription. Included within Connect+ subscription, customers can now access the Gear Guard\nLive Cam feature offering peace of mind from in or away from the vehicle. The system includes high-\nresolution cameras embedded around the vehicle, physical cables that secure your gear, and an\nattentive animation on the center display. With this update, customers can see what is happening\nin and around their vehicle from almost anywhere via the Rivian mobile app.\nFollowing the launch of Connect+, we provided customers a 60 day free trial period; we have seen\nthe majority of R1 customers have subscribed to Connect+ following the free trial period.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 9\nR1 Update\nThe second generation of R1 vehicles have hundreds of design, engineering, and performance\nupgrades to provide a superior customer experience and a meaningful improvement to the cost\nstructure of the vehicle. As a result of these changes, the material cost of the R1 vehicle is now\nmeaningfully lower when comparing a vehicle produced in the first quarter of 2024 to a vehicle\nproduced in the third quarter of 2024. The introduction of the second generation R1 platform\ncombined with commercial cost improvements and commodity tail winds are expected to enable\na 20% material cost reduction when comparing an R1 Dual-Motor with Large Pack produced in the\nfirst quarter of 2024 versus the same vehicle produced in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nWe recently launched our Tri-Motor R1 configuration, combining performance levels that surpass our\noriginal quad motor offerings. Tri-Motor packs two of our Ascent motors in the rear and one Enduro\nmotor in front for a blend of exceptional power and range. With 850 horsepower and 1,103 Ib-ft of\ntorque, it reaches 0-60 mph in 2.9 seconds and when driving in Conserve mode has 405 miles of range.\nIn addition, we expect to launch the Quad-Motor variant in 2025. The Quad-Motor variant has two\nsmaller motors in the front, optimized for efficiency at cruising speeds and two in the rear delivering\n0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds and 1,025 horsepower. Both the Tri-Motor and Quad-Motor are equipped\nwith our new Ascend premium interior offering.\nIn both Tri- and Quad- variants, while operating in Conserve mode, an automatic rear disconnect\nensures AWD performance is always available, but intuitively turns off when driving demand doesn't\nrequire it, helping you maximize range when you need it, and performance when you want it.\nAll Rivian motors are oil-cooled, significantly improving thermal performance during high-torque,\nlow-speed driving such as rock crawling while also improving range efficiency during low-torque,\nhigh-speed cruising.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 10\nGo-to-Market\nWe remain focused on our top of funnel demand generation as we expand our presence across\nthe country and get more customers into vehicles for demo drives. We currently have 16 spaces\nincluding six new spaces opened since the start of the the third quarter of 2024 in Yosemite, San\nDiego, Nashville, Boston, Scottsdale, and Chicago and have 62 service locations with the majority\nstaffed for sales and demo drives. In the third quarter of 2024, we conducted over 29,000 demo\ndrives and launched our consumer referral program.\nWhile we anticipate a challenging consumer backdrop in the near-term, we continue to see\na significant opportunity to increase our brand awareness and have more customers behind\nthe wheel of our award-winning products.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 11\nProduction and Deliveries\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we produced 13,157 vehicles and delivered 10,018 vehicles.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we experienced a production disruption due to a shortage of a\ncomponent within our Enduro motor system. The Enduro motor is our in-house single-motor-per-axle\nsystem used in our R1 vehicles as both motors in the Dual-Motor variant, and one of the motors in the\nTri-Motor variant, as well as our commercial vans as the single motor. We expect to produce more\nTri-Motors and commercial vans as a mitigating factor to the supply constraint, with Amazon\nincreasing its delivery order of vans in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nDemand for R1 vehicles was negatively impacted in the third quarter of 2024 by the production\ndisruption and challenging consumer backdrop. Due to the sequential production ramp following\nthe plant retooling upgrade, the part shortage limited availability of specific R1 variants for sale.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 12\nPath to Profitability\nOur long-term success and ability to make an impact will ultimately be determined by our ability to\noperate profitably and generate cash flow. Over the past few years, we have taken significant steps to\nreduce our capital expenditures and overhead costs. This includes our decision to bring the first line\nof R2 production to Normal and other organizational changes we have made. In addition, we remain\nfocused on generating positive gross margins through improved unit economics on our vehicle\nplatforms.\nWe expect to generate modest positive gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2024 supported by\nthe following key drivers:\n• Revenue per unit: We anticipate an increase in revenue per unit delivered mainly driven by\nthe increase in non-vehicle revenues such as the sale of regulatory credits, vehicle service,\nremarketing, software, and other services. In addition, we anticipate the average selling price\nper vehicle to increase due to the higher mix of second generation R1 vehicles and more\npremium variants like the Tri-Motor, partially offset by an increased mix of commercial vans.\n• Variable costs: As part of the cutover to our second generation R1 vehicles, we are starting\nto see significantly improved material costs associated with our R1 vehicles. These benefits\nare due to design changes, supplier negotiations, and lower raw material costs. We also\nexpect the variable cost per unit delivered to benefit from an increase in the mix of\ncommercial van sales.\n• Fixed and semi-fixed costs: We have made changes to the design of our vehicles and\nmanufacturing process which we expect to significantly reduce our fixed costs per vehicle\ndelivered in the fourth quarter of 2024. We also expect our ending inventory lower of cost\nor net realizable value (LCNRV) and liabilities for losses on firm purchase commitments\nbalances to continue decreasing.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 13\n2024 Outlook\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we took meaningful steps to enhance the profitability of our\nsecond generation R1 vehicles.\nWe are reaffirming our production guidance of between 47,000 to 49,000 vehicles.\nWe are reaffirming our delivery outlook of between 50,500 to 52,000 vehicles and $1,200 million\nin capital expenditures.\nThe lower production outlook for 2024 has a negative impact on our profitability for 2024 due to\nour limited ability to leverage the fixed costs of our production facility. Because of this, we are revising\nour annual adjusted EBITDA guidance to between a $(2.825) billion loss to a $(2.875) billion loss.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 14\nRevenues Total revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $874 million, primarily driven by the delivery\nof 10,018 vehicles. Total revenues from the sale of regulatory credits were $8 million for the\nquarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, a portion of the decrease was driven by timing of\nhigher EDV deliveries in the third quarter of 2023 following the first quarter of 2023 line\nshutdown. The remaining portion of the decrease was driven in part from our production\ndisruption causing a limited number of R1 variants being available for sale and a more challenging\nconsumer environment.\nGross Profit We generated negative gross profit of $(392) million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to\n$(477) million for the third quarter of 2023.\nGross profit losses decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower delivery volume. Gross profit\nlosses per unit increased primarily due to an increase in cost of revenue efficiency initiatives and\nsmaller reduction in LCNRV of inventory and losses on firm purchase commitments.\nCost of revenues for the third quarter of 2024 included $37 million of costs we do not anticipate\nbeing part of our long-term cost structure. This was made up of cost of revenue efficiency\ninitiatives primarily related to certain supplier liabilities incurred.\nThe third quarter of 2024 was impacted by a charge for LCNRV write-downs on inventory and\nlosses on firm purchase commitments. Our ending inventory balance includes LCNRV write-\ndowns of $130 million while liabilities for losses on firm purchase commitments were $10 million,\nfor a total of $140 million at the end of the third quarter of 2024 as compared to our ending\ninventory balance LCNRV write-downs of $292 million and liabilities for losses on firm purchase\ncommitments of $160 million, for a total of $452 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023. The\ndecrease is primarily due to an increase in projected positive-margin variants and a decrease in\nestimated materials’ costs for the projected negative-margin variants. We expect LCNRV write-\ndowns of inventory and losses on firm purchase commitments to continue to decrease over time\nas we further reduce the cost to manufacture our products. The key drivers of our path to positive\ngross profit include increasing our revenues per delivered unit, reducing variable costs, and\nreducing fixed and semi-fixed costs.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 15\nOperating Expenses Total operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $777 million, as compared to\nand Operating Loss $963 million in the same period last year.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we recognized non-cash, stock-based compensation expense within\noperating expenses of $105 million as compared to $219 million in the third quarter of 2023 and\ndepreciation and amortization expense within operating expenses of $73 million as compared to\n$80 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expense in the third quarter of 2024 was $350 million,\nas compared to $529 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to\na $74 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to a reversal in the\naccrual of a previously recorded stock-based bonus expense and decreased grants, a $57 million\ndecrease in engineering, design, and development costs and other related project costs primarily\nsurrounding the R1 platform design and technology upgrades, and a $30 million decrease in\ndepreciation and amortization.\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expense in the third quarter of 2024 was\n$427 million, as compared to $434 million in the same period last year. SG&A expenses remained\nrelatively flat compared to three months ended September 30, 2023, with a $40 million decrease\nin stock-based compensation expense primarily related to a reversal in the accrual of a previously\nrecorded stock-based bonus expense offset by a $23 million increase in depreciation and\namortization and a $17 million increase in sales and marketing expenses to support go-to-market\noperations.\nWe experienced a loss from operations in the third quarter of 2024 totaling $(1,169) million, as\ncompared to $(1,440) million in the same period last year.\nAdjusted Operating Expenses Adjusted R&D¹ for the third quarter of 2024 was $271 million as compared to $346 million for the\n(Non-GAAP)¹ same period last year.\nAdjusted SG&A¹ for the third quarter of 2024 was $328 million as compared to $318 million for the\nsame period last year.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses¹ for the third quarter of 2024 was $599 million as compared to\n$664 million for the same period last year.\nNet Loss Our net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $(1,100) million as compared to $(1,367) million for\nthe same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)¹ Adjusted EBITDA¹ for the third quarter of 2024 was $(757) million as compared to $(902) million\nfor the same period last year.\nAdjusted Net Loss (Non-GAAP)1 Adjusted net loss¹ for the third quarter of 2024 was $(1,008) million as compared to $(1,087)\nmillion for the same period last year.\nNet Cash Used in Operating Net cash used in operating activities for the third quarter of 2024 was $(876) million as compared\nActivities to $(877) million for the same period last year.\nCapital Expenditures Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2024 were $277 million, as compared to $190 million\nfor the same period last year.\n¹A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided later in this letter.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 16\nLiquidity and Free Cash Flow We ended the third quarter of 2024 with $6,739 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term\n(non-GAAP)¹ investments. Including the capacity under our asset-based revolving-credit facility, we ended the\nthird quarter of 2024 with $8,105 million of total liquidity.\nThe third quarter of 2024’s ending cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balance of\n$6,739 million includes $1 billion of an unsecured convertible note issued to Volkswagen\nInternational America, Inc. in association with the announcement of our expected joint venture\nwith Volkswagen Group. The convertible note will automatically convert into shares of Class A\ncommon stock on December 1, 2024 as all conversion conditions have been satisfied as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. The\nincrease in year-over-year capital expenditures discussed above resulted in negative free cash\nflow¹ of $(1,153) million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $(1,067) million for the same\nperiod last year.\nWebcast We will host an audio webcast to discuss our results and provide a business update at\n2:00pm PT / 5:00pm ET on Thursday, November 7th, 2024.

          "content": "Q1 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 2\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we unveiled our new midsize platform (“MSP”) with R2, R3, and\nR3X and we’re pleased with the reaction they received. Distinctly Rivian in terms of performance,\ncapability, and usability, R2, R3, and R3X address the largest consumer segment of midsize SUV\nand crossover vehicles. We also announced that we will start R2 production in Normal which\nwe expect to drive greater capital efficiency with over $2.25 billion of savings from plan, enable\nproduction to start in the first half of 2026, and reduce risk to launch the platform and associated\nramp. We believe that the operating plan for our Normal factory at 215,000 units of annual\nproduction while executing against our cost efficiency roadmap will allow Rivian to generate\npositive free cash flow excluding growth capital investments in new production capacity\nand tooling.\nRivian produced 13,980 vehicles and delivered 13,588 vehicles during the first quarter of 2024.\nThese results exceeded our outlook and help establish a strong foundation for the remainder\nof the year as we focus on driving continued demand and enhancing the customer experience,\ndelivering greater cost downs and plant efficiencies, progressing R2 development, and driving\ntowards profitability. The R1S was the fourth best-selling electric vehicle in the US during the first\nquarter of 20241, the best-selling electric vehicle in the US above $70,0001, and the best-selling\nlarge luxury SUV in California across both electric and combustion engine vehicles2.\nAmazon and Rivian remain focused on bringing 100,000 Rivian electric delivery vans (“EDV”)\nto the road, which will help save Amazon millions of metric tons of carbon per year. Rivian is\nalso excited to help the broader commercial vehicle market to reduce emissions in the transition\nto electric vehicles with our state-of-the-art vehicle. The Rivian Commercial Van (“RCV”) is\ndesigned from the ground up prioritizing safety, driver comfort, and sustainability.\n1 Data source: J.D.

All rights reserved. 3\nResults for the first quarter of 2024 reflect continued progress against our key value drivers:\nFocus on demand generation and enhancing the customer experience: We have seen a\npositive reaction to our demand generating and brand awareness strategies implemented\nduring the first quarter. We recently launched R1S leasing and grew the number of states with\nthis offering. Additionally, the introduction of the Standard Range R1 variant brought more\naccessible pricing to the R1 platform. While the broader vehicle market is still experiencing\nchallenges, we are encouraged by the early results of our initiatives and have confidence in\nour 2024 delivery outlook.\nOptimize operational efficiencies: The changes being implemented on the R1 manufacturing\nline during the second quarter plant retooling upgrade are designed to deliver greater plant\nefficiency with the R1 line rate expected to improve by approximately 30%. We expect greater\nplant efficiency will result in lower conversion costs per vehicle during the second half of 2024.\nDevelop R2 and core technologies: On March 7th, Rivian unveiled the new MSP product lines with\nR2, R3, and R3X. The MSP vehicles are expected to offer amazing performance, utility, and range\nat a significantly lower price point than our flagship R1. It is expected to position Rivian to expand\nits addressable market by opening up new, global segments. MSP is designed to build upon our\nindustry-leading technology platform as well as focus on reducing manufacturing complexity.\nDrive towards profitability: The first quarter of 2024 gross profit per vehicle delivered was\n$(38,784), which includes $15,455 of depreciation and $1,693 of stock-based compensation\nexpense. Our results were negatively impacted by $9,346 per unit delivered, primarily related\nto various supplier and other costs incurred in advance of the new technology changes and parts\nintegration into the R1 platform as part of our cost of revenue efficiency initiatives. As a result\nof the retooling upgrade, we expect significant improvement in the material, depreciation, and\nconversion cost of our vehicles and remain confident in our path to achieving modest gross profit\nin the fourth quarter of this year.\nFurther, we are focused on extending our cash runway by managing operating and capital\nexpenditures and optimizing our working capital.\nWe want to thank our employees, customers, suppliers, partners, communities, and shareholders\nfor their continued support of our vision.\nQ1 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 4\nBuilding Demand and Scaling\nOur Go-to-Market Operations\nWe are focused on improving our customer experience and continuing to generate demand\nfor our vehicles. We believe that our direct relationship with our customers is a long-term\ncompetitive differentiator.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, we benefited from increased top of funnel and brand awareness with\nthe unveil of R2, R3, and R3X and introduced marketing campaigns to support sales initiatives\nsuch as leasing and the introduction of our Standard Range R1.\nWe grew demo drives which allow potential customers the opportunity to experience our\nvehicles, their capabilities, safety features, and technology and has proven to be an effective\ndemand generation strategy. In the first quarter of 2024, we hosted over 28,000 demo drives,\na 91% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOur physical footprint continues to expand across the United States and Canada to support\nthe sales, marketing, and service of Rivian vehicles. We currently have 11 spaces which\nserve as an invitation to current and potential customers to get up close with our vehicles,\nsoftware, and accessories. In the first quarter of 2024, we have hosted over 257,000 visitors,\nan 8% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition, we currently have 59 service\ncenters operational across North America and Germany (for our European EDV deliveries) in\naddition to over 530 mobile service vans which handle the majority of our service events.\nIn addition to the vehicle service these centers provide, they also represent great customer\nfacing spaces for hosting demo drives and other engaging brand and sales opportunities.\nQ1 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 5\nR2, R3, and R3X Reveal\nOn March 7th, we unveiled our new midsized platform, which underpins our R2 and\nR3 product lines. Designed to bring more adventure to more people, R2, R3, and R3X\nare expected to deliver amazing performance, utility, and range at a significantly lower\nprice point than our flagship R1.\nR2 is our versatile new midsize SUV with room for five people. R2 captures the essence\nof Rivian – it’s built for adventures as well as everyday use with its exceptional utility,\nperformance, and capability. R2 features two battery sizes, with the larger pack achieving\nover 300 miles of range on a single charge while offering 0-60 mph acceleration in under\n3 seconds for the quickest powertrain configuration. The price starts at around $45,000\nwith production slated to begin in the first half of 2026.\nR3 is our midsize crossover. This unique vehicle is tidy on dimensions but delivers big\nin terms of performance, off-road capability, passenger comfort, and storage. R3X is\na performance variant of R3 offering even more dynamic abilities both on and off road.\nR3 demonstrates the scalability of Rivian’s brand across different form factors while\ncontinuing to be immediately recognizable. R3 and R3X will be priced below R2 and\ndeliveries will start after R2 to ensure a smooth launch and rapid ramp of R2. As part\nof our MSP, R3 has been designed with a high level of commonality with R2. The R2, R3,\nand R3X are expected to be available internationally following its North American launch.\nWe believe R2, R3, and R3X will be foundational to Rivian’s long-term growth and profit\npotential. It positions Rivian to address new, global market segments and is designed to\nbuild upon our industry-leading technology platform as well as our focus on driving down\nmanufacturing complexity and cost efficiency. We expect MSP to benefit from the key\nvertically integrated technologies developed for R1 including our in-house software stack,\npropulsion technology, network architecture and vehicle electronics. In addition, the platform\nhas been designed around cost efficiency, with a focus on part consolidation or elimination.\nThis includes use of large, high pressure die castings, a structural battery pack, and\nsimplified closure systems.\nQ1 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 6\nR2 Launch in Normal\nIn March, we also announced the formative decision to start production of R2 in our existing\nNormal, Illinois manufacturing facility. This offers several important benefits including significant\ncost savings, acceleration of launch timeline, increase in Normal capacity, and improved visibility\ninto cash-on-hand to fund operations. We believe launching R2 in Normal will create long-term\nvalue by driving greater capital efficiency and reducing risk to the R2 launch and associated ramp.\nImproved capital efficiency: Total savings expected to be over $2.25 billion as compared\nto the original forecast of launching the first line of R2 production at Rivian’s Georgia site.\nThe savings are expected to come from capital expenditures, product development\ninvestment, and supplier sourcing opportunities.\nImproved cash visibility: Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments expected\nto be sufficient to fund operations through the start of R2 production.\nReduced risk to launch: The R2 production ramp will leverage the core R1 technologies and\nthe manufacturing and operations team in Normal responsible for the significant growth\nand improvement of the R1 platform.\nTotal expected Normal capacity following R2 launch and plant changes: 215,000 units of total\nannual capacity across R1T, R1S, EDV, RCV, and R2. This includes up to 155,000 units of R2.\nIncremental to the over $2.25 billion in expected savings, we recently announced an incentive\npackage from the state of Illinois with a value of up to $827 million. We are excited to grow our\ncommunity in Normal and continue our partnership with the state of Illinois.\nQ1 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 7\nUpdate on Normal Plant Retooling Upgrade\nWe successfully completed a several week plant shutdown to retool the Normal plant and\nintroduce new technologies and cost-oriented material changes into our R1 vehicle platform.\nThe plant retooling upgrade also made significant changes that are expected to optimize our\nmanufacturing processes. We integrated nearly 600 new or modified robots, which we believe\nwill enable the R1 line to run more efficiently.\nIn addition, we improved the flow of materials and inventory within the plant. These changes\nare expected to improve cycle time and utilization.\nBased on early indications, we see significant progress on the R1 material cost optimization\nefforts following the plant retooling upgrade.\nQ1 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 8\nCharging\nAccess to abundant, high-quality fast charging is pivotal for mass electric vehicle adoption.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, we made notable progress improving the experience of\nowning a Rivian by growing the Rivian Adventure Network (“RAN”) and enabling access\nto over 15,000 Tesla Superchargers.\nAs of the first quarter of 2024, we had over 470 RAN chargers across 77 locations. To date\nin 2024, RAN chargers have demonstrated an uptime of over 98%. We also recently shared\nmore details about our upcoming open RAN charger which is built from the ground up to\nsupport nearly every electric vehicle sold in North America today. Opening the network later\nthis year enables other electric vehicle drivers to benefit from our reliable charging sites, allows\nRivian to benefit from the fixed costs associated with each charging site which we expect will\nturn our RAN into a profit center over time, and allows Rivian to meet one of the key requirements\nto apply to access the $7.5 billion available government grants associated with expanding\ndomestically manufactured fast chargers across the country.\nIn addition to RAN, existing owners will receive NACS DC adapters providing them access\nto over 15,000 Tesla Superchargers. We have provided a seamless digital experience on the\nTesla Supercharger network. Owners can plug in and charge with automatic billing without\nopening an app. When planning trips in the Rivian mobile app or in-vehicle navigation,\ncompatible Superchargers show up with live availability, price information, and charging\nspeeds listed and incorporated into routing.\nThis quarter we released an OTA software feature introducing the Rivian Charging Score.\nThis industry-first feature enables peace of mind for Rivian drivers by routing them to the\nmost reliable chargers.\nQ1 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 9\n2024 Outlook\nWe remain focused on ramping production coming out of our plant retooling upgrade\nand R1 technology integration. Thus far, consistent with our expectations, we have hit all\nmajor milestones associated with the plant retooling upgrade, and we are reaffirming our\n2024 annual guidance provided during our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings\ncall of 57,000 total units of production and $(2,700) million in adjusted EBITDA.\nDue to moving the start of R2 production to Normal, we expect to be able to significantly\nreduce the capital expenditures required to launch R2. Because of this we are lowering\nour capital expenditures guidance to $1,200 million, a reduction of $550 million. We also\nexpect savings from moving the R2 launch to Normal to impact 2025 and 2026.\nQ1 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 10\nRevenues Total revenues for the first quarter of 2024 were $1,204 million, primarily driven by the delivery\nof 13,588 vehicles. Total revenues from the sale of regulatory credits were de minimis for\nthe quarter.\nGross Profit We generated negative gross profit of $(527) million for the first quarter of 2024 as compared to\n$(535) million for the first quarter of 2023.\nCost of revenues for the first quarter of 2024 includes $171 million of costs as part of our cost of\nrevenue efficiency initiatives primarily related to liabilities incurred during the three months\nended March 31, 2024 with suppliers and accelerated depreciation in advance of the updates\nbeing made to our Normal Factory during the plant retooling upgrade.\nGross profit losses decreased year-over-year, primarily due to the increased vehicle production\nand deliveries, reductions in materials costs, and higher average selling prices. During April 2024,\nwe shut down our Normal Factory to introduce new technologies into the R1 platform and retool\nthe R1 production line. We expect these upgrades to further reduce the material and conversion\ncost of our vehicles as we exit 2024; however, in the near-term we expect the planned plant\nretooling upgrade to negatively impact our vehicle production and cost of revenues as a result of\nthe direct downtime and less efficient absorption of labor, overhead, and depreciation associated\nwith lower volume.\nThe inventory as of March 31, 2024 was written down by $328 million for LCNRV. Additionally\nthere were LCNRV losses related to firm purchase commitments of $45 million. We recorded a\n$150 million charge to reflect the LCNRV of inventory and losses on firm purchase commitments\nas of March 31, 2024. We expect the amount of LCNRV write-downs and losses on firm purchase\ncommitments to decrease over time, which we anticipate will have the effect of increasing net\ninventory balances, and decreasing cost of revenues per vehicle. Furthermore, we forecast\nreaching positive gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024 and therefore expect that by the end\nof 2024, we will not have material LCNRV inventory charges associated with goods manufactured\nat our Normal Factory.\nThe key drivers of our path to positive gross profit include reducing material costs, conversion\ncosts, and depreciation expenses, as well as increasing our revenues per delivered unit through\nthe growth of regulatory credit, software and services, and remarketing revenues.\nQ1 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 11\nOperating Expenses Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2024 grew to $957 million, as compared to\nand Operating Loss $898 million in the same period last year.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, we recognized non-cash, stock-based compensation expense within\noperating expenses of $210 million as compared to $165 million in the first quarter of 2023 and\ndepreciation and amortization expense within operating expenses of $70 million as compared to\n$58 million in the first quarter of 2023.\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expense in the first quarter of 2024 was $461 million, as\ncompared to $496 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to a\n$52 million decrease in engineering, design, and development costs related to the R1 platform\ndesign and technology upgrades and $25 million decrease in payroll and related expenses for\nlower headcount and restructuring activities partially offset by a $40 million increase in stock-\nbased compensation primarily related to increased grants in 2023.\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expense in the first quarter of 2024 was\n$496 million, as compared to $402 million in the same period last year. The increase was\nprimarily due to a $32 million increase in payroll and related expenses resulting predominantly\nfrom an increase in service and sales headcount, $27 million increase in depreciation and\namortization as well as other miscellaneous operating expenses to support go-to-market\noperations and corporate initiatives.\nWe experienced a loss from operations in the first quarter of 2024 totaling $(1,484) million, as\ncompared to $(1,433) million in the same period last year.\nAdjusted Operating Expenses¹ Adjusted R&D¹ for the first quarter of 2024 was $319 million as compared to $379 million for the\nsame period last year.\nAdjusted SG&A¹ for the first quarter of 2024 was $358 million as compared to $296 million for\nthe same period last year.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses¹ for the first quarter of 2024 was $677 million as compared to\n$675 million for the same period last year.\nNet Loss Our net loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $(1,446) million as compared to $(1,349) million for\nthe same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA¹ Adjusted EBITDA¹ for the first quarter of 2024 was $(798) million as compared to $(1,020) million\nfor the same period last year.\nNet Cash Used in Operating Net cash used in operating activities for the first quarter of 2024 was $(1,269) million as\nActivities compared to $(1,521) million for the same period last year.\nCapital Expenditures Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2024 were $254 million, flat as compared to\n$283 million for the same period last year.\nLiquidity and Free Cash Flow¹ We ended the first quarter of 2024 with $7,858 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term\ninvestments. Including the capacity under our asset-based revolving-credit facility, we ended the\nfirst quarter of 2024 with $9,053 million of total liquidity.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. The\nsmaller year-over-year net cash used in operating activities discussed above resulted in negative\nfree cash flow¹ of $(1,523) million for the first quarter of 2024 as compared to $(1,804) million for\nthe same period last year.\nWe continued to take steps to further strengthen our balance sheet as we develop our next\nvehicle platform, R2, and begin long lead time equipment purchases for our plant in Normal.\n¹A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided later in this letter.\nQ1 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian.

All rights reserved. 24\nNon-GAAP In addition to our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nFinancial Measures principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we review financial measures that are not calculated and\npresented in accordance with GAAP (“non-GAAP financial measures”). We believe our non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are useful in evaluating our operating and cash performance. We use the\nfollowing non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and\nfor internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information,\nwhen taken collectively, may be helpful to investors, because it focuses on underlying operating\nresults and trends, provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and\nassists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial\ninformation to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented\nfor supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial\ninformation presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-\nGAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is\nprovided above. Reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not\nprovided because we are unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due\nto the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, certain items, such as stock-based\ncompensation expense and other costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of\nthese non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted research and development expenses,\nadjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses, total adjusted operating expenses,\nadjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share, and free cash flow.\nAdjusted research and development expenses is defined as total research and development\nexpenses, less R&D depreciation and amortization expenses and R&D stock-based\ncompensation expenses.\nAdjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses is defined as total selling, general, and\nadministrative expenses, less SG&A depreciation and amortization expenses and SG&A stock-\nbased compensation expenses.\nAdjusted operating expenses is defined as total operating expenses, less R&D depreciation and\namortization expenses, R&D stock-based compensation expenses, SG&A depreciation and\namortization expenses, and SG&A stock-based compensation expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest expense (income), net, provision for\nincome taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other expense\n(income), net, and special items. Our management team ordinarily excludes special items from its\nreview of the results of the ongoing operations. Special items is comprised of (i) cost of revenue\nefficiency initiatives which include costs incurred as we transition between major vehicle\nprograms, cost incurred for negotiations with major suppliers regarding changing demand\nforecasts or design modifications, and other costs for enhancing capital and cost optimization of\nthe Company (ii) restructuring expenses for significant actions taken by the Company, (iii)\nsignificant asset impairments and write-offs, and (iv) other items that we do not necessarily\nconsider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities.\nAdjusted net loss is defined as net loss before stock-based compensation expense and other\n(expense) income.\nAdjusted net loss per share is defined as adjusted net loss divided by the weighted-average\ncommon shares outstanding.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures.\nQ1 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian.

The technical\nworkstream to prepare the integration of Rivian electrical architecture and software technology\nstack into Volkswagen Group products is moving along very well and, subject to the execution\nof definitive agreements and the receipt of regulatory approvals, we expect to close the joint\nventure in the fourth quarter of this year.\nExecution during the quarter was strong with the success of the retooling upgrade in Normal\nand the launch of our second generation R1 which is more capable and offers new technologies,\nwhile also significantly reducing material costs and improving manufacturing efficiency. We also\nannounced our expected technology partnership with Volkswagen Group, which we believe\ncreates a robust capital roadmap, meaningful cost efficiencies, and demonstrates that our\nvertically integrated software and electronics technology has the potential to serve as the basis\nfor new, high return business opportunities.\nRivian produced 9,612 vehicles and delivered 13,790 vehicles during the second quarter of 2024.\nAs expected, production was impacted by plant downtime associated with the retooling upgrade.\nAs a result, deliveries exceeded production as we significantly reduced inventory of our first\ngeneration R1 trucks and SUVs. In addition, despite the vast majority of R1 deliveries in the quarter\nbeing first generation R1 vehicles, we continued to see the impacts of our cost initiatives and\nexperienced an improvement in gross profit per vehicle delivered in the second quarter as\ncompared to the first quarter of 2024. The plant is now in the process of ramping production\nof the second generation R1.\n1 Subject to the formation of the joint venture, Rivian and Volkswagen Group executing definitive agreements, the achievement of certain\nmilestones, and the receipt of regulatory approvals.\nQ2 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 3\nWe believe the introduction of the second generation R1 will enhance execution against our key\nvalue drivers.\nFocus on demand generation and enhancing the customer experience: A customer survey\nreveals that the top three reasons for buying a Rivian include exterior design and styling, driving\nperformance, and innovative technology. The second generation of R1 builds upon these\nstrengths with a positive reception from our customers. The vast majority of the second half\nof 2024 consumer deliveries are expected to be second generation R1 vehicles.\nOptimize operational efficiency: The second generation R1 vehicles include numerous changes\nthat result in a more efficient manufacturing process. The second generation R1 body has been\nreengineered to optimize cost by eliminating 65 parts and reducing nearly 1,500 joints. Use of\nhigh-pressure die castings simplifies the battery pack and significantly reduced the number of\nparts. Beyond the body improvements, cycle time improvements were made through the entire\nplant to support an overall expected increase in R1 vehicle production line rate of 30%.\nDevelop core technologies: Accompanying the second generation R1 is our new in-house\nAscent drive unit which offers extremely high performance at a much lower cost. In the\nQuad-Motor configuration, the Ascent drive unit delivers 1,025 horsepower, 0-60 mph in\nless than 2.5 seconds, and achieves the quarter mile in less than 10.5 seconds. The Tri-Motor\nAscent configuration outperforms the first generation Quad-Motor configuration in acceleration,\ntorque and range and costs approximately 32% less to manufacture.\nDrive towards profitability: The second generation R1 incorporates engineering design\nchanges, commercial cost improvements, and raw material savings that improve profitability\nand confidence in our positive fourth quarter gross profit target. Beyond 2024, we are planning\nfor further profit improvement driven by reducing material costs, leveraging our fixed cost due\nto anticipated R2 volumes, and scaling our revenues per delivered unit through product mix and\npricing, software and services, and other revenues.\nWe want to thank our employees, customers, suppliers, partners, communities, and shareholders\nfor their continued support of our vision.\nQ2 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 4\nScalable Technology\nFrom the beginning, we have taken the approach to vertically integrate certain key areas of\nthe vehicle. Our focus for vertical integration has been to provide an enhanced customer\nexperience as well as more holistically optimized and structurally advantaged vehicle costs.\nOur in-house technology includes:\nPropulsion: We develop and build our drive units, battery management system, and high\nnickel battery packs. These technologies allow us to offer high performance systems at a\nlower cost to Rivian.\nAutonomy: Our in-house approach to autonomy reduces our costs and increases our\ndevelopment speed. For instance, we were able to quickly develop Lane Change on Command\nthrough tight integration of sensors, hardware, software, testing, and simulation. By having a\nholistic approach to developing autonomy, our learning transfers unencumbered to every layer\nof the stack, improving our velocity and user experience for the next set of features.\nElectrical Hardware: We internally develop and design the electrical architecture within our\nvehicles. Our zonal architecture enables us to minimize the number of electrical control units\n(ECUs) in the vehicle – we have between five and ten times fewer ECUs when compared to a\ntraditional vehicle. This also enables us to fully control our software stack which is paramount\nto delivering a vehicle with customer features that are constantly improving. The second\ngeneration R1 network architecture and topology of ECUs will have significant overlap with\nour future midsize platform (MSP) vehicles.\nSoftware: Because we develop the vast majority of our software, we can continually improve\nfeatures and capabilities with a primary focus on providing a superior customer experience.\nThe software architecture has been intentionally designed to be scalable and modular with\nmultiple abstraction layers to facilitate application across varied hardware configurations.\nAll of these core technologies which underpin the second generation R1 vehicles have been\ndesigned to be scalable across vehicle platforms and set the foundation for the technology\nwe plan to introduce in MSP vehicles expected to launch in the first half of 2026.\nQ2 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 5\nPlanned Technology Joint Venture\nwith Volkswagen Group\nWe recently announced plans to form an equally controlled and owned joint venture to create\nnext generation electrical architecture and best-in-class software technology. Underpinned by\nthe vision of the strategic partnership, Volkswagen Group made an initial investment of $1 billion\ninto Rivian, with up to $4 billion in planned additional investment for a total expected deal size\nof $5 billion (subject to the formation of the joint venture, Rivian and Volkswagen Group\nexecuting definitive agreements, the achievement of certain milestones, and the receipt\nof regulatory approvals).\nWe believe this announcement reaffirms the strength of our vertically integrated technology\nplatform and our collaboration is expected to substantially expand the market applications\nfor our software and associated zonal electrical architecture. Rivian’s proven electronics and\nsoftware platform is expected to serve as the foundation for future software development\nin the partnership.\nFrom the very beginning, we have made an intentional effort to own the ECUs and software in the\nvehicle. The vertical integration of our hardware and software platforms equips us to seamlessly\nincorporate new features and enhancements that improve the customer experience. By using\ncustomer feedback and cloud data, our over-the-air technology can update and enable\nimprovements across the entire vehicle architecture, including vehicle dynamics, battery\nmanagement, thermal management, body controls, autonomy, and digital experience.\nOur hardware architecture also has flexibility and is designed to flex across multiple vehicle\nconfigurations, from affordable mass market vehicles to premium vehicles. Preceding this was\nour transition from our first generation to our second generation architecture which was built\nto fully deliver on our vision of flexibility.\nThe lead program for this joint venture is expected to be our R2 platform with an expected start\nof production during the first half of 2026. While the zonal electrical architecture and core\nsoftware technology developed in the joint venture will be common across vehicle programs,\nR2 and other Rivian vehicles will continue to have Rivian's highly differentiated user experience\nand interface and will benefit from our vertically integrated propulsion, high voltage, and\nautonomous driving systems.\nQ2 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 6\n\nDuring the second quarter, we introduced and started deliveries of the second generation\nR1 vehicles. Our new R1 vehicles have hundreds of design, engineering, and performance\nupgrades, including:\n• Entirely new electrical network architecture\n• Entirely new compute and autonomy platforms\n• Two new in-house drive systems, Tri-Motor and Quad-Motor\n• Re-engineered suspension system\n• Two new premium interior options\n• Several new design options, including new exterior paint, new wheel choices, and electronically\ntinted glass roof and more\n• New exterior and interior lighting systems\n• New ultra-wideband access capabilities\n• New digital interfaces including our unique cel shading designs\nThese upgrades were made while also realizing significant cost improvements throughout\nthe vehicle, which we believe positions the platform for long term profitability. The introduction\nof the second generation R1 platform combined with commercial cost improvements and\ncommodity tail winds are expected to enable a 20% material cost reduction when comparing\nan R1 Dual-Motor with Large Pack produced in Q1 2024 versus the same vehicle produced in\nQ4 2024. In addition, we expect to realize a 30% efficiency in the R1 production line rate by\nthe end of 2024.\nTo achieve this, significant design optimizations were made throughout the R1 vehicles. For\nexample, the front crossmember of our battery pack has been reduced from 17 parts with high-\npressure die casting enabling a 47% piece cost reduction. By moving to a zonal electrical\narchitecture, we moved from having 17 in-house ECUs to 7, allowing us to remove 1.6 miles of\nharness length and significant cost in the electrical system cost.\nMany of the new technologies introduced into the R1 platform will serve as the foundation for\nour MSP expected to launch in the first half of 2026 and give us increased confidence in our\ntimelines associated with that platform.\nQ2 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 8\nIn-House Motor Family\nAlong with our second generation R1 announcement, we also introduced two new in-house motor\nconfigurations; the Tri-Motor and Quad-Motor. These motor configurations, in addition to our\nDual-Motor configurations released in 2023, mean all motors on all new Rivian vehicles are now\ndesigned, engineered, and manufactured fully in-house.\nDual-Motor: Our Dual-Motor delivers incredible all-wheel drive capability along with\n665 horsepower and 0–60 mph in as quick as 3.4 seconds for the Performance variant.\nTri-Motor: Our all-new 850 horsepower Tri-Motor packs two motors in the rear and one in front\nfor a blend of exceptional power and range. The Tri-Motor R1T delivers 0–60 mph in 2.9 seconds\nwhile offering an estimated range in conserve mode of ~400 miles.\nQuad-Motor: For maximum performance, our new 1,025 horsepower Quad-Motor delivers\n0–60 mph in less than 2.5 seconds in an R1T with a staggering 1,198 lb-ft of torque in Launch\nMode, 60–80 mph acceleration in 1.5 seconds, with incredible torque control at each wheel\nfor superior on-road performance and off-road capability.\nIn both Tri and Quad variants, while operating in conserve mode, an automatic rear disconnect\nensures AWD performance is always available, but intuitively turns off when driving demand\ndoesn't require it, helping customers maximize their range when they need it, and performance\nwhen they want it.\nQ2 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 9\nAll Rivian motors are oil-cooled, significantly improving thermal performance during high-torque,\nlow-speed driving such as rock crawling while also improving range efficiency during low-torque,\nhigh-speed cruising.\nThe new in-house drive unit features a redesigned inverter with 75% higher volume density and\n25% lower cost for the same performance. The integrated housing mounts have fewer parts,\nimproved stiffness, and dual isolated bushings improve noise, vibration, and harshness. Direct\noil cooling to stator and rotor allows improved thermal performance and continuous power\noutput. The combination of these design optimizations has dramatically reduced cost and\nimproved performance.\nQ2 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 10\nGo-to-Market Operations\nOur go-to-market team is laser focused on enhancing the customer experience as well\nas investing in key initiatives that will continue to drive demand for our vehicles. We plan to\ncontinue to invest in spaces and service centers while concurrently increasing utilization of our\nexisting physical footprint which includes 14 spaces and 60 service centers. During the second\nquarter of 2024 we welcomed over 267,000 visitors and hosted over 24,000 demo drives.\nTo augment our go-to-market strategy, we have added salespeople and retrofitted some service\ncenters which are typically well-located for demo drives. We also continue to drive utilization\nof our mobile service fleet of vehicles which reduce the need for a physical service footprint.\nThe majority of work orders this year have been completed via our fleet of over 590 mobile\nservice vans.\nQ2 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 11\n2024 Outlook\nDuring the second quarter we took significant steps towards our profitability targets through\nsome of the changes we made to the R1 platform. We expect to start seeing the impact of these\nchanges in the second half of the year and expect to reach a modest gross profit in the fourth\nquarter of this year.\nWe are reaffirming our 2024 annual guidance of 57,000 total units of production, $(2,700) million\nin adjusted EBITDA and $1,200 million in capital expenditures.\nQ2 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 12\nRevenues Total revenues for the second quarter of 2024 were $1,158 million, primarily driven by the delivery\nof 13,790 vehicles. Total revenues from the sale of regulatory credits were $17 million for\nthe quarter.\nGross Profit We generated negative gross profit of $(451) million for the second quarter of 2024 as compared\nto $(412) million for the second quarter of 2023.\nGross profit losses increased year-over-year primarily due to smaller reductions in losses on firm\npurchase commitments, a reduction in average selling prices, accelerated depreciation, and less\nefficient absorption of labor, overhead, and depreciation associated with lower volume as a result\nof direct downtime from the plant retooling upgrade partially offset by increased vehicle\ndeliveries and reductions in materials costs.\nCost of revenues for the second quarter of 2024 included $59 million, or approximately $4,278\nper vehicle delivered, of costs we do not anticipate being part of our long-term cost structure.\nThis was made up of $33 million of cost of revenue efficiency initiatives primarily related to\ncertain supplier liabilities incurred and $26 million of accelerated depreciation associated with\nthe updates made to our Normal Factory during the plant retooling upgrade.\nThe second quarter of 2024 was impacted by a charge for lower of cost or net realizable value\n(LCNRV) write-downs on inventory and losses on firm purchase commitments. Our ending\ninventory balance includes LCNRV write-downs of $148 million while liabilities for losses on firm\npurchase commitments were $31 million, for a total of $179 million at the end of the second\nquarter of 2024 as compared to our ending inventory balance LCNRV write-downs of $379 million\nand liabilities for losses on firm purchase commitments of $179 million, for a total of $558 million\nat the end of the second quarter of 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the cost\nto manufacture our products as a result of increased vehicle deliveries and lower material costs.\nWe expect the amount of LCNRV write-downs and losses on firm purchase commitments to\ndecrease over time, which we anticipate will have the effect of increasing net inventory balances,\nand decreasing cost of revenues per vehicle. Furthermore, we forecast reaching modest positive\ngross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024 and therefore expect that by the end of 2024, we will not\nhave material LCNRV write-downs of inventory associated with goods manufactured at our\nNormal Factory or losses on firm purchase commitments.\nThe key drivers of our path to positive gross profit include reducing material costs, conversion\ncosts, and depreciation expenses, as well as increasing our revenues per delivered unit.\nQ2 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 13\nOperating Expenses Total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2024 grew to $924 million, as compared to\nand Operating Loss $873 million in the same period last year.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we recognized non-cash, stock-based compensation expense\nwithin operating expenses of $177 million as compared to $158 million in the second quarter of\n2023 and depreciation and amortization expense within operating expenses of $71 million as\ncompared to $63 million in the second quarter of 2023.\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expense in the second quarter of 2024 was $428 million,\nas compared to $444 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to\na $33 million decrease in engineering, design, and development costs related to the R1 platform\ndesign and technology upgrades and an $18 million decrease in depreciation and amortization\npartially offset by a $25 million increase in stock-based compensation.\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expense in the second quarter of 2024 was\n$496 million, as compared to $429 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily\ndue to a $33 million increase in payroll and related expenses resulting predominantly from an\nincrease in service and sales headcount and $26 million increase in depreciation and\namortization.\nWe experienced a loss from operations in the second quarter of 2024 totaling $(1,375) million, as\ncompared to $(1,285) million in the same period last year.\nAdjusted Operating Expenses Adjusted R&D¹ for the second quarter of 2024 was $312 million as compared to $336 million for\n(Non-GAAP)¹ the same period last year.\nAdjusted SG&A¹ for the second quarter of 2024 was $364 million as compared to $316 million for\nthe same period last year.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses¹ for the second quarter of 2024 was $676 million as compared\nto $652 million for the same period last year.\nFair Value Loss on Convertible Fair value loss on convertible note, net reflects the issuance and subsequent mark-to-market\nNote, Net valuation of the unsecured convertible note issued to Volkswagen International America, Inc. in\nthe second quarter of 2024.\nNet Loss Our net loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $(1,457) million as compared to $(1,195) million for\nthe same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)¹ Adjusted EBITDA¹ for the second quarter of 2024 was $(860) million as compared to\n$(861) million for the same period last year.\nAdjusted Net Loss (Non-GAAP)1 Adjusted net loss¹ for the second quarter of 2024 was $(1,115) million as compared to $(997)\nmillion for the same period last year.\nNet Cash Used in Operating Net cash used in operating activities for the second quarter of 2024 was $(754) million as\nActivities compared to $(1,361) million for the same period last year. The reduction in cash usage was\nprimarily driven by reductions in raw materials purchased and increased inventory sold.\nCapital Expenditures Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2024 were $283 million, as compared to\n$255 million for the same period last year.\n¹A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided later in this letter.\nQ2 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 14\nLiquidity and Free Cash Flow We ended the second quarter of 2024 with $7,867 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-\n(non-GAAP)¹ term investments. Including the capacity under our asset-based revolving-credit facility, we\nended the second quarter of 2024 with $9,179 million of total liquidity.\nThe second quarter of 2024’s ending cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balance\nof $7,867 million includes $1 billion of an unsecured convertible note issued to Volkswagen\nInternational America, Inc. in association with the announcement of our planned joint venture\nwith Volkswagen Group. The remaining $4 billion of potential incremental investment\nfrom Volkswagen Group is subject to the completion of the definitive agreements, the\nachievement of certain milestones, and the receipt of regulatory approvals. The planned\ninvestments by Volkswagen Group in addition to our current cash, cash equivalents, and\nshort-term investments are expected to provide the capital to fund our operations\nthrough the ramp of R2 in our Normal Factory, as well as the launch and ramp of the\nMSP in our Georgia facility – supporting our path to positive free cash flow and\nmeaningful scale.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. The\nsmaller year-over-year net cash used in operating activities discussed above resulted in negative\nfree cash flow¹ of $(1,037) million for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to $(1,616) million\nfor the same period last year.\nWebcast We will host an audio webcast to discuss our results and provide a business update at\n2:00pm PT / 5:00pm ET on Tuesday, August 6th, 2024.

All rights reserved. 26\nNon-GAAP In addition to our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nFinancial Measures principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we review financial measures that are not calculated and\npresented in accordance with GAAP (“non-GAAP financial measures”). We believe our non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are useful in evaluating our operating and cash performance. We use the\nfollowing non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for\ninternal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information,\nwhen taken collectively, may be helpful to investors, because it focuses on underlying operating\nresults and trends, provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and\nassists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial\ninformation to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented\nfor supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial\ninformation presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-\nGAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is\nprovided above. Reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not\nprovided because we are unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due\nto the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, certain items, such as stock-based\ncompensation expense and other costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of\nthese non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted research and development expenses,\nadjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses, total adjusted operating expenses,\nadjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share, and free cash flow.\nAdjusted research and development expenses is defined as total research and development\nexpenses, less R&D depreciation and amortization expenses and R&D stock-based\ncompensation expenses.\nAdjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses is defined as total selling, general, and\nadministrative expenses, less SG&A depreciation and amortization expenses and SG&A stock-\nbased compensation expenses.\nAdjusted operating expenses is defined as total operating expenses, less R&D depreciation and\namortization expenses, R&D stock-based compensation expenses, SG&A depreciation and\namortization expenses, and SG&A stock-based compensation expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest expense (income), net, provision for\nincome taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other expense\n(income), net, and special items. Our management team ordinarily excludes special items from its\nreview of the results of the ongoing operations. Special items is comprised of (i) cost of revenue\nefficiency initiatives which include costs incurred as we transition between major vehicle\nprograms, cost incurred for negotiations with major suppliers regarding changing demand\nforecasts or design modifications, and other costs for enhancing capital and cost optimization of\nthe Company (ii) restructuring expenses for significant actions taken by the Company, (iii)\nsignificant asset impairments and write-offs, and (iv) other items that we do not necessarily\nconsider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities, including fair value gain or\nloss on convertible note, net.\nAdjusted net loss is defined as net loss before stock-based compensation expense, other\n(expense) income, and special items. Our management team ordinarily excludes special items\nfrom its review of the results of the ongoing operations.

All rights reserved. 2\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we made progress advancing R2 development, driving greater\nefficiency in operating expenses, launching new R1 variants, investing in our go-to-market\ninfrastructure, and introducing new services to further improve the customer experience.\nWe continue to see cost progress from our second generation R1 vehicles which we expect to\nbe represented in the fourth quarter when we anticipate achieving modest positive gross profit.\nRivian produced 13,157 vehicles and delivered 10,018 vehicles during the third quarter of 2024.\nAs previously disclosed, Rivian is experiencing a production disruption due to a shortage of\na shared component within our Enduro motor system on the R1 and RCV platforms. Our team\nhas a strong sense of urgency in finding a solution as we work in close partnership with the\nsupplier to ramp additional capacity to accommodate planned production.\nOver the long-term we believe Rivian’s value will be determined by the scale it can reach with its\nmidsize platform including the R2, R3, and R3X, as well as our ability to continue to reduce costs\nand develop differentiated technologies. Our midsize platform is expected to address global market\nsegments and is designed to build upon our industry-leading technology platform as well as our focus\non reducing manufacturing complexity and cost efficiency. Our team is laser-focused on executing\nthe development plan for R2. The recent transition to our second generation R1 vehicles has\nimplemented multiple new technologies which will serve as the foundation for our midsize platform\nsuch as our zonal network architecture and Rivian Autonomous Platform, positioning R2 for a\nsimplified launch.\nWe believe the formation of the expected joint venture with Volkswagen Group will be a landmark\ndevelopment for the industry. The joint venture will benefit from Rivian's differentiated and well-\nproven zonal network architecture and full-stack software technologies as well as enhanced software\nand electrical architecture innovation. The upcoming partnership with Volkswagen Group validates\nRivian’s technology leadership and creates new growth opportunities for Rivian to be a technology\npartner to other manufacturers.\nThe joint venture is expected to provide a meaningful financial opportunity for Rivian with a total\ndeal size of approximately $5 billion, in addition to the annual operating expense savings Rivian\nexpects to realize. The planned investments by Volkswagen Group in addition to our current cash,\ncash equivalents, and short-term investments are expected to provide the capital to fund Rivian’s\noperations through the ramp of R2 in Normal, as well as the midsize platform in Georgia – enabling\na path to positive free cash flow and meaningful scale.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 3\nWe believe the introduction of our second generation R1, along with the formation of the joint venture,\nwill enhance execution against our core value drivers:\nFocus on demand generation and enhancing the customer experience: Demand for R1 vehicles\nwas negatively impacted in the third quarter of 2024 by the production disruption and a challenging\nconsumer backdrop. We remain focused on maximizing the levers within our control and strategically\ninvesting in our go-to-market strategy. We continue to make progress expanding our commercial\nfootprint and enabling the opportunity for more potential customers to experience Rivian vehicles.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we increased our total demo drives by approximately 20% as compared\nto the second quarter of 2024.\nOptimize operational efficiency: We continue to focus on maximizing spend efficiency across all\naspects of the organization. As compared to the second quarter of 2024, third quarter of 2024\nGAAP operating expenses were down $147 million, marking our lowest quarter in the last three years.\nExcluding stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization, our adjusted operating\nexpenses1 for the quarter were down $77 million as compared to the prior quarter.\nTechnology leadership: We believe technology is a competitive differentiator for Rivian. Our midsize\nplatform is designed to build upon our industry-leading technology platform. We expect the midsize\nplatform to benefit from the key vertically integrated technologies developed for R1 including our\nin-house software stack, propulsion technology, network architecture, and vehicle electronics.\nDrive towards profitability: We are seeing meaningful progress on our second generation R1 material\ncosts due to the new technologies incorporated into the vehicle and manufacturing process. The\nintroduction of the second generation R1 platform combined with commercial cost improvements and\ncommodity tail winds are expected to enable a 20% material cost reduction when comparing an R1\nDual-Motor with Large Pack produced in the first quarter of 2024 versus the same vehicle produced\nin fourth quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024, we have already seen reductions in our material\ncost in line with our target. In addition, we have made meaningful progress in sourcing components\nfor R2. We are approximately 85% through the sourcing of R2 bill of materials and are currently in line\nwith our cost targets. We anticipate the material cost of an R2 AWD Large vehicle to be 45% lower than\na second generation R1 Dual Large vehicle.\nWe want to thank our employees, customers, suppliers, partners, communities, and shareholders for\ntheir continued support of our vision.\n¹A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided later in this letter.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 4\nRivian and Volkswagen Group\nTechnology Joint Venture\nRivian and Volkswagen Group’s technology joint venture expects to create the next-generation of\nelectrical architecture and vertically integrated software for electric vehicles. The joint venture will\nbe highly complementary, combining Rivian’s industry-leading software and electrical hardware\ntechnology and Volkswagen Group’s significant global scale and diverse range of vehicles and price\npoints. The combination of strong brands and breadth of offerings is expected to enable Rivian’s core\ntechnology to reach a broader set of global customers.\nOver the past few months, we have successfully integrated Rivian’s zonal controls and infotainment\nsystems into a prototype Volkswagen Group driveable demonstrator. Through our software, we have\nbeen able to integrate several functions including vehicle core controls, different drive modes, and\ninfotainment features as well as enable remote controls and over-the-air updates.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 5\nInnovation: The joint venture is expected to develop industry-leading software enabled features\nand capabilities to address global markets and a variety of vehicle platforms; from mass market\nto premium.\nScalable technology platform: The joint venture has been made possible by the years of investment\nand development in vertically integrating Rivian’s scalable network architecture, topology of ECUs,\nand associated software platforms.\nPartner of choice for differentiated technology: Over the long-term, we see Rivian as the partner\nof choice for differentiated technologies in the industry. The partnership with Volkswagen Group\nvalidates Rivian’s technology approach and demonstrates our capability to create new growth\nopportunities. From the beginning, we have taken the approach to vertically integrate certain key\nareas of the vehicle including propulsion, autonomy, electrical hardware, and software.\nImproved cost efficiency: The joint venture is expected to leverage the scalable technology across\nboth the Volkswagen Group and Rivian’s combined EV volumes and lower Rivian’s operating\nexpenses while driving greater progress and innovation.\nCapital roadmap for growth: Subject to the formation of the joint venture and certain milestones, the\ntotal deal size of approximately $5 billion in addition to our current cash, cash equivalents, and short-\nterm investments are expected to provide the capital to fund Rivian’s operations through the ramp of\nR2 in Normal, as well as the midsize platform in Georgia supporting our path to positive free cash flow\nand meaningful scale.\nWe expect to close the joint venture in the fourth quarter of this year.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 6\nR2 Progress\nWe believe R2 will be a fundamental driver of Rivian’s growth and profit potential. It allows Rivian\nto address global market segments and is designed to build upon our industry-leading technology\nplatform. R2 will benefit from vertically integrated technologies developed for R1 including our in-\nhouse software stack, propulsion technology, network architecture, and vehicle electronics.\nR2 development has focused on reducing the number of parts, joints, and fasteners in a focused effort\nto drive manufacturing simplicity. This includes a structural battery pack that serves as the floor of the\nvehicle, large structural die castings, further electronics consolidation enabling harness simplification,\nand a wide range of design decisions to enable low cost execution. We have made meaningful\nprogress in sourcing components for R2. We are approximately 85% through the sourcing of\nR2 bill of materials and are currently in line with our cost targets.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 7\nIn addition, we continue to make rapid progress in Normal constructing our facility expansion which\nwill house the general assembly, body shop, and end of line for R2 production. This is a critical step\nto achieve our target of launching R2 in the first half of 2026.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 8\nUpdate on R2 Propulsion\nToday we announced an important strategic partnership with LG Energy Solution (LGES) to supply\nUS manufactured cells for our upcoming R2 vehicle. LGES will provide 4695 cylindrical batteries\nenabling high-quality, advanced battery technology to our vehicles, ensuring long range and\nsegment-leading performance.\nThe agreement also pioneers a plethora of supply chain innovations and strengthens domestic\nsourcing for battery materials. Within the first year of production, the batteries are expected to\nbe manufactured at LGES' Queen Creek, Arizona plant, aligning with Rivian's focus on U.S. domestic\nmanufacturing and IRA compliance.\nOur battery pack architecture is expected to continue to evolve and improve with R2 and R3. It will be\nbased upon a simplified pack structure which reduces weight, complexity, and cost while also having\ngreater energy density. We expect a meaningful reduction in dollar per kilowatt hour (kWh) at the\npack level when compared to the R1 platform. In addition, the 4695 is a larger cell form factor than R1\nwhich allows for reduced cell count for improved manufacturability. We expect battery pack assembly\nprocessing to improve by approximately 45%.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 8\nSoftware\nOur intentional decision to own the software and technology hardware stack in the vehicle has\nbeen focused on an improved experience for our customers. Rivian customers enjoy continuous\nenhancement to their vehicles via frequent over the air updates, with over 35 updates made to the\nvehicles since launching.\nRivian’s software platform allows seamless integration of the services for simple, convenient, and\nimmersive infotainment experience. Available applications now include Apple Music and Audible\nwith Google Cast and YouTube coming later this year.\nThis quarter we introduced Connect+, a streaming and connectivity service providing customers\nmusic, audio, in-vehicle hotspot, and video streaming connectivity with an easy monthly or annual\nsubscription. Included within Connect+ subscription, customers can now access the Gear Guard\nLive Cam feature offering peace of mind from in or away from the vehicle. The system includes high-\nresolution cameras embedded around the vehicle, physical cables that secure your gear, and an\nattentive animation on the center display. With this update, customers can see what is happening\nin and around their vehicle from almost anywhere via the Rivian mobile app.\nFollowing the launch of Connect+, we provided customers a 60 day free trial period; we have seen\nthe majority of R1 customers have subscribed to Connect+ following the free trial period.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 9\nR1 Update\nThe second generation of R1 vehicles have hundreds of design, engineering, and performance\nupgrades to provide a superior customer experience and a meaningful improvement to the cost\nstructure of the vehicle. As a result of these changes, the material cost of the R1 vehicle is now\nmeaningfully lower when comparing a vehicle produced in the first quarter of 2024 to a vehicle\nproduced in the third quarter of 2024. The introduction of the second generation R1 platform\ncombined with commercial cost improvements and commodity tail winds are expected to enable\na 20% material cost reduction when comparing an R1 Dual-Motor with Large Pack produced in the\nfirst quarter of 2024 versus the same vehicle produced in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nWe recently launched our Tri-Motor R1 configuration, combining performance levels that surpass our\noriginal quad motor offerings. Tri-Motor packs two of our Ascent motors in the rear and one Enduro\nmotor in front for a blend of exceptional power and range. With 850 horsepower and 1,103 Ib-ft of\ntorque, it reaches 0-60 mph in 2.9 seconds and when driving in Conserve mode has 405 miles of range.\nIn addition, we expect to launch the Quad-Motor variant in 2025. The Quad-Motor variant has two\nsmaller motors in the front, optimized for efficiency at cruising speeds and two in the rear delivering\n0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds and 1,025 horsepower. Both the Tri-Motor and Quad-Motor are equipped\nwith our new Ascend premium interior offering.\nIn both Tri- and Quad- variants, while operating in Conserve mode, an automatic rear disconnect\nensures AWD performance is always available, but intuitively turns off when driving demand doesn't\nrequire it, helping you maximize range when you need it, and performance when you want it.\nAll Rivian motors are oil-cooled, significantly improving thermal performance during high-torque,\nlow-speed driving such as rock crawling while also improving range efficiency during low-torque,\nhigh-speed cruising.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 10\nGo-to-Market\nWe remain focused on our top of funnel demand generation as we expand our presence across\nthe country and get more customers into vehicles for demo drives. We currently have 16 spaces\nincluding six new spaces opened since the start of the the third quarter of 2024 in Yosemite, San\nDiego, Nashville, Boston, Scottsdale, and Chicago and have 62 service locations with the majority\nstaffed for sales and demo drives. In the third quarter of 2024, we conducted over 29,000 demo\ndrives and launched our consumer referral program.\nWhile we anticipate a challenging consumer backdrop in the near-term, we continue to see\na significant opportunity to increase our brand awareness and have more customers behind\nthe wheel of our award-winning products.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 11\nProduction and Deliveries\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we produced 13,157 vehicles and delivered 10,018 vehicles.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we experienced a production disruption due to a shortage of a\ncomponent within our Enduro motor system. The Enduro motor is our in-house single-motor-per-axle\nsystem used in our R1 vehicles as both motors in the Dual-Motor variant, and one of the motors in the\nTri-Motor variant, as well as our commercial vans as the single motor. We expect to produce more\nTri-Motors and commercial vans as a mitigating factor to the supply constraint, with Amazon\nincreasing its delivery order of vans in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nDemand for R1 vehicles was negatively impacted in the third quarter of 2024 by the production\ndisruption and challenging consumer backdrop. Due to the sequential production ramp following\nthe plant retooling upgrade, the part shortage limited availability of specific R1 variants for sale.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 12\nPath to Profitability\nOur long-term success and ability to make an impact will ultimately be determined by our ability to\noperate profitably and generate cash flow. Over the past few years, we have taken significant steps to\nreduce our capital expenditures and overhead costs. This includes our decision to bring the first line\nof R2 production to Normal and other organizational changes we have made. In addition, we remain\nfocused on generating positive gross margins through improved unit economics on our vehicle\nplatforms.\nWe expect to generate modest positive gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2024 supported by\nthe following key drivers:\n• Revenue per unit: We anticipate an increase in revenue per unit delivered mainly driven by\nthe increase in non-vehicle revenues such as the sale of regulatory credits, vehicle service,\nremarketing, software, and other services. In addition, we anticipate the average selling price\nper vehicle to increase due to the higher mix of second generation R1 vehicles and more\npremium variants like the Tri-Motor, partially offset by an increased mix of commercial vans.\n• Variable costs: As part of the cutover to our second generation R1 vehicles, we are starting\nto see significantly improved material costs associated with our R1 vehicles. These benefits\nare due to design changes, supplier negotiations, and lower raw material costs. We also\nexpect the variable cost per unit delivered to benefit from an increase in the mix of\ncommercial van sales.\n• Fixed and semi-fixed costs: We have made changes to the design of our vehicles and\nmanufacturing process which we expect to significantly reduce our fixed costs per vehicle\ndelivered in the fourth quarter of 2024. We also expect our ending inventory lower of cost\nor net realizable value (LCNRV) and liabilities for losses on firm purchase commitments\nbalances to continue decreasing.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 13\n2024 Outlook\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we took meaningful steps to enhance the profitability of our\nsecond generation R1 vehicles.\nWe are reaffirming our production guidance of between 47,000 to 49,000 vehicles.\nWe are reaffirming our delivery outlook of between 50,500 to 52,000 vehicles and $1,200 million\nin capital expenditures.\nThe lower production outlook for 2024 has a negative impact on our profitability for 2024 due to\nour limited ability to leverage the fixed costs of our production facility. Because of this, we are revising\nour annual adjusted EBITDA guidance to between a $(2.825) billion loss to a $(2.875) billion loss.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 14\nRevenues Total revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $874 million, primarily driven by the delivery\nof 10,018 vehicles. Total revenues from the sale of regulatory credits were $8 million for the\nquarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, a portion of the decrease was driven by timing of\nhigher EDV deliveries in the third quarter of 2023 following the first quarter of 2023 line\nshutdown. The remaining portion of the decrease was driven in part from our production\ndisruption causing a limited number of R1 variants being available for sale and a more challenging\nconsumer environment.\nGross Profit We generated negative gross profit of $(392) million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to\n$(477) million for the third quarter of 2023.\nGross profit losses decreased year-over-year primarily due to lower delivery volume. Gross profit\nlosses per unit increased primarily due to an increase in cost of revenue efficiency initiatives and\nsmaller reduction in LCNRV of inventory and losses on firm purchase commitments.\nCost of revenues for the third quarter of 2024 included $37 million of costs we do not anticipate\nbeing part of our long-term cost structure. This was made up of cost of revenue efficiency\ninitiatives primarily related to certain supplier liabilities incurred.\nThe third quarter of 2024 was impacted by a charge for LCNRV write-downs on inventory and\nlosses on firm purchase commitments. Our ending inventory balance includes LCNRV write-\ndowns of $130 million while liabilities for losses on firm purchase commitments were $10 million,\nfor a total of $140 million at the end of the third quarter of 2024 as compared to our ending\ninventory balance LCNRV write-downs of $292 million and liabilities for losses on firm purchase\ncommitments of $160 million, for a total of $452 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023. The\ndecrease is primarily due to an increase in projected positive-margin variants and a decrease in\nestimated materials’ costs for the projected negative-margin variants. We expect LCNRV write-\ndowns of inventory and losses on firm purchase commitments to continue to decrease over time\nas we further reduce the cost to manufacture our products. The key drivers of our path to positive\ngross profit include increasing our revenues per delivered unit, reducing variable costs, and\nreducing fixed and semi-fixed costs.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 15\nOperating Expenses Total operating expenses in the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $777 million, as compared to\nand Operating Loss $963 million in the same period last year.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we recognized non-cash, stock-based compensation expense within\noperating expenses of $105 million as compared to $219 million in the third quarter of 2023 and\ndepreciation and amortization expense within operating expenses of $73 million as compared to\n$80 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expense in the third quarter of 2024 was $350 million,\nas compared to $529 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to\na $74 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to a reversal in the\naccrual of a previously recorded stock-based bonus expense and decreased grants, a $57 million\ndecrease in engineering, design, and development costs and other related project costs primarily\nsurrounding the R1 platform design and technology upgrades, and a $30 million decrease in\ndepreciation and amortization.\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expense in the third quarter of 2024 was\n$427 million, as compared to $434 million in the same period last year. SG&A expenses remained\nrelatively flat compared to three months ended September 30, 2023, with a $40 million decrease\nin stock-based compensation expense primarily related to a reversal in the accrual of a previously\nrecorded stock-based bonus expense offset by a $23 million increase in depreciation and\namortization and a $17 million increase in sales and marketing expenses to support go-to-market\noperations.\nWe experienced a loss from operations in the third quarter of 2024 totaling $(1,169) million, as\ncompared to $(1,440) million in the same period last year.\nAdjusted Operating Expenses Adjusted R&D¹ for the third quarter of 2024 was $271 million as compared to $346 million for the\n(Non-GAAP)¹ same period last year.\nAdjusted SG&A¹ for the third quarter of 2024 was $328 million as compared to $318 million for the\nsame period last year.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses¹ for the third quarter of 2024 was $599 million as compared to\n$664 million for the same period last year.\nNet Loss Our net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $(1,100) million as compared to $(1,367) million for\nthe same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)¹ Adjusted EBITDA¹ for the third quarter of 2024 was $(757) million as compared to $(902) million\nfor the same period last year.\nAdjusted Net Loss (Non-GAAP)1 Adjusted net loss¹ for the third quarter of 2024 was $(1,008) million as compared to $(1,087)\nmillion for the same period last year.\nNet Cash Used in Operating Net cash used in operating activities for the third quarter of 2024 was $(876) million as compared\nActivities to $(877) million for the same period last year.\nCapital Expenditures Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2024 were $277 million, as compared to $190 million\nfor the same period last year.\n¹A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided later in this letter.\nQ3 2024 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 16\nLiquidity and Free Cash Flow We ended the third quarter of 2024 with $6,739 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term\n(non-GAAP)¹ investments. Including the capacity under our asset-based revolving-credit facility, we ended the\nthird quarter of 2024 with $8,105 million of total liquidity.\nThe third quarter of 2024’s ending cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balance of\n$6,739 million includes $1 billion of an unsecured convertible note issued to Volkswagen\nInternational America, Inc. in association with the announcement of our expected joint venture\nwith Volkswagen Group. The convertible note will automatically convert into shares of Class A\ncommon stock on December 1, 2024 as all conversion conditions have been satisfied as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. The\nincrease in year-over-year capital expenditures discussed above resulted in negative free cash\nflow¹ of $(1,153) million for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to $(1,067) million for the same\nperiod last year.\nWebcast We will host an audio webcast to discuss our results and provide a business update at\n2:00pm PT / 5:00pm ET on Thursday, November 7th, 2024.

We believe our non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are useful in evaluating our operating and cash performance. We use the\nfollowing non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for\ninternal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information,\nwhen taken collectively, may be helpful to investors, because it focuses on underlying operating\nresults and trends, provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and\nassists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial\ninformation to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented\nfor supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial\ninformation presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-\nGAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP financial\nmeasure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is\nprovided above. Reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are not\nprovided because we are unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due\nto the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, certain items, such as stock-based\ncompensation expense and other costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of\nthese non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted research and development expenses,\nadjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses, total adjusted operating expenses,\nadjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share, and free cash flow.\nAdjusted research and development expenses is defined as total research and development\nexpenses, less R&D depreciation and amortization expenses and R&D stock-based\ncompensation expenses.\nAdjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses is defined as total selling, general, and\nadministrative expenses, less SG&A depreciation and amortization expenses and SG&A stock-\nbased compensation expenses.\nAdjusted operating expenses is defined as total operating expenses, less R&D depreciation and\namortization expenses, R&D stock-based compensation expenses, SG&A depreciation and\namortization expenses, and SG&A stock-based compensation expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest expense (income), net, provision for\nincome taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other expense\n(income), net, and special items.

All rights reserved. 2\nWe hold the deep conviction that the entire automotive industry will electrify over the long-term.\nRivian has been built to help accelerate the transition. The opportunity ahead is substantial and\nwe are focused on designing our organization, strategy, and products to capture this. We are\nunveiling our first global platform, the R2, in early March. We have made significant progress\ndriving greater cost efficiency on R1 and RCV and have much more to come.\nOur technology and approach to vertical integration has been designed to create structural cost\nadvantages and product differentiation as the market goes through this massive transition to\nelectric vehicles. We believe Rivian has demonstrated a unique ability to resonate with customers\nas evidenced by the R1S becoming the top selling EV in the U.S. priced over $70,000. With over\n71,000 vehicles on the road and over 700 million miles driven by Rivian vehicles, brand\nawareness continues to grow.\nWe more than doubled production and deliveries for full-year 2023 versus 2022 and exceeded\nour initial production guidance by more than 7,000 vehicles. Importantly, the strong performance\nin deliveries was complemented by our continued investments in the customer experience with\ngrowth in service centers, spaces, demo drives, and charging accessibility. This was recognized\nrecently by a leading consumer publication1 which ranks the Rivian brand number one in its\nowner satisfaction survey, with an 86% score on if ‘owners would buy again’, 900bps higher than\nthe second brand on the list.\n¹Source: https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/most-and-least-liked-\ncar-brands-a1291429338/\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 3\nProduction and manufacturing progress improved throughout 2023. Most notably,\nQ4 production represented our strongest quarter to date with an annualized rate of over\n70,000 units despite taking a week of downtime. During the year, our team managed the\ncrucial task of integrating new engineering design changes including our in-house drive units\nfor both the RCV and R1 platforms, our lithium iron phosphate (“LFP”) battery pack for the EDV,\nand new vehicle variants such as our Max Pack.\nRivian's production ramp and introduction of new technologies across multiple vehicle platforms\nhave provided significant learnings in a compressed time frame. Our team will apply this\nexperience to our 2024 operational plans to introduce a number of new technologies into the\nR1 line which we expect to further lower costs. We have also applied these learnings into the\nproduct design, layout, and manufacturing principles for production at our greenfield facility in\nGeorgia. We aim to start production in 2026 and look forward to unveiling our mid-size SUV, R2,\nto the world in just a few weeks. R2 is designed to achieve a considerably lower price point and\ncost structure while building on the brand position established with our flagship R1 adventure\nvehicles, R1T and R1S.\nWe remain focused on driving efficiency throughout Rivian. Our cost discipline has resulted in\nmeaningful improvements in operating efficiency during 2023. Gross profit per delivered vehicle\nimproved by $81k as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA1\nfor the full-year 2023 improved by $1,236 million compared to 2022, and capital expenditures\nreduced by $343 million during the same period. Our company-wide cost transformation\nprogram resulted in meaningful reductions in both R1 and EDV vehicle unit cost across\neach major cost category, including material cost, manufacturing overhead, and logistics.\nBy incorporating new technologies and renegotiating supplier costs, we have reduced the\nmaterial cost per unit. We expect to realize further cost reductions following our line shutdown\nin the second quarter of 2024.\n¹A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided\nlater in this letter.\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 4\nAs we look back, we want to thank our employees, customers, suppliers, partners, communities,\nand shareholders who made our 2023 accomplishments possible and for their continued support\nof our vision.\nIncrease production and deliveries\n◦ Ramped production of all four of our vehicles, producing 57,232 vehicles, a 135% increase\nas compared to 2022\n◦ Scaled our delivery and go-to-market operations, delivering 50,122 vehicles to\ncustomers, a 147% increase as compared to 2022\nImprove cost efficiency\n◦ ~$81k improvement in gross profit per vehicle delivered from the fourth quarter of 2022\nto the fourth quarter of 2023 driven by ramping production, material cost reductions, a\ndecrease in LCNRV write-downs of inventory and firm purchase commitments, and\nincreased revenue per vehicle\n◦ Held operating expenses flat as compared to 2022 while increasing revenue 167%\nDevelop future platforms and technologies\n◦ Released and ramped our in-house Enduro motor serving both the RCV and R1 platforms\n◦ Made significant progress on the design and development of our R2 platform which will\nbe unveiled on March 7, 2024\nEnhance customer experience\n◦ Grew our service footprint to 56 service centers and over 500 mobile service vehicles\n◦ Expanded the Rivian Adventure Network to over 400 chargers across 67 locations\n◦ Opened 10 new spaces and expanded our demo drive program and offering\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 5\nWe made meaningful progress during 2023 and in 2024 we are focused on the following\nvalue drivers:\n• Optimize operational efficiencies: We expect 2024 production to be flat year-over-year with\ntotal units of 57,000. The changes we plan to make in our R1 manufacturing line during the\nmid-year shut down are designed to deliver greater plant efficiency with production rates\nexpected to improve by approximately 30%.\n• Improve cost efficiency: The Rivian team is deeply focused on driving greater cost efficiency\nthroughout the business, including operating expenses, capital expenditures, and cost of\ngoods sold. Regarding our cost of goods sold, we have made continued progress lowering\nboth our material costs as well as non-material costs. We anticipate the most significant set\nof cost reductions will happen in conjunction with the integration of new engineering design\nchanges in the R1 platform, bringing on new suppliers and realizing effectivity dates for\nnegotiated commercial savings with our suppliers. We expect to achieve modest gross\nprofit in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n• Develop future platforms and technologies: We believe 2024 will be foundational as we\nintegrate new engineering design changes into the R1 platform that we expect will\nsignificantly reduce cost and position Rivian to achieve modest gross profit in the fourth\nquarter of 2024. Importantly, we believe our next generation R2 platform will benefit from the\nscalable technology being introduced in the R1 products and combines these technologies\nwith a vehicle platform that is being developed to achieve a substantially lower cost\nstructure through the learnings of launching R1. In addition, in 2024 we plan to introduce new\nvariants and trims including the recently launched Standard Range R1 variant which expands\nour brand to a broader range of potential customers.\n• Enhance the customer experience and demand generation: We believe that our direct-to-\ncustomer model provides our customers with a best-in-class purchase and ownership\nexperience. Over the past year, we have been awarded both Best Ownership Experience\namong Premium Battery Electric Vehicles by a J.D. Power hosted survey and Most-Loved\nCar Brand of 2023 by a leading consumer publication. We remain focused on scaling our go-\nto-market infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and increase demand for our\nproducts. We currently have over 500 mobile service vehicles on the road which are\nhandling the majority of our repair events. In addition, we have 56 service centers and 11\nspaces, and expect to open 26 additional service centers and 17 spaces in 2024. Our service\ncenters and spaces are designed to host demo drives for customers.\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 6\nR2 Reveal\nOn March 7th, we plan to unveil R2 and are excited to share it with the world. The R2\nplatform will leverage the key vertically integrated technology we have and continue\nto develop for our R1 and RCV platforms. This includes our in-house software stack,\npropulsion technology, network architecture, and vehicle electronics.\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 7\nProduction and deliveries\nWe produced 17,541 and delivered 13,972 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAs expected, the fourth quarter of 2023 reflected greater discrepancy between production and\ndeliveries when compared to prior quarters. Seasonality of the commercial business was the\nprimary contributor to the difference and accounted for the vast majority of the incremental\nfinished goods inventory increase during the quarter. We expect EDV deliveries during the last\nquarter of each fiscal year to be lower than prior quarters; however, production is expected to\nremain continuous in order to maintain manufacturing efficiencies.\nQuarterly Production Quarterly Deliveries\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 8\nScaling our go-to-market operations\nAs the number of Rivians on the road increases, we remain focused on scaling our\ngo-to-market infrastructure. Our relationship with our customers is deeply important to us;\nit’s why we believe in owning nearly every interaction with them. We believe this will serve as\na long-term competitive differentiator by significantly enhancing the customer experience of\nowning a Rivian.\nSpaces\nWe currently have 11 spaces open across the United States and Canada. Our spaces are an\ninvitation to current and potential customers to get up close with our vehicles.\nWe hosted over 130,000 visitors in our spaces to experience Rivian since the start of 2024.\nWe are encouraged by the traffic and brand awareness our spaces provide and plan to open\nover 17 incremental spaces in 2024.\nDemo drives\nDemo drives are offered at our spaces, service centers, and in some instances, at pop-up\nvenues. Allowing potential customers the opportunity to experience our vehicles, their\ncapabilities, safety features, and software has proven to be an effective demand generation\nstrategy.\nLeasing\nWe now offer leasing on both the R1T and R1S in 15 states across the United States.\nLeasing has been one of our most requested financing options from our customers and\nwe are working to expand this offering more broadly.\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 9\nService centers\nWe remain focused on scaling our service network as the number of vehicles and miles driven\ncontinues to grow. We see the service network as a competitive differentiator significantly\nenhancing our customers’ experience of owning a Rivian. We currently have 56 service centers\noperational across North America and Germany (for our European EDV deliveries). These\nservice centers also represent great customer facing spaces for hosting demo drives and\nother brand engagement opportunities.\nWe are also committed to improving the vehicle service experience through the offering of\nmobile service. We have over 500 mobile service vehicles in operation handling the majority\nof our service needs across all Rivian vehicles. Mobile service allows customers the opportunity\nto have their Rivian serviced from the comfort of their home or workplace.\nCharging\nOur goal remains to bring our customers the best charging experience possible. We have\nexpanded our Rivian Adventure Network and now have over 400 fast chargers across\n67 locations. During the fourth quarter of 2023, these chargers had an average uptime\nof 97%, providing customers with a fast, reliable, and seamless charge when away from home.\nWe develop, design, and manufacture our chargers in-house and believe they offer a scalable\nsolution to enable EV adoption.\nIn the second half of 2024, we anticipate opening up our Rivian Adventure Network to\nnon-Rivian owners. Opening our network will enable other customers to benefit from our reliable\ncharging solution, allow Rivian to leverage the fixed costs associated with each charging site, and\nallow Rivian to apply for committed government grants associated with expanding domestically\nmanufactured fast chargers across the country.\nIn addition to our Rivian Adventure Network, Rivian owners are expected to gain access to\nover 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the country through our collaboration with Tesla.\nOur goal is to enable a seamless end-to-end NACS digital experience for our customers.\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 10\nEnhancing the customer experience through software\nWe continue to demonstrate the value of our in-house software architecture and capabilities\nthrough over-the-air (“OTA”) updates which provide our customers seamless feature updates.\nThe vertical integration of our hardware and software platforms enable our steady stream of\nupdates. Through a combination of our customer feedback and diagnostic data, our OTA\nupdates target vehicle improvements across vehicle dynamics, autonomy, battery management,\ndigital experience, body control, and telematics.\nThroughout 2023, we were able to significantly enhance our customers’ experience with their\nvehicles through OTA software updates including:\nVehicle performance\n◦ Enhanced our propulsion controls which has increased range on all R1 vehicles\n◦ Improved ride quality across all drive modes on our R1 vehicles\n◦ Improved towing experience including new trailer profiles, automatic weight sensing,\nadaptive range estimation, and a dedicated truck bed camera view\nSafety\n◦ Improved our Driver+ functionality. Made our vehicles more capable of handling a variety of\nsituations and weather conditions\n◦ Enhanced Driver+ usability by allowing the system to automatically reengage after changing\nlanes allowing for a more seamless experience\nUser experience\n◦ Enhanced gear guard system – security system with automatic video recording using\nvehicle’s external cameras\n◦ Integrated data from A Better Routeplanner into our in-vehicle navigation and trip planner\nOur unique capabilities stem from the intentional decisions we made years ago to take a clean\nsheet approach to our software stack and electrical hardware in the vehicle. We are excited to\ncontinue to evolve our software capabilities as well as leverage our customer feedback to\nenhance our vehicles over time.\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 11\nFocus on Gross Profit and Cost Efficiency\nWe believe our success driving significant reduction in the costs of our vehicles during 2023\npositions us to achieve modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024. We improved gross\nprofit per vehicle delivered by approximately $81,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared\nto the fourth quarter of 2022. This improvement was attributed to three main drivers:\n• ~45% - Fixed/semi-fixed cost per unit reduction: The improvement was mainly driven by\nramping production in the fourth quarter over 75% year-over-year. We also saw a meaningful\nreduction in LCNRV write-downs and losses on firm purchase commitments during the year.\n• ~40% - Variable cost per unit: Our improvement in variable costs per vehicle was mainly\nattributed to our continued focus on driving material cost downs for the R1 and commercial\nvehicles. On the commercial vehicles, we realized over 35% savings in material costs after\nimplementing our Enduro drive unit and LFP battery pack in the first quarter of 2023.\n• ~15% - Increase in average revenue per unit: We delivered a higher mix of new priced orders,\nnew variants with higher average prices such as our Max pack, and an increase in regulatory\ncredits revenue.\nThe key drivers to bridge the fourth quarter 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2024 are:\n• ~50% - Variable cost per unit: We anticipate the majority of these savings will be accomplished\nthrough the material cost reductions planned as part of our R1 engineering design changes,\ncommercial supplier negotiations, and lower raw material costs.\n• ~35% - Fixed/semi-fixed cost efficiencies: As part of our planned shutdown and the associated\ndesign changes and optimization initiatives, we expect to significantly reduce our fixed costs\nper vehicle delivered by the end of 2024. These initiatives include increasing our production\nline rate by 30%. We also expect our LCNRV and firm purchase commitments balance to\nprovide a benefit to gross profit during 2024.\n• ~15% - Non-vehicle revenue: With over 71,000 Rivians on the road, we have the opportunity for\nincreased revenue in areas such as service, accessories, remarketing, finance, insurance, and\nother software enabled services. These revenue sources are core to our long-term margin\ntargets, and we expect to continue to drive growth and efficiencies in these areas over the next\nfew years.\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 12\n2024 Outlook\nOver the course of fiscal year 2024, we are focused on\n• Driving towards profitability: Drive down cost and achieve modest gross profit in the\nfourth quarter\n• Customer experience and demand generation: Build customer demand and a robust\ncustomer experience\n• Operational excellence: Continuous improvement and quality\n• Technology leadership: Integration of new technologies in R1 and progress towards\nR2 launch\nEconomic and geopolitical uncertainties and pressures, most notably the impact of historically\nhigh interest rates, have informed our expectations for 2024.\nAs previously discussed, we expect to shut down the consumer and commercial lines\nduring the second quarter of 2024 to introduce new cost saving in-vehicle technologies to the\nR1 platform. We believe these changes will meaningfully reduce our material costs and position\nRivian to exit 2024 with a much-improved margin profile.\nFor 2024, we expect our total deliveries to be derived from our existing order bank as well as new\norders generated during the year. Our full year targets rely on an improvement in order rate\ndriven by our planned go-to-market strategies. The conversion of our existing order bank to\nsales can be impacted by several factors including delivery timing, location of order, monthly\npayments, and customer readiness. Our order bank has notably reduced over time as deliveries\nmore than doubled in 2023 versus 2022, and we have incurred cancellations due to macro and\ncustomer factors.\n2024 Guidance\nVehicles Produced 57,000\nAdj. EBITDA $(2,700) million\nCapital Expenditures $1,750 million\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 13\nDuring 2024, we anticipate making further progress on commercial, engineering, and operational\ncost down efforts, and increasing non-vehicle revenue streams such as regulatory credits,\nservice, remarketing, financing, insurance, and software. We expect to achieve a modest gross\nprofit in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nWe have taken recent measures to reduce our operating and capital expenditures. For 2024,\ntotal adjusted operating expenses are expected to be approximately flat as compared to 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA is expected to be $(2,700) million in 2024. Capital expenditures in 2024 are\nexpected to be $1,750 million, driven by additional investment in our next generation\ntechnologies, our Georgia facility, and go-to-market operations.\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 14\nRevenue Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1,315 million, primarily driven by the delivery\nof 13,972 vehicles. During the year ended December 31, 2023, total revenue was\n$4,434 million, supported by total vehicle deliveries of 50,122. Total revenues from\nthe sale of regulatory credits were $39 million for the quarter and $73 million for the\nfiscal year 2023.\nGross Profit We generated negative gross profit of $(606) million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared\nto $(1,000) million for the same quarter in 2022. For the year ended 2023, we generated\nnegative gross profit of $(2,030) million, as compared to $(3,123) million in 2022.\nGross profit per vehicle delivered was approximately negative $(43,000). During the fourth\nquarter costs of goods sold were negatively impacted by $70 million, or approximately $5,000\nper vehicle delivered. These costs include supplier related expenses, accelerated\ndepreciation, and other expenses primarily related to the new technology and design changes\ngoing into the R1 platform. While we could incur additional costs associated with our planned\nshutdown and technology and design changes in the near-term, we do not anticipate these\ncosts to be part of our normal course of business in the longer-term.\nDuring the fourth quarter we also delivered a higher proportion of consumer vehicles due to\nAmazon’s expected seasonality. For context, the portion of our total revenue attributed to\nAmazon was 8% in the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to 30% in the third quarter. Given\nour commercial vans have lower material costs driven by some of the technology changes\nmade in the first quarter of 2023, the lower deliveries during the quarter negatively impacted\nour gross margin.\nThe fourth quarter of 2023 was impacted by a charge in LCNRV write-downs on inventory and\nlosses on firm purchase commitments. Our ending inventory balance reflects LCNRV write-\ndowns of $319 million, while liabilities for losses on firm purchase commitments were\n$126 million, for a total of $445 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. We expect the\namount of LCNRV write-downs and losses on firm purchase commitments to decrease over\ntime, which we anticipate will have the effect of increasing inventory balances and decreasing\ncost of revenues per vehicle. We forecast reaching positive gross profit in the fourth quarter of\n2024 and therefore expect that by the end of 2024, we will not have material LCNRV inventory\nwrite-offs associated with goods manufactured at our Normal facility.\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 15\nOperating Expenses Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 grew to $975 million, as compared to\nand Operating Loss $795 million in the same period last year.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized a non-cash, stock-based compensation expense\nwithin operating expenses of $194 million as compared to $123 million in the fourth quarter of\n2022 and depreciation and amortization expense within operating expenses of $75 million as\ncompared to $53 million million in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $526 million,\nas compared to $402 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to a\n$68 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and a $28 million increase in\nengineering, design, and development costs and other related project costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 was\n$449 million, as compared to $393 million in the same period last year. The increase was\nprimarily due to a $32 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and $29\nmillion increase in payroll and related expenses due to an increase in headcount to support\ncommercial go-to-market operations.\nDespite our production and deliveries more than doubling as compared 2022, our operating\nexpenses in 2023 remained flat year-over-year; $3,709 million in 2023 as compared to\n$3,733 million for 2022.\nWe experienced a loss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 totaling $(1,581) million,\nas compared to $(1,795) million in the same period last year. For fiscal year 2023, we recorded\na loss from operations of $(5,739) million as compared to $(6,856) million in 2022.\nAdjusted Operating Expenses¹ Adjusted R&D¹ for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $388 million as compared to $322 million\nfor the same period last year.\nAdjusted SG&A¹ for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $318 million as compared to $297 million\nfor the same period last year.\nTotal adjusted operating expenses¹ for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $706 million as\ncompared to $619 million for the same period last year. For the fiscal year of 2023 total\nadjusted operating expenses¹ was $2,697 million compared to $2,629 million in 2022.\nNet Loss Our net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $(1,521) million as compared to $(1,723) million\nfor the same period last year. For fiscal year 2023, we recorded a net loss of $(5,432) million as\ncompared to $(6,752) million in 2022. The decreased losses were due primarily to the\nimproved gross profit per vehicle.\nAdjusted EBITDA¹ Adjusted EBITDA¹ for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $(1,096) million as compared to $(1,461)\nmillion for the same period last year. The decreased Adjusted EBITDA¹ loss for the fourth\nquarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 was driven by lower gross profit\nlosses. For fiscal year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA¹ was $(3,981) million as compared to $(5,217)\nmillion in 2022.\nNet Cash Used in Operating Net cash used in operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $(1,107) million as\nActivities compared to $(1,446) million for the same period last year. Net cash used in operating\nactivities for fiscal year 2023 was $(4,866) million as compared to $(5,052) million during\nfiscal year 2022.\nCapital Expenditures Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $(298) million, as compared to\n$(294) million for the same period last year. For fiscal year 2023, capital expenditures were\n$(1,026) million as compared to $(1,369) million in 2022. The prior year values were higher due\nto elevated equipment and construction spend in the early stages of our production ramp.\n¹A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided later in this letter.\nQ4 2023 Shareholder Letter © 2024 Rivian. All rights reserved. 16\nLiquidity and Free Cash Flow¹ We ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with $9,368 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-\nterm investments. Including the capacity under our asset-based revolving-credit facility, we\nended the fourth quarter of 2023 with $10,468 million of total liquidity.\nWe define free cash flow¹ as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures.\nThe reduction in year-over-year net cash used in operating activities discussed above\nresulted in negative free cash flow¹ of $(1,405) million for the fourth quarter of 2023 as\ncompared to $(1,740) million for the same period last year. Additionally, free cash flow¹ was\n$(5,892) million for fiscal year 2023 as compared to $(6,421) million for 2022.\nWebcast We will host an audio webcast to discuss our results and provide a business update at 2:00pm\nPT / 5:00pm ET on Wednesday, February 21, 2024.

The company produced 13,157 vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois and delivered 10,018 vehicles during the same period. \n\nRivian is experiencing a production disruption due to a shortage of a shared component on the R1 and RCV platforms. This supply shortage impact began in Q3 of this year, has become more acute in recent weeks and continues. As a result of the supply shortage, Rivian is revising its annual production guidance to be between 47,000 and 49,000 vehicles. The company is also reaffirming its annual delivery outlook of low single digit growth as compared to 2023, which it expects to be in a range of 50,500 to 52,000 vehicles. \n\nThe company also announced that on November 7, 2024, after market close, it will release its third quarter 2024 financial results.

(NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced its secondquarter 2024 financial results, reaffirming all aspects of guidance for the year. During the second quarter, the company made significant progress driving greater cost efficiency, improving its products, further strengthening its balance sheet, validating the differentiated nature of its technology stack, and establishing new business opportunities. Execution during the quarter was strong with the completion of the retooling upgrade at the company’s plant in Normal, IL. As previously reported, the company produced 9,612 vehicles and delivered 13,790.\n\nIn June, Rivian and Volkswagen Group announced their intention to form an equally controlled and owned joint venture (JV) to create next-generation electrical architecture and best-in-class software technology. The partnership is anticipated to accelerate the development of software for Rivian and Volkswagen Group. It is planned to allow both companies to combine their complementary strengths and lower cost per vehicle by increasing scale and speeding up innovation globally. Rivian’s proven in-market zonal hardware design and integrated technology platform will serve as the foundation for future software development in the JV that will be applied to both companies’ electric vehicles. As part of the deal, Volkswagen Group has invested an initial $1 billion in Rivian, with $4 billion in planned additional investment, for a total expected deal size of $5 billion.\n\n**RJ Scaringe, Rivian Founder and CEO said** :_“The second quarter has been a defining one for Rivian. We have demonstrated strong execution during the quarter with the plant retooling upgrade and launch of second generation R1 vehicles. The changes we made to the R1 platform have allowed us to reduce material and manufacturing costs, while simultaneously improving performance and capabilities. As a testament to our industry-leading technology stack, we also recently announced our proposed JV with Volkswagen Group. The technical workstream to prepare the integration of Rivian electrical architecture and software technology stack into Volkswagen Group products are moving along very well, and we expect to close the joint venture in the fourth quarter of this year. The output from our joint venture will see Rivian’s technology in vehicles all around the world, helping to create more consumer choice and speed up the transition away from fossil fuels.”_ During the second quarter, the company introduced and started deliveries of the second generation R1 vehicles. The new R1 includes hundreds of design, engineering, and performance upgrades. These upgrades were made while also realizing significant improvements throughout the vehicle, positioning the platform for long-term profitability. Rivian also introduced two new in-house motor configurations; the Tri-Motor and the Quad-Motor. All motors on Rivian vehicles are now designed, engineered, and manufactured fully in-house. When compared against Rivian’s first generation outsourced Quad-Motor system, the new Ascent Quad and Tri-Motor configurations are significantly lower in cost, quicker, and provide superior range.\n\n**Financial Highlights:**\n\n**Revenues:** Total revenues for the second quarter of 2024 were $1,158 million, primarily driven by the delivery of 13,790 vehicles. Total revenues from the sale of regulatory credits were $17 million for the quarter.\n\n**Gross Profit:** Rivian generated negative gross profit of $(451) million for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to $(412) million for the second quarter of 2023. Cost of revenues for the second quarter of 2024 included $59 million, or approximately $4,278 per vehicle delivered in the quarter, of costs we do not anticipate being part of our long-term cost structure. This was made up of $33 million of cost of revenue efficiency initiatives primarily related to certain supplier liabilities incurred and $26 million of accelerated depreciation associated with the updates made to our Normal Factory during the plant retooling upgrade.\n\n**Operating Expenses and Operating Loss:** Total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2024 grew to $924 million, as compared to $873 million in the same period last year.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the company recognized a non-cash, stock-based compensation expense within operating expenses of $177 million as compared to $158 million in the second quarter of 2023 and depreciation and amortization expense within operating expenses of $71 million as compared to $63 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**Fair Value Loss on Convertible Note, Net** Fair value loss on convertible note, net reflects the issuance and subsequent mark-to-market valuation of the unsecured convertible note issued to Volkswagen International America, Inc. in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**Net Loss:** Rivian’s net loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $(1,457) million as compared to $(1,195) million for the same period last year.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)*** Adjusted EBITDA* for the second quarter of 2024 was $(860) million as compared to $(861) million for the same period last year.\n\n**Capital Expenditures:** Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2024 were $283 million, as compared to $255 million for the same period last year.\n\n**Liquidity:** Rivian ended the second quarter of 2024 with $7,867 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Including the capacity under its asset-based revolving-credit facility, the company ended the second quarter of 2024 with $9,179 million of total liquidity. The second quarter of 2024’s ending cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balance of $7,867 million includes $1 billion of an unsecured convertible note issued to Volkswagen International America, Inc. in association with the announcement of our planned joint venture with Volkswagen Group. The remaining $4 billion of potential incremental investment from Volkswagen Group is subject to the completion of the definitive agreements, the achievement of certain milestones, and the receipt of regulatory approvals.For further information please see Rivian’s latest shareholder letter at [www.rivian.com/investors](/investors)\n\nThe company will host an audio webcast to discuss its results and provide a business update at 2:00pm PT / 5:00pm ET on Tuesday August 6, 2024.

(NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced its first quarter 2024 financial results. As previously announced, the company produced 13,980 vehicles and delivered 13,588, exceeding its outlook with a respective 49 percent and 71 percent increase over the same period last year. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Rivian unveiled its new midsize platform which underpins R2, R3, and R3X. Rivian also had announced its intention to begin R2 production at its facility in Normal, Illinois. This is expected to enable start of production for R2 in the first half of 2026 and save over $2.25 billion, as compared to the original forecast of launching R2 production at Rivian’s Georgia site. \n\nLast week, the company announced an incentive package of up to $827 million from the State of Illinois to expand the plant, improve public infrastructure, and to create training programs for Rivian’s workforce.\n\n**RJ Scaringe, Rivian Founder and CEO said** : \n\n_“First-quarter results exceeded our outlook and set a strong foundation for the remainder of the year as we focus on continued demand generation, delivering cost and plant efficiency improvements, advancing R2 development, and driving towards profitability. We hit several milestones this quarter, including producing our 100,000th vehicle in Normal, successfully navigating the retooling upgrade, and unveiling our new midsize platform which underpins the R2, R3, and R3X. It is great to see the incredible support for our brand and upcoming products.”_\n\nThe recently completed plant retooling upgrade in Normal, Illinois introduced new technologies and cost-focused material changes into the R1 vehicle platform. It also provides the opportunity to improve manufacturing processes that enable the R1 line to run at an approximately 30 percent higher line rate. Furthermore, Rivian also recently transitioned to a new zonal network architecture reducing the number of electronic control units in its vehicle by approximately 60 percent, taking substantial costs out of its vehicles.\n\n**Financial Highlights:**\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 gross profit per vehicle delivered was $(38,784) which was negatively impacted by $9,346 per vehicle delivered, primarily related to various supplier and other costs incurred in advance of the new technology changes and parts integration into the R1 platform as part of its cost of revenue efficiency initiatives. As a result of the retooling upgrade, the company expects significant improvement in the material and conversion cost of its vehicles and remains confident in its path to achieving modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of this year. \n\n**Revenues:**\n\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2024 were $1,204 million, primarily driven by the delivery of 13,588 vehicles. Total revenues from the sale of regulatory credits were de minimis for the quarter. \n\n**Gross Profit:**\n\nRivian generated negative gross profit of $(527) million for the first quarter of 2024 as compared to $(535) million for the first quarter of 2023. Gross profit losses decreased primarily due to the increased vehicle production and deliveries, reductions in materials costs, and higher average selling prices. In addition, the first quarter of 2024 includes $171 million of costs as part of its cost of revenue efficiency initiatives primarily related to liabilities incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024 with suppliers and accelerated depreciation in advance of the updates being made to our Normal Factory during the plant retooling upgrade. \n\n**Operating Expenses and Operating Loss:**\n\nTotal operating expenses in the first quarter of 2024 grew to $957 million, as compared to $898 million in the same period last year. \n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the company recognized a non-cash, stock-based compensation expense within operating expenses of $210 million as compared to $165 million in the first quarter of 2023 and depreciation and amortization expense within operating expenses of $70 million as compared to $58 million in the first quarter of 2023. \n\nRivian experienced a loss from operations in the first quarter of 2024 totaling $(1,484) million, as compared to $(1,433) million in the same period last year. \n\n**Net Loss:**\n\nRivian’s net loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $(1,446) million as compared to $(1,349) million for the same period last year. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA***\n\nAdjusted EBITDA* for the first quarter of 2024 was $(798) million as compared to $(1,020) million for the same period last year. \n\n**Capital Expenditures:**\n\nCapital expenditures for the first quarter of 2024 were $254 million, flat as compared to $283 million for the same period last year. \n\n**Liquidity:**\n\nRivian ended the first quarter of 2024 with $7,858 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Including the capacity under its asset-based revolving-credit facility, the company ended the first quarter of 2024 with $9,053 million of total liquidity. \n\nFor further information please see Rivian’s latest shareholder letter at [_www.rivian.com/investors_](/investors)\n\nThe company will host an audio webcast to discuss its results and provide a business update at 2:00pm PT / 5:00pm ET on Tuesday May 7, 2024.

We use the following non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors, because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is provided above. Reconciliations of forward- looking non-GAAP financial measures are not provided because we are unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, certain items, such as stock-based compensation expense and other costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted EBITDA defined as net loss before interest expense (income), net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other (expense) income, net, and special items. Our management team ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the ongoing operations. Special items is comprised of (i) cost of revenue efficiency initiatives which include costs incurred as we transition between major vehicle programs, cost incurred for negotiations with major suppliers regarding changing demand forecasts or design modifications, and other costs for enhancing capital and cost optimization of the Company (ii) restructuring expenses for significant actions taken by the Company, (iii) significant asset impairments and write-offs, and (iv) other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities.\n\nkey\n\nkey\n\nChat\n\nFirst Name\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail\n\nChats are transcribed for customer service and quality assurance purposes.

(NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced fourth quarter and year end 2023 financial results. The results reflect continued progress against key value drivers including ramping production, improving cost efficiency, and driving demand through successfully introducing new technologies and enhancing the customer experience. \n\nProduction and manufacturing progress continued to improve throughout 2023. On a full-year basis, the company produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122, more than doubling production and deliveries from 2022, and exceeded its initial production guidance by more than 7,000 vehicles. As expected, the fourth quarter of 2023 reflected greater discrepancy between production and deliveries when compared to prior quarters. Due to seasonality, EDV deliveries during the last quarter of each fiscal year are lower than previous quarters, while production remains continuous to maintain manufacturing efficiencies. Overall, there was a 147 percent increase in deliveries for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nThe company remains focused on cost efficiency, which has resulted in a meaningful improvement in operating efficiency in 2023, including a gross profit per delivered vehicle improvement of approximately $81,000, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. \n\nEconomic and geopolitical uncertainties and pressures, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, have informed Rivian’s expectations for 2024. With these market conditions, the company expects to produce 57,000 vehicles in 2024, in line with 2023 production. For 2024, the company is guiding towards capital expenditures of $1,750 million and an Adjusted EBITDA* of $(2,700) million. Rivian will continue its company-wide cost transformation program, which to date has resulted in meaningful reductions in total unit costs for both the R1 and EDV models through engineering design changes, commercial cost downs, and manufacturing efficiencies. Today, Rivian also announced it is reducing its salaried workforce by approximately 10%. \n\nRivian continues to drive demand by developing future platforms and technologies while enhancing the customer experience. In 2024, Rivian will open new spaces and increase demodrives – bringing the Rivian experience to more cities and customers than ever before. Furthermore, on March 7th Rivian will reveal its midsize platform, the R2, for the first time. \n\n**RJ Scaringe, Founder and CEO, Rivian said** : \n\n“We made great progress in 2023 despite economic headwinds, and we’re excited about the year ahead. We firmly believe in the full electrification of the automotive industry, but recognize in the short-term, the challenging macro-economic conditions. We are aggressively focused on driving cost efficiency throughout the business, achieving positive margins and building our go-to-market function to support our long-term growth. We are excited about the reveal of our next generation vehicle, R2, on March 7.” \n\n**Financial Highlights:**\n\n**Revenue:**\n\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1,315 million, driven by the delivery of 13,972 vehicles. For the year end December 31, 2023, total revenue was $4,434 million, supported by 50,122 total vehicle deliveries. Total revenue from the sale of regulatory credits was $39 million for the quarter and $73 million for the fiscal year 2023.\n\n**Gross Profit:**\n\nGross profit was $(606) million for the fourth quarter of 2023, an improvement from $(1,000) million for the same quarter in 2022.

For fiscal year 2023, loss from operations was $(5,739) million as compared to $(6,856) million in 2022. \n\n**Net Loss:**\n\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $(1,521) million as compared to $(1,723) million for the same period last year. For fiscal year 2023, net loss was $(5,432) million as compared to $(6,752) million in 2022. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA***\n\nAdjusted EBITDA* for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $(1,096) million as compared to $(1,461) million for the same period last year. The decreased Adjusted EBITDA* loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 was driven by lower gross profit losses.

While we may elect to update such forward-looking statements at some point in the future, except as may be required by law, we disclaim any obligation to do so, even if subsequent events cause our views to change. \n\n***Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we review financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (“non-GAAP financial measures”). We believe our non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors, because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is provided above. Reconciliations of forward- looking non-GAAP financial measures are not provided because we are unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, certain items, such as stock-based compensation expense and other costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted EBITDA defined as net loss before interest expense (income), net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and other (expense) income, net.\n\n**About Rivian:**\n\nRivian exists to create products and services that help our planet transition to carbon neutral energy and transportation.

[Get updates from Rivian](/connect/tell-us-more).\n\nkey\n\nkey\n\nkey\n\nkey\n\nkey\n\nkey\n\n[Investor Relations](/investors)\n\n# Faster, Leaner, More Efficient: \n\n# Rivian and Volkswagen Group Announce the Launch of their Joint Venture\n\n##### POSTED\n\nNOVEMBER 12, 2024\n\n##### POSTED\n\nNOVEMBER 12, 2024\n\n  * New joint venture (JV) with a total deal size of up to $5.8 billion combines the strength of both partners to create cutting-edge software and electronics architectures and scale the electric vehicle platforms and architectures.\n\n  * Engineers join the JV to create electric architecture and software for next generation Software Defined Vehicles (SDV).\n\n  * JV to be co-led by Wassym Bensaid (Rivian) and Carsten Helbing (Volkswagen Group).\n\n  * Oliver Blume, CEO Volkswagen Group: “The partnership with Rivian is the next logical step in strengthening our global competitive and technological position.”\n\n  * Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe: “We’re thrilled to see our technology being integrated in vehicles outside Rivian – this is an important enabler to help accelerate EV adoption.”\n\n\n\n\n**Irvine, California and Wolfsburg, Germany, November 12, 2024:** Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Volkswagen Group (XETRA: VOW / VOW3) entered into a transaction agreement to create their new joint venture (JV) – “Rivian and VW Group Technology, LLC”, known as Rivian and Volkswagen Group Technologies - with a total deal size of up to $5.8 billion, which is expected to start on November 13. Through this JV, the companies plan to bring next-generation electrical architecture and best-in-class software technology for both companies’ future electric vehicles, covering all relevant vehicle segments, including subcompact cars. It is highly complementary reflecting Rivian’s industry-leading software and electrical hardware technology as well as Volkswagen Group’s significant global scale and industry-leading vehicle platform competencies. \n\nThe joint venture will be headed by Wassym Bensaid (Rivian) and Carsten Helbing (Volkswagen Group). Developers and software engineers from both companies will join the joint venture. Teams will be based in Palo Alto, California initially, and three other sites are in development in North America and Europe. By combining their complementary expertise, the two companies plan to reduce development costs and scale new technologies more quickly. The goal is to be able to offer customers the best technological solution as early as possible.\n\n**Oliver Blume, CEO of Volkswagen Group, said:** “The partnership with Rivian is the next logical step in our software strategy. With its implementation, we will strengthen our global competitive and technological position. Today’s launch of the joint venture demonstrates the potential we want to leverage together in the coming years. We have a clear plan to offer our customers the best products and digital experiences at attractive prices through state-of-the-art development processes, innovative technological approaches, and a competitive cost base driven by synergies.”\n\n**RJ Scaringe, Founder and CEO of Rivian, said:** “Today’s finalization of our joint venture with Volkswagen Group marks an important step forward in helping transition the world to electric vehicles. We’re thrilled to see our technology being integrated in vehicles outside of Rivian, and we’re excited for the future. Rivian will continue to stay focused on creating best in class products and services that benefit our customers, helping to drive EV adoption.”\n\nThe JV will aim to use the existing Rivian electrical architecture and software technology stack, enabling the launch of Rivian’s R2 in the first half of 2026 and support the expected launch of the first models from the Volkswagen Group as early as 2027. \n\nThe JV will evolve this modular and flexible state-of-the-art electrical architecture. It will scale the technology across a wide range of price points and international markets, paving the way for new generations of high-volume vehicles that are fully capable of advanced automated driving functions and can integrate over-the-air updates (OTA) and upgrades. Customers will regularly receive new software updates, increasing the added value throughout the entire lifecycle of the vehicle. \n\nTeams from Rivian and Volkswagen Group have already successfully demonstrated the potential of their collaboration. In just twelve weeks, the team developed an initial drivable demonstrator vehicle. A Volkswagen Group vehicle has been retrofitted to run on Rivian’s proven in-market zonal hardware design and integrated technology platform. The drivable demonstrator vehicle not only highlights the scalability and integration capabilities of both companies, but it also further proves the concept for the joint venture. \n\n**Carsten Helbing, designated future co-CEO of the joint venture, said:** “We have made a successful start. Over the past few months, we’ve created the framework for bringing together the JV teams and pooling our resources. We are thrilled with the rapid progress we have achieved in the preparatory phase. This has laid the foundation for our future success.”\n\n**Wassym Bensaid, co-CEO of the joint venture, said:** “We’re excited to have entered into this joint venture, and welcome colleagues from both Rivian and Volkswagen Group to our new venture. The aim of the joint venture is to speed up innovation, increase scale and lower the cost of owning an EV for millions of people around the world. I’m hugely impressed by the work done already. While the demonstrator vehicle only scratches the surface of what is possible, it’s incredibly exciting to see what is possible when a new OEM and a legacy automaker work closely together.”\n\nVolkswagen Group plans to invest up to $5.8 billion in Rivian and the joint venture by 2027. An initial investment of $1 billion in the form of a convertible note has already been made. At closing of the Joint Venture, Volkswagen Group will invest about $1.3 billion as consideration for background IP licenses and a 50% equity stake in the joint venture. These investments also balance part of lower future costs identified during the technical feasibility tests and the sharing of costs for the inclusion of selected Volkswagen MEB models. The remaining investment of up to $3.5 billion is expected to come in the form of equity, convertible notes, and debt at future dates and based on clearly defined milestones. Further investments are tied to clear operational, technical, and financial milestones. The joint venture will operate as an independent company. \n\nThrough the partnership, Volkswagen Group aims to strengthen consumer benefits surrounding innovation, scalable platform and cost savings potential for both sides, as well as enhancing its R&D cost efficiency and thus sustainably reduce overall expenditure in this area.\n\n***\n\nRivian will host a public call for its investors at 2pm PT / 5pm ET today.

(NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced production and delivery totals for the quarter ending September 30, 2024. The company produced 13,157 vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois and delivered 10,018 vehicles during the same period. \n\nRivian is experiencing a production disruption due to a shortage of a shared component on the R1 and RCV platforms. This supply shortage impact began in Q3 of this year, has become more acute in recent weeks and continues. As a result of the supply shortage, Rivian is revising its annual production guidance to be between 47,000 and 49,000 vehicles. The company is also reaffirming its annual delivery outlook of low single digit growth as compared to 2023, which it expects to be in a range of 50,500 to 52,000 vehicles. \n\nThe company also announced that on November 7, 2024, after market close, it will release its third quarter 2024 financial results. Rivian will host an audio webcast at 5:00 p.m. ET the same day to discuss the performance and outlook for the business. The live webcast will be available at [_https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/2m7m5wyb_](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/2m7m5wyb) and a replay will be available for four weeks at [_www.rivian.com/investors_](https://www.rivian.com/investors) following the webcast. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements:**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding our annual production and delivery outlook; expectations regarding the current supply shortage; and expectations regarding our future growth. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “targets,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “predicts,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements use these words or expressions. \n\nWe have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the important factors discussed in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon information available to us as of the date of this press release, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. While we may elect to update such forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we disclaim any obligation to do so, even if subsequent events cause our views to change. \n\n**About Rivian:**\n\nRivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) is an American automotive manufacturer that develops and builds category-defining electric vehicles and accessories.

Rivian’s proven in-market zonal hardware design and integrated technology platform will serve as the foundation for future software development in the JV that will be applied to both companies’ electric vehicles. As part of the deal, Volkswagen Group has invested an initial $1 billion in Rivian, with $4 billion in planned additional investment, for a total expected deal size of $5 billion.\n\n**RJ Scaringe, Rivian Founder and CEO said** :_“The second quarter has been a defining one for Rivian. We have demonstrated strong execution during the quarter with the plant retooling upgrade and launch of second generation R1 vehicles. The changes we made to the R1 platform have allowed us to reduce material and manufacturing costs, while simultaneously improving performance and capabilities. As a testament to our industry-leading technology stack, we also recently announced our proposed JV with Volkswagen Group. The technical workstream to prepare the integration of Rivian electrical architecture and software technology stack into Volkswagen Group products are moving along very well, and we expect to close the joint venture in the fourth quarter of this year. The output from our joint venture will see Rivian’s technology in vehicles all around the world, helping to create more consumer choice and speed up the transition away from fossil fuels.”_ During the second quarter, the company introduced and started deliveries of the second generation R1 vehicles. The new R1 includes hundreds of design, engineering, and performance upgrades. These upgrades were made while also realizing significant improvements throughout the vehicle, positioning the platform for long-term profitability. Rivian also introduced two new in-house motor configurations; the Tri-Motor and the Quad-Motor. All motors on Rivian vehicles are now designed, engineered, and manufactured fully in-house. When compared against Rivian’s first generation outsourced Quad-Motor system, the new Ascent Quad and Tri-Motor configurations are significantly lower in cost, quicker, and provide superior range.\n\n**Financial Highlights:**\n\n**Revenues:** Total revenues for the second quarter of 2024 were $1,158 million, primarily driven by the delivery of 13,790 vehicles. Total revenues from the sale of regulatory credits were $17 million for the quarter.\n\n**Gross Profit:** Rivian generated negative gross profit of $(451) million for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to $(412) million for the second quarter of 2023. Cost of revenues for the second quarter of 2024 included $59 million, or approximately $4,278 per vehicle delivered in the quarter, of costs we do not anticipate being part of our long-term cost structure. This was made up of $33 million of cost of revenue efficiency initiatives primarily related to certain supplier liabilities incurred and $26 million of accelerated depreciation associated with the updates made to our Normal Factory during the plant retooling upgrade.\n\n**Operating Expenses and Operating Loss:** Total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2024 grew to $924 million, as compared to $873 million in the same period last year.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the company recognized a non-cash, stock-based compensation expense within operating expenses of $177 million as compared to $158 million in the second quarter of 2023 and depreciation and amortization expense within operating expenses of $71 million as compared to $63 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**Fair Value Loss on Convertible Note, Net** Fair value loss on convertible note, net reflects the issuance and subsequent mark-to-market valuation of the unsecured convertible note issued to Volkswagen International America, Inc. in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**Net Loss:** Rivian’s net loss for the second quarter of 2024 was $(1,457) million as compared to $(1,195) million for the same period last year.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)*** Adjusted EBITDA* for the second quarter of 2024 was $(860) million as compared to $(861) million for the same period last year.\n\n**Capital Expenditures:** Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2024 were $283 million, as compared to $255 million for the same period last year.\n\n**Liquidity:** Rivian ended the second quarter of 2024 with $7,867 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Including the capacity under its asset-based revolving-credit facility, the company ended the second quarter of 2024 with $9,179 million of total liquidity. The second quarter of 2024’s ending cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balance of $7,867 million includes $1 billion of an unsecured convertible note issued to Volkswagen International America, Inc. in association with the announcement of our planned joint venture with Volkswagen Group. The remaining $4 billion of potential incremental investment from Volkswagen Group is subject to the completion of the definitive agreements, the achievement of certain milestones, and the receipt of regulatory approvals.For further information please see Rivian’s latest shareholder letter at [www.rivian.com/investors](/investors)\n\nThe company will host an audio webcast to discuss its results and provide a business update at 2:00pm PT / 5:00pm ET on Tuesday August 6, 2024.

We believe our non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors, because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP is provided above. Reconciliations of forward- looking non-GAAP financial measures are not provided because we are unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, certain items, such as stock-based compensation expense and other costs and expenses that may be incurred in the future. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. \n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted EBITDA defined as net loss before interest expense (income), net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other (expense) income, net, and special items. Our management team ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the ongoing operations. Special items is comprised of (i) cost of revenue efficiency initiatives which include costs incurred as we transition between major vehicle programs, cost incurred for negotiations with major suppliers regarding changing demand forecasts or design modifications and other costs for enhancing capital and cost optimization of the Company (ii) restructuring expenses for significant actions taken by the Company, (iii) significant asset impairments and write-offs, and (iv) other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities, including fair value gain or loss on convertible note, net. \n\nkey\n\nkey\n\nChat\n\nFirst Name\n\nLast Name\n\nEmail\n\nChats are transcribed for customer service and quality assurance purposes.

(NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced its first quarter 2024 financial results. As previously announced, the company produced 13,980 vehicles and delivered 13,588, exceeding its outlook with a respective 49 percent and 71 percent increase over the same period last year. \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Rivian unveiled its new midsize platform which underpins R2, R3, and R3X. Rivian also had announced its intention to begin R2 production at its facility in Normal, Illinois. This is expected to enable start of production for R2 in the first half of 2026 and save over $2.25 billion, as compared to the original forecast of launching R2 production at Rivian’s Georgia site. \n\nLast week, the company announced an incentive package of up to $827 million from the State of Illinois to expand the plant, improve public infrastructure, and to create training programs for Rivian’s workforce.\n\n**RJ Scaringe, Rivian Founder and CEO said** : \n\n_“First-quarter results exceeded our outlook and set a strong foundation for the remainder of the year as we focus on continued demand generation, delivering cost and plant efficiency improvements, advancing R2 development, and driving towards profitability. We hit several milestones this quarter, including producing our 100,000th vehicle in Normal, successfully navigating the retooling upgrade, and unveiling our new midsize platform which underpins the R2, R3, and R3X. It is great to see the incredible support for our brand and upcoming products.”_\n\nThe recently completed plant retooling upgrade in Normal, Illinois introduced new technologies and cost-focused material changes into the R1 vehicle platform. It also provides the opportunity to improve manufacturing processes that enable the R1 line to run at an approximately 30 percent higher line rate. Furthermore, Rivian also recently transitioned to a new zonal network architecture reducing the number of electronic control units in its vehicle by approximately 60 percent, taking substantial costs out of its vehicles.\n\n**Financial Highlights:**\n\nThe first quarter of 2024 gross profit per vehicle delivered was $(38,784) which was negatively impacted by $9,346 per vehicle delivered, primarily related to various supplier and other costs incurred in advance of the new technology changes and parts integration into the R1 platform as part of its cost of revenue efficiency initiatives. As a result of the retooling upgrade, the company expects significant improvement in the material and conversion cost of its vehicles and remains confident in its path to achieving modest gross profit in the fourth quarter of this year. \n\n**Revenues:**\n\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2024 were $1,204 million, primarily driven by the delivery of 13,588 vehicles.

(NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced fourth quarter and year end 2023 financial results. The results reflect continued progress against key value drivers including ramping production, improving cost efficiency, and driving demand through successfully introducing new technologies and enhancing the customer experience. \n\nProduction and manufacturing progress continued to improve throughout 2023. On a full-year basis, the company produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122, more than doubling production and deliveries from 2022, and exceeded its initial production guidance by more than 7,000 vehicles. As expected, the fourth quarter of 2023 reflected greater discrepancy between production and deliveries when compared to prior quarters. Due to seasonality, EDV deliveries during the last quarter of each fiscal year are lower than previous quarters, while production remains continuous to maintain manufacturing efficiencies. Overall, there was a 147 percent increase in deliveries for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nThe company remains focused on cost efficiency, which has resulted in a meaningful improvement in operating efficiency in 2023, including a gross profit per delivered vehicle improvement of approximately $81,000, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. \n\nEconomic and geopolitical uncertainties and pressures, most notably the impact of historically high interest rates, have informed Rivian’s expectations for 2024. With these market conditions, the company expects to produce 57,000 vehicles in 2024, in line with 2023 production. For 2024, the company is guiding towards capital expenditures of $1,750 million and an Adjusted EBITDA* of $(2,700) million. Rivian will continue its company-wide cost transformation program, which to date has resulted in meaningful reductions in total unit costs for both the R1 and EDV models through engineering design changes, commercial cost downs, and manufacturing efficiencies. Today, Rivian also announced it is reducing its salaried workforce by approximately 10%. \n\nRivian continues to drive demand by developing future platforms and technologies while enhancing the customer experience. In 2024, Rivian will open new spaces and increase demodrives – bringing the Rivian experience to more cities and customers than ever before. Furthermore, on March 7th Rivian will reveal its midsize platform, the R2, for the first time. \n\n**RJ Scaringe, Founder and CEO, Rivian said** : \n\n“We made great progress in 2023 despite economic headwinds, and we’re excited about the year ahead. We firmly believe in the full electrification of the automotive industry, but recognize in the short-term, the challenging macro-economic conditions. We are aggressively focused on driving cost efficiency throughout the business, achieving positive margins and building our go-to-market function to support our long-term growth. We are excited about the reveal of our next generation vehicle, R2, on March 7.” \n\n**Financial Highlights:**\n\n**Revenue:**\n\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1,315 million, driven by the delivery of 13,972 vehicles.

Total revenue from the sale of regulatory credits was $39 million for the quarter and $73 million for the fiscal year 2023.\n\n**Gross Profit:**\n\nGross profit was $(606) million for the fourth quarter of 2023, an improvement from $(1,000) million for the same quarter in 2022.

The decreased Adjusted EBITDA* loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 was driven by lower gross profit losses.
