This proposed direct funding, when combined with investment tax credits available under the CHIPS and Science Act, could result in more than $200 million in total federal incentives as well as potential state and local incentives.\n\nThis proposed funding would support the expansion and modernization of both Infinera’s semiconductor capabilities in Silicon Valley, California and its advanced test and packaging capabilities in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, increasing the company’s existing domestic manufacturing capacity by an estimated factor of ten. Combined proposed funding for these two projects could create up to 1,700 manufacturing and construction jobs while strengthening America’s supply chain, economic and national security.\n\n“We are grateful for the bipartisan efforts under the CHIPS and Science Act to increase semiconductor fabrication and packaging in the U.S. and protect our national and economic security,” said David Heard, Infinera CEO. “The proposed CHIPS funding will enable us to better secure our supply chain and compete more effectively with foreign adversary nations. Our unique photonic semiconductors address the increased demand for bandwidth from consumers while opening new markets inside the data center driven by the explosive growth in AI workloads.”\n\nInfinera’s award of the proposed CHIPS funding would not have been possible without bipartisan support and partnerships with local, state and federal officials. This support is instrumental to the long-term success of these projects and the growth of advanced manufacturing in the U.S.\n\nAdditional Resource: [Biden-Harris Administration Announces Preliminary Terms with Infinera to Support Development of Semiconductor Technology Important for Communications and National Security](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=cu3kyDZx2UZXDxngJBvVxVhPZdA5GUbTPxUIh1N_Ok94LqiLJi_E2NAHc98mII48ihGiAv-tIpxjaF5SyXqDJr3GqLN7unt9ONbyEyO09O0A_8hTv7iTDDAELIoRtENo8KeUfv7odOPNPmaCo4DwDRJxoJg9BCuRJ9tdc6cicOTZ0ub2wfrTOorF7GEWDmZZxW8PWZfQA_KcEjWT9vDrb-2q-H47I7g7zzFHUA1K9JcsX13RYPmq41rJ73ELJlZQXYfjkYibRoAnOfwgQQtflOI2Qv_Vn5muK6umX9V7ydrJXBzfQBGD7aMVOMVjzlgIlqeKOxxb9BvwE4LbOVnvHkfFK4rzT7jsYJ9fN88YJbrXQii4vRzTF2Fojv1hdwYoR9nClffEYKBgVX-w2e8xU9qe00JfniZP_KIr4yBk__o=)\n\n_Contacts:_\n\n_Infinera Media:Anna VueTel. +1 (916) 595-8157[avue@infinera.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Y9bfblD1kZ6NwsBkPCB7qsaBN5BmWhB30b-ktRWzkpIN8kyDC4-85xoQN_qAA5ivK1OVPh1VgWgRXcWr487ZkQ_B89LphNb97VkvH0B2OwA=)_\n\n_Infinera Investors:Amitabh Passi, Head of Investor RelationsTel. +1 (669) 295-1489[apassi@infinera.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=b3Y3cCwizY6W95mB0JFDS2CeAbrMi98NqGTOefNqn6ioDyBI0Z77leok72QeTxUq-Xp7jlbsqoCk7Ket7u2dZTniAHk_lH3U075XSGqrTZ8=)_\n\n**About Infinera** Infinera is a global supplier of innovative [open optical networking](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zMdxAR0pxUKDQJkGeR7kqSGKJT-2RvjsqLkQCCEpf6oSQoi9IL_fwznZCkcu_SXMzVo62eWUCBx4yHmecf6OBmknOznx5VGr7ZlobcQKlMXw6KHRxBm_dlmZfGBjrj5y4CEQburt6Ll5kqziRLagwyQjJ7_kkv88ZRXqY6FIloL50rTl_F17pBXD3TgGIKFU0O-uukGNKeGc1Tl3STCkQN433swQZIGsLLzqac-sY_g=) solutions and advanced optical semiconductors that enable carriers, cloud operators, governments, and enterprises to scale network bandwidth, accelerate service innovation, and automate network operations.

(PSE: CNVRG), the leading fiber broadband and technology solutions provider in the Philippines, selected Infinera as its submarine line terminal equipment (SLTE) vendor for the fiber pairs over which Converge has been granted an Indefeasible Right of Use (IRU) on the Bifrost Cable System, using Infinera’s industry-leading GX Series Compact Modular Platform and its next-generation high-performance 1.2T [ICE7 optical engine](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tpQQn9Zh44UA99RSTAtJWRYrGVi5by0o5aYBqAAE6bRjLo1V-SwXG3R2NpYIl4_6raL-H6F0x-I6J8zLLf7Mutu80qGa-sjdBeY4_p_lJcQjGqEFdjV-wv3QXz3yFBQi).\n\nAdditionally, Converge will use Infinera’s solutions to modernize its nationwide terrestrial fiber network across the Philippines.\n\nKeppel and Converge have entered into agreements for the grant of an IRU to Converge for one fiber pair on the main trunk and the entire Davao branch of the Bifrost Cable System. Developed by Keppel, Meta, and Telin, the Bifrost Cable System is an end-to-end trans-Pacific cable system spanning over 15,000 km, connecting the west coast of North America via Guam with the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore. Converge is also the landing party for the Davao branch segment of the Bifrost Cable System and owns the cable landing station in Davao, located in the southern Mindanao region.\n\nConverge is the fastest-growing fiber broadband and Information and Communications Technology (ICT) solutions provider in the Philippines, with total fiber assets extending over 70,000 kilometers. It operates the biggest fiber-to-the-home network in the country, with total homes passed reaching 16 million.\n\nConverge selected Infinera’s solution based on Infinera’s proven track record in subsea networking with industry-leading reach and capacity performance. Leveraging Infinera’s subsea solution will enable Converge to monetize its fiber assets by delivering the highest capacity at the lowest cost over ultra-long distances.\n\nOnce deployed, Converge will benefit from the industry’s latest generation of advanced high-speed optics and 5-nm technology, enabling single wavelengths of up to 1.2T and improved capacity-reach. Infinera’s solution provides Converge with an operationally seamless solution including advanced spectrum sharing capabilities in a single platform that supports both ICE7 transponders and next-generation optical line system (OLS) capabilities.\n\n“We are excited to leverage the latest generation of Infinera’s technology for our terrestrial and subsea cable assets. Infinera provides the most advanced subsea networking solution with industry-leading capabilities including advanced power management,” said Dennis Anthony Uy, CEO and Co-Founder of Converge. “Leveraging Infinera’s innovative solution, Converge will be able to effectively scale to meet rapidly growing bandwidth demands across the Philippines and the entire Asia-Pacific region.”\n\n“By selecting Infinera’s ICE7 as the SLTE for the fiber pairs utilized by Converge in the Bifrost Cable System and to modernize its terrestrial backbone, Converge will benefit from the industry’s latest technology, enabling them to provide their customers with access to cost-effective, high-performance, and high-capacity services,” said David Heard, CEO at Infinera. “We are pleased to have been selected for the company’s growth and expansion, which underscores the value of Infinera’s innovative optical engine solutions and expertise in deploying critical networks globally.”\n\n_Contacts:_\n\n_Infinera Media: Anna VueTel. +1 (916) 595-8157[avue@infinera.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rM-T_gwvR1kNoRhvBddemNs2S40dJP9RnQ4Njzh49TFZYmfEK30epLXRR5RybaVUVSz5Zxv8FGc4QjDPI9XozMaYoOQPgqG8SIj-8gVfDAo=)_\n\n_Converge Media: Jay-Anne EncarnadoVP and Head of Corporate Communications and Public Relations[corpcomm@convergeict.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0rcF5v8uMeyctOIMrWp05VLBU0bXt1HKOiNNvmMc5YolvsMsh6bnA7W2USm4kKMJ4Ujxtec9mlMpcnX4S_9JQoQUmuOpc3kO41ilRTBICNo=) _\n\n_Infinera Investors:Amitabh Passi, Head of Investor RelationsTel. +1 (669) 295-1489[apassi@infinera.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4p4l5jRzubycp20h9tS-pbQ5zEIjzT_llqU06CvOyHdssBrn5lW5NbZAp9JD0i8JSQJlS0jB4axAqmlBeBLC2wp9n-QNNGT44aFjdApegNo=)_\n\n_Converge Investors:_ Owen OcampoVP and Head of Investor Relations[Investor.relations@convergeict.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=X07TS1LGTci0whOelc6mKV_h-9JBfMRO-sr7qSuewUgIQ1YdMwTSqjB9SfaqtZYcaOFBenbDIH_B5P23TYLF6Y7_fbnbUXB0PrpNWMfuraOil5B4gYZC_IYTafEh0EcKIwupUv3OMEKmloSk2yocQw==)\n\n**About Converge ICT Solutions** Converge Information and Communications Technology Solutions, Inc.

We present non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nNon-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to GAAP measures. In addition, the non-GAAP measures we use, as presented, may not be comparable to similar measures used by\nother companies. Infinera believes these adjustments are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of its underlying financial performance and also its prospects for the future and are considered by\nmanagement for the purpose of making operational decisions. See the Appendix to this presentation for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\n2\n© 2024 Infinera.
