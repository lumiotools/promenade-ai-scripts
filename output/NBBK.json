Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\n10/30/2024\n\nDownload(opens in new window)\n\nNEEDHAM, Mass., Oct. 30, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NB Bancorp, Inc. (the \"Company\") (Nasdaq Capital Market: **NBBK**), the holding company of Needham Bank (the \"Bank\"), today announced its third quarter 2024 financial results.\n\n**SELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2024**\n\n  * Net income of $8.4 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.5 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the prior quarter. Operating net income, excluding one-time charges, amounted to $13.1 million, or $0.33 per diluted share for the current quarter. One-time charges include:\n    * Loss on the sale of available-for sale securities amounting to $1.9 million;\n    * Tax expense and a modified endowment contract penalty related to the surrender of bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\") policies of $1.6 million, and;\n    * Tax expense related to a basis write-down of solar income tax credits of $2.5 million, partially offset by;\n    * Reversal of previously recognized amortization related to solar income tax credit investments during the first six months of the year, amounting to $913 thousand.\n  * Gross loans increased $151.8 million, or 3.7%, to $4.25 billion, from the prior quarter.\n  * Net interest margin increased 5 basis points to 3.51% during the current quarter from 3.46% in the prior quarter.\n  * A portfolio of available-for-sale securities was sold at a $1.9 million net loss during the current quarter, with the proceeds reinvested into higher-yielding securities, which were restructured to mitigate portfolio risk and increase yield. The securities sold had an average yield of 0.97% with remaining duration of 2.4 years and were reinvested into securities with an average yield of 4.27% and average duration of 4.1 years. The earn-back period on the loss from the sale of the available-for-sale securities is expected to be approximately 2.5 years. The newly purchased securities carry a lower risk weight than the securities sold, mitigating risk in the Bank's available-for-sale securities portfolio.\n  * During the current quarter, the Bank surrendered $46.7 million of existing BOLI policies that were earning an annualized yield of 3.08%. Prior to the surrender of the policies, the Bank took out an additional $50.0 million of BOLI policies, which are currently yielding 4.81%. As a result of the surrender of the BOLI policies, the Bank incurred $1.6 million of tax and penalty, which the Bank expects to earn back in less than 2 years. The insurance carriers have six months to pay out the surrendered policies, and as a result, the Bank expects BOLI to be at higher balances and to continue earning income related to the increase in cash surrender value until the proceeds are received, which will further shorten the earn-back period on the tax and penalty amount.\n  * During the current quarter, the Bank charged off $5.3 million of loans, including $4.0 million related to one non-owner-occupied commercial real estate office loan, which was a purchased participation loan. As a result of the deterioration of this loan, management engaged a third-party loan review firm to review our remaining real estate office loan portfolio, which was completed and did not result in any additional criticized loans or downgrades to our current risk ratings.\n  * Asset quality remains strong:\n    * Annualized net charge-offs increased forty-one basis points to 0.50% of average total loans during the current quarter from 0.09% of average total loans during the prior quarter. Non-performing loans decreased to $16.0 million, or 0.38% of total loans during the current quarter from $20.7 million, or 0.51% of total loans during the prior quarter.\n    * The increase in annualized net charge-offs and the decrease in non-performing loans was primarily due to the charge-off of a $4.0 million office participation loan during the quarter, along with the payoff of a $2.2 million construction loan at par.\n    * Provision for credit losses for the third quarter amounted to $2.6 million, a decrease from $3.7 million in the prior quarter, contributing to a decrease in the allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") of $252 thousand and decreasing the ACL as a percentage of total loans to 0.89%.\n  * During the quarter, the Bank adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-02, with a modified retrospective adoption reflected as of January 1, 2024, to record solar income tax credit investments under the proportional amortization method (\"PAM\"), whereby the solar income tax credit investments are amortized in proportion to the amount of overall benefits received from the investment. As a result of the adoption, the amortization of solar income tax credit investments where the credits were received in prior years was reflected as a retained earnings adjustment, which resulted in a $10.1 million reduction to retained earnings, along with a corresponding reduction in non-public investments. Additionally, $913 thousand of amortization expense related to these investments that was recorded during the first six months of 2024 was also reversed during the current quarter to apply retrospective treatment to the beginning of the year. The impact of adopting PAM on current quarter results amounted to $18.0 million in income tax expense, which included $2.5 million of a deferred tax liability related to the write-down of the basis of the investment. This was partially offset by a reduction in income tax expense of $17.3 million from the recognition of income tax credits during the quarter.\n  * Total deposits increased $124.9 million, or 3.2%, from the prior quarter. Brokered deposits increased by $29.9 million or 10.0% from the prior quarter, while the remaining $95.0 million increase represents core deposit growth of 2.6%, for the quarter.\n  * FHLB advances increased $55.5 million during the quarter, primarily in short-term advances, which were used to fund loan growth and the BOLI policy purchase.\n  * Borrowings and brokered deposits totaled 8.9% of total assets, an increase from 7.5% at the prior quarter end.\n  * Strong capital position of 14.9% shareholders' equity to total assets and 14.9% tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets.\n  * Book value per share and tangible book value per share were $17.50 and $17.48, respectively, which increased from $17.19 and $17.17, respectively in the prior quarter. The increase in tangible book value per share was due to net income for the current quarter of $8.4 million and a $4.0 million reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n\n\n\n\"We continued with another strong quarter, with loan growth of 3.7%, primarily funded by deposits, which grew 3.2% during the quarter. We have shown another quarter of strong, but disciplined loan growth, with the ability to self-fund from our continued growth in deposits. Operating net income was $0.33 per share for the quarter, excluding the one-time charges taken during the quarter, which is expected to help our earnings run rate going forward. While we took a large charge-off during the current quarter, we are confident that the credit quality in the rest of our portfolio remains strong. Our balance sheet remains a strength as we head into the fourth quarter and we are optimistic about our opportunities as we look to close out our first full year as a public company,\" said Joseph Campanelli, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Tangible book value per share grew $0.31 during the quarter, and the Company continues to be disciplined in our capital management.\"\n\n**BALANCE SHEET**\n\nTotal assets amounted to $5.00 billion as of September 30, 2024, representing an increase of $202.8 million, or 4.2%, from June 30, 2024.\n\n  * Cash and cash equivalents decreased $11.9 million, or 3.6%, to $317.0 million from $328.9 million, in the prior quarter as a result of loan growth outpacing deposit growth.\n  * Net loans increased to $4.21 billion, representing an increase of $152.0 million, or 3.7%, from the prior quarter as demand for new originations continued. The current quarter growth was primarily seen in construction and land development loans, which increased $88.5 million, or 15.3%, commercial real estate loans excluding multi-family loans, which increased $55.7 million or 4.6%, consumer loans, which increased $13.1 million, or 5.9%, and residential real estate loans, which increased $9.5 million, or 0.8%; offset partially by a decrease in commercial and industrial loans of $19.4 million, or 3.3%.\n  * BOLI assets increased to $101.7 million from $51.3 million, a $50.4 million, or 98.2%, increase from the prior quarter as a result of the BOLI transaction noted previously.\n  * Prepaid expenses and other assets increased $24.8 million, or 50.0%, to $74.6 million from $49.7 million, primarily from an increase in income tax receivable of $18.9 million, as a result of the solar income tax credits earned during the current quarter.\n  * Non-public investments decreased to $5.7 million from $16.1 million, a $10.4 million, or 64.8%, decrease from the prior quarter as a result of the amortization of solar income tax credit investments under PAM due to the adoption of ASU 2023-02, as described previously.\n  * Deposits totaled $4.04 billion representing an increase of $124.9 million, or 3.2%, from the prior quarter. The increase in deposits was the result of growth in customer deposits, primarily certificates of deposit, which increased $78.6 million, or 4.9%, from the prior quarter, along with money market accounts, which increased $68.6 million, or 7.1%. Additionally, brokered deposits increased $29.9 million, or 10.0%, from the prior quarter. The above increases were partially offset by decreases in the balances of non-interest-bearing deposits of $28.4 million, or 4.8%, and NOW accounts of $23.0 million, or 6.5%.\n  * FHLB borrowings increased to $116.3 million from $60.8 million, a $55.5 million, or 91.2%, increase during the current quarter as a result of the need to fund the BOLI transaction described previously.\n  * Shareholders' equity was $747.4 million, representing an increase of $13.1 million, or 1.8%, from the prior quarter, primarily as a result of $8.4 million of net income and a $4.0 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to interest rate changes during the current quarter.\n\n\n\n**NET INTEREST INCOME**\n\nNet interest income was $41.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $38.7 million for the prior quarter, representing an increase of $2.6 million, or 6.7%.\n\n  * The increase in interest income during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to increases in the average balance of loans, which contributed $3.4 million, and increases in the average rate on loans, which contributed $1.9 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in the average balance and average rate on short-term investments, which decreased interest income by $204 thousand and $164 thousand, respectively, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n  * The increase in interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by increases in the average balance of certificates of deposit, which increased interest expense by $1.3 million, increases in the average balance of money market accounts, which increased interest expense by $408 thousand and increases in the average rate on money market accounts, which increased interest expense by $151 thousand.\n\n\n\n**NONINTEREST INCOME**\n\nNoninterest income was $1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.0 million for the prior quarter, representing a decrease of $1.7 million, or 57.6%.\n\n  * Net loss on sale of available-for-sale securities increased $1.9 million, or 100.0%, during the quarter as a result of the loss trades executed to restructure the securities portfolio for higher yields and lower risk.\n  * Swap contract income was $375 thousand, compared to $265 thousand in the prior quarter, representing an increase of $110 thousand, or 41.5%, due to increased swap contract originations.\n  * Customer service fee income was $2.0 million, compared to $1.9 million in the prior quarter, representing an increase of $91 thousand, or 4.9%, as a result of a higher volume of fees earned during the current quarter.\n\n\n\n**NONINTEREST EXPENSE**\n\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $24.6 million, representing a decrease of $1.6 million, or 6.2%, from the prior quarter.\n\n  * General and administrative expenses decreased $1.6 million, or 93.2%, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of the adoption of ASU 2023-02 under the PAM method which reclassified the amortization of solar tax credit investments from general and administration expenses to income tax expense.\n  * Salaries and employee benefits were $17.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of $456 thousand, or 2.7%, from the prior quarter, primarily due to increased employee compensation of $308 thousand, increased bonus expense of $194 thousand and additional ESOP compensation expense of $134 thousand; partially offset by reductions in 401(k) matching expenses of $100 thousand and employee benefits expenses of $68 thousand.\n  * Director and professional service fees decreased $275 thousand during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of decreased appraisal fees of $142 thousand and decreased professional services expenses of $97 thousand.\n  * Marketing and charitable contributions decreased $253 thousand during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of decreased public relations costs of $94 thousand, decreased broadcast media costs of $48 thousand and decreased promotional costs of $45 thousand.\n\n\n\n**INCOME TAXES**\n\nIncome tax expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $7.0 million, representing a $4.6 million increase, or 195.4%, from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the adoption of PAM under ASU 2023-02. The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 45.5%, compared to 20.0% in the prior quarter. The primary driver of the increase in the effective tax was the income tax expense for the basis reduction on the solar income tax credits, which resulted in $2.5 million of income tax expense, along with the BOLI-related tax and penalty, which amounted to $1.6 million of additional tax expense. Excluding these two items, the effective tax rate would have been 18.8%.\n\n**COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO**\n\nCommercial real estate loans increased $60.8 million, or 4.1%, to $1.55 billion, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n  * Cannabis facility commercial real estate loans increased $49.1 million, or 18.3%, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company's cannabis facility commercial real estate portfolio is secured entirely by the underlying commercial real estate of the borrower operation. The vast majority of the loan portfolio balances have a loan-to-value ratio of 65% or lower, with appraisal reports taking a blended approach (using both cannabis and non-cannabis use real estate sales comparables, which are generally more conservative). The portfolio has geographic dispersion, with lower dollar exposure loans remaining local and larger dollar exposure loans generally tied to multi-state operators with a more national footprint. All cannabis facility loan relationships were pass-rated and current at the end of the current quarter.\n  * The Company's $272.6 million multi-family real estate loan portfolio consists of high-quality, performing loans primarily located in the Greater Boston area, primarily all of which are adjustable-rate loans.\n  * The Company's $215.4 million office portfolio consists principally of suburban Class A and B office space used as medical and traditional offices. The portfolio does not consist of high-rise towers located in Boston.\n\n\n\n**ASSET QUALITY**\n\n  * The ACL amounted to $37.6 million as of September 30, 2024, or 0.89% of total gross loans, compared to $37.9 million, or 0.92% of total loans at June 30, 2024. The Company recorded provisions for credit losses of $2.6 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $3.7 million for the prior quarter, which included a provision of $5.0 million for loans and a release of $2.4 million for unfunded commitments in the current quarter. The provision of $5.0 million for credit losses on loans was mainly the result of the $4.0 million charge-off of one commercial real estate office participation loan coupled with loan growth during the current quarter. The release of $2.4 million for unfunded commitments was mainly the result of reduced qualitative factors and reduced balances of unfunded construction loan commitments.\n  * Non-performing loans totaled $16.0 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $4.7 million, or 22.8%, from $20.7 million at the end of the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to one commercial real estate office participation loan, which had previously been on non-accrual at June 30, 2024, being charged off during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, along with one construction loan amounting to $2.2 million that paid off during the quarter.\n  * During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded total net charge-offs of $5.2 million, or 0.50% of average total loans on an annualized basis, compared to $878 thousand, or 0.09% of average total loans on an annualized basis, in the prior quarter. The increase in net charge-offs during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was due to a $4.0 million charge-off of one commercial real estate office participation loan and $1.3 million of purchased consumer loan charge-offs.\n  * The Company's loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial real estate and multi-family loans, one-to-four-family residential real estate loans, construction and land development loans, commercial and industrial loans and consumer loans. These loans are primarily made to individuals and businesses located in our primary lending market area, which is the Greater Boston metropolitan area and surrounding communities in Massachusetts, eastern Connecticut, southern New Hampshire and Rhode Island.\n\n\n\n**ABOUT NB BANCORP, INC.**\n\nNB Bancorp, Inc.

The Company's management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a Company's financial condition and therefore, such information is useful to investors. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nStatements in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We may also make forward-looking statements in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), in our annual reports to our stockholders, in press releases and other written materials, and in oral statements made by our officers, directors or employees. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of the words \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"estimate,\" \"assume,\" \"outlook,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" and other expressions that predict or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters.\n\nAlthough the Company believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions, they are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. You should exercise caution in interpreting and relying on forward-looking statements because they are subject to significant risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond the Company's control. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, changes in general business and economic conditions on a national basis and in the local markets in which the Company operates, including changes which adversely affect borrowers' ability to service and repay loans; changes in customer behavior due to political, business and economic conditions, including inflation and concerns about liquidity; turbulence in the capital and debt markets; reductions in net interest income resulting from interest rate volatility as well as changes in the balances and mix of loans and deposits; changes in interest rates and real estate values; changes in loan collectability and increases in defaults and charge-off rates; decreases in the value of securities and other assets, adequacy of credit loss reserves, or deposit levels necessitating increased borrowing to fund loans and investments; changing government regulation; competitive pressures from other financial institutions; changes in legislation or regulation and accounting principles, policies and guidelines; cybersecurity incidents, fraud, natural disasters, and future pandemics; the risk that the Company may not be successful in the implementation of its business strategy; the risk that intangibles recorded in the Company's financial statements will become impaired; changes in assumptions used in making such forward-looking statements;\n\nand the other risks and uncertainties detailed in the Company's Form 10-K and updated by our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other filings submitted to the SEC. These statements speak only as of the date of this release and the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this communication or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\n\n**NB BANCORP, INC.**  \n---  \n**SELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**

(the “Company”), consummated its mutual to stock conversion\nand the Company consummated its related stock offering. In the offering, the Company sold 40,997,500 shares of common\nstock, par value $0.01 per share, at a per share price of $10.00 for gross offering proceeds of $410.0 million. Additionally, the\nCompany contributed 1,708,229 shares and $2.0 million in cash to the Needham Bank Charitable Foundation (the\n“Foundation”). The shares of the Company’s common stock sold in the offering began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market\non December 28, 2023 under the symbol “NBBK.”\nIn connection with the conversion, liquidation accounts were established by the Company and the Bank in an aggregate\namount equal to (i) the MHC’s ownership interest in the shareholders’ equity of NB Financial, Inc. as of the date of the latest\nstatement of financial condition included in the Company’s definitive prospectus dated October 12, 2023, plus (ii) the value of\nthe net assets of the MHC as of the date of the MHC’s latest statement of financial condition before the consummation of the\nConversion (excluding the MHC’s ownership interest in NB Financial, Inc.).\nEach eligible account holder and supplemental eligible account holder is entitled to a proportionate share of the\nliquidation accounts in the unlikely event of a liquidation of (i) the Company and the Bank or (ii) the Bank, and only in such\nevents. This share will be reduced if the eligible account holder’s or supplemental account holder’s deposit balance falls below\nthe amounts on the date of record and will cease to exist if the account is closed. The liquidation account will never be\nincreased despite any increase after conversion in the related deposit balance.\nThe Bank may not pay a dividend on its capital stock if the effect thereof would cause retained earnings to be reduced\nbelow the liquidation account amount or regulatory capital requirements.\nNote 2 – Basis of Presentation\nThe Company’s accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and\nwith the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain information and footnote\ndisclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed\nor omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The consolidated financial statements of NB Bancorp, Inc. (referred to\nherein as the “Company,\" “we,” “us,” or “our”) include the balances and results of operations of the Company and the Bank,\nits wholly-owned subsidiary, as well as the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, Needco-op Investment Corporation, Inc., 1892\nInvestments LLC and Eaton Square Realty LLC. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments\nnecessary to present fairly the Company's financial position as of September 30, 2024 and the results of operations and cash\nflows for the interim periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. All interim amounts have not been audited, and the results\nof operations for the interim periods herein are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the\nfiscal year.\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and accompanying notes thereto included in the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Company qualifies as an emerging growth company (“EGC”) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of\n2012 and has elected to defer the adoption of new or revised accounting standards until the nonpublic company effective\ndates. As such, the Company will adopt standards on the nonpublic company effective dates until such time that we no longer\nqualify as an EGC.\n6\nTable of Contents\nRelevant standards that were adopted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-02, Investments–Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for\nInvestments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method (“ASU 2023-02”). This update permits\nreporting entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the\nincome tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method (“PAM”) if the following conditions are met:\n● It is probable that the income tax credits allocable to the tax equity investor will be available;\n● The tax equity investor does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial\npolicies of the underlying project;\n● Substantially all of the projected benefits are from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. Projected\nbenefits include income tax credits, other income tax benefits, and other non-income-tax-related benefits. The\nprojected benefits are determined on a discounted basis, using a discount rate that is consistent with the cash flow\nassumptions used by the tax equity investor in making its decision to invest in the project;\n● The tax equity investor’s projected yield based solely on the cash flows from the income tax credits and other\nincome tax benefits is positive; and\n● The tax equity investor is a limited liability investor in the limited liability entity for both legal and tax purposes,\nand the tax equity investor’s liability is limited to its capital investment.\nUnder existing accounting standards, PAM is allowable only for equity investments in low-income-housing tax credit\nstructures. Under PAM, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax credits and other\nincome tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the\nincome statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). Updates made by ASU 2023-02 allow a reporting entity to\nmake an accounting policy election to apply PAM on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis beyond just low-\nincome-housing tax credits. The Company has made an accounting policy election to account for its investments in solar\nincome tax credit investments using PAM. The Company adopted ASU 2023-02 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024,\nwith a modified retrospective adoption reflected as of January 1, 2024, which resulted in a $10.2 million reduction in retained\nearnings and nonpublic investments.\nCertain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nSubsequent events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before consolidated financial\nstatements are issued. Recognized subsequent events are events or transactions that provide additional evidence about\nconditions that existed at the date of the consolidated balance sheet, including the estimates inherent in the process of\npreparing consolidated financial statements. Non-recognized subsequent events are events that provide evidence about\nconditions that did not exist at the date of the consolidated balance sheet but arose after that date.\nNote 3 – Securities\nThe Company's available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. For available-for-sale securities in an unrealized\nloss position, management will first evaluate whether there is intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that the Company\nwill be required to sell a security prior to anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria are met, the\nCompany will record a write-down of the security's amortized cost basis to fair value through income. For those available-for-\nsale securities which do not meet the intent or requirement to sell criteria, management will evaluate whether the decline in\nfair value is a result of credit related matters or other factors. In performing this assessment, management considers the\ncreditworthiness of the issuer including whether the security is guaranteed by the U.S. Federal Government or other\ngovernment agency, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, and changes in credit rating during the period,\namong other factors. If this assessment indicates the existence of credit losses, the security will be written down to fair value,\nas determined by a discounted cash flow analysis. To the extent the estimated cash flows do not support the amortized cost,\nthe deficiency is considered to be due to credit loss and is recognized in earnings.\n7\nTable of Contents\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses\nare charged against the allowance when the uncollectibility of a security is confirmed, or when either of the aforementioned\ncriteria surrounding intent or requirement to sell have been met.\nSecurities have been classified on the consolidated balance sheets according to management’s intent. The following\ntables summarize the amortized cost, allowance for credit losses, and fair value of securities and their corresponding amounts\nof unrealized gains and losses at the dates indicated:\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Allowance for\nCost Gain Loss Credit Losses Fair Value\nSeptember 30, 2024 (in thousands)\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 54,935 $ 259 $ (328) $ — $ 54,866\nU.S. Government agencies 6,006 29 — — 6,035\nAgency mortgage-backed securities 32,645 — (1,598) — 31,047\nAgency collateralized mortgage obligations 11,507 161 (91) — 11,577\nCorporate bonds 95,722 116 (6,655) — 89,183\nMunicipal obligations 10,089 — (256) — 9,833\nTotal $ 210,904 $ 565 $ (8,928) $ — $ 202,541\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Allowance for\nCost Gain Loss Credit Losses Fair Value\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in thousands)\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 66,874 $ 27 $ (2,549) $ — $ 64,352\nAgency mortgage-backed securities 13,154 5 (1,729) — 11,430\nAgency collateralized mortgage obligations 2,987 — (569) — 2,418\nCorporate bonds 101,244 5 (9,014) — 92,235\nMunicipal obligations 20,010 — (980) — 19,030\nTotal $ 204,269 $ 37 $ (14,841) $ — $ 189,465\nThe Company did not record a provision for estimated credit losses on any available-for-sale securities for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024.

These unrealized losses relate to changes in market interest rates since acquiring the\nsecurities. As management has the intent and ability to hold available-for-sale debt securities until maturity or cost recovery,\nno allowance for credit losses on securities is deemed necessary as of September 30, 2024.\n9\nTable of Contents\nNote 4 – Loans Receivable, Allowance for Credit Losses and Credit Quality\nLoans Receivable\nLoans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until loan maturity or pay-off\nare reported as held-for-investment at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge-offs and net of any deferred\nfees (including purchase accounting adjustments) and origination costs (collectively referred to as “amortized cost”). For\noriginated loans, loan fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized into interest income over the\ncontractual life of the loan using the level-yield method. When a loan is paid off, the unamortized portion is recognized in\ninterest income. Loans are generally placed into nonaccrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to either\nprincipal or interest or when, in the opinion of management, the collection of principal and/or interest is in doubt. A loan\nremains in nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest or past due less than 90 days\nand the borrower demonstrates the ability to pay and remain current. When cash payments are received, they are applied to\nprincipal first, then to accrued interest. It is the Company’s policy not to record interest income on nonaccrual loans until\nprincipal has become current. In certain instances, accruing loans that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest\nmay not go on nonaccrual status if the Company determines that the loans are well-secured and are in the process of\ncollection.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”) represents management’s best estimate of credit losses over the remaining\nlife of the loan portfolio. Loans are charged-off against the ACL when management believes the loan balance is no longer\ncollectible. This determination is made based on management's review of specific facts and circumstances of the individual\nloan, including the expected cash flows to repay the loan, the value of the collateral and the ability and willingness of any\nguarantors to perform. Subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are recorded as increases to the ACL. The\nprovision for credit losses on loans is an amount sufficient to bring the ACL to an estimated balance that management\nconsiders adequate to absorb lifetime expected losses in the Company’s held-for-investment loan portfolio. The ACL is a\nvaluation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on\nthe loans.\nManagement’s determination of the adequacy of the ACL under FASB ASC 326 – Financial Instruments – Credit\nLosses is based on an evaluation of the composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, historical loan loss\nexperience, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and other risk factors.\nThe Company uses a third-party Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model as part of its estimation of the ACL\non a quarterly basis. Loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively assessed within pools (or segments). Loss\nestimates within the collectively assessed population are based on a combination of pooled assumptions and loan-level\ncharacteristics. The Company has determined that using federal call codes is an appropriate loan segmentation methodology,\nas it is generally based on risk characteristics of a loan’s underlying collateral. Using federal call codes also allows the\nCompany to utilize and assess publicly available external information when developing its estimate of the ACL.\nThe weighted average remaining maturity (“WARM”) method is the primary credit loss estimation methodology used\nby the Company and involves estimating future cash flows and expected credit losses for pools of loans using their expected\nremaining weighted average life.\nIn applying future economic forecasts, the Company utilizes a forecast period of up to two years. Historical loss rates\nused in the quantitative model are primarily derived using both the Bank’s data, supplemented with peer bank data obtained\nfrom publicly available sources. Management also considers qualitative adjustments when estimating credit losses to take into\naccount the model’s quantitative limitations. Qualitative adjustments to quantitative loss factors, either negative or positive,\nmay include considerations of economic conditions, volume and severity of past due loans, value of underlying collateral,\nexperience, depth, and ability of management, and concentrations of credit.\n10\nTable of Contents\nFor those loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, the Company evaluates the ACL needs on an individual\n(or loan by loan) basis. This population of individually evaluated loans (or loan relationships with the same primary source of\nrepayment) is determined on a quarterly basis and consists of: loans with a risk rating of substandard or worse and a balance\nexceeding $500,000, or loan terms differing significantly from other pooled loans. In accordance with the Company’s policy,\nnon-accrual residential real estate loans that are below $500,000 and well secured (loan-to-value <60%) are excluded from\nindividually evaluated loans.\nMeasurement of credit loss is based on the expected future cash flows of an individually evaluated loan, discounted\nat the loan’s effective interest rate, or measured on an observable market value, if one exists, or the estimated market value of\nthe collateral underlying the loan, discounted to consider estimated costs to sell the collateral for collateral-dependent loans. If\nthe net value is less than the loan’s amortized cost, a specific reserve in the ACL is recorded, which is charged-off in the\nperiod when management believes the loan balance is no longer collectible.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into commitments to extend credit. Such financial\ninstruments are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they are funded. The credit risk associated with these\ncommitments is evaluated in a manner similar to the ACL on loans. The reserve for unfunded commitments is included in\nother liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLoans consist of the following as of the dates stated:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAmount Percent Amount Percent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOne-to-four-family residential $ 1,123,997 26.42%$ 1,097,486 28.18%\nHome equity 109,946 2.58% 97,270 2.50%\nTotal residential real estate 1,233,943 29.00% 1,194,756 30.68%\nCommercial real estate 1,279,954 30.09% 1,169,859 30.05%\nMulti-family residential 272,561 6.41% 209,982 5.39%\nTotal commercial real estate 1,552,515 36.50% 1,379,841 35.44%\nConstruction and land development 666,936 15.67% 622,823 15.99%\nCommercial and industrial 566,934 13.32% 491,918 12.63%\nTotal commercial 2,786,385 65.49% 2,494,582 64.06%\nConsumer, net of premium/discount 234,461 5.51% 204,871 5.26%\nTotal loans 4,254,789 100.00% 3,894,209 100.00%\nDeferred fees, net (5,715) (4,930)\nAllowance for credit losses (37,605) (32,222)\nNet loans $ 4,211,469 $ 3,857,057\nIncluded in the above are approximately $458.0 million and $365.9 million in loans to borrowers in the cannabis\nindustry at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

These loans are starting to show signs of\npotential weakness and are being closely monitored by management.\nLoans rated 7: Loans in this category are considered “substandard”. Generally, a loan is considered substandard if it\nis inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or the collateral pledged.\nThere is a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the weakness is not corrected. Non-accrual\nresidential real estate loans that are well secured (LTV<60%) are not considered to warrant a downgrade to a\nsubstandard risk rating. Non-accrual commercial loans are downgraded to a substandard risk rating.\n13\nTable of Contents\nLoans rated 8: Loans in this category are considered “doubtful”. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses\ninherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or\nliquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and improbable.\nLoans rated 9: Loans in this category are considered uncollectible (“loss”) and of such little value that their\ncontinuance as loans is not warranted.\nOn an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Company reviews the accuracy of risk ratings for all commercial\nreal estate, construction and land development loans, and commercial and industrial loans based on various ongoing\nperformance characteristics and supporting information that is provided from time to time by commercial borrowers.\nAnnually, the Company engages an independent third-party to review a significant portion of loans within these segments.\nManagement uses the results of these reviews as part of its annual review process.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost of loans receivable by internal risk grade by year of origination as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.

experiencing financial difficulty to understand the\neffectiveness of its loan modification efforts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company modified one\nparticipation commercial real estate loan with an amortized cost basis of $6.2 million, or 0.01% of total commercial real estate\nloans, through an interest rate reduction and maturity extension. The modified loan experienced a $4.0 million charge-off\nduring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from a shortfall in the projected sale price of the\nunderlying real estate collateral. The Company did not modify any loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during\nthe three months ended September 30, 2024 nor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNote 5 – Employee Benefits\nEmployee Pension Plan – The Company provided pension benefits through a defined benefit plan maintained with\nthe Co-operative Banks Employees Retirement Association (“CBERA”) (the “Plan”). The Plan was a multi-employer plan\nwhereby the contributions by each bank are not restricted to provide benefits to the employees of the contributing bank;\ntherefore, the Company is not required to recognize the funded status of the plan on its consolidated balance sheet and need\nonly accrue for any quarterly contributions due and payable on demand, or any withdrawal liabilities assessed by CBERA if\nthe Company intended to withdraw from the Plan.\nThe Company determined to freeze benefit accruals and withdraw from the CBERA Plan as of December 31, 2023.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, an expense of $390,000 was recorded to reflect an increase in the liability\nrelated to the withdrawal from the Plan. The increase was primarily driven by final computations for estimated payouts to\nparticipants. In March 2024, the final increase to reflect the withdrawal liability was determined to be $390,000. The\nCompany accrued for this amount at March 31, 2024 and withdrew from the Plan in the second quarter of 2024. The Company\nis in the process of liquidating the Plan.\nDirector Pension Plan – The Company has a director defined benefit pension plan (“Director Pension Plan”),\ncovering directors who were in service prior to 2023 and have met the plan’s vesting requirements. The Company’s liabilities\nfor the Director Pension Plan are calculated by an independent actuary who uses the “projected unit credit” actuarial method\nto determine the normal cost and actuarial liability. The liability for the Director Pension Plan amounted to $5.9 million and\n$5.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is recorded on the consolidated balance\nsheets. The expense under this plan (recorded in salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statements of income)\napproximated $181,000 and $283,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $542,000\nand $849,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company records an estimate of net periodic pension cost for the director pension plan to accrued retirement\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheet on a quarterly basis. Equity adjustments, to accumulated other comprehensive\nloss, in conjunction with the pension plan are recorded by the Company annually upon receipt of the independent actuarial\nreport.\n18\nTable of Contents\nDeferred Compensation Plans – During 2014, the Company put into place an unfunded, defined contribution, Non-\nqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (“Deferred Comp Plan”) for select employees of the Company.\nThe Deferred Comp Plan was provided to key management of the Company and results in 5% - 20% of the\nemployee’s then current base salary being credited to the participant’s account annually, subject to increases in annual base\ncompensation and the possibility of additional discretionary contributions.\nThe employees vest at varying dates in accordance with each individual’s deferred compensation participation\nagreement; however, all key officers will be fully vested upon the attainment of age 65.\nThe obligations under these plans are included in accrued retirement liabilities on the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheets and approximated $2.6 million and $2.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The expense under these plans (recorded in salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statements of\nincome) approximated $100,000 and $89,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and\n$299,000 and $266,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nLong-Term Incentive Plan – In January 2020, the Company put into place a long-term incentive plan for certain\nmembers of its management team where benefits are awarded annually on a discretionary basis and cliff vest after three years.\nUnder this plan, individuals are granted “phantom shares” and benefits are accrued based upon the projected growth of the\nBank’s capital. The obligations under this plan are included in accrued retirement liabilities on the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheets and approximated $13.5 million and $11.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The expense under this plan (recorded in salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statements of\nincome) approximated $1.8 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nand $5.0 million and $3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n401(k) Plan – The Company has an employee tax deferred incentive plan (the “401(k) plan”) under which the\nCompany makes voluntary contributions within certain limitations. All employees who meet specified age and length of\nservice requirements are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan.\nThe amount contributed by the Company to the 401(k) Plan is included in salaries and employee benefits in the\nconsolidated statements of income. The amounts contributed to the 401(k) plan for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 were $626,000 and $559,000, respectively, and $2.0 million and $1.5 million for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nEmployment and Change in Control Agreements – The Company entered into employment agreements with the\nChief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer that renew for one additional year each January 1st. During 2024, the\nCompany entered into Change in Control agreements with certain executive officers, which provide severance payments in the\nevent of the executive’s involuntary or constructive termination of employment, including upon a termination following a\nchange in control as defined in the agreements.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan – As part of the Initial Public Offering (\"IPO\") completed on December 27, 2023,\nthe Bank established a tax-qualified Employee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\") to provide eligible employees the opportunity\nto own Company shares. The ESOP borrowed $47.2 million from the Company to purchase 3,416,458 common shares on the\nopen market. The loan is payable in annual installments over 20 years at an interest rate of 8.50%. As the loan is repaid to the\nCompany, shares are released and allocated proportionally to eligible participants on the basis of each participant’s\nproportional share of compensation relative to the compensation of all participants. The unallocated ESOP shares are pledged\nas collateral on the loan.\nThe Company accounts for its ESOP in accordance with FASB ASC 718-40, Compensation – Stock Compensation.\nUnder this guidance, unreleased shares are deducted from shareholders’ equity as unearned ESOP shares on the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets.\n19\nTable of Contents\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense equal to the fair value of the ESOP shares during the periods in which\nthey are committed to be released. To the extent that the fair value of the Company’s ESOP shares differs from the cost of such\nshares, the difference will be credited or debited to shareholders' equity.\nAs the loan is internally leveraged, the loan receivable from the ESOP to the Company is not reported as an asset nor is\nthe debt of the ESOP shown as a liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Total compensation expense\nrecognized in connection with the ESOP was $762,000 and $2.0 million for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively. The Company did not recognize any compensation expense related to the ESOP for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The following table presents share information held by the ESOP:\nAs of\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAllocated shares — —\nShares committed to be released 127,766 —\nUnallocated shares 3,288,692 1,000,000\nTotal shares 3,416,458 1,000,000\nFair value of unallocated shares $ 61,038 $ 13,400\nNote 6 – Fair Value Measurements\nASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement – Overall (“ASC 820-10”), provides a framework for measuring fair value under\nU.S. GAAP. This guidance also allows the Company the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent\nmeasurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis.\nIn accordance with ASC 820-10, the Company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value\nin three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to\ndetermine fair value.\nLevel 1 – Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange.\nValuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or\nliabilities.\nLevel 2 – Valuations for assets and liabilities traded in less active dealer or broker markets. Valuations are obtained\nfrom third party pricing services for identical or comparable assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 – Valuations for assets and liabilities that are derived from other methodologies, including option pricing\nmodels, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques, and are not based on market exchange, dealer, or broker\ntraded transactions. Level 3 valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections in determining the fair value\nassigned to such assets and liabilities.\nA financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to\nthe fair value measurement.\nA description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value, as well as the general\nclassification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. These valuation methodologies were\napplied to all of the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value for September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAvailable-for-sale securities – Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within\nLevel 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities would include highly liquid government bonds (such as U.S. Treasuries),\nmortgage products and exchange traded equities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by\nusing pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows.\n20\nTable of Contents\nLevel 2 securities would include U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed agency securities, obligations of states and\npolitical subdivisions, and certain corporate, asset-backed and other securities. In certain cases where there is limited activity\nor less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.\nDerivative arrangements – The fair values of derivative arrangements are estimated by the Company using a third-\nparty derivative valuation expert who relies on Level 2 inputs, namely discounted cash flow models to determine a fair value\nby calculating a settlement termination value with the counterparty.\nAssets measured and reported at estimated fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:\nSeptember 30, 2024 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nAssets: (in thousands)\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 54,866 $ — $ — $ 54,866\nU.S. Government agencies — 6,035 — 6,035\nAgency mortgage-backed securities — 31,047 — 31,047\nAgency collateralized mortgage obligations — 11,577 — 11,577\nCorporate bonds — 80,227 8,956 89,183\nMunicipal obligations — 9,833 — 9,833\nTotal available-for-sale debt securities $ 54,866 $ 138,719 $ 8,956 $ 202,541\nDerivative assets $ — $ 26,912 $ — $ 26,912\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities $ — $ 26,922 $ — $ 26,922\nDecember 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nAssets: (in thousands)\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 64,352 $ — $ — $ 64,352\nAgency mortgage-backed securities — 11,430 — 11,430\nAgency collateralized mortgage obligations — 2,418 — 2,418\nCorporate bonds — 82,367 9,868 92,235\nMunicipal obligations — 19,030 — 19,030\nTotal available-for-sale debt securities $ 64,352 $ 115,245 $ 9,868 $ 189,465\nDerivative assets $ — $ 27,769 $ — $ 27,769\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities $ — $ 27,786 $ — $ 27,786\nThe Company had no purchases, sales, transfers or changes in fair value of level 3 assets during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company may also be required from time to time to measure certain other assets on a non-recurring basis in\naccordance with U.S. GAAP. Any adjustments to fair value usually result in write-downs of individual assets.\nCollateral-Dependent Loans – Collateral-dependent loans with specific reserves are carried at fair value, which\nequals the estimated market value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. Collateral may be in the form of real estate or\nbusiness assets including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable.\nA loan may have multiple types of collateral; however, the majority of the Company’s loan collateral is real estate.\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe value of real estate collateral is generally determined utilizing a market valuation approach based on an appraisal\nconducted by an independent, licensed appraiser outside of the Company using observable market data (Level 2). However, if\nthe collateral value is significantly adjusted due to differences in the comparable properties or is discounted by the Company\nbecause of lack of marketability, then the fair value is considered Level 3. The value of business equipment is based upon an\noutside appraisal if deemed significant or the net book value on the applicable borrower’s financial statements if not\nconsidered significant. Likewise, values for inventory and accounts receivables collateral are based on financial statement\nbalances or aging reports (Level 3). Fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for credit losses in\nthe consolidated statements of income.\nMortgage Servicing Rights – Mortgage servicing rights do not trade in an active market with readily observable\nmarket data. As a result, the Company estimates the fair value of mortgage servicing rights by using a discounted cash flow\nmodel to calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The assumptions used in the discounted cash\nflow model are those that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. Assumptions in the\nvaluation of mortgage servicing rights may include estimated loan repayment rates, the discount rate, servicing costs, and the\ntiming of cash flows, among other factors.

These financial instruments include commitments to originate loans, to disburse funds to\nborrowers on unused construction and land development loans, and to disburse funds on committed but unused lines of credit.\nThese financial agreements involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the\namount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The contract amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of\ninvolvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.\n23\nTable of Contents\nCommitments to originate loans and disburse additional funds to borrowers on lines of credit are agreements to lend\nto a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed\nexpiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each customer’s\ncreditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon\nextension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower.\nThe Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument\nfor loan commitments, is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit\npolicies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The commitments to\noriginate loans and lines of credit may expire without being funded or drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts\ndo not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance by a\ncustomer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in\nextending loan facilities to customers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the maximum potential amount of\nthe Company’s obligation was $6.5 million and $7.5 million, respectively, for standby letters of credit. The Company’s\noutstanding letters of credit generally have a term of less than one year. If a letter of credit is drawn upon, the Company may\nseek recourse through the customer’s underlying line of credit. If the customer’s line of credit is also in default, the Company\nmay take possession of the collateral, if any, securing the line of credit.\nFinancial instruments whose contract amounts represents off-balance sheet credit risk and are not reflected on the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheets consist of the following at the dates stated:\nAs of\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nCommitments to originate loans $ 75,784 $ 79,191\nUnadvanced funds on lines of credit 477,614 490,847\nUnadvanced funds on construction loans 487,462 542,893\nLetters of credit 6,517 7,471\n$ 1,047,377 $ 1,120,402\nThe Bank accrues for credit losses related to off-balance sheet financial instruments. Potential losses on off-balance\nsheet loan commitments are estimated using the same risk factors used to determine the allowance for credit losses on loans,\nadjusted for the likelihood that funding will occur. The allowance for off-balance sheet commitments is recorded within other\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amounted to $3.4 million and $6.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a release of the\nallowance for unfunded commitments of $2.4 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company did not\nrecord a provision for unfunded commitments. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company\nrecorded a release of the allowance for unfunded commitments of $2.6 million and a provision for unfunded commitments of\n$86,000, respectively.\nNote 8 – Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nRisk Management Objective of Using Derivatives – The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its\nbusiness operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business\nand operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including\ninterest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and\nthe use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage\nexposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts,\nthe value of which are determined by interest rates.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration\nof the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the\nCompany’s assets and liabilities.\nFair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk – The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain pools of its\npre-payable fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to\nmanage its exposure to changes in the fair value of these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark\ninterest rate.\nInterest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a\ncounterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the\nexchange of the underlying notional amount.\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the\noffsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income.\nThe Company had previously entered into two “last of layer hedges” on a significant portion of its fixed rate\nresidential loan pool. These amounts include the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging\nrelationships in which the hedged item is the last layer expected to remain at the end of the hedging relationship.\nDuring September 2021, the Company terminated these last of layer hedges by paying out $2.2 million to the\nrespective third parties. These fees were capitalized into loans receivable and are being amortized against loan income over\nthe contractual lives of the remaining designated residential loans. The unamortized amount of this cost basis adjustment is\n$949,000 and $1.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized amortization expense related to this cost basis adjustment of $31,000\nand $41,000, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized\namortization expense related to this cost basis adjustment of $81,000 and $113,000, respectively.\nNon-designated Hedges – Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the\nCompany’s exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting\nrequirements and/or the Company has not elected to apply hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not\ndesignated in hedging relationships, exclusive of credit valuation adjustments, are recorded directly in earnings.\nThe Company executes interest rate swaps and cap agreements with commercial banking customers to facilitate its\nrespective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swap and cap agreements are simultaneously hedged by offsetting\ninterest rate swaps and caps that are executed with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure\nresulting from such transactions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 58 interest rate swap agreements with an\naggregate notional amount of $383.8 million compared to 52 interest rate swap agreements and one interest rate cap\nagreement with an aggregate notional amount of $338.6 million related to this program as of December 31, 2023.\nRisk Participation Agreements – Risk Participation Agreements (“RPAs”) are guarantees issued by the Company to\nother parties for a fee, whereby the Company agrees to participate in the credit risk of a derivative customer of the other party.\nUnder the terms of these agreements, the “participating bank” receives a fee from the “lead bank” in exchange for the\nguarantee of reimbursement if the customer defaults on an interest rate swap. The interest rate swap is transacted such that any\nand all exchanges of interest payments (favorable and unfavorable) are made between the lead bank and the customer. In the\nevent that an early termination of the swap occurs, and the customer is unable to make a required close out payment, the\nparticipating bank assumes that obligation and is required to make this payment. RPAs where the Company acts as the lead\nbank are referred to as “participations-out,” in reference to the credit risk associated with the customer derivatives being\ntransferred out of the Company. Participations-out generally occur concurrently with the sale of new customer derivatives.\nRPAs where the Company acts as the participating bank are referred to as “participations-in,” in reference to the credit risk\nassociated with the counterparty’s derivatives being assumed by the Company. The Company’s maximum credit exposure is\nbased on its proportionate share of the settlement amount of the referenced interest rate swap. Settlement amounts are\ngenerally calculated based on the fair value of the swap plus outstanding accrued interest receivable from the customer.\n25\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had 17 RPAs with an aggregate notional amount of $45.0 million related to\nthis program compared to 16 RPAs with an aggregate notional amount of $44.5 million as of December 31, 2023. These RPAs\nall represent “participations-in” and generally have terms ranging from five to ten years.\nThe table below presents the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging\ninstruments, as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets as of the dates stated:\nDerivative Derivative\nAssets (1) Liabilities (2)\nSeptember 30, 2024 (in thousands)\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate products $ 26,912 $ 26,912\nRPA credit contracts — 10\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments $ 26,912 $ 26,922\nDecember 31, 2023\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate products $ 27,769 $ 27,769\nRPA credit contracts — 17\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments $ 27,769 $ 27,786\n(1) Recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2) Recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe table below presents the financial impact of the Company’s derivative financial instruments not designated as\nhedges in the consolidated statements of income, caused by changes in fair value for the periods indicated:\nLocation of Gain or (Loss)\nRecognized Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,\nin Income on Derivative 2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nRPA credit contracts-fair value adjustments Other non-interest income $ (6) $ (2)$ 7 $ 1\nSwap contract fees, net of brokerage costs, recognized in earnings on the above noted interest rate products and RPA\ncontracts approximated $375,000 and $950,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and\n$1.1 million and $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the\nCompany defaults (or is capable of being declared in default) on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be\ndeclared in default on its derivative obligations, and it could be required to terminate its derivative positions with the\ncounterparty. The Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision whereby\nif the counterparty fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, then the Company could be required to terminate\nits derivative positions with the counterparty. In order to mitigate counterparty default risk in conjunction with these interest\nrate products and RPA credit contracts, the Company was required to maintain $9.1 million of collateral deposit accounts with\nthe counterparties to these agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nNote 9 – Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income.\nAlthough certain changes in assets and liabilities are reported as a separate component of the shareholders' equity section of\nthe consolidated balance sheets, such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income (loss).\n26\nTable of Contents\nThe components of other comprehensive income (loss) and related tax effects are as follows for the periods indicated:\nFor the Three Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\n(In thousands)\nPre-Tax Tax (Expense) After-Tax Pre-Tax Tax (Expense) After-Tax\nAmount Benefit Amount Amount Benefit Amount\nChange in fair value of available-for-sale securities $ 7,274 $ (1,957)$ 5,317 $ 381 $ (95)$ 286\nLess: Reclassification adjustment for realized (losses) gains in net income (1,868) 542 (1,326) — — —\nNet change in fair value of available-for-sale securities 5,406 (1,415) 3,991 381 (95) 286\nChange in fair value of cash flow hedge — — — (33) 8 (25)\nLess: Net cash flow hedge gains (losses) reclassified into interest income or interest expense — — — — — —\nNet change in fair value of cash flow hedge, net of tax — — — (33) 8 (25)\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss) $ 5,406 $ (1,415)$ 3,991 $ 348 $ (87)$ 261\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\n(In thousands)\nPre-Tax Tax (Expense) After-Tax Pre-Tax Tax (Expense) After-Tax\nAmount Benefit Amount Amount Benefit Amount\nChange in fair value of available-for-sale securities $ 8,309 $ (2,231)$ 6,078 $ 731 $ (183)$ 548\nLess: Reclassification adjustment for realized (losses) gains in net income (1,868) 543 (1,325) — — —\nNet change in fair value of available-for-sale securities 6,441 (1,688) 4,753 731 (183) 548\nChange in fair value of cash flow hedge — — — (318) 80 (238)\nLess: Net cash flow hedge gains (losses) reclassified into interest income or interest expense — — — — — —\nNet change in fair value of cash flow hedge, net of tax — — — (318) 80 (238)\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss) $ 6,441 $ (1,688)$ 4,753 $ 413 $ (103)$ 310\nThe following table presents the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023:\nAs of\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nNet unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale securities, net of tax $ (6,175) $ (10,928)\nUnrecognized director pension plan benefits, net of tax (969) (969)\nTotal accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (7,144) $ (11,897)\nNote 10 – Regulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by\nregulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Under\nregulatory capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet\nspecific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet\nitems as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s capital amounts and classification are also subject\nto qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the federal banking agencies published a final rule on a Community Bank Leverage Ratio\n(“CBLR”) Framework that provides a simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualified community banking organizations.\nManagement had determined that the Company meets the standards to qualify under the CBLR framework and opted into this\nframework for FDIC call reporting purposes during 2020. Under the CBLR framework, a bank that maintains a CBLR of\n9.0% (defined as Tier 1 capital divided by total average assets) is considered to have satisfied its capital requirements,\ndetermined to be well-capitalized, and will no longer be required to calculate risk-based capital ratios. As of December 31,\n2023 the Bank met the minimum requirement with a CBLR of 13.6%.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe Company no longer meets the requirement for the CBLR framework due to its unfunded loan commitments\nbeing over 25.0% of its capital for more than two consecutive quarters. As a result, the Company operated under the risk-\nbased framework for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Under this framework, quantitative measures\nestablished by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total\nCapital, Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets, and Tier 1 Capital to Total Average Assets\n(as defined in the regulations). Management believes, as of September 30, 2024, that the Company and the Bank meet all\ncapital adequacy requirements to which each is subject.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company and the Bank were categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-\nbased, Tier 1 risk-based, Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There are\nno conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank’s category.

Diluted EPS have been calculated in a manner similar to that of basic EPS\nexcept that the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is increased to include the number of additional\ncommon shares that would have been outstanding if all potentially dilutive common shares (such as those resulting from the\nexercise of stock options) were issued during the period, computed using the treasury stock method. There were no securities\nthat had a dilutive effect during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Effective September 30, 2024, with a modified\nretrospective application to January 1, 2024, the Company adopted ASU No. 2023-02 and began to apply the proportional\namortization method of accounting for its SITCPs. Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2023-02, the Company applied the equity\nmethod of accounting for its SITCPs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded $14.7\nmillion and $17.3 in solar income tax credit, respectively and $18.0 million of amortization attributable to the SITCPs within\nIncome Tax Expense in its Consolidated Statements of Income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the\nCompany recorded no tax credits within Income Tax Expense in its Consolidated Statements of Income and amortization of\n$341,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, within Other Noninterest Expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. At\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s carrying value of SITCPs was $731,000 and $10.2 million,\nrespectively, recorded in Non-Public Investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Remaining funding obligations related\nto these SITCPs recorded in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $5.6\nmillion and $0 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. For the remaining funding obligations at\nSeptember 30, 2024, 100% are expected to be funded during 2025.

In\naddition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions\nthat are subject to change.\nThe following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or\nother expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements:\n● weakening in the United States economy in general and the regional and local economies within the Company’s\nmarket area;\n● the effects of inflationary pressures, labor market shortages and/or supply chain issues;\n● the instability or volatility in financial markets and unfavorable general business conditions, globally, nationally\nor regionally, whether caused by geopolitical concerns, recent disruptions in the banking industry, or other\nfactors;\n● unanticipated loan delinquencies, loss of collateral, decreased service revenues, and other potential negative\neffects on our business caused by severe weather, pandemics or other external events;\n● changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields, our mortgage banking revenues, the\nfair value of financial instruments, including our mortgage servicing rights asset, or our level of loan\noriginations, or increase the level of defaults, losses and prepayments on loans we have made and make;\n● changes in the level and direction of loan delinquencies and write-offs and changes in estimates of the adequacy\nof the allowance for credit losses on loans;\n● the effect of any change in federal government enforcement of federal laws affecting the cannabis industry;\n● changes in liquidity, including the size and composition of our deposit portfolio, including the percentage of\nuninsured deposits in the portfolio;\n● our ability to access cost-effective funding;\n● fluctuations in real estate values and both residential and commercial real estate market conditions;\n● demand for loans and deposits in our market area;\n● our ability to implement and change our business strategies;\n● competition among depository and other financial institutions;\n● adverse changes in the securities or secondary mortgage markets;\n● changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in\nregulatory fees, capital requirements and insurance premiums;\n● changes in the quality or composition of our loan or investment portfolios;\n● technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected;\n30\nTable of Contents\n● the inability of third-party providers to perform as expected;\n● a failure or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, including cyberattacks;\n● our ability to manage market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, compliance risk, and operational risk;\n● our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;\n● changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;\n● changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board;\n● our ability to attract and retain key employees; and\n● changes in the financial condition, results of operations or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own.\nBecause of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from\nthe results indicated by these forward-looking statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThere are no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form\n10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2024.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company estimates the allowance for credit losses in accordance with the CECL methodology for loans measured\nat amortized cost. The allowance for credit losses is established based upon the Company's current estimate of expected\nlifetime credit losses. Arriving at an appropriate amount of allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of judgment.\nThe Company estimates credit losses on a collective basis for loans sharing similar risk characteristics using a\nquantitative model combined with an assessment of certain qualitative factors designed to address forecast risk and model risk\ninherent in the quantitative model output. Management's judgement is required for the selection and application of these\nfactors which are derived from historical loss experience as well as assumptions surrounding expected future losses and\neconomic forecasts.\nLoans that no longer share similar risk characteristics with any pools of assets are subject to individual assessment and\nare removed from the collectively assessed pools to avoid double counting.\nFor the loans that are individually assessed, the Company uses either a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) approach or a\nfair value of collateral approach. The latter approach is used for loans deemed to be collateral dependent or when foreclosure\nis probable. Changes in these judgements and assumptions could be due to a number of circumstances which may have a\ndirect impact on the provision for credit losses and may result in changes to the amount of allowance. The allowance for credit\nlosses is increased by the provision for credit losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off. Credit losses are\ncharged against the allowance when management's assessments confirm that the Company will not collect the full amortized\ncost basis of a loan.\n31\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of\nexisting assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax\nrates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or\nsettled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion of the\ndeferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of\nthe resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments may require us to make projections of future taxable income and/or to\ncarryback to taxable income in prior years. The judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any\nreduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nSecurities Valuation\nWe classify our debt securities as available-for-sale, which are carried at fair value. We obtain our fair values from one\nor more third-party services. These services’ fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices when such prices are\navailable.\nIf quoted market prices are not available, estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of techniques, including\nextrapolation from the quoted prices of similar instruments or recent trades for thinly traded securities, fundamental analysis,\nor through obtaining purchase quotes. Due to the subjective nature of the valuation process, it is possible that the actual fair\nvalues of these investments could differ from the estimated amounts, thereby affecting our financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nFor any available-for-sale debt security with a fair value less than its amortized cost basis, we will determine whether\nwe have the intent to sell the available-for-sale debt security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell\nthe available-for-sale debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either condition is met, the Company will\nrecognize a full impairment charge to earnings. For all other available-for-sale debt securities that don't meet either condition\nand that have expected credit losses, the credit loss will be recognized in earnings. Any non-credit related loss impairment\nrelated to all other factors will be recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Management also assesses the nature of the\nunrealized losses taking into consideration factors such as changes in risk-free interest rates, general credit spread changes,\nmarket supply and demand, creditworthiness of the issuer, and quality of the underlying collateral.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains certain\nnon-GAAP financial measures, including operating net income, operating noninterest expense, operating noninterest income,\noperating earnings per share, basic, operating earnings per share, diluted, operating return on average assets, operating return\non average shareholders’ equity, operating efficiency ratio, tangible shareholders’ equity, tangible assets, tangible book value\nper share, and efficiency ratio. The Company’s management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information is utilized\nby regulators and market analysts to evaluate a Company’s financial condition and therefore, such information is useful to\ninvestors. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\nBecause non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with\nother companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.\n32\nTable of Contents\nNB BANCORP, INC.\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATION\n(Unaudited)\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNet income (GAAP) $ 8,383 $ 8,467 $ 26,537 $ 23,444\nAdd (Subtract):\nAdjustments to net income:\nLosses on sales of securities available for sale, net 1,868 - 1,868 -\nIncome tax expense on solar tax credit investment basis reduction 2,503 - 2,503 -\nBOLI surrender tax and managed endowment contract penalty 1,552 - 1,552 -\nAdjustment for adoption of ASU 2023-02 (913) - (913) -\nTotal adjustments to net income $ 5,010 $ - $ 5,010 $ -\nLess net tax benefit associated with losses on sales of securities available for sale, net and reversal of previously taken\namortization of solar tax credit investments 277 - 277 -\nNon-GAAP adjustments, net of tax 4,733 - 4,733 -\nOperating net income (non-GAAP) $ 13,116 $ 8,467 $ 31,270 $ 23,444\nWeighted average common shares outstanding, basic 39,289,271 N/A 39,423,214 N/A\nWeighted average common shares outstanding, diluted 39,289,271 N/A 39,423,214 N/A\nOperating earnings per share, basic (non-GAAP) 0.33 N/A 0.79 N/A\nOperating earnings per share, diluted (non-GAAP) 0.33 N/A 0.79 N/A\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNoninterest expense (GAAP) $ 24,586 $ 23,088 $ 76,367 $ 68,459\nSubtract (Add):\nNoninterest expense components:\nAdjustment for adoption of ASU 2023-02 (913) - (913) -\nTotal impact of non-GAAP noninterest expense adjustments $ (913) $ - $ (913) $ -\nNoninterest expense on an operating basis (non-GAAP) $ 25,499 $ 23,088 $ 77,280 $ 68,459\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNoninterest income (GAAP) $ 1,265 $ 3,138 $ 7,750 $ 12,101\nSubtract (Add):\nNoninterest income components:\nLosses on sales of securities available for sale, net (1,868) - (1,868) -\nTotal impact of non-GAAP noninterest income adjustments $ (1,868) $ - $ (1,868) $ -\nNoninterest income on an operating basis (non-GAAP) $ 3,133 $ 3,138 $ 9,618 $ 12,101\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nOperating net income (non-GAAP) $ 13,116 $ 8,467 $ 31,270 $ 23,444\nAverage assets 4,890,204 4,133,146 4,697,200 3,854,877\nOperating return on average assets (non-GAAP) 1.07% 0.81% 0.89% 0.81%\nAverage shareholders’ equity 754,609 363,469 743,251 355,751\nOperating return on average shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) 6.91% 9.24% 5.62% 8.81%\n33\nTable of Contents\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nTotal shareholders’ equity (GAAP) $ 747,449 $ 365,701 $ 747,449 $ 365,701\nSubtract:\nIntangible assets (core deposit intangible) 1,116 1,265 1,116 1,265\nTotal tangible shareholders’ equity (non-GAAP) 746,333 364,436 746,333 364,436\nTotal assets (GAAP) 5,002,557 4,231,792 5,002,557 4,231,792\nSubtract:\nIntangible assets (core deposit intangible) 1,116 1,265 1,116 1,265\nTotal tangible assets (non-GAAP) $ 5,001,441 $ 4,230,527 $ 5,001,441 $ 4,230,527\nTangible shareholders' equity / tangible assets (non-GAAP) 14.92% 8.61% 14.92% 8.61%\nTotal common shares outstanding 42,705,729 N/A 42,705,729 N/A\nTangible book value per share (non-GAAP) $ 17.48 $ N/A $ 17.48 $ N/A\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNoninterest expense on an operating basis (non-GAAP) $ 25,499 $ 23,088 $ 77,280 $ 68,459\nTotal revenue (net interest income plus total noninterest income) (non-GAAP) 44,457 36,622 128,296 108,544\nOperating efficiency ratio (non-GAAP) 57.36% 63.04% 60.24% 63.07%\nComparison of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023\nTotal Assets. Total assets increased $469.1 million, or 10.3%, to $5.00 billion as of September 30, 2024 from $4.53\nbillion as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increases in net loans, BOLI, cash and cash equivalents\nand available-for-sale securities.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased $44.5 million, or 16.3%, to $317.0 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $272.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to\ndeposit growth outpacing loan and investment growth, offset partially by paydowns of FHLB borrowings, purchases of BOLI\npolicies and increases in prepaid and other assets.\nSecurities Available for Sale. Securities available for sale increased $13.1 million, or 6.9%, to $202.5 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $189.5 million as of December 31, 2023 due to purchases of U.S. treasuries, government agency\nand corporate bond debt securities. The Company sold $29.3 million in available-for-sale debt securities during the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 with the proceeds reinvested into higher-yielding available-for-sale debt securities,\nwhich were restructured to mitigate portfolio risk and increase yield.\nLoans. Net loans increased $354.4 million, or 9.2%, to $4.21 billion as of September 30, 2024 from $3.86 billion as\nof December 31, 2023. The increase resulted primarily from increases in: commercial real estate loans, which increased\n$110.1 million, or 9.4%; commercial and industrial loans, which increased $75.0 million, or 15.3%; multi-family residential\nloans, which increased $62.6 million, or 29.8%; construction and development loans which increased $44.1 million, or 7.1%;\nconsumer loans, which increased $29.6 million, or 14.4%; and one-to-four family residential loans, which increased $26.5\nmillion, or 2.4%. The increase in our loan portfolio reflects our strategy to prudently grow the balance sheet by continuing to\ndiversify into these higher-yielding loans to improve net margins and manage interest rate risk.\nThe Company had approximately $458.0 million and $365.9 million in loans to borrowers in the cannabis industry at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of that total, $301.9 million and $207.7 million were direct loans\nto cannabis companies and were collateralized by real estate at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n34\nTable of Contents\nFHLB Stock. The FHLB is a cooperative bank that provides services to its member financial institutions. The\nprimary reason for our membership in the FHLB is to gain access to a reliable source of wholesale funding and as a tool to\nmanage interest rate risk. We held an investment in FHLB stock of $6.8 million and $14.6 million as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe amount of stock we are required to purchase is in proportion to our FHLB borrowings and level of total assets.\nAccordingly, the decrease in the FHLB stock from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 is due to the decrease in FHLB\nborrowings.\nBOLI. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company surrendered $46.7 million of\nexisting BOLI policies that were earning an annualized yield of 3.08%. Prior to the surrender of the policies, the Company\npurchased an additional $50.0 million of BOLI policies, which are currently yielding 4.81%. As a result of the surrender of the\nBOLI policies, the Company incurred $1.6 million of income tax and penalty, which the Company expects to earn back in less\nthan two years. The insurance carriers have six months to pay out the proceeds from the surrendered policies, and as a result,\nthe Company expects BOLI to be at higher balances and to continue earning income related to the increase in cash surrender\nvalue until the proceeds are received, which will further shorten the earn-back period on the income tax and penalty amount.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Assets. Prepaid expenses and other assets consist primarily of right of use assets related\nto our long-term leases, income taxes receivables and derivatives with a positive fair value. These assets increased $21.4\nmillion, or 40.4%, to $74.6 million as of September 30, 2024 from $53.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase\nresulted primarily from an $18.9 million increase in income taxes receivables as a result of earned solar income tax credits and\na $2.4 million increase in right of use assets resulting from a lease extension.\nDeposits. Deposits increased $655.5 million, or 19.4%, to $4.04 billion as of September 30, 2024 from $3.39 billion\nas of December 31, 2023. Core deposits (which we define as all deposits including certificates of deposit, other than brokered\ndeposits) increased $509.1 million, or 15.9%, to $3.71 billion as of September 30, 2024 from $3.20 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The increase in deposits was the result of growth in customer deposits, primarily certificates of deposit,\nwhich increased $360.1 million, or 27.4%, from December 31, 2023, along with money market accounts and noninterest-\nbearing demand deposit accounts, which increased $147.4 million, or 16.6%, and $32.4 million, or 6.1%, respectively, from\nDecember 31, 2023. Additionally, brokered deposits increased $146.3 million, or 79.7%, from December 31, 2023, as a result\nof lower rates versus alternative funding sources and to support overall liquidity.\nThe Company had $302.3 million and $277.5 million in deposits from the cannabis industry as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nFHLB Borrowings. FHLB borrowings decreased $167.0 million, or 58.9%, to $116.3 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $283.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in FHLB borrowings was the result of\noverall deposit growth and growth in brokered deposits due to lower rates.\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities. Accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased $11.8 million, or 14.5%, to\n$69.5 million as of September 30, 2024 from $81.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease resulted from $15.8\nmillion in IPO-related and other accrued expenses, $5.6 million reduction in accrued incentive bonuses resulting from bonuses\nbeing paid partially offset by current period accruals, and a $2.6 million reduction in allowance for credit losses on unfunded\ncommitments; offset partially by a $5.6 million increase in deferred solar tax credit investments resulting from a future\nexpected capital call, a $2.6 million increase in deferred tax liabilities related to a basis reduction on solar tax credits, a $2.5\nmillion increase in lease liabilities resulting from a lease extension and a $1.7 million increase in accrued interest on brokered\ndeposits resulting from increased utilization of brokered deposits.\nShareholders’ Equity. Total shareholders’ equity decreased $10.5 million, or 1.4%, to $747.4 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $758.0 million as of December 31, 2023, due to the $31.6 million increase in the unallocated\ncommon shares held by the ESOP resulting from the purchase of shares on the open market to fund the ESOP as a result of the\nconversion, along with the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-02 of $10.2 million, offset partially by $26.5 million in net\nincome during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n35\nTable of Contents\nComparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023\nNet Income. Net income was $8.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $8.5\nmillion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of approximately $84,000, or 1.0%.\nAn increase of $7.8 million, or 23.4%, in net interest income was offset by a $3.9 million, or 125.6% increase in\nincome tax expense, a $1.9 million, or 59.7% decrease in noninterest income and a $1.5 million, or 6.5%, increase in\nnoninterest expense.\nOperating net income, excluding one-time charges, amounted to $13.1 million, or $0.33 per diluted share for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to net income of $8.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, an\nincrease of $4.6 million, or 54.9%. The material one-time charges were:\n● Loss on the sale of available-for sale securities amounting to $1.9 million;\n● Tax expense and a managed endowment contract penalty related to the surrender of BOLI policies of $1.6\nmillion, and;\n● Tax expense related to a basis write-down of solar income tax credits of $2.5 million, partially offset by;\n● Reversal of previously recognized amortization related to solar income tax credit investments during the first six\nmonths of the year, amounting to $913 thousand.\nInterest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $16.4 million, or 27.5%, to $76.0 million for\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2024 from $59.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a $13.8\nmillion, or 24.4%, increase in interest and fees on loans and a $2.5 million, or 245.6%, increase in interest on short-term\ninvestments. The increase in interest and fees on loans was primarily due to an increase of $564.7 million, or 15.6%, in the\naverage balance of the loan portfolio to $4.19 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from $3.62 billion for\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2023 and an increase of 49 basis points in the weighted average yield for the loan portfolio to\n6.70% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 6.21% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, reflecting the growth\nof our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. The increase in interest income on short-term investments was primarily due\nto an increase of $183.0 million, or 224.9%, in the average balance of short-term investments to $264.4 million for the quarter\nended September 30, 2024 from $81.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $738.9 million, to $4.69 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024\nfrom $3.95 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 46 basis points to\n6.45% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 5.99% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $8.6 million, or 32.8%, to $34.7 million for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $26.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposit accounts\nincreased $12.8 million, or 61.7%, to $33.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from $20.8 million for\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in the average balance of certificates of deposit of\n$495.3 million to $1.94 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from $1.45 billion for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, an increase in the weighted average rate on certificates of deposit of 91 basis points to 5.02% for the\nquarter ended September 30, 2024 from 4.11% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and an increase in the weighted\naverage rate on money market accounts of 129 basis points to 4.06% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 2.77%\nfor the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest expense on FHLB borrowings decreased $4.3 million, or 80.0%, to $1.1 million for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $5.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The average balance of FHLB borrowings\ndecreased $298.4 million, or 77.8%, to $85.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from $383.5 million for\nthe quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the average balance of FHLB borrowings was the result of growth in\nbrokered deposits due to lower rates, as well as, overall deposit growth.\n36\nTable of Contents\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased $7.8 million, or 23.4%, to $41.3 million for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $33.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an $738.9 million, or\n18.7%, increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $4.69 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024\nfrom $3.95 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in the weighted average yield on interest-earning\nassets of 46 basis points to 6.45% September 30, 2024 from 5.99% September 30, 2023.\nThese increases were offset partially by an increase in the weighted average rate on interest-bearing liabilities of 80\nbasis points to 4.13% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 3.33% September 30, 2023 and an increase in the\naverage balance of interest-bearing liabilities of $233.1 million, or 7.5%, to $3.34 billion September 30, 2024 from $3.11\nbillion September 30, 2023.\nProvision for Credit Losses. Based on management’s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, a\nprovision of $2.6 million was recorded for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, of which $5.0 million related to the\nprovision for credit losses on loans, compared to a provision of $2.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The\nprovision for credit losses on unfunded commitments decreased $2.4 million during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 as a result of a reduction in qualitative factors on construction commitments, as well as, the reduction in the balance of\nunfunded commitments. The increase of $3.0 million, or 154.3%, in the total provision for credit losses was primarily due to\nthe overall increase in the size of the loan portfolio and increases in the qualitative factors on loans collateralized by purchased\nconsumer loans.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased $1.9 million, or 59.7%, to $1.3 million for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $3.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease resulted primarily from losses\nof sale on available-for-sale debt securities of $1.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Data processing expenses increased $1.1 million, or 20.0%, during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, primarily the result of higher electronic banking, information technology and system costs. The above\nincreases were partially offset by decreased FDIC and state insurance assessments of $1.0 million, or 36.5%, and general and\nadministrative expenses of $783,000, or 18.45%, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2023-02, which resulted in a $1.2 million\ndecrease in amortization of solar income tax credits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.

There were no out-of-period items or adjustments required to be excluded from the table below.\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 vs. 2023\nIncrease (Decrease) Due to Total\nIncrease\nVolume Rate (Decrease)\n(In thousands)\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans $ 32,124 $ 17,162 $ 49,286\nSecurities (339) 1,463 1,124\nOther (215) (551) (766)\nShort-term investments 7,414 395 7,809\nTotal interest-earning assets 38,984 18,469 57,453\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nSavings accounts (10) 1 (9)\nNOW accounts (28) 215 187\nMoney market accounts 1,872 9,671 11,543\nCertificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts 14,288 16,850 31,138\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 16,122 26,737 42,859\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances (7,508) (133) (7,641)\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 8,614 26,604 35,218\nChange in net interest income $ 30,370 $ (8,135) $ 22,235\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity\nis primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and\nplanned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, and\nproceeds from maturities of securities. We are also able to borrow from the FHLB and the Discount Window at the Federal\nReserve Bank of Boston (“FRB”). As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding advances of $116.3 million from the FHLB.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had unused borrowing capacity of $730.7 million with the FHLB and $36.6 million available\nwith the FRB. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the Bank received approval from the FRB under its Borrower in Custody\n(“BIC”) program, which allowed us to pledge commercial real estate and multi-family loans to the FRB, which provided the\nBank with additional borrowing capacity of $531.6 million. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, we had $329.9 million of\nbrokered deposits and pursuant to our internal liquidity policy, which allows us to utilize brokered deposits up to 25.0% of our\ntotal assets, we had an additional capacity of up to approximately $920.7 million of brokered deposits.\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows\nand loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid\nassets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending, and\ninvesting activities during any given period.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing\nactivities, and financing activities.\n43\nTable of Contents\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $75.8 million in commitments to originate loans outstanding. In addition, we had\n$477.6 million in unused lines of credit to borrowers, $487.5 million in unadvanced construction loans and $6.5 million in\nletters of credit outstanding.\nNon-brokered certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2024 totaled $1.65 billion, or 40.9%, of total\ndeposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, we may be required to seek other sources of funds, including brokered\ndeposits, FHLB advances and FRB borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on\nsuch deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the non-brokered certificates of deposit due on or before\nSeptember 30, 2025, or on our other interest-bearing deposit accounts. We believe, however, based on historical experience\nand current market interest rates that we will retain upon maturity a large portion of our certificates of deposit with maturities\nof one year or less as of September 30, 2024.\nOur primary investing activity is originating loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we originated\n$345.4 million of loans, net of repayments.\nFinancing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and FHLB advances. We experienced net increases\nin deposits of $655.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nthe level of brokered time deposits was $329.9 million and $183.6 million, respectively. Deposit flows are affected primarily\nby the overall level of interest rates and the interest rates and products offered by us and our competitors. FHLB advances\ndecreased $167.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nFor additional information, see the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 included as part of the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-\nQ.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We continuously monitor our liquidity position and\nadjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate by management. Liquidity risk\nmanagement is an important element in our asset/liability management process. We regularly model liquidity stress scenarios\nto assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions, volatility in the financial\nmarkets, unexpected credit events or other significant occurrences deemed problematic by management. These scenarios are\nincorporated into our contingency funding planning process, which provides the basis for the identification of our liquidity\nneeds. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. In addition, based on our\ndeposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will\nbe retained.\nAs of September 30, 2024, Needham Bank and NB Bancorp, Inc. exceeded all of their regulatory capital\nrequirements, and were categorized as well-capitalized at that date. Management is not aware of any conditions or events\nsince the most recent notification of well-capitalized status that would change our category. See Note 10 of the notes to\nconsolidated financial statements.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars\nwithout considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of\ninflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the\nassets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, generally, have a more\nsignificant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the\nsame direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nItem 3.

In addition, we sometimes refer to NB Bancorp, Inc. as “NB Bancorp” or the\n“Company” and to Needham Bank as the “Bank.”\n4\nBUSINESS OF NB BANCORP, INC.\nNB Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation that was incorporated in June 2023 for the\npurpose of becoming the registered bank holding company for Needham Bank (the “Bank”) upon the consummation of\nthe mutual to stock conversion of NB Financial, MHC, the Bank’s former mutual holding company. The Company’s\ninitial stock offering was completed on December 27, 2023. In connection with the conversion, the Company sold\n40,997,500 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for gross offering proceeds (before deducting offering\nexpenses) of approximately $410.0 million based on the offering price of $10.00 per share. The Company also\ncontributed 1,708,229 shares of common stock and $2.0 million in cash to the Needham Bank Charitable Foundation.\nThe shares of the Company’s common stock sold in the offering began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on\nDecember 28, 2023 under the symbol “NBBK.”\nSince being incorporated, other than holding the common stock of Needham Bank, retaining approximately\n50% of the net cash proceeds of the stock conversion offering and making a loan to the Bank’s employee stock\nownership plan, we have not engaged in any material business activities to date.\nOur cash flow depends on earnings from the investment of the net proceeds we retained from our initial public\nstock offering that was consummated on December 27, 2023, and any dividends we receive from Needham Bank. We\nneither own nor lease any property, but pay a fee to Needham Bank for the use of its premises, equipment and furniture.\nAt the present time, we employ only persons who are officers of Needham Bank who also serve as officers of NB\nBancorp. We use the support staff of Needham Bank from time to time and pay a fee to Needham Bank for the time\ndevoted to NB Bancorp by employees of Needham Bank. However, these persons are not separately compensated by NB\nBancorp. NB Bancorp may hire additional employees, as appropriate, to the extent it expands its business in the future.\nOur executive offices are located at 1063 Great Plain Avenue, Needham, Massachusetts 02492. Our telephone\nnumber at this address is (781) 444-2100.\nBUSINESS OF NEEDHAM BANK\nGeneral\nNeedham Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered cooperative bank headquartered in Needham, Massachusetts.\nNeedham Bank was organized in 1892 and has operated continuously in Needham, Massachusetts, which is\napproximately 17 miles southwest of Boston’s financial district, since this time. Our headquarters are still located in\nNeedham, and we have branch locations in Wellesley, Westwood, Dedham, Medfield, Medford, Dover, Ashland, Millis,\nNatick and Boston (Mission Hill). Our branch network covers the metro-west area of Boston and surrounding\ncommunities, which is our primary deposit market area. We consider our primary lending market area to be the Greater\nBoston metropolitan area and surrounding communities in Massachusetts, eastern Connecticut, southern New Hampshire\nand Rhode Island. As one of the largest community banks in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, and throughout New\nEngland, we believe that our reputation for providing personalized customer service is our strongest asset and our most\neffective business strategy to continue to grow and be a profitable bank.\nOur business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together\nwith funds generated from operations, in commercial real estate and multifamily loans, one- to four-family residential\nreal estate loans, construction and land development loans, commercial and industrial loans and consumer loans. To a\nlesser extent, we originate home equity loans and lines of credit. At December 31, 2023, our total loan portfolio was\ncomprised of $1.38 billion, or 35.5%, of commercial real estate and multifamily loans, $1.10 billion, or 28.2%, of one-\nto four-family residential real estate loans, $622.7 million, or 16.0%, of construction and land development loans, and\n$487.9 million, or 12.5%, of commercial and industrial loans. We also invest in securities, consisting primarily of U.S.\nTreasury and federal agency securities, municipal bonds and corporate bonds. We offer a variety of deposit accounts,\nincluding certificate of deposit accounts, IRAs, money market accounts, savings accounts, demand deposit accounts and\ninterest-bearing and noninterest-bearing checking accounts. We historically have utilized advances from the Federal\nHome Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLB”) to fund our operations and we had $283.3 million of FHLB advances at\n5\nDecember 31, 2023. Additionally, in recent years, we have also utilized brokered deposits as a non-retail funding source\nto fund our operations and at December 31, 2023, we had $183.6 million of brokered deposits.\nNeedham Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of\nBanks (the “Commissioner”) under Massachusetts law, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the\n“Federal Reserve Board”) as its primary federal regulator. It is also regulated by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(the “FDIC”) as its primary insurer of its deposits.\nOur executive offices are located at 1063 Great Plain Avenue, Needham, Massachusetts 02492. Our telephone\nnumber at this address is (781) 444-2100. Our website address is www.needhambank.com. Information on our website is\nnot incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nBusiness Strategy\nIn recent years and consistent with our growth strategy to increase our commercial relationships along all\nbusiness lines, we have enhanced our online and mobile banking offerings, including fraud prevention and detection\nsystems, and additionally, we have invested heavily in our cash management suite of products. Additional investments\nhave been made to continually strengthen cybersecurity controls, such as with expanded vulnerability detection and\npatch management protocols. The acquisition of our cannabis-related and money service banking businesses resulted in\nthe addition of $297.7 million of core deposits in April 2022 and we believe our significant investment in these cash\nmanagement products has allowed us to capture and service the full banking relationships for these and our other\nStructured Finance customer relationships. We have invested in systems to automate compliance with cannabis-related\nregulatory requirements and guidance. Investments in tools have been completed to further automate compliance with\nstate-specific and federal regulatory requirements for cannabis banking and consumer lending activities. We are also\nimplementing a Marketing Customer Information File and Customer Relationship Management system to improve\ncommunication, collaboration and the customer experience.\nIn recent years, we have focused on building an experienced management team and diversifying and enhancing\nour operating and business strategy. In January 2017, we hired Joseph Campanelli as our Chief Executive Officer, and in\nApril 2017, we hired Salvatore Rinaldi, our Chief Operating Officer. Messrs. Campanelli and Rinaldi each have more\nthan 40 years of banking experience at larger, more complex financial institutions. They have worked together for over\n40 years at other financial institutions prior to joining Needham Bank successfully executing similar strategies. Under\ntheir leadership, the Bank has implemented an intentional and structured growth plan to enable the Bank to grow its\nbalance sheet and diversify its operations and offer a personalized banking experience to individuals and businesses\nwhile seeking to address the risks inherent with such growth.\nSince 2020, the Bank added approximately 102 full time employees, including approximately 23 employees in\nconnection with the April 2022 acquisition of a cannabis banking business from another financial institution. Consistent\nwith our strategy to continue to service individuals and small businesses in our market area, while also competing for\nlarger business customers, the Bank has made significant investments in infrastructure, upgraded technology solutions\nand offerings, and compliance and risk management.\nFollowing a comprehensive strategic review of the Company’s governance structure, in May 2023, we added\nfour new board members, and in July 2023 added a fifth new director, each of whom individually, and together as a\ngroup, we believe bring a level of business acumen and sophistication that matches our growth strategy.\nThe proceeds from our initial stock offering which we consummated in December 2023 will enable us to\ncontinue to implement our prudent and disciplined growth strategy. We plan to employ the following strategies to\nmaximize sustainable profitability:\n• Continue to moderately grow our commercial real estate and multifamily loan portfolio. In\nrecent years, we have increased our commercial real estate and multifamily loan portfolio consistent with\nsafe and sound underwriting practices. This has had the benefit of increasing the yield on our loan portfolio\n6\nwhile reducing the average term to repricing of our loans. At December 31, 2023, our commercial real\nestate and multifamily loan portfolio totaled $1.38 billion, or 35.5% of our total loan portfolio, compared\nwith $1.01 billion, or 33.6% of total loans, at December 31, 2022. We intend to continue to compete for\nmore relationships, primarily to experienced seasoned builders, developers and investors in our market\narea.\n• Continue to diversify our commercial and industrial loan portfolio. We have diversified our\ncommercial and industrial loan portfolio into three divisions, which we refer to as Small Business, Middle\nMarket and Structured Finance. The Small Business Lending division generally focuses on loans under the\nSmall Business Administration (the “SBA”) programs of up to $5 million and traditional non-small SBA\ncommercial business relationships with businesses who generate up to $10 million in revenue, and our\nMiddle Market division generally focuses on relationships with businesses who have annual revenues from\n$10 million to $50 million, nearly all of which are to borrowers in our primary market area. Our Structured\nFinance division seeks to service the banking needs of larger business customers, typically with greater\nthan $50 million in annual revenues, throughout a variety of industries, including manufacturers, service\ncompanies, renewable energy providers, commercial finance companies, and cannabis-related entities. We\nbelieve that our industry-specific knowledge about the banking needs of these industries gives us a\ncompetitive advantage to service these customers. We intend to continue to emphasize growth in each of\nthese divisions of our commercial and industrial lending.\n• Continue our historical emphasis on residential mortgage lending, including construction of single-\nfamily homes. Historically, we have emphasized residential mortgage lending, including for the\nconstruction of single-family homes, and at December 31, 2023, one- to four-family residential real estate\nloans totaled $1.10 billion, or 28.2% of our total loan portfolio. We intend to continue measured, efficient\ngrowth of these types of residential lending.\n• Grow our consumer loan operations. We seek to continue our growth in consumer loan operations, and\nin 2022, we purchased a variety of consumer loans from a third-party originator. Largely as a result of\nthese purchases, at December 31, 2023, consumer loans totaled $204.9 million, or 5.3% of our total loan\nportfolio, compared to $196.5 million, or 6.5% of our total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2022. Going\nforward, we intend to continue to emphasize the modest growth in our consumer loan portfolio through\nongoing originations and purchases from two limited-flow arrangements. We believe that this loan\ndiversification will allow us to continue to execute our business strategy of growing the Bank while\naddressing the inherent risks of community banking, including the risk of geographic concentrations in our\nloan portfolios. The diversification of our loan products allows us to address risk across a wider variety of\nborrowers and industries as well as the ongoing management of these portfolios to minimize our exposure\nto interest rate risk.\n• Diversify our deposit gathering. Consistent with our strategy to grow core deposits, which we consider to\nbe all deposits including certificates of deposits, other than brokered deposits, we have invested in a cash\nmanagement suite of products and enhanced our online and mobile banking offerings, as well as fraud\nprevention and detection systems. We intend to continue to implement new technology as it is developed or\nimproved. We view the growth of commercial and industrial lending, in each of our market segments, as an\nopportunity to increase our core deposits through our effort to capture the full banking relationship of these\ncommercial customers.\nReflecting our focus on our community, in connection with our mutual to stock conversion and initial public\noffering which closed in December 2023, we established a charitable foundation called Needham Bank Charitable\nFoundation and funded it with $2.0 million in cash and 1,708,229 shares of our common stock, for a total contribution of\n$19.1 million based on the $10.00 per share offering price. The purpose of this foundation is to make contributions to\nsupport various charitable organizations operating in our community now and in the future.\n7\nMarket Area\nWe consider our primary market area to be any counties, towns or municipalities within a 100-mile radius of\nNeedham, which generally covers the Greater Boston metropolitan area as well as surrounding communities in\nMassachusetts, eastern Connecticut, southern New Hampshire and Rhode Island. We will consider commercial and\nresidential real estate opportunities outside of this market area, but these are generally to customers with whom we have\nan existing relationship and who have a presence within our primary market area. We also have industry-specific and\nstructured commercial and industrial relationships to cannabis, wind and solar companies based on our underlying\ndiligence and understanding of the specific operations outside of our primary market area.\nThe Greater Boston metropolitan area benefits from the presence of numerous institutions of higher learning,\nmedical care and research centers and the corporate headquarters of several significant multinational corporations.\nEastern Massachusetts also has many high technology companies employing personnel with specialized skills. These\nfactors affect the demand for residential homes, multifamily apartments, office buildings, shopping centers, industrial\nwarehouses and other commercial properties.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau (the “Census”), at July 2022, the Greater Boston metropolitan\narea is the eleventh largest metropolitan area in the United States. Located adjacent to major transportation corridors, the\nGreater Boston metropolitan area provides a highly diversified economic base, with major employment sectors ranging\nfrom services, manufacturing and wholesale/retail trade, to finance, technology and medical care. According to the\nUnited States Department of Labor, in March 2023, the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts area had an\nestimated unemployment rate of 3.2%, compared to a Massachusetts state unemployment rate of 3.5% and the national\nunemployment rate of 3.5%.\nBased on the Census’ estimates, from 2020 to 2022, the populations of Boston–Cambridge–Newton, MA–NH\nMetropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”) decreased 0.83%, compared to a 0.6% increase for the Commonwealth of\nMassachusetts. At July 2022, the Census estimates that the Boston–Cambridge–Newton, MA–NH MSA’s median\nhousehold incomes was $104,372, compared to median household income of $81,744 for the city of Boston, $89,026 for\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and $69,021 for the United States.\nCompetition\nWe face significant competition within our market both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market\narea has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community\nbanks, credit unions and other non-bank financial service providers. Some of our competitors offer products and services\nthat we currently do not offer, such as trust services or wealth management services.\nOur competition for loans comes primarily from the competitors referenced above and from other financial\nservice providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from the\nincreasing number of non-depository financial service companies participating in the mortgage market, such as insurance\ncompanies, securities firms, financial technology companies, and specialty finance firms.\nWe expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes\nand the continuing trend toward consolidation of the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example,\nhave lowered barriers to entry, which have allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over\nthe internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions, including financial technology companies, to offer\nproducts and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Competition for deposits and the origination of\nloans could limit our growth in the future.\nWe expect to continue to emphasize originations of larger structured finance credit facilities. In recent years,\nmost of our larger, structured commercial and industrial loans have been to customers in the cannabis, wind or solar\nindustries. Our competition in this business sector is broad-based and not dominated by any specific larger or more well-\nestablished competitors. Changing legislation and government policy with respect to these industries could increase\ncompetition even further on a jurisdictional or industry-specific basis. We do not believe that our ability to compete is\ndependent on our existing relationships in these areas but we believe our experience could provide a competitive\n8\nadvantage versus lenders who enter these business lines in the future. We intend to continue to compete effectively in\nthese areas by utilizing our knowledge of the operating and cash flow structures of these industries, as well as the\napplicable regulatory considerations.\nLending Activities\nOur principal lending activity is originating commercial real estate and multifamily loans, one- to four-family\nresidential real estate loans, construction and land development loans, commercial and industrial loans and consumer\nloans. To a lesser extent, we also originate home equity loans and lines of credit. Subject to market conditions and our\nasset-liability analysis, we expect to continue to grow each of our loan portfolios with the most significant emphasis of\ngrowth in commercial real estate and multifamily loans, commercial and industrial loans and consumer loans. From time\nto time and subject to market conditions, we have also originated for sale and sold a portion of our long-term, fixed-rate\none- to four-family residential real estate loans, on a servicing-retained, limited or no recourse basis, while retaining\nshorter-term fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the\nduration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio.\nHistorically, we have also engaged in loan participation sales, with Needham Bank as the lead, for certain larger\ncommercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans and have limited purchased participations from well-\nestablished financial institutions in our market area. Participations and counterparty exposure is periodically reported to\nthe board of directors. At December 31, 2023, our highest combined participations sold with one bank was\napproximately 9.3% of our total capital and was comprised of three commercial real estate loans.\nLoan Portfolio Composition.

One of the primary focuses of our lending has long\nbeen the origination of long-term loans secured by mortgages on primarily owner-occupied, one- to four-family\nresidences. At December 31, 2023, $1.10 billion, or 28.2%, of our total loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family\nresidential real estate loans. The vast majority of the one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate are\nsecured by properties located in our primary market area. See “Originations, Sales and Purchases of Loans.”\nOur one- to four-family residential real estate loans are generally underwritten according to Fannie Mae\nguidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both\nfixed- and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming\nloan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”). We also originate loans above the FHFA\nlimit, which are referred to as “jumbo loans.” We generally underwrite jumbo loans in a manner similar to conforming\nloans and at December 31, 2023, approximately $355.1 million, or 32.4% of our one- to four-family residential real\nestate loans were jumbo loans with an average balance of $1.4 million.\nOur fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans are originated with terms of up to 30 years and\nour and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans are originated with terms of up to 40 years. At\nDecember 31, 2023, $537.9 million, or 49.0%, of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate\nloans.\nWe originate our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans with initial interest rate\nadjustment periods of three, five and seven years, based on changes in a designated market index. Generally, these loans\nare limited to a 200-basis point initial increase in their interest rate and a 200-basis point increase annually after the\ninitial adjustment and a maximum upward adjustment of 600 basis points over the life of the loan. We determine\nwhether a borrower qualifies for an adjustable-rate mortgage loan based on our lending policy.\nWe originate conventional one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 95%\nwithout private mortgage insurance. We also originate loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 97% for loans that are\nsold and serviced by MassHousing, an independent, quasi-public Massachusetts agency charged with providing\nfinancing for affordable housing in Massachusetts or under our First-Time Homebuyer Program.\nFrom time to time and subject to market conditions, we sell a portion of the fixed-rate one- to four-family\nresidential real estate loans that we originate with terms of greater than 20 years. We base the amount of fixed-rate loans\nthat we sell on our liquidity needs, asset/liability mix, loan volume, portfolio size and other factors. In recent years, most\nof the loans that we originated and sold to the secondary market were sold with servicing retained.\nWe generally do not offer “interest-only” mortgage loans on one- to four-family residential real estate loans nor do\nwe offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can\npay less than the interest owed on their loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan.\nAdditionally, we do not offer “subprime loans” (loans that are made with low down-payments to borrowers with weakened\ncredit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or\nborrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios).\n10\nWe evaluate both the borrower’s ability to make principal, interest and escrow payments and the value of the\nproperty that will secure the loan. Our one- to four-family residential real estate loans do not currently include\nprepayment penalties, are non-assumable and do not produce negative amortization. Our one- to four-family residential\nmortgage loans customarily include “due-on-sale” clauses giving us the right to declare the loan immediately due and\npayable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells the property subject to the mortgage. All borrowers are\nrequired to obtain title insurance. We also require homeowner’s insurance and fire and casualty insurance and, where\ncircumstances warrant, flood insurance on properties securing real estate loans.\nWe offer one- to four-family residential real estate loans secured by non-owner-occupied properties. Generally,\nwe will not make loans in excess of 80.0% loan to value on non-owner-occupied one- to four-family residential real\nestate properties or in excess of 80.0% on single family non-owner occupied residential real estate properties.\nHome Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. In addition to one- to four-family residential real estate loans, we\noffer home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by the borrower’s primary or secondary residence. At\nDecember 31, 2023, we had $97.3 million, or 2.5%, of our total loan portfolio in home equity loans and lines of credit.\nHome equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten using the same criteria that we use to\nunderwrite one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit may be underwritten\nwith a loan-to-value ratio of up to 80% when combined with the principal balance of the existing first mortgage loan.\nHome equity loans and lines of credit are generally secured by junior mortgages and have greater risk than one-\nto four-family residential real estate loans secured by first mortgages. We face the risk that the collateral will be\ninsufficient to compensate us for loan losses and costs of foreclosure, after repayment of the senior mortgages, if\napplicable. When customers default on their loans, we attempt to foreclose on the property and resell the property as\nsoon as possible to minimize foreclosure and carrying costs. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to\ncompensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from\nthose customers. Particularly with respect to our home equity loans and lines of credit, decreases in real estate values\ncould adversely affect our ability to fully recover the loan balance in the event of a default.\nCommercial Real Estate and Multifamily Lending. Our commercial real estate and multifamily loans are\nsecured primarily by multifamily apartment buildings, retail and mixed-use properties, light industrial properties,\nmanufacturing facilities and office buildings, almost all of which are located in our primary lending market area. We will\nalso make these loans out of our primary lending market area to customers of Needham Bank with whom we have an\nexisting lending relationship. Our multifamily loans are secured primarily by five or more-unit residential buildings. At\nDecember 31, 2023, we had $1.38 billion in commercial real estate and multifamily loans, representing 35.5% of our\ntotal loan portfolio.\nWe generally originate adjustable-rate commercial real estate and multifamily loans with maximum terms of up\nto 30 years. From time to time we will also originate fixed rate loans in these portfolios. We generally limit loan-to-value\nratios to 80% of the appraised value or purchase price, whichever is lower. All of our commercial real estate and\nmultifamily real estate loans are subject to our underwriting procedures and guidelines.\nAt December 31, 2023, our 25 largest commercial real estate lending relationships had an average balance of\napproximately $24.9 million, or approximately $623.2 million in the aggregate, representing 45.0% of our total\ncommercial real estate loans at such date. Consistent with our internal policies, any borrowing relationship with\naggregate exposure of greater than $55.0 million requires approval by the board of directors and at such date we had nine\nsuch relationships in excess of $55.0 million, which were comprised of commercial real estate and multifamily, and\nconstruction and land development loans. At December 31, 2023, each of the commercial real estate loans underlying\nour 25 largest commercial real estate relationships was performing in accordance with its repayment terms.\nWe consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate and multifamily loans. We evaluate the\nqualifications and financial condition of the borrower (including credit history), profitability and expertise, as well as the\nvalue and condition of the mortgaged property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we\nconsider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and\n11\nthe borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan,\namong other factors we consider the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and\ndepreciation, the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure that, subject to\ncertain exceptions, it is at least 1.20x for multifamily loans and 1.25x for commercial real estate loans, and the ratio of\nthe loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property. Our commercial real estate and multifamily loans are\nappraised by outside independent and qualified appraisers that are duly approved in accordance with Needham Bank\npolicy. Personal guarantees are often obtained from commercial real estate borrowers. Each borrower’s financial\ninformation on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates.\nOur loans-to-one borrower limit is 20% of our capital, which limit was $125.8 million at December 31, 2023.\nWe believe that our commercial real estate loan portfolio composition is relatively diversified in terms of\nindustry sectors, property types and various lending specialties. As of December 31, 2023, the amortized cost balances of\nconcentrations in our commercial real estate loan portfolio, including multi-family loans, were as follows:\nCommercial Real Estate\nNon-\nOwner- Owner- Total\nOccupied Occupied Balance $ Percentage %\n(Dollars in thousands)\nIndustrial $212,246 $ 72,288 $ 284,534 20.6%\nOffice 39,330 184,246 223,576 16.2\nMulti-family - 209,982 209,982 15.2\nRetail 84,269 104,596 188,865 13.6\nSpecial purpose 119,073 59,876 178,949 12.9\nHospitality 1,217 148,278 149,495 10.8\nOther 58,548 23,741 82,289 5.9\nMixed-use 8,974 57,338 66,312 4.8\nTotal commercial real estate $523,657 $860,345 $ 1,384,002 100.0%\nConstruction and Land Development Loans. At December 31, 2023, we had $622.7 million in construction\nand land development loans, or 16.0% of total loans. We make construction loans on raw land, land which has received\npermits for construction and commercial and residential properties which are being re-constructed, primarily to\ndevelopers, contractors and builders of apartment buildings, single-family homes and condominiums and individuals for\nthe construction of their primary residences. We also make a limited amount of land loans that will be used for\nresidential or commercial development. Land loans also include loans secured by land purchased for investment\npurposes.\nWhile we may originate loans to builders whether or not the collateral property underlying the loan is under\ncontract for sale, we consider each project carefully in light of current residential real estate market conditions.\nHistorically, most of our construction loans for residential properties are to well-known builders in our market area for\nwhich there is no contract for sale for the underlying completed home at the time of origination. We refer to these loans\nas speculative construction loans, and we expect this concentration of speculative residential construction lending to\ncontinue to be an important component of our construction and land development loans in the future. We actively\nmonitor the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing markets to attempt to maintain\nan appropriate balance between home sales and new loan originations. We generally will limit the maximum number of\nspeculative units (units that are not pre-sold) approved for each builder, typically starting with five speculative loans per\nbuilder until we develop a relationship and track record with the builder.\nOur construction loans are fixed- and adjustable-rate, interest-only loans that provide for the payment of interest\nduring the construction phase, which is usually up to 24 months. At the end of the construction phase, the loan may\nconvert to a permanent mortgage loan or may be paid in full. Given supply chain issues resulting in delays and longer\npermitting and approval times, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in recent years, depending on the complexity of\nthe construction project, the term of an “interest-only” construction loan may be extended if circumstances warrant.\n12\nConstruction loans are generally limited to 80% (75% for investment properties) loan-to-completed-appraised-\nvalue ratio upon completion of the project. Land development loans which are approved for development are limited to\n75%, and not yet approved for development land loans, are limited to 65% loan to completed appraised value. Before\nmaking a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed\nappraiser. We also generally require inspections of the property before disbursements of funds during the term of the\nconstruction loan.\nAt December 31, 2023, our 25 largest construction and land development loan relationships had an average\nbalance of approximately $17.0 million, or approximately $425.8 million in the aggregate, representing 68.4% of our\ntotal construction and land development loans at such date. Consistent with our internal policies, any borrowing\nrelationship with aggregate exposure of greater than $55.0 million requires approval by the board of directors and at such\ndate we had nine such relationships in excess of $55.0 million, which were comprised of commercial real estate and\nmultifamily loans and construction and land development loans. At December 31, 2023, each of the construction and\nland development loans underlying our 25 largest construction and land development loan relationships was performing\nin accordance with its repayment terms.\nCommercial and Industrial Loans. We offer a broad range of commercial and industrial loans, including lines\nof credit and terms loans, to a variety of commercial businesses and industrial borrowers. The loans are used to support\nworking capital and general corporate needs.\nOur commercial and industrial banking division is segmented into three core units: Small Business, Middle\nMarket and Structured Finance. The Small Business division generally focuses on loans under SBA programs of up to\n$5 million and non-SBA commercial business relationships with businesses who have annual revenues up to\n$10 million. SBA product offerings include SBA 7(a) Loans, SBA Express Lines of Credit, 504 Loans, and\nMassachusetts Capital Access Program.\nOur Middle Market division generally focuses on relationships with businesses with revenues from $10 million\nto $50 million for a variety of operating businesses. We serve operating companies such as manufacturers, distributors,\nimporters, exporters, medical practices, CPA firms, and law firms. The Middle Market division offers loans and lines of\ncredit to fund general operations, expansion, sales growth, new product development, and working capital. Nearly all of\nthese loans are to borrowers in our primary market area.\nOur Structured Finance division generally focuses on relationships with businesses with greater than\n$50 million in annual revenues and which may contain unique attributes to certain industries. In recent years, most of\nthese larger, structured commercial and industrial loans have been to customers in the cannabis, wind or solar industries.\nThese industries may be subject to heightened regulatory or business risks, and we believe our knowledge of the\noperating and cash flow structures of these industries, as well as the applicable regulatory considerations, enable us to\noffer competitive credit facility solutions to these customers while maintaining our prudent underwriting standards\nconsistent with our small business and middle market lending divisions. Generally, our Structured Finance loans are\ncollateralized by the borrower’s real estate and not by operating equipment which is harder to value due to these\nindustries’ unique operations. We seek to partner with company owners, management teams, and private equity sponsors\nto provide customized debt facility and cash management solutions for business owners. The Structured Finance\ndivision’s practices include sponsored and direct-to-company transactions, family-owned and privately held businesses,\nand, to a limited extent, publicly traded companies. We believe our Structured Finance division’s portfolio is well\ndiversified with over 50 commercial relationships at December 31, 2023.\nOur small business and middle market commercial and industrial loans are generally secured by all business\nassets of the borrower, including but not limited to equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, specific project assets and\ncontracts, and real estate. Across all three segments, loans are priced either by floating rate benchmarks plus applicable\nspreads, fixed-interest rates or floating rate fixed synthetically through interest rate swap derivative products. Terms\ngenerally range from three to 10 years. The average tenor of our commercial and industrial portfolio varies and at\nDecember 31, 2023 was less than 7 years for Structured Finance loans. At December 31, 2023, the average loan to value\nof the Structured Finance loan portfolio was less than 75%.\n13\nWe also offer lines of credit in amounts of up to 80% of the value of the eligible collateral securing the loan.\nWhen making commercial and industrial loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, lending\nhistory with the borrower, the debt service capabilities and global cash flows of the borrower and other guarantors, the\nhistorical and projected cash flows of the business and the value of the business assets. Where applicable we engage\nthird-party specialists to assist in conducting diligence on any prospective borrower, and they may include, as warranted,\nindustry-specific consultants, engineers, appraisers, and accountants.\nThe primary risk associated with commercial and industrial loans is the ability of borrowers to achieve business\nresults consistent with those projected at origination. The vast majority of the loans are extended on a secured basis, with\na limited number of unsecured lines of credit with additional covenants. At December 31, 2023, we had commitments to\nfund $22.0 million of unsecured lines of credit with no balances outstanding at this date. The security of any underlying\nloan is determined according to the credit profile of the customer on a case-by-case basis.\nIn managing our commercial and industrial loan portfolio, we focus on the size of the customer’s lending\nrelationship, which we view as the aggregate amount of all loans and loan commitments outstanding to a commercial\nborrower and any related borrowers or guarantors.\nAt December 31, 2023, approximately 94% of our small business and 98% of our middle market commercial\nand industrial loan exposure was to customers headquartered within our primary market area, which is the Greater\nBoston metropolitan area and surrounding communities, including eastern Connecticut, southern New Hampshire and\nRhode Island. On occasion, we will make these types of loans outside of the primary market but generally only to\ncustomers with whom we have a pre-existing relationship.\nBecause of the unique business characteristics of the cannabis, wind and solar industries, which comprise most\nof our Structured Finance loans, many of these loans are to customers which have operations both within and outside of\nour primary market area.\nThe vast majority of the relationships in the commercial and industrial segment also have cash management and\ntreasury service product offerings tied to the relationships. These products include specific online banking tools, ACH\nproducts, wire capabilities, fraud prevention tools and other customized set-up that help the underlying business securely\nmanage the business’ cash. Generally, these products provide for additional fee income, along with enhanced risk\nmanagement, to the Bank and are managed within the commercial and industrial business unit of the Bank.\nConsumer Lending. We offer a variety of consumer loans to individuals who reside or work in our primary\nlending area, including loans that are secured by mobile homes, new and used automobiles, new and used boats and\nrecreational vehicles, solar panels, deposit accounts, as well as a limited number of unsecured loans, including student\nloans, home improvement loans and credit cards loans. In recent years we have purchased a variety of consumer loan\nportfolios from a third-party originator subject to our underwriting procedures. Largely as a result of these purchases,\nhigher yielding consumer loans increased $8.3 million, or 4.2% to $204.9 million at December 31, 2023 from\n$196.5 million at December 31, 2022 and from $39.4 million at December 31, 2021. Subject to market conditions, we\nintend to continue to modestly grow our consumer loan portfolio and we would expect this growth to come through\npartnerships with established third-party originators.\nConsumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest\nrates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to\nour existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing\nopportunities.\nOriginations, Sales and Purchases of Loans\nOur loan originations are generated by our banking personnel operating at our banking office and mortgage\nbrokers. Additionally, in recent years, we have purchased a variety of consumer loans. We also obtain referrals from\nexisting and former customers and from accountants, real estate brokers, builders and attorneys. All loans we originate\n14\nare underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures which incorporate Fannie Mae underwriting guidelines to the\nextent applicable for residential loans.\nWhile we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends\nupon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace by competing banks, thrifts, credit\nunions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced significantly by\nmarket interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period.\nConsistent with our interest rate risk strategy, we originate for sale and sell a portion of the long-term, fixed-\nrate, one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate on a servicing-retained, limited or no recourse\nbasis, while generally retaining shorter-term fixed-rate and all adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate\nloans in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio. We consider our balance sheet as well\nas market conditions on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether to hold loans we originate for investment or\nto sell such loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk\nmanagement standpoint.\nHistorically, we have also engaged in loan participations sales, with Needham Bank as the lead, for certain\nlarger commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans and have, on a limited basis, purchased participations\nfrom well-established financial institutions in our market area. Participations are periodically reported to the board of\ndirectors. In recent years we have also purchased a variety of consumer loan portfolios and would expect to continue to\npurchase consumer loans from several established third-party originators. At December 31, 2023, our highest combined\nparticipations with one bank was approximately 9.3% of total capital and was comprised of commercial real estate and\nmultifamily, commercial and industrial, and construction and land development loans.\nLoan Approval Procedures, Loans to One Borrower Limit and Lending Authority\nThe maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is generally\nlimited, by statute, to 20% of our capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of our surplus account,\nundivided profits and, after the completion of the conversion, capital stock. Loans secured by a first mortgage on\nresidential property occupied by the borrower are excluded from this limit. At December 31, 2023, our regulatory limit\non loans-to-one borrower was $125.8 million.\nAt December 31, 2023, our general internal limit on an aggregate loan relationship-to-one borrower (and related\nentities) was $55.0 million. Most of our largest loan relationships are to borrowers which have multiple loans with\nNeedham Bank and are collateralized by commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and construction and land\ndevelopment loans. Aggregate exposure limits can be increased above our internal limit up to the legal lending limit on\nan exception basis with the approval of the Credit Committee and the board of directors, and at December 31, 2023, we\nhad nine relationships in excess of $55.0 million which were secured by commercial and industrial and commercial real\nestate loans, including construction and land development loans. Each of these relationships was approved by the board\nof directors and at December 31, 2023 each of the loans underlying these relationships was performing in accordance\nwith their prepayment terms.\nOur lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures. Decisions on loans are\nmade consistent with our loan policies and procedures, and the underwriting and review of a loan decision is designed\nprimarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan.\nThe board of directors has overall responsibility for our lending policy, and the board reviews this policy at\nleast annually.\nThe board of directors has delegated loan approval authority to certain officers up to prescribed limits,\ndepending on the officer’s experience, the type of loan and whether the loan is secured or unsecured. Loans for\nresidential real estate of greater than $2.5 million require approval by management’s Credit Committee, which consists\nof the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Operating Officer (“COO”), Chief Credit Officer (“CCO”), SVP –\nManaged Assets Group Leader and managers of the Bank’s lending departments. Commercial loan relationships with\n15\ntotal loan exposure of greater than $3.0 million up to our internal loans-to-one relationship limitation require approval by\nthe Credit Committee. All commercial and industrial loans under $3.0 million are approved by the CCO (or designated\nsigner), and all commercial loan relationships with total loan exposure of greater than $3.0 million are approved by the\nCredit Committee. Loan policy exceptions are fully disclosed to the approving authority, either an individual officer or\nthe appropriate management or credit committee prior to approval. Reporting on Policy exceptions are included within\nthe Board package.\nGenerally, we require title insurance on our mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty\ninsurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property,\ndepending on the type of loan. We also require flood insurance if the improved property is determined to be in a flood\nzone area.\nDelinquencies and Non-Performing Assets\nDelinquency Procedures. When a borrower fails to make required payments on a loan, we take a number of\nsteps to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. We generally send a written\nnotice of non-payment to the borrower 15, 30, 60 and 90 days after a loan is first past due. We will additionally try to\ncontact the borrower by telephone after the 15th day after the due date.\nAll loans past due 90 days are put on non-accrual and reported to the board of directors monthly. Generally,\nwhen a loan becomes 90 days past due, the loan is transferred to our Managed Asset division, which attempts to\ndetermine underlying issues and develop a repayment plan with the borrower. If workout efforts are unsuccessful, the\nloan may be turned over to our attorneys to ensure that further collection activities are conducted in accordance with\napplicable laws and regulations. If our attorneys do not receive a response from the borrower, or if the terms of any\npayment plan established are not followed, then foreclosure proceedings may be initiated on loans secured by real estate.\nManagement submits a delinquent loan report detailing loans 30 days or more past due to the board of directors on\na monthly basis.\nWhen we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the real estate is\nclassified as foreclosed real estate until it is sold. The real estate is recorded at estimated fair value at the date of\nacquisition less estimated costs to sell, and any write-down resulting from the acquisition is charged to the allowance for\ncredit losses. Estimated fair value is based on an appraisal typically obtained before the foreclosure process is completed.\nSubsequent decreases in the value of the property are charged to operations. After acquisition, all costs incurred in\nmaintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are\ncapitalized to the extent of estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell.\nIn the course of resolving delinquent loans, we may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans.\nWe attempt to work-out alternative payment schedules with the borrowers in order to avoid foreclosure actions. As noted\nin Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we adopted ASU 2022-02 on January 1, 2023, which\neliminated troubled-debt restructuring (“TDR”) accounting. Prior to the adoption of this standard, we reviewed each loan\nthat was modified to identify whether a TDR had occurred. TDRs involved situations in which, for economic or legal\nreasons related to the borrower’s financial difficulties, we granted a concession to the borrower that we would not\notherwise have considered. Subsequent to our adoption of this standard, we apply the loan refinancing and restructuring\nguidance codified in paragraphs 310-20-35-9 through 35-11 of the Accounting Standards Codification to determine\nwhether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan.\nASU 2022-02 requires disclosure of loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The\nCompany did not modify any loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty during the year ended December 31,\n2023.\nIf a loan is on non-accrual at the time of restructuring, interest income is accrued after the borrower\ndemonstrates the ability to pay under the restructured terms through a sustained period of repayment performance, which\nis generally six consecutive months.\n16\nDelinquent Loans. The following table sets forth our loan delinquencies by type and amount at the dates\nindicated.\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n30-59 60-89 90 Days or 30-59 60-89 90 Days or\nDays Days More and Still Days Days More and Still\n(Dollars in thousands) Past Due Past Due Accruing Past Due Past Due Accruing\nReal estate loans:\nOne to four-family residential $ 1,903 $ — $ — $ 1,449 $ — $ —\nHome equity 288 65 — 728 490 —\nCommercial real estate 2,735 — — 4,243 — —\nConstruction and land development — — — — — —\nCommercial and industrial 2 1 — 38 — —\nConsumer 4,009 1,008 — 1,499 436 —\nTotal $ 8,937 $ 1,074 $ — $ 7,957 $ 926 $ —\nNon-Performing Assets. The following table sets forth information regarding our non-performing assets as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. As a result of the adoption of CECL beginning January 1, 2023, troubled debt\nrestructuring recognition and measurement has been eliminated. We had no loans 90 days or more delinquent and still\naccruing interest as of the dates presented.\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nReal estate loans:\nOne-to four-family residential $ 4,100 $ 5,579\nHome equity 590 818\nCommercial real estate 422 670\nConstruction and land development 10 10\nCommercial and industrial 4,138 5,086\nConsumer 1,538 859\nTotal $ 10,798 $ 13,022\nTotal non-accrual loans to total loans (1) 0.28% 0.43%\nTotal non-performing loans to total loans 0.28% 0.43%\nTotal non-performing assets to total assets 0.24% 0.36%\n(1) Includes both non-accrual loans and non-accruing troubled debt restructured loans for 2022.\nClassified Assets. Federal regulations provide that each insured savings institution classify its assets on a\nregular basis. In addition, in connection with examination of insured depository institutions, federal and Massachusetts\nbanking regulators have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, classify them. There are three\nclassifications for problem assets: “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is\ninadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.\n“Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain\n“some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in\nthose classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation\nin full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets\nclassified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without\nthe establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution\nto sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated\nas “special mention” by our management.\nWhen an insured depository institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may\nestablish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General\nallowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with\n17\nlending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an\ninsured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses\nequal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to\nthe classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory agencies,\nwhich may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.\nIn connection with the filing of our quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve Board and in accordance with our\nclassification of assets policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans\nrequire classification in accordance with applicable regulations.\nOn the basis of this review of our assets, our classified and special mention assets at December 31 were as\nfollows:\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nSubstandard loans $ 9,444 $ 10,532\nDoubtful loans 10 10\nLoss loans — —\nTotal classified loans $ 9,454 $ 10,542\nSpecial mention loans $ 12,622 $ 18,709\nOther Loans of Concern. There were no other loans at December 31, 2023 that are not already disclosed where\nthere is information about possible credit problems of borrowers that caused management to have serious doubts about\nthe ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and that may result in disclosure of such loans\nin the future.\nProvision for Credit Losses. On January 1, 2023, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which\nreplaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the CECL methodology.\nUnder this new current expected loss model, provisions for credit losses are charged to operations to establish an\nallowance for credit losses at a level to cover expected losses over the expected life of a loan or securities portfolio.\nUnder the previous “incurred loss” model, provisions for loan losses were charged to operations to establish an\nallowance for loan losses at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio that are both\nprobable and reasonably estimable at the date of the consolidated financial statements. In evaluating the level of the\nallowance for credit losses, management analyzes reasonable and supportable forecasts and several qualitative loan\nportfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues\nrelated to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans,\nexisting risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic\nconditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses.\nAs part of the initial adoption of the CECL standard on January 1, 2023, we recorded $1.1 million to the\nallowance for credit losses and $1.8 million for off-balance sheet commitments. The total of $2.9 million was tax\neffected and resulted in a decrease of $2.1 million to retained earnings.\nAdditionally, as part of the adoption of the CECL standard, for the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded\na provision for credit losses of $9.7 million and a provision of $4.2 million as a reserve for off-balance sheet\ncommitments, both of which are included in the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income.\nSubsequent to the CECL adoption, management refined the modeling assuming and enhanced the CECL calculation,\nincluding the reserve for unfunded commitments, specifically regarding the probability of funding assumptions related to\nunfunded commitments and enhanced the qualitative analysis used in the determination of expected credit losses. The\nimpact of these changes, in addition to growth in the unfunded commitment balances resulted in provisions for credit\nlosses of $4.2 million.\n18\nOur allowance for credit losses was $32.2 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to $25.0 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. The ratio of our allowance for credit losses to total loans was 0.83% at both December 31, 2023 and\n2022, while the allowance for credit losses to non-performing loans was 298% at December 31, 2023 compared to 192%\nat December 31, 2022. We had net charge offs of $3.6 million and $87,000 during the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. The increase in net charge-offs was caused by charge-offs in the higher yielding purchased\nconsumer loan portfolio.\nAdditions to the allowance for credit losses are provided by charges against income based on various factors,\nwhich, in our judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating probable losses. Credit losses are charged-off in the\nperiod the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed uncollectible. Generally, the Company will record a loan charge-off\n(including a partial charge-off) to reduce a loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less cost to sell,\nfor collateral dependent loans. We regularly review the loan portfolio in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses\nin accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAs an integral part of their examination process, the Commissioner and the Federal Reserve Board will\nperiodically review our allowance for credit losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may determine to adjust our\nallowance for credit losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process for establishing the\nallowance for credit losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the\nresponsibility of management. The Audit Committee reviews and approves the CECL calculation quarterly, including\nmanagement’s support for qualitative factors used in developing its allowance for credit losses.\nThe following table sets forth activity in our allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated.\nFor the years ended December31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022\nAllowance for credit losses at beginning of the period $ 25,028 $ 18,415\nAdjustment to allowance for adoption of ASU 2016-13 1,159 —\nProvision for credit losses - allowance for credit losses 9,657 6,700\nCharge offs\nOne-to Four-Family Residential (379) (35)\nCommercial and Industrial (679) —\nConsumer (3,487) (287)\nTotal charge-offs (4,545) (322)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off\nOne-to Four-Family Residential — 33\nCommercial Real Estate 48 48\nConsumer 875 154\nTotal recoveries 923 235\nNet (charge-offs) recoveries (3,622) (87)\nAllowance for credit losses at end of the period $ 32,222 $ 25,028\nAllowance to non-performing loans 298% 192%\nAllowance to total loans outstanding at the end of the period 0.83% 0.83%\nNet (charge-offs) recoveries to average loans outstanding during the period (0.10%) 0.00%\n19\nThe following table sets forth additional information with respect to charge-offs by category for the periods\nindicated.\nFor the year ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet (charge-offs) recoveries to average loans outstanding during the period:\nOne-to Four-Family Residential (0.04%) 0.00%\nCommercial and Industrial (0.15%) 0.00%\nConsumer (1.29%) (0.11%)\nAllocation of Allowance for Credit Losses.

Our investment policy is established by the board of directors. The objectives of the policy are to:\n(i) provide and maintain liquidity within the guidelines of the Massachusetts banking laws and regulations for loan\ndemand and deposit fluctuations, and to allow us to alter our liquidity position to meet both day-to-day and long-term\nchanges in assets and liabilities; (ii) manage interest rate risk in accordance with our interest rate risk policy; (iii) provide\ncollateral for pledging requirements; (iv) maximize return on our investments; and (v) maintain a balance of high quality\ndiversified investments to minimize risk. All purchase and sale transactions are reviewed by the Audit Committee, which\nconsists of the CEO, COO, Chief Financial Officer and certain board members, at least quarterly.\nOur investment policy is reviewed annually by our board of directors and all policy changes recommended by\nmanagement must be approved by the board. Authority to make investments under the approved guidelines are delegated\nto appropriate officers. The execution of specific actions with respect to securities held by Needham Bank rests with the\nAudit Committee within the scope of the established investment policy.\nWe have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations,\nsecurities of various government-sponsored enterprises and municipal governments, deposits at the FHLB, certificates of\ndeposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and investment grade marketable equity\nsecurities. We also are required to maintain an investment in FHLB stock. While we have the authority under applicable\nlaw to invest in derivative securities, we have not purchased derivative securities as an investment strategy.\n20\nAt December 31, 2023 we had $189.5 million of investment securities, representing 4.2% of our total assets,\nand our investment portfolio consisted primarily of U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities, government-sponsored\nresidential mortgage-backed securities (which includes collateralized mortgage obligations), municipal bonds and\ncorporate bonds.\nAt the time of purchase, we designate a security as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on\nour ability and intent. Securities available-for-sale or trading are reported at fair value, while securities held-to-maturity\nare reported at amortized cost. Consistent with our overall business and asset/liability management plan, which focuses\non sustaining adequate levels of core earnings, the base premise of our investment portfolio is that all securities\npurchased will be suitable to be held-to-maturity. However, at December 31, 2023, we had no securities which we\ndesignated held to maturity.\nSome of our securities are callable by the issuer. Although these securities may have a yield somewhat higher\nthan the yield of similar securities without such features, these securities are subject to the risk that they may be\nredeemed by the issuer prior to maturing in the event general interest rates decline. At December 31, 2023, we had\n$66.5 million of securities which were subject to redemption by the issuer prior to their stated maturity, including four\nsubordinated note agreements totaling $37.5 million issued by community bank mutual holding companies.\nThe Company measures expected credit losses on available-for-sale securities based upon the unrealized gain or\nloss position of the security. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company evaluates\nqualitative criteria to determine any expected loss unless the Company intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that\nthe Company will be required to sell before recovery of the amortized cost. In the latter two circumstances, the Company\nrecognizes the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value as a write-down of the\ninvestment balance with a charge to earnings. Otherwise, management’s analysis considers various factors, which\ninclude the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, performance on any underlying collateral, downgrades\nin the ratings of the security by a rating agency, the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments\nand adverse conditions specifically related to the security.\nAt December 31, 2023, our corporate bond portfolio consisted of investment grade securities with maturities\ngenerally shorter than 10 years. Our investment policy provides that we may invest within the three highest investment-\ngrade ratings from Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s. The maturity of these bonds generally may not exceed 10 years\nunless approved by the board of directors. Bonds that subsequently experience a decline in credit rating below\ninvestment grade are monitored at least quarterly.\nThe following table presents the fair value of our securities as of December 31, 2023 by their stated maturities\n(this maturity schedule excludes security prepayment and call features), as well as the weighted average yields for each\nmaturity range.\nD ue in one ye ar or less Due in one year to five years Due in five years to ten yea rs D ue after ten years\nWeighted Weighted Weighted Weighted\nFair Average Fair Average Fair Average Fair Average\n(In thousands) Value Yield Value Yield Value Yield Value Yield\nDecember 31, 2023\nDebt Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 41,400 2.1 % $ 22,952 0.9 % $ — - % $ — — %\nAgency mortgage-backed securities 2 (3.4) 330 3.6 2,638 0.8 8,460 2.2\nAgency collateralized mortgage\nobligations — - 282 1.3 — - 2,136 1.2\nCorporate bonds 12,894 2.7 49,455 1.7 29,886 3.1 — -\nMunicipal obligations 2,530 1.6 16,500 1.9 — - — -\nTotal $ 56,826 2.2 % $ 89,519 1.5 % $ 32,524 2.9 % $ 10,596 3.6 %\nFor additional information regarding our investment securities portfolio, see Note 2 to the notes to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to provide us with a funding source for\nour benefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides us noninterest income that is non-\n21\ntaxable. Applicable regulations generally limit our investment in bank-owned life insurance to 25% of our Tier 1 capital\nplus our allowance for credit losses. At December 31, 2023, we had $50.5 million in bank-owned life insurance,\nrepresenting 8.1% of Tier 1 capital.\nOther Securities. We hold common stock of the FHLB in connection with our borrowing activities. The FHLB\ncommon stock is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. It is not practicable to determine the fair\nvalue of FHLB common stock due to restrictions placed on its transferability. Under current FHLB rules, we will be\nrequired to purchase additional FHLB common stock if we increase borrowings in the future.\nWe maintain shares in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in order to meet criteria for membership in the\nFederal Reserve System. Dividends are paid semi-annually at the statutory rate of 6.0%. At December 31, 2023, we held\n206,450 shares of stock in the approximate amount of $10.3 million.\nWe also invest in certain equity securities which offer favorable tax treatment. See Note 2 to the notes to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nSources of Funds\nGeneral. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment\nactivities. We also use borrowings and brokered deposits to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of\nliabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled\nloan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, loan sales, retained earnings and income on earning assets.\nWhile scheduled loan payments and income on interest-earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit\ninflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of\ncompetition.\nDeposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from residents and businesses within our primary deposit market\narea. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand accounts,\nmoney market accounts, savings accounts and certificates of deposit including IRAs. Deposit account terms vary, with\nthe principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and\nthe interest rate. In recent years, we have also utilized brokered deposits as non-retail funding source to fund our\noperations. These non-core funding sources are not relationship-based accounts and are generally more price-sensitive\nthan our core deposits. Therefore, these deposits carry a greater risk of non-renewal than our core deposits. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, our core deposits, which are deposits other than brokered deposits, were $3.2 billion, representing\n94.6% of total deposits. At December 31, 2023, we had $183.6 million of brokered deposits and we had 26 municipal\ndeposit relationships in the aggregate amount of $83.2 million.\nAdditionally, At December 31, 2023, we believe that our highest concentration of industry-specific deposits\nwas from cannabis-related relationships. At December 31, 2023, we had 817 cannabis-related deposit relationships\ntotaling $277.2 million, or 8.2% of total deposits, of which $144.0 million were directly related to the cannabis industry\n(e.g., growing, transporting, packaging, distributing, or selling cannabis) and $133.2 million were indirectly related to\nthe cannabis industry. At December 31, 2023, we do not believe that we have significant concentrations among our\nlarger deposit accounts from venture capital funds, or their portfolio companies, or from out-of-market businesses.\nInterest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit\nrates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by\ncompetitors and growth goals. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes\nin interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating\ndeposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers’ demands. Our ability to gather deposits is impacted\nby the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering\na wide range of products. We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain\ndeposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates.\n22\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of total deposits, by account type, at the dates indicated.\nAt December 31,\n2023 2022\nAverage Average\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percent Rate Amount Percent Rate\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 528,409 15.60% — % $ 445,518 15.43% —%\nSavings accounts 127,640 3.77% 0.05 % 163,257 5.66% 0.05%\nNOW accounts 345,753 10.21% 0.30 % 408,894 14.16% 0.07%\nMoney market accounts 888,511 26.23% 2.55 % 659,455 22.84% 1.12%\nCertificates of deposit and individual retirement\naccounts 1,497,035 44.19% 3.90 % 1,209,619 41.90% 2.65%\nTotal $3,387,348 100.00% 2.56 % $2,886,743 100.00% 1.38%\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate amount of time deposits we had in amounts greater than\n$250,000, which is the maximum amount for federal deposit insurance, was $544.2 million and $915.0 million,\nrespectively.\nThe following table sets forth, by time remaining until maturity, the portion of our time deposits that are in\nexcess of the FDIC insurance limit at December 31, 2023.\nDecember 31, 2023\n(Dollars in thousands)\nMaturity period:\nThree months or less $ 222,174\nOver three months through six months 292,855\nOver six months through 12 months 21,542\nOver 12 months 7,675\nTotal $ 544,246\nAll of our deposits are fully insured due to the additional insurance provided to a Massachusetts cooperative\nbank, such as Needham Bank, under the DIF, a private industry-sponsored insurance fund in Massachusetts that insures\nall deposits at Needham Bank above FDIC limits.\nBorrowing Capacity. As a member of the FHLB, Needham Bank is eligible to obtain advances upon the\nsecurity of the FHLB common stock owned and certain residential mortgage loans, provided certain standards related to\ncredit-worthiness have been met. FHLB advances are available pursuant to several credit programs, each of which has its\nown interest rate and range of maturities. At December 31, 2023, we had the ability to borrow an additional\n$508.0 million from the FHLB, subject to certain collateral requirements and had advances of $283.3 million at such\ndate. At December 31, 2023 we also had an additional line of credit from the FHLB in the amount of $6.1 million. We\nhad no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at December 31, 2023.\nAdditionally, at December 31, 2023 we had secured Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window borrowing\ncapacity of $49.6 million, and at December 31, 2023, we had no such borrowings.\nUnder the Bank’s Liquidity Policy, we test access to all off-balance sheet liquidity sources periodically, but no\nless than annually.\nSubsidiary and Other Activities\nNeedham Bank is the wholly owned subsidiary of NB Bancorp.\nNeedham Bank has three subsidiaries: Needco-op Investment Corporation, Inc. (“Needco”), a Massachusetts\ncorporation, which is engaged in the buying, selling and holding of investment securities. The income earned on\nNeedco’s securities is subject to a significantly lower rate of state tax than that assessed on income earned on securities\nmaintained at Needham Bank. At December 31, 2023, Needco had total assets of $93.0 million, substantially all of\nwhich were in securities, federal funds, and cash to be invested.\n23\nThe Bank’s other subsidiaries are Eaton Square Realty LLC and 1892 Investments LLC, both of which hold\ncertain real estate investments for Needham Bank, including investor tax credit investments. These entities enable us to\nsegregate certain assets for management purposes, and or borrow against assets or stock of these entities for liquidity\npurposes.\nExpense and Tax Allocation\nNeedham Bank has entered into an agreement with NB Bancorp to provide it with certain administrative\nsupport services for compensation not less than the fair market value of the services provided. In addition, Needham\nBank and NB Bancorp will enter into an agreement to establish a method for allocating and for reimbursing the payment\nof their consolidated tax liability.\nPersonnel\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 342 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by\nany collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees.\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nGeneral\nNeedham Bank is a Massachusetts-chartered cooperative bank and is the wholly owned subsidiary of NB\nBancorp, Inc., which is a Maryland corporation, and a registered bank holding company. Needham Bank’s deposits are\ninsured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and by the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund (“DIF”), a private\nindustry-sponsored insurance fund, for amounts in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. Needham Bank is subject to\nextensive regulation by the Massachusetts Division of Banks, as its chartering agency, and by the Federal Reserve\nBoard, its primary federal regulator. It is also regulated by the FDIC as the insurer of its deposit accounts. Needham\nBank must also comply with consumer protection regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as\nenforced by the Federal Reserve Board. Needham Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by\nthe Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain\nregulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions\nof other financial institutions. As a registered bank holding company, NB Bancorp is regulated by the Federal Reserve\nBoard. Needham Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the FHLB, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the\nFederal Home Loan Bank System.\nUnder this system of regulation, the regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their\nsupervisory, enforcement, rulemaking and examination activities and policies, including rules or policies that: establish\nminimum capital levels; restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments; govern the classification of assets; provide\noversight for the adequacy of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes and the adequacy of its risk management\nframework; and establish the timing and amounts of assessments and fees imposed by the regulatory agencies.\nMoreover, as part of their examination authority, the banking regulators assign numerical ratings to banks and savings\ninstitutions relating to capital, asset quality, management, liquidity, earnings and other factors. These ratings rely on the\nsupervisor’s judgment and the receipt of a less than satisfactory rating in one or more categories may result in\nenforcement action by the banking regulators against a financial institution. A less than satisfactory rating may also\nprevent a financial institution, such as Needham Bank or its holding company, from obtaining necessary regulatory\napprovals to access the capital markets, pay dividends, acquire other financial institutions or establish new branches.\nIn addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws and regulations,\nCommunity Reinvestment Act laws and regulations, and fair lending laws and regulations. Government agencies have\nthe authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on institutions that fail to comply with these laws and\nregulations, which could significantly affect our business activities, including our ability to acquire other financial\ninstitutions or expand our branch network.\n24\nNB Bancorp is a bank holding company and is required to comply with the Bank Holding Company Act of\n1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. It is required to file certain\nreports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal\nReserve Board. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board may directly examine the subsidiaries of a bank holding\ncompany, including Needham Bank. NB Bancorp will also be subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission under the federal securities laws.\nAny change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the Massachusetts legislature, the Commissioner, the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission\nor Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of NB Bancorp and\nNeedham Bank.\nSet forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Needham Bank\nand NB Bancorp. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is\nnot intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Needham Bank and NB\nBancorp.\nMassachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision Applicable to the Bank\nGeneral. As a Massachusetts-chartered cooperative bank, Needham Bank is subject to supervision, regulation\nand examination by the Commissioner and to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations which govern, among other\nthings, investment powers, lending and deposit-taking activities, borrowings, maintenance of surplus and reserve\naccounts, distribution of earnings and payment of dividends. In addition, Needham Bank is subject to Massachusetts\nconsumer protection, Community Reinvestment Act, civil rights laws and regulations. The approval of the\nCommissioner is required for a Massachusetts-chartered bank to establish or close branches, merge with other financial\ninstitutions, issue stock and undertake certain other activities.\nMassachusetts regulations generally allow Massachusetts banks, with appropriate regulatory approvals, to\nengage in activities permissible for federally chartered banks or banks chartered by another state. The Commissioner\nalso has adopted procedures reducing regulatory burdens and expense and expediting branching by well-capitalized and\nwell-managed banks.\nDividends. A Massachusetts stock bank may declare cash dividends from net profits not more frequently than\nquarterly. Noncash dividends may be declared at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited or paid if a bank’s\ncapital stock is impaired. The approval of the Commissioner is required if the total of all dividends declared in any\ncalendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding\ntwo years. Dividends from NB Bancorp may depend, in part, upon receipt of dividends from Needham Bank. The\npayment of dividends from Needham Bank would be restricted by federal law if the payment of such dividends resulted\nin Needham Bank failing to meet regulatory capital requirements.\nLoans to One Borrower Limitations. Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However,\nwith certain limited exceptions, total obligations to one borrower may not exceed 20% of the total of an institution’s\ncapital stock (if any), surplus and undivided profits. The Commissioner applies the Office of the Comptroller of the\nCurrency’s attribution rules to a borrower’s related interests. At December 31, 2023, Needham Bank was in compliance\nwith the loans-to-one borrower limitations.\nLoans to a Bank’s Insiders. Under Massachusetts law, a Massachusetts-chartered bank must comply with\nRegulation O of the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner retains examination and enforcement authority to\nensure compliance.\nInvestment Activities. In general, Massachusetts-chartered banks may invest in preferred and common stock of\nany corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve\ncontrol of any corporation and do not, in the aggregate, exceed 4% of a bank’s deposits. Federal law imposes additional\nrestrictions on Needham Bank’s investment activities.\n25\nRegulatory Enforcement Authority. Any Massachusetts bank that does not operate in accordance with the\nregulations, policies and directives of the Commissioner may be subject to sanctions for noncompliance, including\nrevocation of its charter. The Commissioner may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors\nwho have violated the law, conducted the bank’s business in an unsafe or unsound manner or contrary to the depositors’\ninterests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. Upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or\ndeceptive act or practice, the Commissioner may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank\nconcerned. The Commissioner also has authority to take possession of a bank and appoint the FDIC as receiver under\ncertain conditions such as an unsafe and unsound condition to transact business, the conduct of business in an unsafe or\nunauthorized manner or impaired capital. In addition, Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes\napplicable to Needham Bank permit private individual and class action law suits and provide for the rescission of\nconsumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees in the\ncase of certain violations of those statutes.\nExcess Deposit Insurance Fund. Massachusetts-chartered cooperative banks are members of the DIF, a private\nindustry-sponsored insurance fund in Massachusetts that insures all deposits at Needham Bank above FDIC limits. In the\nfuture, if the aggregate amount of our deposits in excess of the federal deposit insurance limit (which is $250,000 per\ndepositor) exceed the threshold as established by the DIF, which at December 31, 2023 was $1.10 billion, then we may\nbe required to exit from the DIF resulting in these excess deposits no longer being insured above FDIC-limits, beginning\none year after such exit.\nProtection of Personal Information. Massachusetts banking regulations contain requirements intended to\nprotect personal information and are similar to federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, discussed below under\n“– Federal Regulations Applicable to the Bank” and “– Other Regulations,” that require organizations to establish\nwritten information security programs to prevent identity theft. The Massachusetts regulation also contains technology\nsystem requirements, especially for the encryption of personal information sent over wireless or public networks or\nstored on portable devices.\nInsurance Sales. Massachusetts banks may engage in insurance sales activities if the Commissioner has\napproved a plan of operation for insurance activities and the bank obtains a license from the Massachusetts Division of\nInsurance. A bank may be licensed directly or indirectly through an affiliate or a subsidiary corporation established for\nthis purpose. Needham Bank does not currently sell insurance products, and has not sought approval for direct insurance\nsales activities. Needham Bank is licensed to solicit and refer potential insurance customers to an unaffiliated, third-party\nlicensed insurance producer.\nParity Regulation. A Massachusetts bank may exercise, with appropriate regulatory approvals, any power and\nengage in any activity that has been authorized for national banks, federal thrifts or state banks in a state other than\nMassachusetts, provided that the activity is permissible under applicable federal law and not specifically prohibited by\nMassachusetts law. Such powers and activities must be subject to the same limitations and restrictions imposed on the\nnational bank, federal thrift or out-of-state bank that exercised the power or activity.\nMassachusetts has other statutes or regulations that are similar to certain of the federal provisions discussed\nbelow.\nFederal Regulations Applicable to the Bank\nCapital Requirements. Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several\nminimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-\nbased assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0%, and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage\nratio of 4.0%.\nIn determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including\ncertain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a\nrisk-weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of\ncapital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally\n26\ndefined as common stockholders’ equity and related surplus and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as\ncommon equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain non-cumulative perpetual\npreferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital\nincludes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is\ncomprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative\npreferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock\nand subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for credit losses limited to a maximum of 1.25%\nof risk-weighted assets. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified\nin the regulations. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these\nnumeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for\nindividual institutions where deemed necessary.\nIn addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital\ndistributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital\nconservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount\nnecessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nFederal law required the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, to establish a\n“community bank leverage ratio” of between 8% and 10% for institutions with total consolidated assets of less than\n$10 billion. Institutions with capital complying with the ratio and otherwise meeting the specified requirements and\nelecting the alternative framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements,\nincluding the risk-based requirements. The community bank leverage ratio was established at 9% Tier 1 capital to total\naverage assets, effective January 1, 2020. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage\nratio framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is\nprovided with a two-quarter grace period to regain compliance. Failure to meet the qualifying criteria within the grace\nperiod or maintain a leverage ratio of 8% or greater requires the institution to comply with the generally applicable\nregulatory capital requirements.\nAt December 31, 2023, Needham Bank had opted into the community bank leverage ratio framework and its\nleverage capital ratio exceeded the applicable requirement.\nCapital Distributions. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”) generally provides that an insured\ndepository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail\nto meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. Unless the approval of the Federal Reserve Board is obtained,\nNeedham Bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the calendar year,\nincluding the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of its net income during the current calendar year and the retained net\nincome of the prior two calendar years. Payments of dividends by Needham Bank are also subject to other banking law\nrestrictions, such as the Federal Reserve Board’s authority to prevent a bank from paying dividends if such payment\nwould constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice or reduce a bank’s capital below safe and sound levels and\nMassachusetts banking law restrictions which require dividends to be paid from net profits for the current and two\nprevious years, and which preclude a Massachusetts bank from paying dividends if its capital is, or would become,\nimpaired.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All insured depository institutions have a\nresponsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their\ncommunities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers, consistent with its safe and sound banking operations.\nThe Federal Reserve Board’s Community Reinvestment Act regulations are generally based upon objective criteria of\nthe performance of institutions under three key assessment tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of\nmaking loans in its service areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community\ndevelopment projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low- or moderate-income individuals and businesses;\nand (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices.\nThe Federal Reserve Board is required to assess Needham Bank’s record of compliance with the Community\nReinvestment Act. An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a\nminimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its\n27\nactivities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in\ntheir lending practices. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could\nresult in enforcement actions by the Federal Reserve Board, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the\nDepartment of Justice.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating.\nNeedham Bank received a “Satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination.\nMassachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA which is also applicable to Needham Bank. The\nMassachusetts version is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Massachusetts\nlaw requires the Commissioner to consider, but not be limited to, a bank’s record of performance under Massachusetts\nlaw in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office\nor to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. Needham\nBank’s most recent November 2022 CRA performance rating under Massachusetts law was “High Satisfactory.”\nTransactions with Related Parties. An insured depository institution’s authority to engage in transactions with\nits affiliates is generally limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate\nis generally a company that controls, or is under common control with, an insured depository institution such as\nNeedham Bank. NB Bancorp is an affiliate of Needham Bank because of its control of Needham Bank. In general,\ntransactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and\ncollateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a state-chartered bank from lending to any of its\naffiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the\nsecurities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and\nsound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the\ninstitution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates.\nNeedham Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as\nto entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the\nFederal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally\nrequire that extensions of credit to insiders:\n• be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not\nless stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not\ninvolve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and\n• not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the\naggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Needham Bank’s capital.\nIn addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Needham Bank’s board of\ndirectors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension\ninvolved.\nEnforcement. The Federal Reserve Board has extensive enforcement authority over insured state member\nbanks. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease\nand desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to\nviolations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve\nBoard is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if\nthat bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on\nwhich the institution became “critically undercapitalized.” The Federal Reserve Board may also appoint itself as\nconservator or receiver for an insured state non-member bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency;\n(2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of\nan unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will\ndeplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal\nassistance.\n28\nStandards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain\nstandards for the insured depository institutions they supervise. These standards relate to, among other things, internal\ncontrols, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure,\nasset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation and benefits, and other operational and managerial standards as the\nagency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking\nagencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the\nappropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines,\nthe agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the\nstandard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution\nto implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action,\nincluding the issuance of a cease and desist order and/or the imposition of civil money penalties.\nBranching. Federal law permits insured state banks to engage in interstate branching if the laws of the state\nwhere the new banking office is to be established would permit the establishment of the banking office if it were\nchartered by a bank in such state. Under current Massachusetts law, Needham Bank can establish a branch in\nMassachusetts or in any other state. All branch applications require prior approval of the Commissioner and the FDIC.\nFinally, Needham Bank may also establish banking offices in other states by merging with banks or by purchasing\nbanking offices of other banks in other states, subject to certain restrictions.\nAcquisitions. Prior approval from the Commissioner and Federal Reserve Board is required in order for\nNeedham Bank to acquire another bank. Well capitalized and well managed banks may acquire other banks in any state,\nsubject to certain deposit concentration limits and other conditions, pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and\nBranching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nActivities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Member Banks. The Federal Reserve Act generally\nlimits the types of equity investments a Federal Reserve member bank, such as Needham Bank, may make, and the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act generally limits the kinds of activities in which such an FDIC-insured state-chartered\nbank may engage, as a principal, to those that are permissible for national banks. Further, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\n(“GLBA”) permits national banks and state banks, to the extent permitted under state law, to engage via financial\nsubsidiaries in certain activities that are permissible for subsidiaries of a financial holding company. In order to form a\nfinancial subsidiary, a state-chartered bank must be “well capitalized,” and such banks must comply with certain capital\ndeduction, risk management and affiliate transaction rules, among other requirements.\nBrokered Deposits. The FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository\ninstitution to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution’s capital category is “well capitalized”\nor, with the FDIC’s approval, “adequately capitalized.” Depository institutions that have brokered deposits in excess of\n10% of total assets may be subject to increased FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. However, for institutions\nthat are well capitalized and have a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2, reciprocal deposits are deducted from brokered\ndeposits. Section 202 of the Economic Growth Act, which was enacted in 2018, amends the FDIA to exempt a capped\namount of reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits for certain insured depository institutions.\nPrompt Corrective Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal banking agencies take\n“prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose,\nthe Federal Reserve Board’s regulations establish five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized,\nundercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under applicable regulations, an\ninstitution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-\nbased capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or\ngreater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-\nbased capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or\ngreater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based\ncapital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An\ninstitution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a\nTier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of\n29\nless than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as\ndefined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.\nAt each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and\nprohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions\non the payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured\ndepository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration\nplan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan.\nBased upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may\nbe treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and\nopportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such\ntreatment. An undercapitalized bank’s compliance with a capital restoration plan is required to be guaranteed by any\ncompany that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total\nassets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an\n“undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.”\n“Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including a\nregulatory order to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets,\nceasing receipt of deposits from correspondent banks, dismissal of directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates\npaid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically\nundercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the\nappointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.\nThe previously referenced final rule establishing an elective “community bank leverage ratio” regulatory capital\nframework provides that a qualifying institution whose capital exceeds the community bank leverage ratio and opts to\nuse that framework will be considered “well-capitalized” for purposes of prompt corrective action.\nAt December 31, 2023, Needham Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized.”\nInsurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured\nfinancial institutions such as Needham Bank, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor.\nThe FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nUnder the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky of failure pay lower\nassessments. Assessments for institutions of less than $10 billion of assets are based on financial measures and\nsupervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution’s failure within\nthree years.\nThe FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse\neffect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Needham Bank. For 2023, the FDIC insurance expense for\nNeedham Bank was $4.1 million. We cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.\nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or\nunsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law,\nregulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the Federal Reserve Board. Needham Bank does not know of any\npractice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of its deposit insurance.\nPrivacy Regulations. Federal regulations generally require that Needham Bank disclose its privacy policy,\nincluding identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of\nestablishing the customer relationship. Needham Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place, provides each\nnew customer with this policy at the time of an initial account opening, and believes that such policy is in compliance\nwith the regulations. Most states, including Massachusetts, have enacted legislation concerning breaches of data security\nand the duties of Needham Bank in response to a data breach. Congress continues to consider federal legislation that\nwould require consumer notice of data security breaches. In addition, Massachusetts has promulgated data security\nregulations with respect to personal information of their residents. Pursuant to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions\n30\nAct (the “FACT Act”), Needham Bank had to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program to\ndetect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing\naccounts. Additionally, the FACT Act amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act to generally prohibit a person from using\ninformation received from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer, unless the consumer\nis given notice and a reasonable opportunity and method to opt out of the making of such solicitations.\nAnti-Money Laundering - The Bank Secrecy Act. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), a financial institution\nis required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction.\nFinancial institutions are generally required to report to the U.S. Treasury any cash transactions involving at least\n$10,000. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for any transaction or series of\ntransactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect\ninvolves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The USA PATRIOT\nAct, which amended the BSA, together with the implementing regulations of various federal regulatory agencies, has\ncaused financial institutions, such as the Bank, to adopt and implement additional policies or amend existing policies and\nprocedures with respect to, among other things, anti-money laundering compliance, suspicious activity, currency\ntransaction reporting, customer identity verification and customer risk analysis. In evaluating an application to acquire a\nbank or to merge banks or effect a purchase of assets and assumption of deposits and other liabilities, the applicable\nfederal banking regulator must consider the anti-money laundering compliance record of both the applicant and the\ntarget. In addition, under the USA PATRIOT Act financial institutions are required to take steps to monitor their\ncorrespondent banking and private banking relationships as well as, if applicable, their relationships with “shell banks.”\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control. The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with\ndesignated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by the Office of Foreign\nAssets Control (“OFAC”), take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following\nelements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or\nindirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial or\nother transactions relating to a sanctioned country or with certain designated persons and entities; (ii) a blocking of\nassets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by\nprohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S.\npersons); and (iii) restrictions on transactions with or involving certain persons or entities. Blocked assets (for example,\nproperty and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from\nOFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences for Needham\nBank.\nProhibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Needham Bank is prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from\nextending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or\nservice, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not\nobtain services of a competitor of the institution.\nConsumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. Needham Bank is subject to a variety of federal and\nMassachusetts statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting\nof credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including\nimposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil\naction for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes, including Section 5 of the Federal\nTrade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices against consumers, authorize private\nindividual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for\ncertain types of violations. Federal laws also prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices against consumers,\nwhich can be enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and state\nattorneys general.\n31\nOther Regulations\nInterest and other charges collected or contracted for by Needham Bank are subject to state usury laws and\nfederal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit\ntransactions, such as the:\n• Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public\nand public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the\nhousing needs of the community it serves;\n• Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited\nfactors in extending credit;\n• Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and\n• Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such\nfederal laws.\nThe deposit operations of Needham Bank also are subject to, among others, the:\n• Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial\nrecords and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;\n• Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,”\nsuch as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original\npaper check; and\n• Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits\nto and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of\nautomated teller machines and other electronic banking services.\nFederal Home Loan Bank System\nNeedham Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal\nHome Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks provide central credit facilities primarily for member institutions.\nMembers of a Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in their Federal Home\nLoan Bank. Needham Bank complied with this requirement at December 31, 2023. Based on redemption provisions of\nthe Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. Needham Bank\nreviews for impairment, based on the ultimate recoverability, the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston\nstock. At December 31, 2023, no impairment had been recognized.\nBank Holding Company Regulation\nNB Bancorp is a bank holding company within the meaning of the BHCA. As such, NB Bancorp is registered\nwith the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements\napplicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over NB\nBancorp and its non-bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict\nor prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to Needham Bank.\nA bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or\nindirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the\nprincipal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to\nbanking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the\n32\nFederal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing\nloans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as\nfiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations\nor projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings association whose direct and\nindirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies.\nNB Bancorp is subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies\n(on a consolidated basis). The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital\nrequirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of\ncomponents of capital, than those applicable to the depository institutions themselves. Consolidated regulatory capital\nrequirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks apply to bank holding companies.\nBy law, bank holding companies must act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by\nproviding capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. This support may be required at times when NB\nBancorp may not have the resources to provide support to Needham Bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s\nbankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of\na bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.\nThe Federal Reserve Board has issued supervisory policies regarding the payment of dividends and the\nrepurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should\nbe paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company\nappears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory\nguidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as\nwhere the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of capital distributions previously paid over that period, is\ninsufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the\ncompany’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be\nrestricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should\ninform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual\npreferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would\nresult in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the\nbeginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability\nof NB Bancorp to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.\nNB Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from Needham Bank and any of its other subsidiaries.\nRevenues of NB Bancorp are derived primarily from dividends paid to it by Needham Bank and NB Bancorp’s other\nsubsidiaries. The right of NB Bancorp, and consequently the right of shareholders of NB Bancorp, to participate in any\ndistribution of the assets or earnings of its subsidiaries, through the payment of such dividends or otherwise, is subject to\nthe prior claims of creditors of the subsidiaries, including, with respect to the Bank, depositors of the Bank, except to the\nextent that certain claims of NB Bancorp in a creditor capacity may be recognized.\nMassachusetts Holding Company Regulation. Under Massachusetts banking laws, a company owning or\ncontrolling two or more banking institutions, including a cooperative bank, is regulated by the Commissioner as a bank\nholding company. Each such bank holding company: (i) must obtain the approval of the Massachusetts Board of Bank\nIncorporation before engaging in certain transactions, such as the acquisition of more than 5% of the voting stock of\nanother banking institution; (ii) must register, and file reports, with the Commissioner; and (iii) is subject to examination\nby the Commissioner. NB Bancorp would become a bank holding company regulated by the Commissioner if it acquires\na second banking institution and holds and operates it separately from Needham Bank.\nChange in Control Regulations\nUnder the Change in Bank Control Act, no person or group of persons may acquire “control” of a bank holding\ncompany, such as NB Bancorp, unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days prior written notice and has\nnot issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the\nfinancial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined\n33\nunder federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class\nof voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by\nthe regulator that the acquirer has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the\nmanagement or policies of the institution. There is a presumption of control upon the acquisition of 10% or more of a\nclass of voting stock if the holding company involved has its shares registered under the Exchange Act, or, if the holding\ncompany involved does now have its shares registered under the Exchange Act, if no other persons will own, control or\nhold the power to vote a greater percentage of that class of voting security after the acquisition.\nIn addition, the BHCA prohibits any company from acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company\nwithout first having obtained the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other circumstances, under the BHCA,\na company has control of a bank or bank holding company if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote\n25% or more of a class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company, controls in any manner the election of\na majority of directors or trustees of the bank or bank holding company, or the Federal Reserve Board has determined,\nafter notice and opportunity for hearing, that the company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the\nmanagement or policies of the bank or bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board has established presumptions\nof control under which the acquisition of control of 5% or more of a class of voting securities of a bank holding\ncompany, together with other factors enumerated by the Federal Reserve Board, could constitute the acquisition of\ncontrol of a bank holding company for purposes of the BHCA.\nFederal Securities Laws\nThe common stock of NB Bancorp is registered with the SEC. NB Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy\nsolicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced\npenalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving\nthe accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. We have policies, procedures and\nsystems designed to comply with these regulations, and we review and document such policies, procedures and systems\nto ensure continued compliance with these regulations.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nNB Bancorp is an emerging growth company. For as long as it continues to be an emerging growth company, it\nmay choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to public companies. These\nexemptions include, but are not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our\nperiodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on\nexecutive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an\nemerging growth company, NB Bancorp is also not subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which\nwould require that our independent auditors audit our internal control over financial reporting. We have also elected to\nuse the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public\ncompanies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Such an election is irrevocable during\nthe period a company is an emerging growth company.\nNB Bancorp will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year\nfollowing the fifth anniversary of the completion of the conversion and offering; (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual\ngross revenues are $1.235 billion (adjusted for inflation) or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous\nthree-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in\nwhich the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million at the end of the second\nquarter of that fiscal year. We expect to lose our status as an emerging growth company effective December 31, 2028,\nwhich is the end of the fifth year after the completion date of the conversion and offering.\n34\nTAXATION\nFederal Taxation\nGeneral. NB Bancorp and Needham Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as\nother corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only\nto summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to\nNB Bancorp and Needham Bank.\nMethod of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, NB Bancorp currently reports its income and\nexpenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax\nreturns.\nAlternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20%\non a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, less an exemption amount, referred to as “alternative\nminimum taxable income.” The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent tax computed this way exceeds tax\ncomputed by applying the regular tax rates to regular taxable income. Net operating losses can, in general, offset no\nmore than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as\ncredits against regular tax liabilities in future years. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the alternative minimum tax for\nincome generated after January 1, 2018. At December 31, 2023, NB Bancorp had no minimum tax credit carryovers.\nNet Operating Loss Carryovers. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally, a financial institution may\ncarry net operating losses forward indefinitely. At December 31, 2023, NB Bancorp had no federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards.\nCapital Loss Carryovers. A corporation cannot recognize capital losses in excess of capital gains generated.\nGenerally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the\nsucceeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year\nto which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which it is carried and is used to\noffset any capital gains. Any undeducted loss remaining after the five-year carryover period is not deductible. At\nDecember 31, 2023, NB Bancorp had no capital loss carryovers.\nCorporate Dividends. NB Bancorp may generally exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from\nNeedham Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.\nAudit of Tax Returns. Needham Bank’s federal income tax returns, nor the consolidated returns of NB Bancorp\nor NB Financial, MHC’s and NB Financial, Inc.’s, Needham Bank’s former holding companies have not been audited in\nthe most recent five-year period.\nState Taxation\nFinancial institutions in Massachusetts file combined income tax returns with affiliated companies that are not\nsecurity corporations. The Massachusetts excise tax rate for cooperative banks is currently 9.0% of federal taxable\nincome, adjusted for certain items. Taxable income includes gross income as defined under the Internal Revenue Code,\nplus interest from bonds, notes and evidences of indebtedness of any state, including Massachusetts, less deductions, but\nnot the credits, allowable under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, except for those deductions relating to\ndividends received and income or franchise taxes imposed by a state or political subdivision. Carryforwards and\ncarrybacks of net operating losses and capital losses are not allowed. Neither NB Bancorp’s nor Needham Bank’s state\ntax returns, as well as those of its subsidiaries have not been audited in the most recent five-year period.\nA financial institution or business corporation is generally entitled to special tax treatment as a “security\ncorporation” under Massachusetts law provided that: (a) its activities are limited to buying, selling, dealing in or holding\nsecurities on its own behalf and not as a broker; and (b) it has applied for, and received, classification as a “security\ncorporation” by the Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. A security corporation that is also a\n35\nbank holding company under the Internal Revenue Code must pay a tax equal to 0.33% of its gross income. A security\ncorporation that is not a bank holding company under the Internal Revenue Code must pay a tax equal to 1.32% of its\ngross income. Needham Bank’s wholly owned subsidiary, Needco-op Investment Corporation, which engages in\nsecurities transactions on its own behalf, is qualified as a security corporation. As such, it has received security\ncorporation classification by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue and does not conduct any activities deemed\nimpermissible under the governing statutes and the various regulations, directives, letter rulings and administrative\npronouncements issued by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue.\nAs a Maryland business corporation, NB Bancorp is required to file an annual report with and pay franchise\ntaxes to the state of Maryland.\nAvailability of Annual Report on Form 10-K\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K is available on our website at www.needhambank.com. Information on the\nwebsite is not incorporated into, and is not otherwise considered a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to factors discussed in the description of our business and elsewhere in this Annual Report, the\nfollowing are factors that could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Lending Activities\nOur portfolios of commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans have increased in recent\nperiods, and we intend to continue originating these types of loans. These loans involve credit risks that could\nadversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2023, commercial real estate, multifamily loans and construction and land development loans,\ntotaled $2.01 billion, or 51.5% of our loan portfolio, and commercial and industrial loans, including those secured by\nowner-occupied real estate, totaled $487.8 million, or 12.5% of our loan portfolio. These loans generally have more risk\nthan the one-to four-family residential real estate loans we originate. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to\nsingle borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. In addition,\nthe repayment of these types of loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower’s businesses\nor properties. The repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or\neconomy. Also, many of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. At December 31,\n2023, our loans-to-one borrower limit was $125.8 million and our four largest borrower relationships, including\navailable lines of credit, were $76.2 million, $70.6 million, $68.5 million and $67.6 million, respectively. Consequently,\nan adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of\nloss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential real estate loan. Commercial\nand industrial loans expose us to additional risk since they typically are dependent on the borrower’s ability to make\nrepayments from the cash flows of the business and are sometimes secured by non-real estate collateral that may\ndepreciate over time, such as inventory and accounts receivable, the value of which may be more difficult to appraise,\ncontrol or collect and may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value at the time of default. In addition, if we foreclose\non commercial real estate loans, our holding period for the collateral may be longer than for a single-family residential\nproperty if there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Furthermore, if loans that are collateralized by\ncommercial real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not\nbe able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the\nloan. Any of these risks could cause us to increase our provision for credit losses and adversely affect our operating\nresults and financial condition.\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio subjects us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nThe Federal Reserve Board and the other federal bank regulatory agencies have promulgated joint guidance on\nsound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under\n36\nthe guidance, a financial institution that is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk\nassessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending\nif, among other factors, (i) total reported loans for construction, land acquisition and development, and other land\nrepresent 100% or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multifamily and non-farm residential\nproperties, loans for construction, land acquisition and development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the\ngeneral commercial real estate market, including loans to non-owner occupied commercial real estate related entities,\nrepresent 300% or more of total capital.\nBased on these factors we could be deemed to have a concentration in commercial real estate lending, as such\nloans represent approximately 234.9% of our total capital as of December 31, 2023. The guidance focuses on exposure\nto commercial real estate loans that is dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that is likely\nto be at greater risk to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a\nsecondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The guidance assists banks in developing risk\nmanagement practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The\nguidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management\noversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market\nanalysis and stress testing. While we believe we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to our\ncommercial real estate loan portfolio consistent with this guidance, bank regulators could require us to implement\nadditional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs\nto us or that may result in a curtailment of our commercial real estate lending, including multifamily and construction\nand land development lending, and/or the requirement that we maintain higher levels of regulatory capital, either of\nwhich would adversely affect our loan originations and profitability.\nOur construction and land development loans involve credit risks that could adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2023, construction loans and loans to finance the acquisition of developable land which we\nrefer to as “land development loans” totaled $622.7 million, or 16.0% of our loan portfolio and 100.4% of our the\nBank’s total capital. Construction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent finance lending\nbecause funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value before its completion. Because\nof the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and\nthe effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds\nrequired to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. In addition, generally during the term of a construction\nloan, interest may be funded by the borrower or disbursed from an interest reserve set aside from the construction loan\nbudget. These loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the\nsuccess of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out\nfinancing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the appraised value of a\ncompleted project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon\ncompletion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. In addition, speculative construction loans, which are\nloans made to home builders who, at the time of loan origination, have not yet secured an end buyer for the home under\nconstruction, typically carry higher risks than those associated with traditional construction loans. These increased risks\narise because of the risk that there will be inadequate demand to ensure the sale of the property within an acceptable\ntime. As a result, in addition to the risks associated with traditional construction loans, speculative construction loans\ncarry the added risk that the builder will have to pay the property taxes and other carrying costs of the property until an\nend buyer is found. Land loans have substantially similar risks to speculative construction loans. As our construction and\nland loan portfolio increases, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase.\nLack of seasoning of certain portions of our commercial and industrial loan portfolio, especially with respect to\ncannabis, wind and solar customers, may increase the risk of credit defaults in the future.\nWe have experienced significant loan growth in recent years in our larger commercial and industrial loans,\nwhich we refer to as Structured Finance loans. Most of these loans are to new customers in the cannabis, wind and solar\nindustries. We believe we have grown these loan portfolios consistent with prudent underwriting standards but in\ngeneral, loans do not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some\n37\nperiod of time, a process referred to as “seasoning.” As a result, a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more\npredictably than a newer portfolio. It will take several years to determine our borrowers’ payment histories, with respect\nto many of these new lending relationships and, as a result, we may not be able to reliably evaluate the quality of the\nloan portfolio until that time.\nOur historical emphasis on residential mortgage loans exposes us to lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2023, $1.10 billion, or 28.2% of our loan portfolio, was secured by one- to four-family\nresidential real estate and we intend to continue to provide this type of lending for the foreseeable future. One- to four-\nfamily residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly\nimpact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Declines in\nreal estate values could cause some of our residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose\nus to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nThe geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in\nthe local economy.\nWe primarily serve individuals and businesses located in the Greater Boston metropolitan area and surrounding\ncommunities, including eastern Connecticut, southern New Hampshire and Rhode Island. At December 31, 2023, the\nvast majority of our total loans were primarily secured by real estate in this market area, defined as within a 100-mile\nradius of the company headquarters in Needham, Massachusetts. At December 31, 2023, $46.4 million in loans were\nreported as out of territory, excluding Structured Finance loans, which have a broader geographical targeted footprint.\nTherefore, our success is largely dependent on the economic conditions, including employment levels, population\ngrowth, income levels, savings trends and government policies, in this market area. Although our loan portfolio has very\nlimited exposure to commercial office space in downtown Boston, increased vacancies in this market resulting in\ndepressed prices could have a ripple effect on the Greater Boston Metropolitan area. Moreover, the continued trend of\nhybrid and remote work would likely result in increased vacancy rates in commercial office space throughout the Greater\nBoston metropolitan area which could also negatively affect the demand for retail occupancy and sales in surrounding\nareas, any of which could adversely affect the value of the properties used as collateral for such loans. Similarly, weaker\neconomic conditions caused by recessions, unemployment, inflation, a decline in real estate values or other factors\nbeyond our control may adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to service their debt obligations and could result in\nhigher loan and lease losses and lower net income for us.\nAlthough there is not a single employer or industry in our market area on which a significant number of our\ncustomers are dependent, a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is composed of loans secured by property located in\nthe Greater Boston metropolitan area. This makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy and real estate\nmarkets. Decreases in local real estate values caused by economic conditions or other events could adversely affect the\nvalue of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure.\nA worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we\nconduct business could have adverse effects on our business, including the following:\n• a decrease in the demand for, or the availability of, loans and other products and services offered by us;\n• a decrease in the value of our loans or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate;\n• a decrease in interest income from variable rate loans due to declines in interest rates; and\n• an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection\nunder bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us, which could result in a higher\nlevel of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provisions for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on\nloans held for sale.\n38\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism,\nan outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment, public health crises or other\nfactors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the\nfinancial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating\ncosts, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of\nunderlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. In the event of severely\nadverse business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct\nbusiness, there can be no assurance that the federal government and the Federal Reserve Board would intervene. If\neconomic conditions worsen or volatility increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be\nmaterially adversely affected. For more information about our market area, please see the section titled “Business of\nNeedham Bank – Market Area.”\nIf our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual credit losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses, which is established through a provision for credit losses that\nrepresents management’s best estimate of the current expected losses within the loan portfolio. We make various\nassumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers\nand the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In\ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience,\nand we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions or the results of our analyses are incorrect, our allowance for\ncredit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance.\nIn addition, our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolios of commercial real estate loans, as well as any\nfuture credit deterioration or changes in economic conditions could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses\nin the future. At December 31, 2023, our allowance for credit losses was 0.83% of total loans and 298% of non-\nperforming loans. Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nWe adopted the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) standard on January 1, 2023. CECL requires financial\ninstitutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit\nlosses as allowances for credit losses. This has changed the current method of providing allowances for credit losses that\nare incurred or probable, which has required us to increase our allowance for credit losses, and to greatly increase the\ntypes of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. Our day\none CECL adjustment on January 1, 2023, was $2.1 million, net of tax.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and, as a result of such reviews,\nwe may be required to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. However, regulatory\nagencies are not directly involved in the process of establishing the allowance for credit losses, as the process is our\nresponsibility and any adjustment of the allowance is the responsibility of our management. Any increase in our\nallowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as a result of such review or otherwise may have a material adverse effect\non our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide banking services to customers who do business in the cannabis industry and the strict enforcement of\nfederal laws regarding cannabis would likely result in our inability to continue to provide banking services to\nthese customers and we could have legal action taken against us by the federal government.\nWe have deposit and loan customers that are licensed in various States to do business in the cannabis industry\nas growers, processors, and dispensaries. While cannabis is legal in each of these States, it remains classified as a\nSchedule I controlled substance under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. As such, the cultivation, use,\ndistribution, and possession of cannabis is a violation of federal law that is punishable by imprisonment and fines.\nMoreover, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in USA v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers’ Coop. that the federal government has the\nauthority to regulate and criminalize cannabis, including medical marijuana.\nIn January 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) rescinded the “Cole Memo” and related memoranda\nwhich characterized the enforcement of the CSA against persons and entities complying with state regulatory systems\npermitting the use, manufacture and sale of medical marijuana as an inefficient use of their prosecutorial resources and\n39\ndiscretion. The impact of the DOJ’s rescission of the Cole Memo and related memoranda is unclear, but may result in\nthe DOJ increasing its enforcement actions against the regulated cannabis industry generally.\nAs in past years, the U.S. Congress has enacted an omnibus spending bill that includes a provision prohibiting\nthe DOJ and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration from using funds appropriated by that bill to prevent states from\nimplementing their medical-use cannabis laws. This provision was recently renewed as part of the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act of 2022. While this provision has been re-enacted every year since 2014, and is expected to continue\nto be re-enacted in future federal spending bills, if Congress and the President fail to further renew the provision, then\nthe ability of medical cannabis businesses to act in this area, and our ability to provide banking products and services to\nsuch businesses, may be impeded. Further, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in USA v. McIntosh that\nthis provision prohibits the DOJ from spending funds from relevant appropriations acts to prosecute individuals who\nengage in conduct permitted by state medical-use cannabis laws and who strictly comply with such laws. There is no\nguarantee that the U.S. Congress will extend this provision or that U.S. Federal courts located outside the Ninth Circuit\nwill follow the ruling in USA v. McIntosh. As of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are aware of no\nfederal or state court in or for Massachusetts that has addressed the merits of the McIntosh ruling.\nFederal prosecutors have significant discretion and there can be no assurance that a federal prosecutor in any of\nthe federal districts in which we operate will not choose to strictly enforce the federal laws governing cannabis,\nincluding medical-use cannabis, or that any of these federal courts will follow the Ninth Circuit’s ruling in\nUSA v. McIntosh. Any change in the federal government’s enforcement position, could cause us to immediately cease\nproviding banking services to the medical-use cannabis industry in the States where we operate.\nAdditionally, as the possession and use of cannabis remains illegal under the CSA, we may be deemed to be\naiding and abetting illegal activities through the services that we provide to these customers and could have legal action\ntaken against us by the Federal government, including imprisonment and fines. Any change in position or potential\naction taken against us could result in significant financial damage to us and our stockholders.\nThe Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) published guidelines in 2014 for financial institutions\nservicing state legal cannabis business. These guidelines were issued for the explicit purpose so “that financial\ninstitutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses in a manner consistent with their obligations to know\ntheir customers and to report possible criminal activity.” Needham Bank has and will continue to follow this and other\nFinCEN guidance in the areas of cannabis banking. Any adverse change in this FinCEN guidance, any new regulations\nor legislation, any change in existing regulations or oversight, whether a change in regulatory policy or a change in a\nregulator’s interpretation of a law or regulation, could have a negative impact on our interest income and noninterest\nincome, as well as the cost of our operations, increasing our cost of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and/or\notherwise affect us, which may materially affect our profitability.\nEnvironmental liability associated with our lending activities could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans originated or\npurchased that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that material environmental\nviolations could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the\naffected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of remedial action could substantially exceed the value of\naffected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could\nfind it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nThe foreclosure process may adversely impact our recoveries on non-performing loans.\nThe judicial foreclosure process is protracted, which delays our ability to resolve non-performing loans through\nthe sale of the underlying collateral. The longer timelines have been the result of additional consumer protection\ninitiatives related to the foreclosure process, increased documentary requirements and judicial scrutiny, and, both\nvoluntary and mandatory programs under which lenders may consider loan modifications or other alternatives to\nforeclosure. These reasons and the legal and regulatory responses have impacted the foreclosure process and completion\n40\ntime of foreclosures for residential mortgage lenders. This may result in a material adverse effect on collateral values and\nour ability to minimize its losses.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\nThe reversal of the historically low interest rate environment may adversely affect our net interest income and\nprofitability.\nNet interest income historically has been, and we anticipate that it will remain, a significant component of our\ntotal revenue. A high percentage of our assets and liabilities involve interest-bearing or interest-related instruments.\nThus, changes in interest rates have impacted and may continue to impact many areas of our business, including net\ninterest income, both the earnings and volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as loan\ndelinquency. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including global, national,\nregional and local economic conditions, the effects of disease pandemics such as COVID-19, competitive pressures, and\npolicies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the FOMC. Changes in interest rates have\ninfluenced and will continue to influence the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we\npay on deposits and borrowings, our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, and the fair value of our financial\nassets and liabilities. If the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates\non our interest earning assets, our net interest income may decline and, with it, a decline in our earnings may occur. Our\nnet interest income and our earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest earning assets\ndeclined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds throughout 2022 and 2023, and additional rate increases\nmay occur if inflation pressures remain elevated or intensify. Increases to the target range for the federal funds rate,\ncombined with ongoing geopolitical instability, could raise the risk of an economic recession and responsive measures,\nincluding a reduction of the federal funds rate. Any such downturn may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels,\nloan demand and results of operations.\nHigher interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations and refinancings, while\nlower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations and refinancings. Our ability to generate gains on\nsales of mortgage loans is significantly dependent on the level of originations. Cash flows are affected by changes in\nmarket interest rates. Generally, in rising interest rate environments, loan prepayment rates are likely to decline, and in\nfalling interest rate environments, loan prepayment rates are likely to increase. A significant amount of our commercial\nand industrial and commercial real estate, including multi-family residential real estate loans, are adjustable-rate loans\nand an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers, especially those with\nadjustable rate loans, to pay their loan obligations. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds and other factors may\nalso cause the value of our loans held for sale to change.\nAlthough we have implemented risk management strategies, as well as policies and procedures designed to\nmanage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates, changes in interest rates have had and may continue to\nhave an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf our ongoing assumptions regarding borrower or depositor behavior or overall economic conditions are\nsignificantly different than we anticipate, then our risk mitigation may be insufficient to protect against interest rate risk\nand our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nChanges in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values.\nWe derive our income mainly from the difference or “spread” between the interest earned on loans, securities\nand other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. In\ngeneral, the larger the spread, the more we earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our\nassets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely\naffect our income. For the past several years, we have been asset sensitive, which indicates that assets generally reprice\n41\nfaster than liabilities. In a rising rate environment, asset sensitivity is preferable as it results in improvement to our net\ninterest margin.\nInterest rates also affect how much money we lend. For example, when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing\nincreases for customers and the Bank’s loan originations tend to decrease. A rising rate environment can also negatively\nimpact the Bank if the higher debt service costs on adjustable-rate loans lead to borrowers’ inability to pay contractual\nobligations. In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and securities. For example, a\nreduction in interest rates generally results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, as\nborrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing cost. This causes reinvestment risk, because we generally are\nnot able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities in a\ndeclining rate environment.\nAny substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on\nour financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively\naffect the value of our assets, including the value of our available-for-sale investment securities, which generally\ndecrease when market interest rates rise, and ultimately affect our earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwe incurred other comprehensive income of $3.3 million, primarily related to net changes in unrealized holding gains\n(losses) in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.\nChanges in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate real estate loans, the\nvalue of our assets, and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings.\nAlso, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of\nactual interest rate changes on our balance sheet or projected operating results. See “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management of Market Risk.”\nHedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect our earnings.\nOn occasion we have employed various financial risk methodologies that limit, or “hedge,” the adverse effects\nof rising or decreasing interest rates on our loan portfolios and short-term liabilities. We also engage in hedging\nstrategies with respect to arrangements where our customers swap floating interest rate obligations for fixed interest rate\nobligations, or vice versa. Our hedging activity varies based on the level and volatility of interest rates and other\nchanging market conditions. There are no perfect hedging strategies, and interest rate hedging may fail to protect us from\nloss. Moreover, hedging activities could result in losses if the event against which we hedge does not occur.\nAdditionally, interest rate hedging could fail to protect us or adversely affect us because, among other things:\n• available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is\nsought;\n• the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability;\n• the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay;\n• the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it\nimpairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction;\n• the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting\nrules to reflect changes in fair value; and/or\n• downward adjustments, or “mark-to-market” losses, would reduce our stockholders’ equity.\n42\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nInflation can have an adverse impact on our business and on our customers.\nInflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be worth less in the future as\ninflation decreases the value of money. Recently, there has been a rise in inflation and the Federal Reserve Board has\nraised certain benchmark interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. As discussed above under “– Risks Related to\nMarket Interest Rates – Changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values,” as inflation increases and\nmarket interest rates rise, the value of our investment securities, particularly those with longer maturities, would\ndecrease, although this effect can be less pronounced for floating rate instruments. In addition, inflation generally\nincreases the cost of goods and services we use in our business operations, such as electricity and other utilities, which\nincreases our noninterest expenses. Furthermore, our customers are also affected by inflation and the rising costs of\ngoods and services used in their households and businesses, which could have a negative impact on their ability to repay\ntheir loans with us.\nA worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services\nand/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could adversely affect our operations,\nfinancial condition and earnings.\nLocal and regional economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans\nand the value of the collateral securing loans. A deterioration in economic conditions, especially local conditions, could\nhave the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nliquidity and results of operations, and could more negatively affect us compared to a financial institution that operates\nwith more geographic diversity:\n• demand for our products and services may decline;\n• loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n• collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers’ future\nborrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans, causing an\nincrease in our allowance for credit losses; and\n• the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to\nus.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism,\ncivil unrest, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, an epidemic or pandemic,\nunemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could\nfurther negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while\npossibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business\nborrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial\nperformance.\nFurther, a U.S. government debt default would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial\nperformance, including a decrease in the value of U.S. Treasury securities and other government securities held by us,\nwhich could negatively impact our capital position and our ability to meet regulatory requirements. Other negative\nimpacts could be volatile capital markets, an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar, as well as\nincreased default rates among borrowers in light of increased economic uncertainty. Some of these impacts might occur\neven in the absence of an actual default but as a consequence of extended political negotiations around the threat of such\na default and a government shutdown.\n43\nWe have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate in our market area. Adverse economic conditions,\nboth generally and in our market area, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our loans are inside of our primary market area and, as a result, we have a greater risk of loan\ndefaults and losses in the event of a further economic downturn in our market area, as adverse economic conditions may\nhave a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely payments of their loans. A return of recessionary\nconditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the\nmarkets in which we do business, the value of our loans, investments, and collateral securing our loans, and our ongoing\noperations, costs and profitability. Any of these negative events may result in higher-than-expected loan delinquencies,\nincrease our levels of nonperforming and classified assets, and reduce demand for our products and services, which may\ncause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity and financial condition.\nAdverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving\nliquidity, defaults, or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely\naffect our financial condition and results of operations.\nActual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect\nfinancial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial\nservices industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past\nand may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on May 1, 2023, First Republic Bank went\ninto receivership and its deposits and substantially all of its assets were acquired by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National\nAssociation. Similarly, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank went into receivership, and on March 12, 2023,\nSignature Bank went into receivership.\nInflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued\ngovernment securities with interest rates below current market interest rates. Although the Treasury, FDIC and Federal\nReserve Board have announced a program to provide up to $25 billion of loans to financial institutions secured by\ncertain of such government securities held by financial institutions to mitigate the risk of potential losses on the sale of\nsuch instruments, widespread demands for customer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for\nimmediately liquidity may exceed the capacity of such program. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the Treasury,\nFDIC and Federal Reserve Board will provide access to uninsured funds in the future in the event of the closure of other\nbanks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely fashion.\nOur securities portfolio performance in difficult market conditions could have adverse effects on our results of\noperations.\nUnrealized losses on investment securities result from changes in credit spreads and liquidity issues in the\nmarketplace, along with changes in the credit profile of individual securities issuers. Under GAAP, we are required to\nreview our investment portfolio periodically for the presence of credit losses of our securities, taking into consideration\ncurrent and future market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends,\nvolatility of earnings, current analysts’ evaluations, our ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of fair\nvalue, as well as other factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the foregoing factors may require\nus to deem particular securities to be impaired, with the credit-related portion of the reduction in the value recognized as\na charge to our earnings through an allowance. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors prevailing at that time, may\nresult in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods. Any of these factors could require us to\nrecognize further impairments in the value of our securities portfolio, which may have an adverse effect on our results of\noperations in future periods.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause\npotential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency\nactions with respect to individual securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and\nchanges in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others,\n44\ncould cause credit losses and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive\nincome, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and\nprospects. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is related to credit usually requires complex,\nsubjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the\nsecurity in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.\nSignificant negative changes to valuations could result in credit losses on our securities portfolio, which could have an\nadverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately\n$11.9 million of accumulated other comprehensive losses. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we had\n$2.5 million of after-tax other comprehensive income, which resulted primarily from $3.7 million in unrealized valuation\ngains on available-for-sale investment securities.\nPotential downgrades of U.S. government securities by one or more of the credit ratings agencies could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operations, earnings and financial condition.\nA possible future downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and a decline in the\nperceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could impact our ability to obtain funding that is\ncollateralized by affected instruments, as well as affect the pricing of that funding when it is available. A downgrade\nmay also adversely affect the market value of such instruments. We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the\ncredit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. Such ratings actions\ncould result in a significant adverse impact on us. Among other things, a downgrade in the U.S. government’s credit\nrating could adversely impact the value of our securities portfolio and may trigger requirements that we post additional\ncollateral for trades relative to these securities. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or\nthe credit ratings of related institutions, agencies or instruments would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which\nwe are subject and any related adverse effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial\nsoundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,\ncounterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different counterparties, and we routinely execute\ntransactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, other commercial banks,\ninvestment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other financial institutions. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or\nquestions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to\nmarket-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and organizations. Many of these\ntransactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may\nbe exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the\nfull amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not\nmaterially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Funding\nOur inability to generate core deposits may cause us to rely more heavily on wholesale funding strategies for\nfunding and liquidity needs, which could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and profitability.\nWe must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. Deposits have\ntraditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also receive funds from\nloan repayments, investment maturities and income on other interest-earning assets. While we emphasize generating\ntransaction accounts, we cannot guarantee if and when this will occur. Further, the considerable competition for deposits\nin our market area also has made, and may continue to make, it difficult for us to obtain reasonably priced deposits.\nMoreover, deposit balances can decrease if customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return\ntradeoff. If we are not able to increase our lower-cost transactional deposits at a level necessary to fund our asset growth\nor deposit outflows, we may be forced seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit, FHLB\nadvances, brokered deposits and lines of credit to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our\ncustomers, which may be more expensive and have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and profitability. In\n45\naddition, if our capital levels fell such that we were no longer considered “well capitalized,” under federal law we would\nbe subject to restrictions on accepting brokered deposits and on paying above-market rates for deposits. Additionally, if,\nbased on a decrease in our tangible equity, the FHLB were to determine that we have inadequate capital levels, in its\ndiscretion, it may limit our ability to utilize FHLB advances.\nAdditionally, through our April 2022 purchase of cannabis-related and money service businesses from another\nfinancial institution, we acquired approximately $297.7 million of deposits. Of this total, approximately $316.0 million\nare cannabis-related deposits, directly involved in growing, transporting, packaging, distributing, or selling cannabis\n(that “touch” cannabis along the distribution chain), as of December 31, 2023. Due to the unique industry-specific risks\nof this business, if we were forced to terminate this business line, we could lose many or most of these deposits, all of\nwhich are core deposits.\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support our future growth.\nWe must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of our\nliquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and\nmaturities of loans and investments. As we continue to grow, we are likely to become more dependent on these sources,\nwhich may include FHLB advances, proceeds from the sale of loans, federal funds purchased and brokered certificates\nof deposit. Adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability to access\nthese additional funding sources. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our\naccess to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If\nwe are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not\nincrease proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely\naffected.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may\nadversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nNeedham Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Commissioner and the\nFederal Reserve Board, and, also by the FDIC as insurer of Needham Bank’s deposit accounts and NB Bancorp is\nsubject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and\nsupervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily\nfor the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund and the depositors of Needham Bank, rather than for our\nstockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including\nthe imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the adequacy of the\nlevel of our allowance for credit losses. These regulations, along with existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance and\nmonetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions conduct\nbusiness, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change\nin such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action,\nmay have a material impact on our operations.\nOur cannabis-related business, money service business and ATM business present compliance risks that are\ndifferent in kind or degree compared to those that we are accustomed to managing and have required us to\nimplement new or enhance existing procedures, systems and controls.\nOur April 2022 acquisition resulted in our operation of three different business lines that are new to us and have\nnecessitated robust compliance policies and procedures in order to comply with various laws and regulations. We\nprovide depository services to cannabis businesses, including cannabis retailers and cannabis cultivators. We also\nprovide loans to various cannabis-related businesses. We also provide depository services to money service businesses\nand ATM businesses.\n46\nThese acquired portfolios are mature portfolios which have been previously reviewed and managed by the\nmanagement team and employees now employed by Needham Bank who were previously employed by the selling\ninstitution. However, these business lines are relatively new to Needham Bank and have required and we expect will\ncontinue to require, proportionately greater compliance and risk management resources than our other business lines in\norder for us to comply with laws and regulations related to the prevention of financial crimes and combating terrorism,\nincluding the U.S. Patriot Act of 2001. These laws and regulations require us to, among other things, implement specific\npolicies and procedures related to those business lines, including enhanced licensing procedures and policies, and anti-\nmoney laundering, anti-bribery and corruption, fraud, compliance, suspicious activities, currency transaction reporting,\nand due diligence on new and existing customers.\nWith respect to cannabis-related businesses, the Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal under federal law to\nmanufacture, distribute, or dispense cannabis, and therefore federal law, including the money laundering statutes and the\nBank Secrecy Act, apply to cannabis-related conduct. Financial transactions involving proceeds generated by cannabis-\nrelated conduct can form the basis for prosecution under the money laundering statutes. Financial institutions must report\ncurrency transactions and conduct suspicious activity monitoring and reporting in connection with cannabis-related\nbusinesses to FinCEN.\nOur ability to comply with anti-money laundering laws and our reporting obligations to FinCEN depend on our\nability to maintain robust customer due diligence, surveillance, detection, reporting and analytic capabilities. Although\nwe believe that we have policies, systems and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations, to the\nextent our policies or procedures are not fully effective or do not meet heightened regulatory standards or expectations,\nwe may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on certain activities including future acquisitions, reputational harm, or\nother adverse consequences from our federal bank regulators, the Department of Justice or FinCEN.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in\nfines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent\nfinancial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are suspected,\nfinancial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with FinCEN. These rules require financial\ninstitutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial\naccounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on pursuing\nacquisitions or establishing new branches. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in\ncompliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nFurthermore, these rules and regulations continue to evolve and expand.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the\npolicies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money\nsupply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives\nare open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in\nbanks’ reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence\noverall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects\ninterest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the\noperating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of\nsuch policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\n47\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to\nraise additional capital, or limit our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares.\nFederal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including\nminimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and define “capital” for calculating these ratios. The minimum capital\nrequirements are: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (2) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%;\n(3) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (4) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The regulations also establish a “capital conservation\nbuffer” of 2.5%, which results in the following minimum ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (2) a\nTier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (3) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to\nlimitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls\nbelow the capital conservation buffer amount.\nThe application of these capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and\nresult in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements. Needham Bank’s ability to pay dividends\nto NB Bancorp would be limited if it does not maintain the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules,\nwhich may limit NB Bancorp’s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders. See “Supervision and Regulation – Banking\nRegulation – Capital Requirements.”\nWe are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced\nreporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock\nless attractive to investors.\nNB Bancorp is an emerging growth company, and we expect we will cease to be an emerging growth company\nat the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the offering (i.e., December 31, 2028).\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from\nvarious reporting requirements applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure\nobligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the\nrequirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden\nparachute payments not previously approved. We have also elected to use the extended transition period to delay\nadoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are\nmade applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial\nstatements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Investors may find our\ncommon stock less attractive since we have chosen to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common\nstock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for\nour common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nIf our deposits grow too large, we may lose the benefits of excess deposit insurance provided by the Depositors\nInsurance Fund.\nThe deposits of Needham Bank are insured in full beyond federal deposit insurance coverage limits by the\nDepositors Insurance Fund (“DIF”) a private excess deposit insurer created under Massachusetts law. We believe\noffering full deposit insurance gives us a competitive advantage for individual, corporate and municipal depositors\nhaving deposit balances in excess of FDIC insurance limits. However, the DIF may require member institutions that pose\ngreater than normal loss exposure risk to the DIF to take certain risk-mitigating measures or withdraw from the DIF and\nbecome a Massachusetts trust company by operation of law, subject to the Commissioner’s approval. In such an event,\nan institution may be required to reduce its level of excess deposits, pay for the reinsurance of excess deposits, make an\nadditional capital contribution to the DIF, provide collateral or take other risk-mitigating measures that the DIF may\nrequire, which may include entering into reciprocal deposit programs with other financial institutions or reciprocal\ndeposit services. Reducing excess deposits by taking any of the above risk-mitigating measures, which allows deposits to\nrun off, reduces our overall level of deposits and increases the extent to which we may need to rely in the future on other,\nmore expensive or less stable sources for funding, including FHLB advances, which would reduce net income. Shifting\nexcess deposits into reciprocal deposit programs may result in higher funding costs, which also would reduce net\nincome.\n48\nThe Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support our bank subsidiary.\nFederal law requires that a holding company act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its\nsubsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the “source of strength” doctrine, the\nFederal Reserve Board may require a holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and\nmay charge the holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a\nsubsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to\nprovide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Thus, any borrowing or funds needed to\nraise capital required to make a capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect\non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to enforcement actions even though noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional.\nThe financial services industry is subject to intense scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process\nand aggressive enforcement of federal and state regulations, particularly with respect to mortgage-related practices and\nother consumer compliance matters, and compliance with anti-money laundering, Bank Secrecy Act and Office of\nForeign Assets Control regulations, and economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and nationals. Enforcement\nactions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. We maintain systems and\nprocedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, some legal/regulatory\nframeworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was\ninadvertent or unintentional and even though there was in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure\ncompliance. Failure to comply with these and other regulations, and supervisory expectations related thereto, may result\nin fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputation damage, or restrictions on our business.\nWe face significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions\nbrought against us.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal\nliability. From time to time, customers and others make claims and take legal action pertaining to the performance of our\nresponsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the performance of our responsibilities are founded\nor unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant\nexpenses, attention from management and financial liability. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nand results of operations. There is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future. Actions\ncurrently pending against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which\ncould materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational\nharm to us.\nRisks Related to our Business Strategy\nOur business strategy includes growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively\naffected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. Growing our operations could also cause our\nexpenses to increase faster than our revenues.\nOur business strategy includes growth in assets, deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving such\ngrowth will require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market area. Our\nability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced\nbankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities and the level of competition from other financial\ninstitutions. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we\ndo not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected.\nFurthermore, there can be considerable costs involved in expanding lending capacity, and generally a period of time is\nrequired to generate the necessary revenues to offset these costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an\nestablished presence. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings until\ncertain economies of scale are reached.\n49\nOur continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be\navailable when it is needed.\nWe are required by banking regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our\noperations. We may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth. If we raise capital\nthrough the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities, it would dilute the ownership interests\nof stockholders and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock. New investors may also have rights,\npreferences and privileges senior to our current stockholders, which may adversely impact our current stockholders.\nAlso, the need to raise additional capital may force our management to spend more time in managerial and financing-\nrelated activities than in operational activities.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time,\nwhich are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional\ncapital, if needed, with favorable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand\nour operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired.\nWe depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations and\nwe could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe depend on the services of the members of our senior management team who direct our strategy and\noperations. Our executive officers and lending personnel possess substantial expertise, extensive knowledge of our\nmarkets and key business relationships. Any one of them could be difficult to replace. Additionally, in recent years, we\nhave grown our Structured Finance loan portfolio significantly, including through lending relationships to cannabis,\nwind and solar companies. These industries can entail unique regulatory and operational risks and we believe we have\nexperienced team members who are able to understand and assess these risks when originating and managing these\nrelationships. Our loss of these persons, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to\nimplement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to\ncompete in our markets.\nDevelopment of new products and services may impose additional costs on us and may expose us to increased\noperational risk.\nThe introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources, including regulatory\napprovals. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services,\nincluding technical and control requirements that may need to be developed and implemented, rapid technological\nchange in the industry, our ability to access technical and other information from its clients, the significant and ongoing\ninvestments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices and the\npreparation of marketing, sales and other materials that fully and accurately describe the product or service and its\nunderlying risks. Our failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes it to enhanced risk of operational\nlapses which may result in the recognition of financial statement liabilities. Regulatory and internal control requirements,\ncapital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and shifting market preferences may also determine\nif such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to our clients. Products and services\nrelying on internet and mobile technologies may expose us to fraud and cybersecurity risks. Failure to successfully\nmanage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse\neffect on our business and reputation, as well as on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Competitive Matters\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with commercial banks,\nsavings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies,\nbrokerage and investment banking firms, financial technology or “fintech companies,” and unregulated or less regulated\nnon-banking entities. Many of these competitors are substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater\n50\nresources and higher lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition,\nsome of our competitors offer loans with lower interest rates and/or more attractive terms than loans we offer.\nCompetition also makes it increasingly difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. We expect\ncompetition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing\ntrend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to\nsuccessfully compete for business and qualified employees in our market areas. The greater resources and deposit and\nloan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets.\nRisks Related to Operational Matters\nWe face significant operational risks because of our reliance on technology. Our information technology systems\nmay be subject to failure, interruption or security breaches.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. Our business requires us to collect, process,\ntransmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and our own\nbusiness, operations, plans and business strategies. We use various technology systems to manage our customer\nrelationships, general ledger, investments, deposits, and loans. Our computer systems, data management and internal\nprocesses, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. Our operational risks include the risk of\nmalfeasance by employees or persons outside our company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology,\nsystems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business\ncontinuation and disaster recovery. There have been increasing efforts by third parties to breach data security at financial\ninstitutions. Such attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or\ninformation or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss\nor destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information, damages to systems, or other material disruptions to\nnetwork access or business operations. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of\nsystem failures, interruptions and security breaches, including privacy breaches and cyber-attacks. Although we take\nprotective measures and believe that we have not experienced any of the data breaches described above, the security of\nour computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer\nviruses, or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have an impact on information security. Because the\ntechniques used to cause security breaches change frequently, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques\nor to implement adequate preventative measures.\nIn the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper\nemployee actions, or a breach of our security systems, including if confidential or proprietary information were to be\nmishandled, misused or lost, we could suffer financial loss, loss of customers and damage to our reputation, and face\nregulatory action or civil litigation. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nand results of operations. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may\nexceed insurance limits.\nWe outsource critical operations to third-party service providers. Systems failures, interruptions and\ncybersecurity breaches could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe outsource a majority of our data processing requirements to third-party providers. Accordingly, our\noperations are exposed to the risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with our contractual agreements\nwith them, or we also could be adversely affected if such an agreement is not renewed by the third-party vendor or is\nrenewed on terms less favorable to us. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty\ncommunicating with those service providers, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be\naffected, and our business operations could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer\ninformation through various other vendors and their personnel, and our third-party service providers may be vulnerable\nto unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We may have to expend\nadditional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems\ncaused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of our third-party service providers or the\nactivities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and\n51\nviruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation costs and other possible liabilities. To our knowledge,\nthe services and programs provided to us by third parties have not experienced any material security breaches. However,\nthe existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be\ndisclosed to us in a timely manner.\nOur business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.\nOur loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to\nexposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other\nfinancial crimes have increased. To our knowledge, we have not experienced material losses due to apparent fraud or\nother financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, losses may still occur.\nRisks Related to Accounting Matters\nChanges in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements and our financial condition or operating results.\nIn preparing this Annual Report as well as other periodic reports we are required to file under the Exchange\nAct, including our consolidated financial statements, our management is required under applicable rules and regulations\nto make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s\nbest estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different\nresults may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. The area requiring significant\nestimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe regulatory bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board, the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting\nguidance that governs the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can\nmaterially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be\nrequired to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nOther Risks Related to Our Business\nWe operate as a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation, which is critical to the success of\nour business, may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key\ncomponent of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to\nexpand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market\narea and contiguous areas. Threats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about\nfinancial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of\nservice or quality, compliance deficiencies, cybersecurity incidents and questionable or fraudulent activities of our\ncustomers. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the\nloss of customers and employees, costly litigation and increased governmental regulation, any or all of which could\nadversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe cost of additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls in order to satisfy our new public\ncompany reporting requirements will increase our expenses.\nAs a result of the completion of our initial public offering in December 2023, we became a public reporting\ncompany. The obligations of being a public company, including the substantial public reporting obligations, require\nsignificant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. Any failure to achieve and maintain an\neffective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. In addition,\n52\nwe may need to hire additional compliance, accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience\nand technical knowledge, and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion. As a result, we may need to rely on\noutside consultants to provide these services for us until qualified personnel are hired. These obligations will increase\nour operating expenses and could divert our management’s attention from our operations.\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly\nthrough impacts on our customers.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental\nefforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior as a result\nof these concerns. We and our customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and\nbusiness preferences resulting from climate change concerns. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on\ntheir specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts to us could be a\ndecrease in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in\ncreditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks\ninto account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly\ncompanies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in\nconsumer or business behavior.\nVarious factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and federal and state banking laws, including\nregulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of NB Bancorp\nwithout our board of directors’ approval. Massachusetts and federal regulations applicable to the conversion state that for\na period of three years following completion of our conversion, no person may offer to acquire or acquire beneficial\nownership of more than 10% of our common stock without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Under federal\nlaw, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the Federal Reserve Board and receive the\nFederal Reserve Board’s non-objection before acquiring control of a bank holding company. There also are provisions in\nour articles of incorporation and bylaws that we may use to delay or block a takeover attempt, including a provision that\nprohibits any person from voting more than 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Furthermore, shares of\nrestricted stock and stock options that we may grant to employees and directors, stock ownership by our management\nand directors and other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of NB Bancorp\nwithout the consent of our board of directors, and may increase the cost of an acquisition. Taken as a whole, these\nstatutory or regulatory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could result in NB Bancorp\nbeing less attractive to a potential acquirer and therefore could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that, subject to limited exception, state and federal courts in the State of\nMaryland are the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our\nstockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, and other\nemployees.\nThe articles of incorporation of NB Bancorp provide that, unless NB Bancorp consents in writing to the\nselection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on\nbehalf of NB Bancorp, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or\nother employee of NB Bancorp to NB Bancorp or its stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to\nany provision of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal\naffairs doctrine will be conducted in a state or federal court located within the State of Maryland, in all cases subject to\nthe court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This exclusive forum\nprovision does not apply to claims arising under the federal securities laws. This exclusive forum provision may limit a\nstockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum it finds favorable for disputes with NB Bancorp and its\ndirectors, officers, and other employees or may cause a stockholder to incur additional expense by having to bring a\nclaim in a judicial forum that is distant from where the stockholder resides, or both. In addition, if a court were to find\nthis exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in a particular action, we may incur additional costs\n53\nassociated with resolving the action in another jurisdiction, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nITEM 1C. Cybersecurity\nThe Company recognizes the importance of cybersecurity and the potential risks posed to our business\noperations, financial performance, and reputation. Cybersecurity is a significant and integrated component of the\nCompany’s risk management strategy. As a financial services company, cyber threats are present and growing, and the\npotential exists for a cybersecurity incident to occur, which could disrupt business operations or compromise sensitive\ndata. To date, the Company has not, to its knowledge, experienced an incident materially affecting or reasonably likely\nto materially affect the Company. Cybersecurity risks and threats include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access,\nuse, disclosure, modification, or destruction of our information systems, data, or network; denial of service attacks;\nmalware; ransomware; phishing; social engineering; and cyberattacks by hackers, state-sponsored actors, or other\nmalicious third parties and is compounded by the advent and availability of artificial intelligence (“AI”) tools.\nTo prepare and respond to incidents, the Company has implemented a multi-layered cybersecurity strategy,\nintegrating people, technology, and processes. This includes establishing a cybersecurity risk management framework\nthat aligns with industry standards and best practices provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology\n(“NIST”), employee training, the use of innovative technologies, and the implementation of policies and procedures in\nthe areas of Information Security, Data Governance, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery, Privacy, Third-Party\nRisk Management, and Incident Response that ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations and obligations, such\nas the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”)\nCybersecurity Assessment Tool, and the Ransomware Self-Assessment Tool (“RSAT”). Additionally, we have\nimplemented various technical measures to prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity incidents, such as firewalls,\nthird-party managed detection & response services, encryption, authentication, backup and recovery solutions. The\nCompany engages third-party consultants and independent auditors to, among other things, conduct penetration tests and\nperform cybersecurity risk assessments and audits to regularly evaluate our cybersecurity posture in conjunction with\nobtaining cybersecurity insurance coverage to mitigate the potential financial impact of cybersecurity incidents.\nThe Board Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) Committee provides governance oversight of all risks faced\nby the Company, including cybersecurity and information technology general controls. The Chief Information Officer\n(“CIO”) manages the IT Department and reports to the Board Risk Committee and Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) on these\nmatters. The CIO also supervises the Information Security Officer (“ISO”) who is responsible for implementing and\nmaintaining the Company’s Information Security Program. The Information Security Program, which is governed by\nvarious information security and cybersecurity, systems development, change control, disaster recovery/business\ncontinuity and physical asset classification and control policies. Additional cybersecurity training to the ERM\nCommittee is provided and overseen by the CRO and CIO. The Information Security Program identifies data sources,\nthreats and vulnerabilities and ensures awareness, accountability, and oversight for data protection throughout the\nCompany and with trusted third parties to ensure that data is protected and able to be recovered in the event of a breach\nor failure (technical or other disaster). The Information Security Department conducts on-going technology and IT threat\nmeetings to ensure the latest threats are addressed in addition to external and internal penetration testing, business\ncontinuity/ disaster recovery testing, and incident response plan testing. The CIO is a member of various management\ncommittees, chairs the Company’s management-level Information Technology Steering Committee, and presents\ninformation security and cybersecurity updates on a regular basis to the Company’s ERM Working Group, which\nconsists of members of management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating\nOfficer, and other senior leaders in the Company. The ERM Working Group is responsible for identifying and assessing\ncybersecurity risks, developing and implementing risk mitigation strategies that align with the Bank’s corporate\nstrategies, and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Bank’s IT Steering Committee in\nconjunction with the Bank’s PMO oversees the development and implementation of our cybersecurity strategy, financial\nplanning, and capital allocation.\n54\nThe ERM Working Group provides executive management oversight, from a risk perspective, of information\nsystems security. As referenced above, the CIO provides information security updates to the ERM Working Group at\neach meeting. In addition, as discussed below, the Company has implemented an Incident Response Plan to provide a\nstructured and systematic incident response process for information security incidents that affect any of the information\ntechnology systems, network, or data of the Company. The Incident Response Plan is implemented and maintained by\nthe CIO and ISO and is subject to annual review and approval by the ERM Working Group. Cybersecurity metrics are\nreported to both management level committees and the ERM Committee and ERM Working Group on a quarterly basis.\nThe Board of Directors recognizes the importance of the FFIEC for Safeguarding Customer Information and\nhas incorporated those elements in its ongoing oversight of the Information Security Program.\nWe continually monitor and evaluate the evolving cybersecurity landscape and the potential impact of\ncybersecurity incidents on our business. We may incur additional costs to enhance our cybersecurity processes and\ncontrols, to comply with new or changing laws, regulations, or contractual obligations, or to respond to or recover from\ncybersecurity incidents. We may also experience reputational harm or loss of customer confidence or trust as a result of\ncybersecurity incidents. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, and reputation.\nDespite our efforts to enhance our cybersecurity posture, we cannot guarantee that our processes and controls\nwill be sufficient to prevent or mitigate all cybersecurity risks and threats that we face. We may experience cybersecurity\nincidents that result in unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of our information systems,\ndata, or network; disruption or degradation of our operations; loss of customers or business opportunities; regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement actions; litigation or liability; reputational damage; or increased costs.\nRisk Assessment. On a periodic basis, but not less than annually, the CIO and ISO, in conjunction with\nEnterprise Risk Management, identifies and documents internal and external vulnerabilities that could result in\nunauthorized disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of customer information or customer records. Based on the\nresults of the risk assessment, the Company’s Information Security Program may be revised to protect against any\nanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information. The IT Steering Committee reviews\nchanges to the program designed to monitor, measure, and respond to vulnerabilities identified.\nResponse to Security Vulnerabilities. In response to identified risks, management may take certain steps to\ncorrect and respond to security vulnerabilities, which may include:\n• Eliminating unwarranted risks by applying vendor-provided software fixes, commonly called patches.\n• Ensuring that changes to security configurations are documented, approved, and tested.\n• Ensuring that exploitable files and services are assessed and removed or disabled based upon known\nvulnerabilities and business needs.\n• Updating vulnerability scanning and intrusion detection tools to identify known vulnerabilities and related\nunauthorized activities.\n• Investing in additional technologies or resources to aid in the evaluation, identification and mitigation of\nrisks.\n• Conducting subsequent penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, as warranted.\n• Reviewing performance with service providers to ensure security maintenance and reporting\nresponsibilities are operating according to contract provisions and that service providers provide\nnotification of system security breaches that may affect the Company.\n55\nInternal Controls, Audit, and Testing. Regular internal monitoring is integral to the Company’s risk\nassessment process, which includes regular testing of internal key controls, systems, and procedures. In addition,\nindependent third-party penetration testing to test the effectiveness of security controls and preparedness measures is\nconducted at least annually or more often, if warranted by the risk assessment or other external factors. Management\ndetermines the scope and objectives of the penetration analysis, which may identify additional risks or require additional\ncosts to remediate.\nService Providers. The Company relies, in part, on third-party vendor solutions to support its operations. Many\nof these vendors, especially in the financial services industry, have access to sensitive and proprietary information. In\norder to mitigate the operational, informational and other risks associated with the use of vendors, the Company\nmaintains a Vendor Risk Management Program, which is implemented through a Vendor Risk Management Policy and\nincludes a detailed onboarding process and periodic reviews of vendors with access to sensitive Company data. The\nVendor Risk Management Policy applies to any business arrangement between the Company and another individual or\nentity, by contract or otherwise, in compliance with the Interagency Guidance on Vendor Relationships: Risk\nManagement. The Vendor Risk Management Program is audited as part of the Company’s annual Internal Audit Risk\nAssessment.\nEmployees and Training. Employees are the first line of defense against cybersecurity measures. Each\nemployee is responsible for protecting Company and client information. Employees are provided training at initial\nonboarding and thereafter regarding information security and cybersecurity-related policies and procedures applicable to\ntheir respective roles within the organization. In addition, employees are subjected to regular simulated phishing\nassessments, designed to sharpen threat detection and reporting capabilities. In addition to training, employees are\nsupported with solutions designed to identify, prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from incidents. Notable\ntechnologies include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, security automation and response capabilities, user behavior\nanalytics, multi-factor authentication, data backups to immutable storage and business continuity applications. Notable\nservices include security monitoring and response, continuous vulnerability scanning, third-party monitoring, and threat\nintelligence.\nBoard Reporting. At least annually, the CIO reports to the Board, directly or through the Enterprise-Wide Risk\nManagement Committee, the overall status of the Information Security Program and the Company’s compliance with the\nInteragency Guidelines for Safeguarding Customer Information. Any material findings related to the risk assessment,\nrisk management and control decisions, service provider arrangements, results of testing, security breaches or violations\nare discussed as are management’s responses and any recommendations for program changes.\nProgram Adjustments. The CIO monitors, evaluates, and adjusts the Information Security Program\nconsidering any relevant changes in technology, the sensitivity of its customer information, internal or external threats to\ninformation, and changing business arrangements, such as mergers and acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures,\noutsourcing arrangements, and changes to customer information systems.\nIncident Response Plan. To ensure that information security incidents can be recovered from quickly and with\nthe least impact to the Company and its customers, the Company maintains a structured and systematic incident response\nplan (the “IRP”) for all information security incidents that affect any of the IT systems, network, or data of the\nCompany, including the Company’s data held, or IT services provided by third-party vendors or other service providers.\nThe CISO is responsible for implementing and maintaining the IRP, which includes:\n• Identifying the incident response team (“IRT”) and any appropriate sub-teams to address specific\ninformation security incidents, or categories of information security incidents.\n• Coordinating IRT activities, including developing, maintaining, and following appropriate procedures to\nrespond to and document identified information security incidents.\n• Conducting post-incident reviews to gather feedback on information security incident response procedures\nand address any identified gaps in security measures.\n56\n• Providing training and conducting periodic exercises to promote employee and stakeholder preparedness\nand awareness of the IRP.\n• Reviewing the IRP at least annually, or whenever there is a material change in the Company’s business\npractices that may reasonably affect its cyber incident response procedures.\n• Report up to the Executive Incident Response Committee, as needed.\nITEM 2. Properties\nWe conduct our business through our main office located in Needham, Massachusetts and our branch offices\nlocated in Wellesley, Westwood, Dedham, Medfield, Medford, Dover, Ashland, Millis, Natick and Boston (Mission\nHill), Massachusetts. Additionally, we have two administrative offices in Needham, Massachusetts. We own four of our\noffices, including our main office, and our two administrative offices and we lease seven offices of our offices. At\nDecember 31, 2023 the total net book value of our land, buildings, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and\nequipment was $35.5 million.\nITEM 3. Legal Proceedings\nLegal Proceedings\nAmong other things, the activities of Needham Bank, including with respect to disclosures about and\nimplementation of numerous consumer products, are subject to various laws and numerous regulations, including those\nrelated to unfair or deceptive acts or practices. If Needham Bank is found to have violated one or more consumer\nprotection laws, it may be required to pay restitution to certain affected customers in connection with certain of these\npractices. In addition, as a result of the extensive regulation, supervision and examination of our business described\nelsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations\nand proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business, certain of which may\nresult in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, public or private censure, increased costs, required remediation,\nrestriction on business activities or other impacts on us.\nWe are not involved in any pending legal proceedings as a plaintiff or defendant other than routine legal\nproceedings occurring in the ordinary course of business, and at December 31, 2023, we were not involved in any legal\nproceedings, the outcome of which would be material to our financial condition or results of operations.\nITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nITEM 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of\nEquity Securities\nMarket, Holder and Dividend Information. The Company’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital\nMarket under the symbol “NBBK.” The approximate number of holders of record of NB Bancorp common stock as of\nDecember 31, 2023 was 3,491. Certain shares of NB Bancorp are held in “nominee” or “street” name and accordingly,\nthe number of beneficial owners of such shares is not known or included in the foregoing number.\nNB Bancorp does not currently pay cash dividends on its common stock. Dividend payments by NB Bancorp\nare dependent, in part, on dividends it receives from Needham Bank, because NB Bancorp has no source of income other\nthan dividends from Needham Bank, earnings from the investment of proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock\nin the stock offering which closed in December 2023 retained by NB Bancorp and interest payments with respect to our\n57\nloan to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. See “Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Federal Banking\nRegulation—Capital Distributions.”\nThe Federal Reserve Board has issued supervisory policies providing that dividends should be paid only out of\ncurrent earnings and only if our prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with our capital needs, asset quality\nand overall financial condition. Federal Reserve Board guidance also provides for prior regulatory consultation with\nrespect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the holding company’s net income for the past\nfour quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the holding\ncompany’s overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with its capital needs and overall financial condition. In\naddition, Needham Bank’s ability to pay dividends would be limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer\nrequired by the capital rules, which may limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. No assurances can be given\nthat any dividends will be paid or that, if paid, will not be reduced or eliminated in the future. Special cash dividends,\nstock dividends or returns of capital, to the extent permitted by regulations and policies of the Federal Reserve Board\nand the Commissioner, may be paid in addition to, or in lieu of, regular cash dividends.\nOther than its Employee Stock Ownership Plan, NB Bancorp does not have any equity compensation plans that\nwere not approved by stockholders. NB Bancorp currently has no other equity compensation plans.\nReport of Offering of Securities and Use of Proceeds Therefrom. Not applicable.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nUnder current Federal Reserve Board conversion regulations, the Company may not repurchase shares of its common\nstock during the first year following the Company’s initial public offering, except to fund shareholder-approved equity\nbenefit plans or, with prior regulatory approval, when extraordinary circumstances exist.\nITEM 6. [Reserved]\nITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reflects our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data,\nand is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in\nthis section has been derived from the consolidated financial statements that appear beginning on page 72 of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial\ninformation regarding NB Bancorp and Needham Bank and the consolidated financial statements provided in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for NB Bancorp and, with respect to the year ended December 31 2022, NB Financial,\nMHC, Needham Bank’s mutual holding company parent prior to the mutual-to-stock conversion on December 27, 2023.\nNB Bancorp had not engaged in any material activities prior to December 28, 2023, the date of the consummation of the\nmutual to stock conversion of NB Financial, MHC.\nOur results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference\nbetween the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing\nliabilities. Our results of operations also are affected by our provision for credit losses, noninterest income and\nnoninterest expense. Noninterest income currently consists primarily of customer service fees, swap contract income,\nand income on bank-owned life insurance. Noninterest expense currently consists primarily of expenses related to salary\nand employee benefits and director fees, occupancy and equipment, data processing, marketing and charitable\ncontribution expense, professional fees, federal deposit insurance assessments and other general and administrative\nexpenses.\nOur results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive\nconditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities.\n58\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated\nfinancial statements, which are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial\nstatements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. We consider\nthe accounting policies discussed below to be significant accounting policies. The estimates and assumptions that we use\nare based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nActual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could\nhave a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.\nThe JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for\nqualifying public companies. As an “emerging growth company” we have elected to use the extended transition period\nto delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such\npronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements may not\nbe comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting\nstandards.\nThe following represent our significant accounting policies:\nLoans Held for Investment and Allowance for Credit Losses. Loans that management has the intent and ability\nto hold for the foreseeable future or until loan maturity or pay-off are reported held for investment at their outstanding\nprincipal balance adjusted for any charge-offs and net of any deferred fees (including purchase accounting adjustments)\nand origination costs (collectively referred to as “amortized cost”). Loan origination fees and certain direct origination\ncosts are deferred and amortized as an adjustment of the yield using the payment terms required by the loan contract.\nLoans are generally placed into nonaccrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to either principal\nor interest or when, in the opinion of management, the collection of principal and/or interest is in doubt. A loan remains\nin nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest or past due less than 90 days and\nthe borrower demonstrates the ability to pay and remain current. When cash payments are received, they are applied to\nprincipal first, then to accrued interest. It is the Company’s policy not to record interest income on nonaccrual loans until\nprincipal has become current. In certain instances, accruing loans that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or\ninterest may not go on nonaccrual status if the Company determines that the loans are well-secured and are in the\nprocess of collection. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company elected to exclude accrued interest from the amortized\ncost basis in its determination of the allowance for credit losses (the “ACL”) for loans held for investment, and will\ninstead reverse accrued but unpaid interest through interest income in the period in which the loan is placed on\nnonaccrual status.\nThe ACL represents management’s best estimate of credit losses over the remaining life of the loan portfolio.\nLoans are charged-off against the ACL when management believes the loan balance is no longer collectible. Subsequent\nrecoveries of previously charged-off amounts (recoveries) are recorded as increases to the ACL. The provision for credit\nlosses is an amount sufficient to bring the ACL to an estimated balance that management considers adequate to absorb\nlifetime expected losses in the Company’s held for investment loan portfolio. The ACL is a valuation account that is\ndeducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans.\nManagement’s determination of the adequacy of the ACL under ASC 326 is based on an evaluation of the\ncomposition of the loan portfolio current economic conditions, historical loan loss experience, reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts, and other risk factors. We use a third-party CECL model as part of our estimation of the ACL on a\nquarterly basis. Loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively assessed within pools (or segments). Loss\nestimates within the collectively assessed population are based on a combination of pooled assumptions and loan-level\ncharacteristics. We have determined that using federal call codes is an appropriate loan segmentation methodology, as it\nis generally based on risk characteristics of a loan’s underlying collateral. Using federal call codes also allows us to\nutilize and assess publicly available external information when developing our estimate of the ACL. The weighted\n59\naverage life (“WAL”) method is the primary credit loss estimation methodology we use and involves estimating future\ncash flows for pools of loans using their weighted average life.\nIn applying future economic forecasts, the Company utilizes a forecast period of up to two years. The Company\nconsiders economic forecasts of inflation, Federal Open Market Committee interest rates, national gross domestic\nproduct, and unemployment rates sourced from the Federal Reserve System’s “Beige Book,” Wells Fargo’s “U.S.\nEconomic Outlook,” and the “Economic Forecast” publications from FHN Financial to inform the model for loss\nestimation. Historical loss rates used in the quantitative model are primarily derived using both the Bank’s data,\nsupplemented with peer bank data obtained from publicly available sources (i.e., federal call reports). The Bank’s peer\ngroup is comprised of financial institutions of relatively similar size and in similar markets (i.e. $10.00 billion or less of\ntotal assets and headquartered in Massachusetts). Management also considers qualitative adjustments when estimating\ncredit losses to take into account the model’s quantitative limitations. Qualitative adjustments to quantitative loss factors,\neither negative or positive, may include considerations of economic conditions, volume and severity of past due loans,\nvalue of underlying collateral, experience, depth, and ability of management, and concentrations of credit.\nFor those loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, we evaluate the ACL needs on an individual (or\nloan by loan) basis. This population of individually evaluated loans (or loan relationships with the same primary source\nof repayment) is determined on a quarterly basis and is based on whether the risk grade of the loan is substandard or\nworse and the balance exceeds $500,000 and the loan’s terms differ significantly from other pooled loans. In accordance\nwith our policy, non-accrual residential real estate loans that are well secured (LTV <75%) are not considered to warrant\na downgrade to substandard risk rating and are therefore generally excluded from individually evaluated loans.\nMeasurement of credit loss is based on the expected future cash flows of an individually evaluated loan, discounted at\nthe loan’s effective interest rate, or measured on an observable market value, if one exists, or the estimated market value\nof the collateral underlying the loan, discounted to consider estimated costs to sell the collateral for collateral-dependent\nloans. If the net value is less than the loan’s amortized cost, a specific reserve in the ACL is recorded, which is charged-\noff in the period when management believes the loan balance is no longer collectible.\nIncome Taxes. We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax\nassets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial\nstatement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those\ntemporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance\nwhen it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. We exercise significant\njudgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets. These judgments\nmay require us to make projections of future taxable income and/or to carryback to taxable income in prior years. The\njudgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets, which are inherently subjective, are reviewed\non a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Any reduction in estimated future taxable income may\nrequire us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.\nSecurities Valuation and Credit Losses. We classify our investments in debt securities as either held-to-\nmaturity or available-for-sale. Securities classified as held-to maturity are recorded at cost or amortized cost. Available-\nfor-sale securities are carried at fair value. We obtain our fair values from one or more third-party services. This\nservice’s fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices when such prices are available. If quoted market\nprices are not available, estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of techniques, including extrapolation from\nthe quoted prices of similar instruments or recent trades for thinly traded securities, fundamental analysis, or through\nobtaining purchase quotes. Due to the subjective nature of the valuation process, it is possible that the actual fair values\nof these investments could differ from the estimated amounts, thereby affecting our financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nWe adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for debt securities for which other-than-\ntemporary impairment had been recognized prior to January 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any\nother than-temporarily impaired investment securities. Therefore, upon adoption of ASC 326, we determined that an\nallowance for credit losses on available for sale securities was not deemed material. For available for sale securities,\nmanagement evaluates all investments in an unrealized loss position on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when\n60\neconomic or market conditions warrant such evaluation. If we have the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than\nnot that we will be required to sell the security, the security is written down to fair value and the entire loss is recorded in\nearnings through an allowance for credit losses. If either of the above criteria is not met, we evaluate whether the decline\nin fair value is the result of credit losses or other factors. In making the assessment, we may consider various factors\nincluding the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, performance on any underlying collateral,\ndowngrades in the ratings of the security by a rating agency, the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or\nprincipal payments and adverse conditions specifically related to the security. If the assessment indicates that a credit\nloss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are compared to the amortized cost basis of the\nsecurity and any excess is recorded as an allowance for credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than\nthe amortized cost basis. Any amount of unrealized loss that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit loss\nis recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit loss are recorded as provision for (or\nreversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance for credit loss when management believes an\navailable for sale security is confirmed to be uncollectible or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement\nto sell is met. At December 31, 2023, there was no allowance for credit loss related to the available for sale portfolio.\nAccrued interest receivable on available for sale debt securities totaled $1.2 million at December 31, 2023 and was\nexcluded from the estimate of credit losses.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nTotal Assets. Total assets increased $941.1 million, or 26.2%, to $4.53 billion as of December 31, 2023 from\n$3.59 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily the result of increases in net loans and federal funds\nsold.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents increased $116.0 million, or 31.0%, to $272.6 million\nas of December 31, 2023 from $156.5 million at December 31, 2022. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was due\nto the proceeds from the Company’s mutual-to-stock conversion and related IPO, which closed on December 27, 2023.\nSecurities Available-for-Sale. Securities available-for-sale decreased $56.0 million, or 22.8%, to\n$189.5 million as of December 31, 2023 from $245.5 million at December 31, 2022. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, purchases of securities were more than offset by the fair value decline in the portfolio, as well as\namortization and calls. No securities were sold during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLoans, net. Loans, net increased $866.6 million, or 29.0%, to $3.86 billion at December 31, 2023 from\n$2.99 billion at December 31, 2022. We experienced increases in each of our loan portfolios. From December 31, 2022\nto December 31, 2023, one- to four-family residential real estate loans, including home equity loans, increased\n$187.1 million, or 18.6%; our commercial real estate portfolio, including multi-family real estate loans, increased\n$372.0 million, or 36.8%; construction and land development increased $70.3 million, or 12.7%; commercial and\nindustrial loans increased $240.5 million, or 97.2%; and consumer loans increased $8.3 million, or 5.3%. The increase in\nthese loan portfolios reflects our strategy to grow the balance sheet by continuing to diversify into these higher-yielding\nloans to improve net margins and manage interest rate risk. In addition, to help manage interest rate risk and generate\nnon-interest income, occasionally we sell one- to four-family residential mortgage loans into the secondary market on a\nservicing-retained basis. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold $2.1 million in loans and recognized gains\nof $29,000.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock. The FHLB is a cooperative bank that provides services to its member\nfinancial institutions. The primary reason for our membership in the FHLB is to gain access to a reliable source of\nwholesale funding and as a tool to manage interest rate risk. The purchase of stock in the FHLB is a requirement for a\nmember to gain access to funding. We purchase and/or are subject to redemption of FHLB stock proportional to the\nvolume of funding received and view the holdings as a necessary long-term investment for the purpose of balance sheet\nliquidity and not for investment return. We held an investment in FHLB stock of $14.6 million and $13.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of stock we are required to purchase is in proportion to our\nFHLB borrowings and level of total assets. Accordingly, the increase in the FHLB stock is due to increased borrowings.\n61\nBank-owned Life Insurance. We invest in bank-owned life insurance to help offset the costs of our employee\nbenefit plan obligations. Bank-owned life insurance also generally provides noninterest income that is nontaxable. Bank-\nowned life insurance increased $1.5 million, or 3.1%, to $50.5 million as of December 31, 2023 from $49.0 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase during 2023 was from increases in the cash surrender value of the policies.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Assets. Prepaid expenses and other assets consist primarily of right of use assets\nrelated to our long-term leases and derivatives with a positive fair value and other investments and decreased\n$4.1 million, or 7.1%, to $53.1 million as of December 31, 2023 from $57.2 million as of December 31, 2021. The\ndecrease resulted primarily from increases in the value of our right of use assets and derivatives from hedging strategies\nand other investments.\nDeposits. Deposits increased $500.6 million, or 17.3%, to $3.39 billion as of December 31, 2023 from\n$2.89 billion as of December 31, 2022. Core deposits (which we define as all deposits including certificates of deposit,\nother than brokered deposits) increased $567.0 million, or 21.5%, to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2023 from $2.6 billion\nat December 31, 2022. The increase resulted from increases in customer deposits, primarily certificates of deposit, which\nincreased $353.8 million, or 36.9% from the prior year, along with money market and checking accounts, which\nincreased $229.1 million and $82.9 million, respectively, from December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had approximately $183.6 million and $250.0 million of brokered\ndeposits, respectively. The decrease in brokered deposits during 2023 resulted from the growth in the core deposit\nportfolio.\nBorrowings. We had $283.3 million of borrowings at December 31, 2023 as compared to $293.1 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. The decrease is due to funding needs and our ability to repay some advances. Our borrowings\nconsisted solely of FHLB advances.\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities. Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased $28.9 million, or\n55.20%, to $81.3 million as of December 31, 2023 from $52.4 million at December 31, 2022. The increase resulted from\nan IPO-related payable, an increase in the allowance for unfunded commitments, and an increase in derivatives with a\nnegative fair value.\nEquity. Shareholders’ equity was $758.0 million, representing an increase of $413.9 million, or 120.3%, from\nthe prior year. The increase resulted primarily from the capital raised during the Company’s public offering, which was\nconsummated on December 27, 2023, and net income of $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022\nNet Income. Net income was $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of\n$30.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $20.2 million, or 67.3%. The decrease was primarily\ndue to a one-time donation of $2.0 million in cash and 1.7 million shares of common stock to the Needham Bank\nCharitable Foundation at a total market value of $19.1 million, in addition to a $7.9 million discretionary bonus awarded\nby the Compensation Committee, a $1.9 million pension expense and $3.7 million of additional income tax expense\nrelated to the impact of public company tax laws. In addition to the mutual-to-stock conversion expense, the Company\nalso recognized $7.2 million in additional provision for credit losses, due to the growth of the loan portfolio and\nunfunded commitments. Partially offsetting these increases in expenses was a $25.1 million, or 23.9%, increase in net\ninterest income due to net loan growth and an increase in the weighted average yield on our interest-earning assets and a\n$6.3 million, or 67.9%, increase in noninterest income due to increases from employee retention credit income and\nincreases in cash management fees from customers.\nInterest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $100.0 million, or 83.0%, to $220.5\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $120.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due\nto a $98.2 million increase in interest and fees on loans. The increase in interest and fees on loans was primarily due to an\nincrease of $979.5 million in the average balance of the loan portfolio to $3.46 billion for the year ended December 31,\n2023 from $2.49 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and an increase of 154 basis points in the weighted\n62\naverage yield for the loan portfolio to 6.12% for 2023 from 4.58% for 2022, reflecting the increasing rate environment\nyear to year as well as the growth of our loan portfolio.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $807.2 million, to $3.81 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023\nfrom $3.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 177 basis points\nto 5.78% for the year ended December 31, 2023 from 4.01% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased $74.9 million, or 481.7%, to $90.4 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023 from $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Interest expense on deposit\naccounts increased $63.7 million, or 502.0%, to $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $12.7 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022, due to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits of\n$516.6 million, or 23.6%, to $2.70 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $2.19 billion for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and an increase in the weighted average rate on interest-bearing deposits to 3.05% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 from 0.68% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nInterest expense on FHLB advances increased $11.2 million, or 391.4%, to $14.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 from $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average balance of FHLB advances\nincreased $171.1 million, or 193.7%, to $259.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $88.3 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 2022 and the weighted average cost of these advances increased to 5.41% for 2023 from\n3.24% for 2022. The increase in the average balance was due to our strategy to utilize additional borrowings to support\nloan growth and for liquidity management.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income was $130.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared\nto $105.0 million in the prior year, representing an increase of $25.1 million, or 23.9%. The net interest margin was\n3.41% for 2023, representing a decrease of eight basis points from 2022, primarily due to an increase in the cost of\nliabilities used to fund the Company’s loan growth. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a\n$807.2 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets during the year ended December 31, 2023,\nwhich outpaced growth in average interest-bearing liabilities, which grew by $689.7 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The net interest margin decreased slightly to 3.41% for the year ended December 31, 2023 from\n3.49% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to the increase\nin the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities increasing by 237 basis points during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, while the yield on interest-earning assets grew by 177 basis points.\nProvision for Credit Losses. Based on management’s analysis of the adequacy of allowance for credit losses, a\nprovision of $13.9 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023 in accordance with the CECL standard,\ncompared to a provision of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 in accordance with the incurred loss\nmethodology standard. The $7.2 million, or 107.2%, increase in the provision was primarily due to the material growth\nin total loans which increased $878.3 million, or 29.1%, to $3.89 billion at December 31, 2023 from $3.02 billion at\nDecember 31, 2022. The provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of a provision for\ncredit losses of $9.7 million and a provision for unfunded commitments of $4.2 million.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $6.3 million, or 68.0%, to $15.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 from $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase resulted primarily from a\n$3.5 million employee retention credit received in 2023 resulting from COVID-19 impacts, and a $2.7 million increase\nin customer service fees, primarily from increased money service fees related to the cannabis banking services. The table\nbelow sets forth our noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n63\nYear ended\nDecember 31, Change\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Amount Percent\nGain from bargain purchase and assumption agreement $ — $ 1,070 $ (1,070) (100.00%)\nCustomer service fees 7,817 5,138 2,679 52.14%\nIncrease in cash surrender value of BOLI 1,510 1,157 353 30.51%\nMortgage banking income 581 595 (14) (2.35%)\nSwap contract income 2,153 1,262 891 70.60%\nEmployee retention credit income 3,452 — 3,452 100.00%\nOther income 64 53 11 20.75%\nTotal noninterest income $ 15,577 $ 9,275 $ 6,302 67.95%\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense for 2023 was $119.9 million, representing an increase of\n$48.8 million, or 68.5%, from the prior year, and included certain one-time costs associated with the Company’s mutual-\nto-stock conversion during the year ended December 31, 2023. Excluding expenses related to the mutual-to-stock\nconversion and certain other non-operating items, noninterest expense on an operating basis for 2023 was $91.0 million,\nwhich represents a $19.8 million, or 27.9%, increase from 2022 as the Company continued to invest in infrastructure to\nsupport growth. Noninterest expense increased $48.8 million, or 68.5%, to $119.9 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 from $71.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Salary and employee benefit expenses\nincreased $20.9 million, or 44.0%. The increase in salary and employee benefits resulted primarily from the hiring of\nadditional employees consistent with our business strategy to grow the Company, as well as discretionary bonuses\nawarded by the Compensation Committee. Charitable contribution expense increased $19.3 million resulting from a\n$19.1 million charitable contribution as part of the Company’s mutual-to-stock conversion and related IPO.\nAdditionally, director and professional fees increased $1.5 million, or 31.0%, resulting primarily from increased\nprofessional services in connection with our loan operations, and FDIC insurance expense increased $2.9 million, or\n157.4%, resulting from an increase in asset growth and a reduction in capital ratios. The table below sets forth our\nnoninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear ended\nDecember 31, Change\n(Dollars in thousands) 2023 2022 Amount Percent\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 68,344 $ 47,466 $ 20,878 43.99%\nDirector and professional service fees 6,232 4,758 1,474 30.98%\nOccupancy and equipment expenses 5,192 4,354 838 19.25%\nData processing expenses 7,500 5,657 1,843 32.58%\nCharitable contribution expense 20,335 1,066 19,269 1,807.60%\nMarketing expense 2,747 2,338 409 17.49%\nFDIC and state insurance assessments 4,707 1,829 2,878 157.35%\nGeneral and administrative expenses 4,848 3,683 1,165 31.63%\nTotal noninterest expense $ 119,905 $ 71,151 $ 48,754 68.52%\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense decreased $4.3 million, or 68.1%, to $2.0 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 from $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The effective tax rate was 17.1% and\n17.4% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate decreased during 2023\nprimarily as a result of a decrease in income before taxes of $24.5 million, or 67.45% in comparison to 2022.\nAverage Balances and Yields. The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs,\nand certain other information for the periods indicated.

Our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the\nmajority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations\nis to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our financial condition and results of operations to changes in\nmarket interest rates. Our ERM Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and\nliabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment,\ncapital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the policy and guidelines\napproved by our board of directors. The ERM Committee meets at least quarterly, is comprised of directors, executive\nofficers and certain senior management, and reports to the full board of directors on at least a quarterly basis. We\ncurrently utilize a third-party modeling program, prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate our sensitivity to changing\ninterest rates, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for\nmanaging this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors.\nWe have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to\nchanges in interest rates. We have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk:\n• maintaining capital levels that exceed the thresholds for well-capitalized status under federal regulations;\n• maintaining a prudent level of liquidity;\n• maintaining a prudent level of off-balance sheet funding capacity\n• growing our volume of core deposit accounts;\n• utilizing our investment securities portfolio and interest rate swaps as part of our balance sheet asset and\nliability and interest rate risk management strategy to reduce the impact of movements in interest rates on\nnet interest income and economic value of equity;\n• managing our utilization of wholesale funding with borrowings from the FHLB and brokered deposits in a\nprudent manner;\n66\n• continuing to diversify our loan portfolio by adding more commercial-related loans and consumer loans,\nwhich typically have shorter maturities and/or balloon payments; and\n• continuing to price our one-to-four family residential real estate loan products in a way that encourages\nborrowers to select our adjustable-rate loans as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate loans.\nShortening the average term of our interest-earning assets by increasing our investments in shorter-term assets,\nas well as originating loans with variable interest rates, helps to match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and\nliabilities better, thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates.\nOn occasion we have employed various financial risk methodologies that limit, or “hedge,” the adverse effects\nof rising or decreasing interest rates on our loan portfolios and short-term liabilities. We also engage in hedging\nstrategies with respect to arrangements where our customers swap floating interest rate obligations for fixed interest rate\nobligations, or vice versa. Our hedging activity varies based on the level and volatility of interest rates and other\nchanging market conditions.\nNet Interest Income. We analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through a net interest income\nmodel. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as\nloans and securities, and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We\nestimate what our net interest income would be for a 12-month period. We then calculate what the net interest income\nwould be for the same period under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases or decreases\ninstantaneously by various basis point increments, with changes in interest rates representing immediate and permanent,\nparallel shifts in the yield curve. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals\none percent. An increase in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100-basis point increase in the\n“Change in Interest Rates” column below.\nThe following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2023, the calculation of the estimated changes in our net\ninterest income that would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.\nAt December 31, 2023\nChange in Interest Rates Net Interest Income Year Year 1 Change from\n(basis points) (1) 1 Forecast Level\n(Dollars in thousands)\n300 $ 152,223 0.4%\n200 152,027 0.3%\n100 152,218 0.4%\nLevel 151,577 —%\n(100) 149,636 (1.3)%\n(200) 146,920 (3.1)%\n(300) 144,447 (4.7)%\n(1) Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.\nThe table above indicates that at December 31, 2023, we would have experienced a 0.3% decrease in net\ninterest income in the event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and a 3.1%\ndecrease in net interest income in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates.\nEconomic Value of Equity. We also compute amounts by which the net present value of our assets and\nliabilities (economic value of equity or “EVE”) would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market\ninterest rates. This model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure the\ninterest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and\noff-balance sheet contract under the assumptions that the United States Treasury yield curve increases instantaneously by\n100, 200, and 300 basis point increments or decreases instantaneously by 100 or 200 basis point increments, with\nchanges in interest rates representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve.\n67\nThe following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2023, the calculation of the estimated changes in our EVE\nthat would result from the designated immediate changes in the United States Treasury yield curve.\nEstimat ed I ncrease\nAt December 31, 2023 Estimated (Decrease) in EVE\nChange in Interest Rates (basis points) (1) EVE (2) Amount Percent\n(Dollars in thousands)\n300 $ 743,527 $ (20,750) (2.7)%\n200 752,755 (11,522) (1.5)%\n100 761,350 (2,927) (0.4)%\nLevel 764,277 n/a —%\n(100) 758,549 (5,728) (0.7)%\n(200) 742,157 (22,120) (2.9)%\n(300) 718,598 (45,679) (6.0)%\n(1) Assumes an immediate uniform change in interest rates at all maturities.\n(2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.\nThe table above indicates that at December 31, 2023, we would have experienced a 1.5% decrease in EVE in\nthe event of an instantaneous parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates and a 2.9% decrease in EVE in the\nevent of an instantaneous 200 basis point decrease in market interest rates.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements.\nModeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and\ncosts respond to changes in market interest rates. The net interest income and net economic value tables presented\nassume that the composition of our interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains\nconstant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly\nacross the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the\ntables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not\nintended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates, and actual results may\ndiffer.\nInterest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example,\ndecreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of our loans, mortgage servicing rights, deposits and\nborrowings.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business.\nLiquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund\ncurrent and planned expenditures. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans\nand securities, and proceeds from maturities of securities. We are also able to borrow from the FHLB. At December 31,\n2023, we had outstanding advances of $283.3 million from the FHLB. At December 31, 2023, we had unused borrowing\ncapacity of $608.6 million with the FHLB. At December 31, 2023 we also had a $46.2 million available line of credit\nwith the Discount Window at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Additionally, at December 31, 2023, we had $183.6\nmillion of brokered deposits and pursuant to our internal liquidity policy, which allows us to utilize brokered deposits up\nto 10.0% of our total assets, we had an additional capacity of up to approximately $269.7 million of brokered deposits.\nWhile maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit\nflows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our\nmost liquid assets are cash and short-term investments. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating,\nfinancing, lending, and investing activities during any given period.\nOur cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing\nactivities, and financing activities. For additional information, see the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years\n68\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included as part of the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position. We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis.\nWe anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments. Based on our deposit\nretention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will\nbe retained.\nAt December 31, 2023, Needham Bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements, and was categorized\nas well-capitalized at that date. Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification\nof well-capitalized status that would change our category. See Note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements\non page 105.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nCommitments. As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with\noff-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual\nobligations represent our future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire\nwithout being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to\nloans we make. At December 31, 2023, the unfunded portion of construction loans, home equity lines of credit,\ncommercial lines of credit and other lines of credit, along with letters of credit, totaled $1.1 billion. Our allowance for\ncredit losses on these unfunded commitments amounted to $6.0 million. We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds\navailable to meet our current lending commitments. Time deposits that are scheduled to mature in less than one year\nfrom December 31, 2023 totaled $340.8 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of these time deposits\nwill be retained. However, if a substantial portion of these time deposits is not retained, we may utilize advances from\nthe FHLB, brokered deposits or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels\nof interest expense.\nContractual Obligations. In the ordinary course of our operations, we enter into certain contractual obligations.\nSuch obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect\nto borrowed funds and deposit liabilities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 23 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting\npronouncements that may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been\nprepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in\nterms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to\ninflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. Unlike most\nindustrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result,\ninterest rates, generally, have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does inflation.\nInterest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services.\nITEM 7A.

(the “Company”) as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity\nand cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the\n“financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position\nof the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then\nended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for credit\nlosses effective January 1, 2023 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards\nCodification No. 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (ASC 326). The Company adopted the new credit loss\nstandard using the modified retrospective method such that prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be\nreported in accordance with previously applicable generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion\non the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its\ninternal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control\nover financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Elliott Davis, LLC\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.\nColumbia, South Carolina\nMarch 28, 2024\n71\nNB

Policies\nCorporate Structure and Nature of Operations\nNB Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”), a Maryland corporation, is a bank holding company. Through its wholly-owned\nsubsidiary, Needham Bank (the “Bank”), the Company provides a variety of banking services, through its full-service bank\nbranches, located in Massachusetts.\nThe Bank’s deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up\nto federal limits. All deposits above the FDIC insurance amount are insured by the Depositors Insurance Fund (DIF). The\nDIF is a private, industry-sponsored insurance fund that insures all deposits above FDIC limits at our member banks. The\nBank provides numerous services to customers, including the maintenance of checking, savings, money market and\ncertificate of deposit accounts, and the granting of several types of residential, construction, commercial, and consumer\nloans. The primary market area of the Company is the metro-west area of Boston and surrounding communities, with\nheadquarters in Needham and branch locations in Wellesley, Westwood, Dedham, Medfield, Medford, Dover, Ashland,\nMillis, Natick and Mission Hill. The Bank is subject to competition from other financial institutions, including commercial\nbanks, other savings and co-operative banks, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, and other financial service\nproviders. The primary regulators of the Company are the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the Federal Reserve\nSystem (see Note 11, Regulatory Capital Requirements). As part of the criteria for membership in the Federal Reserve\nSystem, the Company is required to maintain stock in the Federal Reserve Bank (see Note 2, Investment Securities).\nConversion and Reorganization\nPursuant to a Plan of Conversion (the “Plan”), NB Financial, MHC (the “MHC”), the Bank’s former mutual holding\ncompany parent and the predecessor of the Company, converted from a mutual holding company into a publicly traded\nstock form of organization on December 27, 2023. In connection with the conversion, the MHC transferred to the Company\n100% of MHC’s common stock, and immediately thereafter merged into the Company.\nPursuant to the Plan, the Company sold 40,997,500 shares of common stock in a public offering at $10.00 per share for\nnet offering proceeds of approximately $400.4 million. The Company completed the offering on December 27, 2023.\nEffective as of December 27, 2023, the Company donated $2.0 million of cash and 1,708,229 shares of common stock to\nNeedham Bank Charitable Foundation (the “Foundation”). A total of 42,705,729 shares of common stock of the Company\nwere issued and outstanding immediately after the donation to the Foundation. After the completion of the conversion, the\nBank’s employee stock ownership plan (the “ESOP”) purchased 1,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.\nThe cost of conversion and issuing the capital stock was deferred and deducted from the proceeds of the offering. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company incurred approximately $9.6 million in conversion costs, which are included in\nshareholders’ equity on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\nIn connection with the conversion, liquidation accounts are established by the Company and the Bank in an aggregate\namount equal to (i) the MHC’s ownership interest in the shareholders’ equity of NB Financial, Inc. as of the date of the\nlatest statement of financial condition included in the Company’s definitive prospectus dated October 12, 2023, plus (ii) the\nvalue of the net assets of the MHC as of the date of the MHC’s latest statement of financial condition before the\nconsummation of the Conversion (excluding the MHC’s ownership interest in NB Financial, Inc.). Each eligible account\nholder and supplemental eligible account holder is entitled to a proportionate share of the liquidation accounts in the event\nof a liquidation of (i) the Company and the Bank or (ii) the Bank, and only in such events. This share will be reduced if\nthe eligible account holder’s or supplemental account holder’s deposit balance falls below the amounts on the date of\nrecord and will cease to exist if the account is closed. The liquidation account will never be increased despite any increase\nafter conversion in the related deposit balance. The Bank may not pay a dividend on its capital stock if the effect thereof\nwould cause retained earnings to be reduced below the liquidation account amount or regulatory capital requirements.\n77\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States (“GAAP”) as set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and its\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) as well as the rules and\ninterpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the authority of federal securities\nlaws.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities in\nwhich it holds a controlling financial interest through being the primary beneficiary or through holding a majority of the\nvoting interest. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCertain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.\nOperating Segments\nAccounting standards require that information be reported about a company’s operating segments using a “management\napproach.” Reportable segments are identified in these standards as those revenue producing components for which\nseparate financial information is produced internally and which are subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision\nmaker. While the chief operating decision maker monitors the revenue streams of the various products and services,\noperations are managed, and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis. Accordingly, all of the financial\nservice operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable segment.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nMaterial estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the\nallowance for credit losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans,\nthe valuation of deferred tax assets, actuarial estimates related to the Company’s various retirement programs, and the\nvaluation of financial instruments. In connection with the determination of the allowances for credit losses on loans and\nforeclosed real estate, management obtains independent appraisals for significant properties.\nA majority of the Company’s loan portfolio consists of one to four-family residential, commercial real estate, construction\nand land development loans in the metro-west area of Boston and its surrounding communities. Accordingly, the ultimate\ncollectability of a substantial portion of the Company’s loan portfolio and the recovery of the carrying amount of foreclosed\nreal estate are susceptible to changes in local market conditions.\nWhile management uses currently available information to recognize losses on loans and foreclosed real estate, future\nadditions to the allowances for credit losses on loans and foreclosed real estate may be necessary based on changes in local\neconomic conditions. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review\nthe Company’s allowances for credit losses on loans and foreclosed real estate. Such agencies may require the Company\nto recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their\nexamination. Because of these factors, it is reasonably possible that the allowance for losses on loans and foreclosed real\nestate may change in the near future.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards – On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-13 –\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU\n2016-13”) along with amendments ASU 2019-11 - Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments –\nCredit Losses, and ASU 2022-02 - Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and\n78\nVintage Disclosures (“ASU 2022-02”). Together, these ASUs, referred to herein as ASC 326, replace the incurred loss\nimpairment methodology with the current expected credit loss methodology (“CECL”) and require consideration of a\nbroader range of information to determine credit loss estimates at the reporting date based on historical experience, current\nconditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASC 326 applies to financial assets subject to credit losses that are\nmeasured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures, which include, but are not limited to, loans\nreceivable, leases, held-to-maturity (“HTM”) securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees.\nIn addition, ASC 326 made changes to the accounting for available for sale (“AFS”) debt securities. One such change is\nto require credit losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down on available for sale debt securities if\nmanagement does not intend to sell and does not believe that it is more likely than not, they will be required to sell.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for debt securities for which other-than-\ntemporary impairment had been recognized prior to January 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have\nany other than-temporarily impaired investment securities. Upon adoption of ASC 326, the Company determined that an\nallowance for credit losses on available for sale securities was not required.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets measured at amortized\ncost and off-balance sheet credit exposures, which included loans receivable and commitments to extend credit (loan\ncommitments and stand-by letters of credit), respectively. The Company does not have any securities classified as HTM.\nResults for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2023 are presented under ASC 326 while prior period amounts are\nreported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP.\nThe following table presents the impact to the consolidated balance sheet as the result of adopting ASC 326 effective\nJanuary 1, 2023.\nJanuary 1, 2023 December 31, 2022 Impact of\nPost-ASC 326 Pre-ASC 326 ASC 326\n(In thousands) Adoption Adoption Adoption\nAssets:\nLoans receivable, net of deferred fees and costs $ 3,015,445 $ 3,015,445 $ —\nAllowance for credit losses (26,187) (25,028) (1,159)\nDeferred income tax asset 7,862 7,035 827\nLiabilities:\nReserve for unfunded commitments (1,786) — (1,786)\nEquity:\nRetained earnings 356,348 358,466 (2,118)\nOn January 1, 2023, the Company on a modified retrospective basis early adopted ASU 2023-02, Investments – Equity\nMethod and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Investments in Tax Credit Structures. This ASU allows reporting entities to elect\nto account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method (“PAM”), regardless of the\nprogram giving rise to the related income tax credits. Previously, reporting entities were permitted to apply PAM only to\nqualifying tax equity investments in low-income housing tax credit structures (“LIHTCs”). The new guidance was\neffective for public business entities for fiscal years, including interim periods within, beginning after December 15, 2023.\nEarly adoption is permitted, and the amendments are applied either on a modified retrospective or retrospective basis. The\nadoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nLoans Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”) – Loans that management has the intent and ability to\nhold for the foreseeable future or until loan maturity or pay-off are reported held for investment at their outstanding\nprincipal balance adjusted for any charge-offs and net of any deferred fees (including purchase accounting adjustments)\nand origination costs (collectively referred to as “amortized cost”). Loan origination fees and certain direct origination\ncosts are deferred and amortized as an adjustment of the yield using the payment terms required by the loan contract.\n79\nLoans are generally placed into nonaccrual status when they are past due 90 days or more as to either principal or interest\nor when, in the opinion of management, the collection of principal and/or interest is in doubt. A loan remains in nonaccrual\nstatus until the loan is current as to payment of both principal and interest or past due less than 90 days and the borrower\ndemonstrates the ability to pay and remain current. When cash payments are received, they are applied to principal first,\nthen to accrued interest. It is the Company’s policy not to record interest income on nonaccrual loans until principal has\nbecome current. In certain instances, accruing loans that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest may not\ngo on nonaccrual status if the Company determines that the loans are well-secured and are in the process of collection. In\naccordance with ASC 326, the Company elected to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis in its\ndetermination of the ACL for loans receivable, and will instead reverse accrued but unpaid interest through interest income\nin the period in which the loan is placed on nonaccrual status. Accrued interest receivable on loans amounted to\napproximately $16.1 million and $9.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe ACL represents management’s best estimate of credit losses over the remaining life of the loan portfolio. Loans are\ncharged-off against the ACL when management believes the loan balance is no longer collectible. Subsequent recoveries\nof previously charged-off amounts are recorded as increases to the ACL. The provision for credit losses is an amount\nsufficient to bring the ACL to an estimated balance that management considers adequate to absorb lifetime expected losses\nin the Company’s held for investment loan portfolio. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’\namortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans.\nManagement’s determination of the adequacy of the ACL under ASC 326 is based on an evaluation of the composition of\nthe loan portfolio current economic conditions, historical loan loss experience, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and\nother risk factors. The Company uses a third-party CECL model as part of its estimation of the ACL on a quarterly basis.\nLoans with similar risk characteristics are collectively assessed within pools (or segments). Loss estimates within the\ncollectively assessed population are based on a combination of pooled assumptions and loan-level characteristics. The\nCompany has determined that using federal call codes is an appropriate loan segmentation methodology, as it is generally\nbased on risk characteristics of a loan’s underlying collateral. Using federal call codes also allows the Company to utilize\nand assess publicly available external information when developing its estimate of the ACL. The weighted average\nremaining maturity (“WARM”) method is the primary credit loss estimation methodology used by the Company and\ninvolves estimating future cash flows and expected credit losses for pools of loans using their expected remaining weighted\naverage life.\nIn applying future economic forecasts, the Company utilizes a forecast period of up to two years. The Company considers\neconomic forecasts of inflation, Federal Open Market Committee interest rates, national gross domestic product, and\nunemployment rates sourced from the Federal Reserve System’s “Beige Book,” Wells Fargo’s “U.S. Economic Outlook,”\nand the “Economic Forecast” publications from FHN Financial to inform the model for loss estimation. Historical loss\nrates used in the quantitative model are primarily derived using both the Bank’s data, supplemented with peer bank data\nobtained from publicly available sources (i.e., federal call reports). The Bank’s peer group is comprised of financial\ninstitutions of relatively similar size and in similar markets (i.e., $10.00 billion or less of total assets and headquartered in\nMassachusetts). Management also considers qualitative adjustments when estimating credit losses to take into account the\nmodel’s quantitative limitations. Qualitative adjustments to quantitative loss factors, either negative or positive, may\ninclude considerations of economic conditions, volume and severity of past due loans, value of underlying collateral,\nexperience, depth, and ability of management, and concentrations of credit.\nFor those loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, the Company evaluates the ACL needs on an individual (or\nloan by loan) basis. This population of individually evaluated loans (or loan relationships with the same primary source of\nrepayment) is determined on a quarterly basis and is based on whether the risk grade of the loan is substandard or worse\nand the balance exceeds $500,000, and the loan’s terms differ significantly from other pooled loans. In accordance with\nthe Company’s policy, non-accrual residential real estate loans that are well secured (LTV <75%) are not considered to\nwarrant a downgrade to substandard risk rating and are therefore excluded from individually evaluated loans. Measurement\nof credit loss is based on the expected future cash flows of an individually evaluated loan, discounted at the loan’s effective\ninterest rate, or measured on an observable market value, if one exists, or the estimated market value of the collateral\nunderlying the loan, discounted to consider estimated costs to sell the collateral for collateral-dependent loans. If the net\nvalue is less than the loan’s amortized cost, a specific reserve in the ACL is recorded, which is charged-off in the period\nwhen management believes the loan balance is no longer collectible.\n80\nThe Company’s Allowance Committee approves the key methodologies and assumptions, as well as the final ACL on a\nquarterly basis. While management uses available information at the time of estimation to determine expected credit losses\non loans, future changes in the ACL may be necessary based on changes in portfolio composition, portfolio credit quality,\nand/or economic conditions. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review its ACL and may require an increase\nin the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of\nmanagement.\nUpon the adoption of ASC 326, the Company recognized an adjustment to retained earnings in the amount of $2.1 million,\nand recorded an adjustment to the allowance for credit losses in loans of approximately of $1.2 million and unfunded\ncommitments on loans in the amount of approximately $1.8 million, net of deferred taxes of approximately $827,000.\nSubsequent to the CECL adoption, management refined the modeling assuming and enhanced the CECL calculation,\nincluding the reserve for unfunded commitments, specifically regarding the probability of funding assumptions related to\nunfunded commitments and enhanced the qualitative analysis used in the determination of expected credit losses. The\nimpact of these changes, in addition to growth in the unfunded commitment balances resulted in provisions for credit\nlosses of $4.2 million.\nCollateral-dependent Loans – The Company has certain loans for which repayment is dependent upon the operation or\nsale of collateral, as the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The underlying collateral can vary based upon the\ntype of loan. The following provides more detail about the types of collateral that secure collateral-dependent loans:\n• Commercial real estate loans may be secured by either owner occupied commercial real estate or non-owner-\noccupied investment commercial real estate. Typically, owner occupied commercial real estate loans are\nsecured by office buildings, warehouses, manufacturing facilities, and other commercial and industrial\nproperties occupied by operating companies. Repayment is generally from the cash flows of the business\noccupying the property. Non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans are generally secured by office\nbuildings and complexes, retail facilities, multifamily complexes, land under development, industrial\nproperties, as well as other commercial or industrial real estate.\n• Commercial and industrial loans may be secured by non-real estate collateral such as accounts receivable,\ninventory, equipment, or other similar assets.\n• Residential real estate loans are typically secured by first mortgages, and in some cases could be secured by\na second mortgage.\n• Home equity lines of credit are generally secured by second mortgages on residential real estate property.\n• Consumer loans are generally secured by boat and recreational vehicles, automobiles, solar panels and other\npersonal property. Some consumer loans are unsecured, have no underlying collateral, and would not be\nconsidered collateral-dependent.\nModified Loans – ASU 2022-22 eliminated the concept of troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) from the accounting\nstandards for companies that have adopted ASC 326. ASU 2022-02 also requires additional disclosures for certain loan\nmodifications and disclosures of gross charge-offs by year of origination. Specifically, loan modification disclosures in\nperiods subsequent to the adoption of ASC 326 must be made for modifications of existing loans to borrowers who were\nexperiencing financial difficulties at the time of the modification. The modification type must include a direct change in\nthe timing or amount of a loan’s contractual cash flows. The additional disclosures are applicable to situations where there\nis: principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension, or any\ncombination thereof.\nAvailable for Sale Securities – The Company evaluates the fair value and credit quality of its AFS securities portfolio on\na quarterly basis. In the event the fair value of a security falls below its amortized cost basis, the security is evaluated to\ndetermine whether the decline in value was caused by changes in market interest rates or security credit quality. The\nprimary indicators of credit quality for the Company’s AFS securities portfolio are security type and credit rating, which\n81\nis influenced by a number of security-specific factors that may include obligor cash flow, geography, seniority, and others.\nIf unrealized losses are related to credit quality, the Company estimates the credit-related loss by evaluating the present\nvalue of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. Subsequent to\nthe adoption of ASC 326, if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis\nof the security and a credit loss exists, then an ACL is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value\nis less than amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any other-than-temporarily impaired\nAFS securities. Upon adoption of ASC 326, the Company determined that an ACL on AFS securities was not warranted.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was no allowance for credit losses related to the available for sale portfolio.\nFor AFS debt securities, management evaluates all investments in an unrealized loss position on a quarterly basis, and\nmore frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation. If the Company has the intent to sell the\nsecurity or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security, the security is written down to\nfair value and the entire loss is recorded in earnings through an allowance for credit loss. If either of the above criteria is\nnot met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is the result of credit losses or other factors. In making\nthe assessment, the Company may consider various factors including the extent to which fair value is less than amortized\ncost, performance on any underlying collateral, downgrades in the ratings of the security by a rating agency, the failure of\nthe issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments and adverse conditions specifically related to the security. If\nthe assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are compared to\nthe amortized cost basis of the security and any excess is recorded as an allowance for credit loss, limited by the amount\nthat the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any amount of unrealized loss that has not been recorded through\nan allowance for credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit loss are\nrecorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses are charged against the allowance for credit loss when\nmanagement believes an available for sale security is confirmed to be uncollectible or when either of the criteria regarding\nintent or requirement to sell is met. As of December 31, 2023, there was no allowance for credit loss related to the\navailable- for-sale portfolio. Accrued interest receivable on available for sale debt securities totaled $1.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2023 and was excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\nPurchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income, using the interest method, to arrive at periodic interest\nincome at a constant effective yield, thereby reflecting the securities’ market yield. Gains and losses on the sale of securities\nare recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific identification method. Such gains and losses are\nrecognized within non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments – The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in\nwhich the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is\nunconditionally cancellable by the Company. The reserve for unfunded commitments is adjusted as a provision for credit\nloss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur, the existence of any third-party\nguarantees, and an estimate of credit losses on commitments expected to be funded using the same loss rates of similar\nfinancial instruments derived in the estimation of ACL for loans receivable. Upon the adoption of ASC 326, the Company\nrecorded an increase in its reserve for unfunded commitments of $1.8 million (included in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities), which after related income tax effects, reduced equity by $1.3 million.\nComprehensive Income – Under generally accepted accounting principles, “comprehensive income” is defined as the\nchange in equity during a period due to transactions, events and circumstances arising from non-owner sources.\nComprehensive income includes net income under generally accepted accounting principles as well as “other\ncomprehensive income” (“OCI”), which consists of items that are excluded from net income and reported as changes in\nseparate components of equity as required by other accounting standards. The Company’s OCI consists of unrealized gains\nand losses on investment securities available for sale (see Note 2), unrealized gains and losses on interest rate swap\nagreements (see Note 14) and unrecognized pension costs (see Note 9).\nThe Company presents the components of OCI in a separate consolidated statement of comprehensive income (see Note\n15).\nFair Value Measurements – The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and\nDisclosures”, for assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures.\n82\nThis standard defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. This standard applies to certain\nother existing accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements (see Note 13).\nCash and Cash Equivalents – For purposes of the consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows, cash and cash\nequivalents include cash and due from banks, short-term investments, and federal funds sold deposited in other financial\ninstitutions that mature within ninety days.\nOther Investments – Investments in mutually-owned banking organizations (Depositors Insurance Fund, Federal Home\nLoan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank), cooperative organizations (Connecticut On-Line Computer Center “COCC”), and\nnon-controlling interests in privately-held companies (Jassby, Reinventure Capital, and LearnLaunch Fund), have no\nquoted market values and are carried at original cost, less any estimated impairment. Interest and dividends on these\ninvestments are recognized as earned or when dividends are declared. The Company reviews the above-mentioned stock\nfor impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of their cost. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no\nallowance for credit losses related to other investments.\nA non-controlling partnership interest in the Massachusetts Housing Equity Fund XXII LLC (a Qualified Affordable\nHousing Project “QAHP” of the Massachusetts Housing Investment Corporation), is accounted for using the proportional\namortization method, whereby the Company amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits\nand other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance as a component of income tax expense. The\nCompany’s interest in the Massachusetts Housing Equity Fund XXII LLC constitutes a variable interest entity, which is\nnot consolidated into the Company as there is a separate managing member who controls and operates the entity.\nInvestments in solar energy programs are accounted for under the proportional amortization method of accounting, rather\nthan consolidation, due to the nature of the investee’s business (solar project where control remains with the managing\nLLC member) and the relative insignificance to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and constitute\nunconsolidated variable interest entities.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – The Company follows ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, with\nregard to disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities, with the intent to provide users of financial\nstatements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how the entity\naccounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items\naffect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Qualitative disclosures explain the Company’s\nobjectives and strategies for using derivatives, and quantitative disclosures are made regarding the fair value of, and gains\nand losses on, derivative instruments, and about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments.\nAs required by ASC 815, the Company reports all derivatives on its balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes\nin the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate\na derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the\ncriteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes\nin the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are\nconsidered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected\nfuture cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally\nprovides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with 1) the recognition of\nthe changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge, or\n2) the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.\nOther Real Estate Owned – Properties acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of\nforeclosure are classified as other real estate owned (“OREO”). Real estate formally acquired in settlement of loans are\nrecorded at the lower of the carrying value of the loan or the fair value of the property actually received. Losses arising\nfrom the acquisition of such properties are charged against the allowance for credit losses. Operating expenses and any\nsubsequent provisions to reduce the carrying value to fair value less costs to sell are charged to current period earnings. In\nperiods of declining real estate values, this accounting treatment would result in additional charges to OREO expense.\nGains and losses upon disposal are reflected in earnings as realized.\n83\nTransfers of Financial Assets – Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has\nbeen surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from\nthe Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right)\nto pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred\nassets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.\nRevenue Recognition – The Company recognizes certain revenues in accordance with ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from\nContracts with Customers”. The standard is based on the principles that revenues are recognized when control of a good\nor service transfers to a customer, and that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or\nservices to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for\nthose goods or services. Under Topic 606, depending on the terms of a contract with a customer, revenues are either\nrecognized at a point in time when a performance obligation is satisfied, or over time, as satisfaction of a performance\nobligation progresses. The standard does not apply to customer contracts that are within the scope of other accounting\nstandards such as financial instruments and their transfer and servicing. As such, the standard does not apply to the\nCompany’s interest income on loans, investment income, sale of financial assets and related mortgage banking and\nservicing income.\nRevenues from contracts with customers that are subject to the principles of ASC Topic 606 are included in “non-interest\nincome” under the customer service fees category in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. The following is\na summary of such revenues from contracts with customers for the years ended December 31:\n(In thousands) 2023 2022\nATM and interchange income, net of related expenses $ 1,224 $ 1,071\nNon-sufficient funds (“NSF”) and overdraft fees 527 438\nOther customer service fees 6,066 3,629\nTotal $ 7,817 $ 5,138\nATM and interchange income are reported net of directly related expenses and are recognized by the Company when\ncustomers use their ATM/debit cards issued by the Company through a third-party payment network. NSF and overdraft\nprotection fees represent fees charged to customers to cover or protect customer transactions in case of insufficient\ncustomer funds. Other customer service fees are primarily comprised of fees on cash management services, deposit account\nmaintenance fees, wire transfer fees, certain loan prepayment fees and investment advisory fees. All of these fees are\nrecognized at a point in time. Transaction based fees are recognized at the time of the transaction while account\nmaintenance and protection fees are both charged and recognized on a monthly basis.\nIn each of the revenue streams identified above, there were no significant judgments made in determining or allocating the\ntransaction price, as the consideration and service requirements are generally explicitly identified in the associated\ncontracts and consist of a single performance obligation.\nLoan Servicing – The Company records a servicing asset at estimated fair value, if practical, each time it undertakes an\nobligation to service a financial asset, principally when it sells financial assets and retains servicing rights. For sales of\none to four-family residential real estate loans, a portion of the cost of originating the loan is allocated to the mortgage\nservicing rights based on estimated relative fair value. Fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage\nservicing contracts, when available, or alternatively based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of\nestimated future net servicing income. For subsequently measuring and reporting servicing assets, the Company has chosen\nto use the amortization method, rather than the fair value measurement method. Under this method, the Company amortizes\nthe servicing asset in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income, and it assesses the asset for\nestimated impairment based on fair value at each reporting date. Mortgage servicing rights are included in “prepaid\nexpenses and other assets” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Loan servicing income received and the related\namortization of the mortgage servicing rights are included in “mortgage banking income” in the Company’s consolidated\nstatement of income (see Note 4).\nBanking Premises and Equipment – Land is carried at cost. Other premises and equipment are carried at cost net of\naccumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the\n84\nassets (see Note 5). Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred while major improvements are capitalized. Gains\nand losses on dispositions are included in current operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets – The Company tests long-lived assets, including the core deposit intangible asset,\nfor impairment whenever circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability\nof assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net\ncash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be\nrecognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.\nAssets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell.\nDefined Benefit Plans:\nDirector Pension Plan – The Company maintains a director defined benefit pension plan which covers members of the\nboard of directors who were in service prior to 2023, upon meeting specific qualifications. Pension expense under this plan\nis charged to current operations and consists of several components of net periodic pension cost based on various actuarial\nassumptions regarding future experience under the plans.\nThe Company recognizes the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit plan as an asset or liability in its\nbalance sheet and it recognizes changes in the funded status of the plan in the year in which the changes occur. The funded\nstatus of a plan is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the “projected benefit obligation”\n(PBO) at the financial statement date. The unrecognized prior service costs, net actuarial gains and accounting transition\nobligation are reflected as “accumulated other comprehensive income” (OCI). The changes in the plan’s funded status are\nrecognized as charges or credits to “OCI” to the extent that they are not required to be recognized as components of “net\nperiodic pension cost” in net income (see Notes 9 and 15).\nEmployee Pension Plans – The Company provides pension benefits for substantially all employees through membership\nin the Co-operative Banks Employees Retirement Association (CBERA). The Plan is accounted for as a multi-employer,\nnoncontributory, defined benefit pension plan. Company employees become eligible after attaining age 21 and completing\none year of service, and benefits become fully vested after six years of eligible service. Effective April 1, 2018, future\neligibility for new Company employees to participate in the plan was frozen. Effective December 31, 2023, the Plan was\nfrozen and participants no longer accrue additional retirement benefits (see Note 9).\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) – ESOP shares are shown as a reduction of equity and are presented in the\nconsolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity as unallocated common stock held by ESOP. Compensation\nexpense for the Company’s ESOP is recorded at an amount equal to the shares committed to be allocated by the ESOP\nmultiplied by the average fair market value of the shares during the period. The Company recognizes compensation\nexpense ratably over the period based upon the Company’s estimate of the number of shares committed to be allocated by\nthe ESOP. When the shares are released, unallocated common stock held by ESOP is reduced by the cost of the ESOP\nshares released and the difference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares committed to be\nallocated by the ESOP is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. The loan receivable from the ESOP is\nnot reported as an asset nor is the Company’s guarantee to fund the ESOP reported as a liability on the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheet. The employees of the Bank are the participants in the ESOP. Dividends paid on unallocated\nshares are used to repay the loan to the Company.\nAdvertising Costs – The Company participates in certain advertising activities to attract more customers. The advertising\ncosts of the Company are considered to benefit the period in which they are incurred. It is the Company’s policy to expense\nall advertising costs in the period incurred and to include them in the operating expense section of the consolidated income\nstatement under the category marketing and charitable contribution expenses. The Company’s advertising expenses were\napproximately $2.7 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes – The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company recognizes\ncertain revenue and expense items in periods which are different for financial accounting purposes than for federal income\ntax purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed under the liability method based on differences\nbetween the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or\n85\ndeductible amounts in the future, based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences\nare expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets\nto the amount expected to be realized.\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, management assesses the likelihood that tax positions taken\nwill be sustained upon examination based on their technical merit, considering the facts, circumstances and information\navailable at the end of each period. The Company recognizes the effects of significant income tax positions taken on tax\nreturns only if the positions are “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. Positions\ntaken on tax returns that do not meet that threshold are not recognized in the Company’s provisions for income taxes. The\nmeasurement of uncertain tax positions is adjusted when new information is available, or when an event occurs that\nrequires a change. The Company’s policy is to analyze its tax positions for all open tax years. Interest and penalties, if any,\nassociated with uncertain tax positions, are classified as additional income tax expense in the consolidated statements of\nincome (see Note 10).\nSubsequent events – Management has reviewed all events through the date the audited consolidated financial statements\nwere filed with the SEC and concluded that no other events required any adjustment to the balances presented or disclosure.\nReclassifications – Certain prior period balances in the audited consolidated financial statements may have been\nreclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on prior year net income or\nshareholders’ equity.\nNote 2 – Investment Securities\nAvailable for Sale – The amortized cost and estimated fair values of securities classified as available for sale (“AFS”) are\nas follows:\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\n(In thousands) Cost Gain Loss Fair Value\nDecember 31, 2023\nDebt Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 66,874 $ 27 $ (2,549) $ 64,352\nAgency mortgage-backed securities 13,154 5 (1,729) 11,430\nAgency collateralized mortgage obligations 2,987 — (569) 2,418\nCorporate bonds 101,244 5 (9,014) 92,235\nMunicipal obligations 20,010 — (980) 19,030\nTotal $ 204,269 $ 37 $ (14,841) $ 189,465\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized\n(In thousands) Cost Gain Loss Fair Value\nDecember 31, 2022\nDebt Securities:\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 111,953 $ 43 $ (5,195) $ 106,801\nAgency mortgage-backed securities 14,123 3 (1,985) 12,141\nAgency collateralized mortgage obligations 3,749 — (676) 3,073\nCorporate bonds 110,886 — (9,079) 101,807\nMunicipal obligations 23,313 — (1,655) 21,658\nTotal $ 264,024 $ 46 $ (18,590) $ 245,480\nInvestment securities with carrying values of $49.6 million as of December 31, 2023 were pledged to secure borrowings\nwith the Federal Reserve Bank (see Note 8). There were no investment securities pledged to secure borrowings with the\nFederal Reserve Bank as of December 31, 2022.\nThe Company did not sell any AFS securities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n86\nThe net unrealized gain (loss) on AFS securities is reported, net of deferred income tax effects, as a separate component\nof the Company’s shareholders’ equity, “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)”, and approximates the\nfollowing as of the dates stated:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2023 D ecember 31, 2022\nUnrealized losses, net $ (14,804) $ (18,544)\nDeferred income tax asset 3,876 4,805\n$ (10,928) $ (13,739)\nMaturities of Debt Securities – The following is a summary of maturities of securities available for sale as of December 31,\n2023. The amortized cost and fair values are based on the contractual maturity dates. Actual maturities may differ from\ncontractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalty. Agency\nmortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are presented as separate lines as paydowns are\nexpected to occur before contractual maturity dates.\nAvailab le f or Sale\nAmortized Cost Fair Value\n(In thousands)\nWithin one year $ 57,476 $ 56,824\nOver one year to five years 95,163 88,905\nOver five years to ten years 35,489 29,888\n188,128 175,617\nAgency mortgage-backed securities 13,154 11,430\nAgency collateralized mortgage obligations 2,987 2,418\n$ 204,269 $ 189,465\nCredit Loss Evaluation – The following tables present fair value and gross unrealized losses, aggregated by investment\ncategory and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, as of the dates\nstated.\nL ess than 12 M onths 12 Month s o r More To ta l\nGross Gross Gross\n(In thousands) Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair\nDecember 31, 2023 Number of Securities Losses Value Losses Value Losses Value\nU.S. Treasuries 15 $ (95) $ 7,884 $ (2,454) $ 46,515 $ (2,549) $ 54,399\nU.S. Government Agencies 18 — — (1,730) 11,124 (1,730) 11,124\nTaxable municipals 5 — — (569) 2,418 (569) 2,418\nCorporate bonds 33 (1,135) 6,866 (7,879) 78,365 (9,014) 85,231\nMortgage backed securities 13 (181) 1,819 (799) 17,211 (980) 19,030\nTotal 84 $ (1,411) $16,569 $ (13,431) $ 155,633 $ (14,842) $172,202\nL ess than 12 M onths 12 Month s o r More To ta l\nGross Gross Gross\n(In thousands) Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair Unrealized Fair\nDecember 31, 2022 Number of Securities Losses Value Losses Value Losses Value\nU.S. Treasury securities 20 $ (47) $19,958 $ (5,148) $ 83,759 $ (5,195) $103,717\nAgency mortgage-backed securities 25 (263) 2,900 (1,722) 8,932 (1,985) 11,832\nAgency collateralized mortgage obligations 6 (54) 1,048 (622) 2,025 (676) 3,073\nCorporate bonds 34 (4,332) 44,537 (4,747) 46,270 (9,079) 90,807\nMunicipal obligations 14 (382) 10,841 (1,273) 10,817 (1,655) 21,658\nTotal 99 $ (5,078) $79,284 $ (13,512) $ 151,803 $ (18,590) $231,087\nMunicipal, Agency Debt, and U.S. Treasury Securities – The contractual cash flows of these securities are direct\nobligations of municipalities or the U.S. Treasury, or they consist of agency obligations, mortgage-backed securities or\ncollateralized mortgage obligations which are guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Home\nLoan Bank or other quasi-government agencies. It is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than\nthe amortized cost of the investment.\n87\nCorporate Bonds – The Company invests in a substantial amount of corporate bonds and subordinated debentures, which\nare scheduled to mature between the calendar years 2024 through 2032. These corporate bonds vary in commercial\nindustries, including automotive, energy, consumer products, and media companies. The Company has also invested in\ndomestic and foreign banking institutions. The subordinated debentures are mostly debt issuances from bank holding\ncompanies.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the majority of securities in an unrealized loss position were of investment grade;\nhowever, a few did not have a third-party investment grade available. These ungraded securities were primarily\nsubordinated debt instruments issued by bank holding companies and are classified as corporate bonds in the tables above.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 14 securities with a market value of $37.9 million, respectively, did not have a third-party\ninvestment grade available. Investment securities with unrealized losses are generally a result of pricing changes due to\nchanges in the interest rate environment since purchase and not as a result of permanent credit loss. The Company does\nnot intend to sell, nor does it believe it will be required to sell, any of its securities prior to the recovery of the amortized\ncost. Because the declines in fair value are attributable to market changes in interest rates and not due to credit quality,\nmanagement did not recognize an allowance for credit loss against the Company’s investment portfolio as of December 31,\n2023.\nDepositors Insurance Fund Stock – The Company holds stock in the Depositors Insurance Fund, as a requirement of\nmembership. The cost of the shares is $139,000, which represents the Company’s interest in the Depositors Insurance\nFund, and is not redeemable.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock – The Company holds stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, a regional member\nof the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”), as part of the Company’s membership requirements.

The\nbalance in the investment account as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $14.6 million and $13.2 million, respectively.\nThe stock serves as additional collateral on FHLB borrowings, which determines the amount of stock the Company is\nrequired to hold.\nFederal Reserve Bank Stock – The Company is required to maintain shares in the Federal Reserve Bank for 50% of the\ntotal par value in order to meet criteria for membership in the Federal Reserve System. Although the full par value of the\nstock is $100 per share, the Company is required to pay only $50 per share at the time of purchase with the understanding\nthat the other half of the subscription amount is subject to call at any time. Dividends are paid semi-annually at the statutory\nrate of 6 percent per annum, or $1.50 per share semi-annually. In addition, Federal Reserve regulations require that the\nCompany purchase additional stock, or that the Federal Reserve System redeem stock, if a change in total deposit liabilities\n(as reported in the quarterly report of condition) results in a change in the Company’s Federal Reserve Stock holdings\nrequirement by 15 percent or 100 shares, whichever is lower. As of December 31, 2023, the Company held 195,936 shares\nof stock in the approximate amount of $10.3 million compared to 162,072 shares of stock in the approximate amount of\n$8.1 million as of December 31, 2022.\nNon-Public Investments – Non-public investments consists of the following:\nConnecticut On-Line Computer Center, Inc.

The state agencies award Low Income Housing Tax Credits for Qualified Affordable Housing\nProjects (“QAHP”). Project sponsors use tax credits to raise equity from investors. The equity investment\nreduces the debt burden on the tax credit property, making it financially feasible to offer lower, more\naffordable rental rates to eligible individuals. The participating banks are entitled to certain federal tax credits.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company is carrying approximately $1,000,000 in the Massachusetts\nHousing Equity Fund XXII LLC, a QAHP sponsored by the MHIC. The Company holds a 1.15% interest in\nthis partnership as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s accumulated share of losses and tax credits as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 was $662,000.\nSunwealth Project Pool 20 LLC (“Sunwealth”) – Sunwealth is a solar energy program formed on April 21,\n2021 by the Company as a 99% non-controlling LLC investor member and Sunwealth Holdco 8 LLC\n(Holdco) as the sole managing LLC member.

These loans are starting to show\nsigns of potential weakness and are being closely monitored by management.\n91\nLoans rated 7: Loans in this category are considered “substandard”. Generally, a loan is considered\nsubstandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligors and/or\nthe collateral pledged. There is a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the weakness\nis not corrected. Non-accrual residential real estate loans that are well secured (LTV<75%) are not considered\nto warrant a downgrade to a substandard risk rating.\nLoans rated 8: Loans in this category are considered “doubtful”. Loans classified as doubtful have all the\nweaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses\nmake collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, highly questionable and\nimprobable.\nLoans rated 9: Loans in this category are considered uncollectible (“loss”) and of such little value that their\ncontinuance as loans is not warranted.\nOn an annual basis, or more often if needed, the Company reviews the accuracy of risk ratings for all commercial real\nestate, construction and land development loans, and commercial and industrial loans based on various ongoing\nperformance characteristics and supporting information that is provided from time to time by commercial borrowers.\nAnnually, the Company engages an independent third-party to review a significant portion of loans within these segments.\nManagement uses the results of these reviews as part of its annual review process.

The Company did not modify any loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Unfunded Commitments\nThe Company maintains an allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded balances for existing lines\nof credit, commitments to extend future credit, as well as both standby and commercial letters of credit when there is a\ncontractual obligation to extend credit and when this extension of credit is not unconditionally cancellable (i.e.,\ncommitment cannot be canceled at any time). The allowance for off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a\nprovision for (reversal of) credit loss expense. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will\noccur, which is based on a historical funding study derived from internal information, and an estimate of expected credit\nlosses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life, which are the same loss rates that are used in\ncomputing the allowance for credit losses on loans. The allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments of\n$6.0 million as of December 31, 2023 is classified separately on the consolidated balance sheet with accrued expenses and\nother liabilities. There no allowance was for credit losses for unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2022.\n94\nThe following table presents the balance and activity in the allowance for credit losses for unfunded loan commitments\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nBeginning balance $ —\nAdjustment to allowance for unfunded commitments for adoption of ASC 326 1,786\nProvision for unfunded commitments 4,228\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 6,014\nSubsequent to the CECL adoption, management refined the modeling assuming and enhanced the CECL calculation,\nincluding the reserve for unfunded commitments, specifically regarding the probability of funding assumptions related to\nunfunded commitments and enhanced the qualitative analysis used in the determination of expected credit losses. The\nimpact of these changes resulted in provisions for credit losses for unfunded commitments of $4.2 million.\nPre-ASC 326 Adoption Disclosures\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2023, the Company calculated the allowance for loan losses under the\nincurred loss methodology. The following disclosures are presented under this previously applicable GAAP for the\napplicable prior periods.\nDue to the adoption of CECL under ASC 326, two significant concepts under the incurred loss methodology disclosed\nbelow, impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) have been eliminated and replaced by collateral-dependent\nloans and modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties which were discussed in Note 1 and\ndisclosed previously. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the\nCompany will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual\nterms of the loan agreement. Under the incurred loss methodology, when a loan is modified and a concession is made to a\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty, the modification was considered a TDR. All TDRs were initially classified by\nthe Company as impaired.\nThe following table presents a summary of the loan portfolio individually and collectively evaluated for impairment as of\nthe date stated (in thousands):\nRealEstate\nOne-to Four-\nFamily Commercial Construction& Commercial&\nResidential Home Equity Real Estate Land Development Industrial Consumer Unallocated Total\nDecember 31, 2022\nAllowance for loans individually\nevaluated for impairment $ 422 $ — $ — $ — $ 4,998 $ — $ — $ 5,420\nAllowance for loans collectively\nevaluated for impairment 3,063 258 6,538 3,846 3,257 1,403 1,243 19,608\nTotal Allowance for Loan Loss $ 3,485 $ 258 $ 6,538 $ 3,846 $ 8,255 $ 1,403 $ 1,243 $ 25,028\nLoans individually evaluated for\nimpairment $ 1,809 $ 80 $ 3,360 $ 10 $ 9,121 $ — $ — $ 14,380\nLoans collectively evaluated for\nimpairment 930,627 75,146 1,008,663 552,365 238,240 196,535 — 3,001,576\nTotal Loans $ 932,436 $ 75,226 $ 1,012,023 $ 552,375 $ 247,361 $ 196,535 $ — $3,015,956\n95\nThe following tables presents a summary of impaired loans as of the date stated (in thousands):\nRecorded Unpaid Related\nInvestment in Principal Allowance for Net Impaired\n(In thousands) Impaired Loans Balance Loan Losses Loan Balance\nDecember 31, 2022\nImpaired loans with no related allowance recorded:\nReal estate:\nOne-to four-family residential $ 1,387 $ 1,912 $ — $ 1,387\nHome equity 80 80 — 80\nCommercial real estate 3,360 9,178 — 3,360\nConstruction & land development 10 640 — 10\nCommercial & industrial 874 2,669 — 874\nConsumer — — — —\nTotal 5,711 14,479 — 5,711\nImpaired loans with an allowance recorded:\nReal estate:\nOne-to four-family residential 422 422 422 —\nHome equity — — — —\nCommercial real estate — — — —\nConstruction & land development — — — —\nCommercial & industrial 8,247 8,247 4,998 3,249\nConsumer — — — —\nTotal 8,669 8,669 5,420 3,249\nTotal impaired loans:\nReal estate:\nOne-to four-family residential 1,809 2,334 422 1,387\nHome equity 80 80 — 80\nCommercial real estate 3,360 9,178 — 3,360\nConstruction & land development 10 640 — 10\nCommercial & industrial 9,121 10,916 4,998 4,123\nConsumer — — — —\nTotal impaired loans $ 14,380 $ 23,148 $ 5,420 $ 8,960\nAdditional information about impaired loans is as follows for the period stated (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2022\nAverage recorded investment in impaired loans:\nReal Estate:\nOne-to-four family residential 1,633\nHome equity 16\nCommercial real estate 3,413\nConstruction and land development 10\nCommercial and industrial 8,802\nTotal $ 13,874\nRelated amount of interest income recognized during the period that the loans were impaired:\nTotal recognized $ 683\nAmount recognized using a cash-basis method of accounting $ 367\n96\nThe following table summarizes the carrying balance of troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) as of December 31, 2022\n(in thousands):\nPerforming TDRs $ 8,304\nNonperforming TDRs 3,762\nTotal TDRs $ 12,066\nThere were no loans modified as TDRs and no TDRs that defaulted in the first twelve months after restructuring during\nthe year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following tables present an analysis of the change in the allowance for loan losses by loan type for the period stated\n(in thousands):\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nOne-to\nFour-\nFamily Home Commercial Construction and Commercial and\nResidential Equity Real Estate Land Development Industrial Consumer Unallocated Total\nBalance, December 31, 2021 $ 3,016 $ 175 $ 4,449 $ 3,467 $ 5,749 $ 109 $ 1,450 $ 18,415\nProvision for loan losses 471 83 2,041 379 2,506 1,427 (207) 6,700\nCharge offs (35) — — — — (287) — (322)\nRecoveries of loans previously charged off 33 — 48 — — 154 — 235\nBalance, December 31, 2022 $ 3,485 $ 258 $ 6,538 $ 3,846 $ 8,255 $ 1,403 $ 1,243 $ 25,028\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s loans by risk rating category as of the date stated (in thousands):\nResidential\nRisk Real Commercial Construction & Commercial & Total\nRating Estate Real Estate Land Development Industrial Consumer Loans\nDecember 31, 2022\nGrade:\nPass 1-5 $ 1,006,275 $ 998,788 $ 552,365 $ 232,742 $ 196,535 $ 2,986,705\nSpecial Mention 6 — 13,235 — 5,474 — 18,709\nSubstandard 7 1,387 — — 9,145 — 10,532\nDoubtful 8 — — 10 — — 10\nLoss 9 — — — — — —\nTotal $ 1,007,662 $1,012,023 $ 552,375 $ 247,361 $ 196,535 $ 3,015,956\nNote 4 – Mortgage Banking – Loan Sales and Servicing\nMortgage loans sold to and serviced for investors are not included in the accompanying financial statements. The loans\nserviced for others were sold without recourse provisions. The aggregate outstanding unpaid principal balance of such\nloans approximates $215.7 million and $231.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Gains on loans sold,\nincluding recognition of mortgage servicing rights, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were approximately\n$29,000 and $60,000, respectively, and are included in “mortgage banking income” in the noninterest income section in\nthe consolidated statements of income.\nThe fair value of the rights to service mortgage loans sold is estimated by management using independent market\ninformation. This fair value is capitalized and amortized into income in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated\nnet servicing income using the interest amortization method.\nThe following is a schedule of mortgage servicing assets, including the final carrying value, as of and for the years ended\nDecember 31 (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nBalance at the beginning of the year $ 2,298 $ 2,735\nServicing obligations that result from transfers of financial assets 25 14\nAmortization (273) (451)\nBalance at the end of the year $ 2,050 $ 2,298\n97\nManagement has concluded that the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which is based on market prices for comparable\nmortgage servicing contracts, exceeds the carrying value.

In addition to the rental amounts, the\nCompany is responsible for its share of utilities.\nThe Company follows ASC 842, “Leases”, whereby all of its existing branch lease agreements have been recognized in\nthe consolidated balance sheet in prepaid expenses and other assets as “right of use assets”, with offsetting “operating lease\nliabilities” in accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nThe following is a summary of the recorded lease right-of-use assets for all of the above-mentioned lease agreements as\nof the dates stated (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 11,540 $ 11,540\nLess accumulated amortization (992) (563)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 10,548 10,977\nOperating lease liabilities $ 10,773 $ 11,049\nWeighted average remaining term (years) 19 20\nWeighted average discount rate 4.38% 4.38%\nThe future minimum lease payments under the terms of the above leases at December 31, 2023, along with the recorded\npresent value of the lease obligations, are as follows:\n(in thousands)\n2024 $ 765\n2025 787\n2026 808\n2027 825\n2028 and thereafter 835\nThereafter 12,846\n$ 16,866\nLess unamortized discount (6,093)\nRecorded present value of lease obligations $ 10,773\nThe Company has included in its recorded lease obligations and right-of-use assets any of the available lease extension\noptions permitted under the agreements for branch locations as management can be reasonably certain under lease\naccounting criteria that the options will be exercised. Required payments for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and\nmanagement fees are not included in the recorded lease obligations and assets since they are variable payments that do not\n98\ndepend on a specified index or rate and they are recorded to expense as they are incurred. Any increases in lease payments\nas a result of changes in the CPI are charged to lease expense. Common area maintenance charges under the agreements\nare not considered in the lease payments since they represent a service provided to the Company and, as such, they are\nrecorded to expense as incurred. The discount rates imputed on the lease obligations range from 3.01% to 5.29%, which\nrepresented the Company’s incremental borrowing rates for similar length terms as the applicable leases.\nTotal lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 approximated $938,000 and $630,000, respectively.\nNote 7 – Deposits\nA comparative summary of deposits is as follows as of the dates stated:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nTransactional accounts:\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 528,409 $ 445,518\nSavings accounts 127,640 163,257\nNOW accounts 345,753 408,894\nMoney market accounts 888,511 659,455\nTotal transactional accounts 1,890,313 1,677,124\nTime deposits\nGreater than $250,000 544,246 415,860\nLess than or equal to $250,000 952,789 793,759\nTotal time deposits 1,497,035 1,209,619\nTotal deposits $ 3,387,348 $ 2,886,743\nContractual maturities of time deposits are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nWithin 1 year $ 1,472,067 $ 1,022,891\nOver 1 year to 2 years 13,360 160,545\nOver 2 years to 3 years 3,434 11,137\nOver 3 years to 4 years 6,159 5,937\nOver 4 years to 5 years 2,015 9,109\n$ 1,497,035 $ 1,209,619\nIncluded in time deposits less than or equal to $250,000 are brokered certificates of deposit of approximately\n$183.6 million and $250.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, total deposits related to the cannabis industry are $316.0 million and $234.9 million,\nor 9.3% and 8.1%, of total deposits, respectively.\nThere are no customers that exceed 5% of total deposits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNote 8 – Borrowings\nFederal Home Loan Bank – Borrowings from the FHLB are secured by a blanket lien on qualified collateral, defined\nprincipally by pledging a specified percentage of the carrying value of owner and non-owner occupied first mortgage loans\nsecured by one to four-family properties and commercial real estate loans, including multifamily loans. The amount of\nloans pledged was $1.33 billion as of December 31, 2023. Total additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB based upon\ncollateral pledged, approximates $608.6 million at December 31, 2023. Additionally, in order to further secure these\nborrowings with the FHLB, the Company is also required to invest in the stock of the FHLB.\n99\nMaturities on outstanding borrowings from the FHLB are summarized as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 Decembe r 3 1, 2022\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Rate Amount Rate\nAdvances maturing within:\nOne year $ 282,503 5.53% $ 293,075 4.27%\nOne to two years — — 7 2.80%\nFour to five years 560 0.00% — —\nFive to ten years 275 0.00% — —\nTotal $ 283,063 5.53% $ 293,082 4.27%\nThe Company also had a line of credit from the FHLB Ideal Way in the amount of $6.1 million at December 31, 2023 and\n2022. The Company has no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nInterest expense on the above FHLB borrowings approximated $14.1 million and $2.9 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank – The Company has a line of credit agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for\nusage of the discount window. The terms of the agreement call for the pledging of certain assets for any and all obligations\nof the Company under the agreement (see Note 2). As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no borrowings\noutstanding under this agreement.\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts – The Company was party to an International Swap and Derivative Association (“ISDA”)\ninterest rate swap contract of $50.0 million with a financial institution (“counterparty”) to manage its exposure to interest\nrate changes previously associated with $50.0 million of FHLB borrowings. The swap was modified during 2021 to\nmanage its exposure to interest rates by replacing the FHLB borrowings with $50.0 million of brokered certificates of\ndeposit (representing the notional amount of the swap contract). The swap contract qualified as a cash flow hedge and,\naccordingly, the Company recorded the fair value of the contract on its consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability,\nwith an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of income tax impacts, and with changes reflected\nin other comprehensive income. The swap contract matured during April of 2023.\nThe effect of the swap contract was to limit the interest rate exposure on the brokered certificates of deposits to a fixed\nrate (2.53%) versus the three-month LIBOR. In accordance with the swap agreement, the interest charge was calculated\nbased upon the LIBOR and the fixed rate. If interest as calculated was greater based on the LIBOR, the counterparty paid\nthe difference to the Company. However, if interest as calculated was greater based on the fixed rates, the Company paid\nthe difference to the counterparty.\nDepending on the fluctuations in the LIBOR, the Company’s interest rate exposure and its related impact on interest\nexpense and net cash flow could increase or decrease. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was the estimated\namount the Company would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at a particular point in time, considering current\ninterest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparty. The estimated fair value of the interest rate swap contract was\nprovided by a third-party valuation expert.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the swap contract was estimated to be an asset of approximately $321,000,\nwhich was reflected as prepaid expenses and other assets, on the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nAn unrealized gain on the swap contract of approximately $231,000 at December 31, 2022, net of income tax effects, was\nrecorded in AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022.\nThis financial instrument involved counterparty credit exposure. The counterparty for the interest rate exchange was a\nmajor financial institution that met the Company’s criteria for financial stability and creditworthiness. In order to mitigate\ncounterparty default risk, should there be a significant difference in the market value of the swap components and/or the\nprojected net interest payments, the Company or the counterparty could demand that collateral be pledged to cover the\n100\ndifference on each swap contract. The Company was required to maintain $500,000 of collateral deposits with the\ncounterparty at December 31, 2022.\nThe swap agreement resulted in a credit to the Company’s interest expense of approximately $321,000 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 (this swap contract matured during April 2023) and a charge to the Company’s interest expense of\napproximately $496,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022 (included with interest expense on deposits).\nNote 9 – Employee Benefits\n401(k) Plan – The Company has an employee tax deferred incentive plan (the “401(k) plan”) under which the Company\nmakes voluntary contributions within certain limitations. All employees who meet specified age and length of service\nrequirements are eligible to participate in the 401(k) plan. The amount contributed by the Company is included in salaries\nand employee benefits expense. The amounts contributed to the 401(k) plan for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022 were $2.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively.\nEmployee Pension Plan – The Company provides pension benefits through a defined benefit plan maintained with\nCBERA. The Company’s Plan assets and liabilities are pooled together with those of other financial institutions; therefore,\nthe Company is not required to recognize the funded status of the plan on its balance sheet and need only accrue for any\nquarterly contributions due and payable on demand, or any withdrawal liabilities assessed by CBERA if the Company\nintended to withdraw from the Plan. Future benefit under the employee pension plan were frozen as of December 31, 2023\nand the Company plans on withdrawing from the defined benefit plan maintained with CBERA.\nThe Company’s participation in the CBERA Plan C defined benefit plan for year ended December 31 is summarized\nbelow:\nPension Protect Act Zone Bank’s Con tri b utions for\nStatus Year Ended December 31,\nFIP/RP\nStatus\nDecember 31, December 31, Pending / Surcharge\nPension Fund EIN/Plan Number 2023 2022 Implemented 2023 2022 Imposed\nThe Defined Benefit\nPlan (Plan C) of the EIN:\nCBERA Retirement 04-6035593;\nProgram Plan No. 334 Green Green No $3,476,667 $ 2,000,000 No\nThe Company’s contributions to the Plan in each of the two periods disclosed above exceeded 5% of the total plan\ncontributions.\nThe Plan’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, indicated total net assets available for\nbenefits of $403.6 million and total contributions from all participating employers of $8.6 million.\nDeferred Compensation Plans – During 2014, the Company put into place an unfunded, defined contribution, Non-\nqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (“Deferred Comp Plan”) for select employees of the Company. The Deferred Comp\nPlan was provided to key management of the Company and results in 5% - 20% of the employee’s then current base salary\nbeing credited to the participant’s account annually, subject to increases based upon increases in annual base compensation\nand the possibility of additional discretionary contributions. The employees vest at varying dates in accordance with each\nindividual’s deferred compensation participation agreement; however, all key officers will be fully vested upon the\nattainment of age 65. The obligations under these plans are included in accrued retirement liabilities in the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets and approximated $2.4 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The expense under these plans (recorded in salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statements of\nincome) approximated $355,000 and $336,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLong-Term Incentive Plan – In January 2020, the Company put into place a long-term incentive plan for certain members\nof its management team where benefits are awarded annually on a discretionary basis and cliff vest after three years. Under\n101\nthis plan, individuals are granted “phantom shares” and benefits are accrued based upon the projected growth of the Bank’s\ncapital. The obligations under this plan are included in accrued retirement liabilities on the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheets and approximated $11.1 million and $4.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nexpense under this plan (recorded in salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statements of income)\napproximated $7.8 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase\nduring 2023 was a result of a discretionary increase by the Compensation Committee.\nDirector Pension Plan – The Company has a director defined benefit pension plan, covering directors who were in service\nprior to 2023 and have met the plan’s vesting requirements. The Company’s liabilities for the director pension plan are\ncalculated by an independent actuary who used the “projected unit credit” actuarial method to determine the normal cost\nand actuarial liability.\nA comparison of the actuarial estimates of the benefit obligations to the recorded obligations are as follows as of the\nmeasurement date, December 31 (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nProjected benefit obligations $ (5,744) $ (4,998)\nPlan assets at fair value - -\nFunded status $ (5,744) $ (4,998)\nAmounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 are as follows (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nAccrued retirement liabilities $ (5,744) $ 4,998\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss in equity, before taxes (1,347) (1,241)\nNet amount recognized $ (7,091) $ 3,757\nAmounts included in “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)” that have not yet been recognized as\ncomponents of net periodic pension cost as of December 31 are as follows (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nUnrecognized prior service cost $ (258) $ (315)\nUnrecognized net loss (1,089) (926)\nUnrecognized losses included in AOCI $ (1,347) $ (1,241)\nThe weighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine the director pension plan projected benefit obligations and\nnet periodic pension cost are as follows as of December 31 (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nPre-retirement discount rate for net periodic pension cost 5.03% 2.35%\nPre-retirement discount rate for projected benefit obligation 4.81% 5.03%\nPost-retirement discount rate for projected benefit obligation 4.81% 5.03%\nRate of compensation increase 0.00% 0.00%\nThe components of projected net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows\n(amortization amounts will be recorded via charges or credits to “other comprehensive income”) (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nBenefit obligation at beginning of the year $ 4,998 $ 4,549\nService cost 260 232\nInterest cost 261 114\nPlan amendments 430 372\nActuarial loss (gain) 244 (30)\nBenefits paid (449) (239)\nBenefit obligation at end of the year $ 5,744 $ 4,998\n102\nThe following schedule reflects the net periodic pension cost, contributions received, and benefits paid for the year ended\nDecember 31:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2023 D ecember 31, 2022\nService cost $ 260 $ 232\nInterest cost 261 114\nAmortization of net actuarial losses 81 85\nAmortization of prior service costs 487 57\nNet periodic pension cost $ 1,089 $ 488\nEmployer contribution $ 449 $ 239\nBenefits paid $ 449 $ 239\nThe Company records an estimate of net periodic pension cost for the director pension plan to accrued retirement liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheet on a quarterly basis.

Therefore, no valuation allowance has been\nprovided. The primary sources of recovery of the gross federal and state deferred tax assets is the expectation that the\nexisting net deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in which the Company generates net taxable\nincome. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will generate any earnings or any specific level of\ncontinuing earnings. It should be noted, however, that factors beyond management’s control, such as the general state of\nthe economy and real estate values, can affect future levels of taxable income, and that no assurance can be given that\nsufficient taxable income will be generated to fully absorb gross deductible temporary differences.\nIn the past, the Internal Revenue Code provisions permitted co-operative banks a special bad debt deduction, irrespective\nof the amounts provided for financial reporting purposes. As a result, the Company’s total pre-1988 bad debt reserve for\nfederal income tax purposes approximates $13,806,000 as of December 31, 2023, for which no deferred income tax\nliabilities have been recognized. Reduction of this amount for purposes other than to absorb bad debt losses would be\nsubject to income taxes.\nThe Company has not identified any uncertain tax positions requiring accrual or disclosure as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022. The Company’s income tax returns are subject to review and examination by federal and state taxing authorities;\nhowever, there are currently no examinations for any tax periods in progress. Management of the Company believes it is\nno longer subject to examination for tax years prior to 2020.\n104\nNote 11 – Regulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure\nto meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by\nregulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under regulatory\ncapital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific\ncapital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet\nitems as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s capital amounts and classification are also\nsubject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the federal banking agencies published a final rule on a Community Bank Leverage Ratio\n(“CBLR”) Framework that provides a simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualified community banking\norganizations. Management has determined that the Company meets the standards to qualify under the CBLR framework\nand opted into this framework for FDIC call reporting purposes during 2020. Under the CBLR framework, a bank that\nmaintains a CBLR of 9% (defined as Tier 1 capital divided by total average assets) is considered to have satisfied its capital\nrequirements, determined to be well-capitalized, and will no longer be required to calculate risk-based capital ratios. As\nof December 31, 2023 the Bank met the minimum requirement with a CBLR of 13.6%.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company did not meet the requirement for the CBLR framework due to its unfunded loan\ncommitments being over 25.00% of its capital for more than two consecutive quarters. As a result, the Company operated\nunder the risk-based framework for the year ended December 31, 2022. Under this framework, quantitative measures\nestablished by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of\nTotal Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets, and Tier 1 Capital to Total\nAverage Assets (as defined in the regulations). As of December 31, 2022, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized\nunder this regulatory framework for prompt corrective action as presented in the table below (dollars in thousands).\nTo be well cap italized\nFor minimum capital under prompt corrective\nActual adequacy purposes action provisions\nDecember 31, 2022 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nTotal Capital $ 382,417 11.3% $ 271,323 8.0% $ 339,153 10.0%\n(to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nTier 1 Capital 357,389 10.5% 203,492 6.0% 271,323 8.0%\n(to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital 357,389 10.5% 152,619 4.5% 220,450 6.5%\n(to Risk-Weighted Assets)\nTier 1 Capital 357,389 10.5% 136,311 4.0% 170,389 5.0%\n(to Total Average Assets)\nThe Company’s consolidated capital ratios are consistent with the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios as reported above for\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNote 12 – Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk\nOff-Balance Sheet Risk – The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course\nof business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to originate\nloans, to disburse funds to borrowers on unused construction and land development loans, and to disburse funds on\ncommitted but unused lines of credit. These financial agreements involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and\ninterest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. The contract amounts of these instruments reflect\nthe extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.\nCommitments to originate loans and disburse additional funds to borrowers on lines of credit are agreements to lend to a\ncustomer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed\n105\nexpiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each customer’s\ncreditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon\nextension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower. The Company’s exposure to credit loss\nin the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for loan commitments, is represented by the\ncontractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and\nconditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The commitments to originate loans and lines of credit\nmay expire without being funded or drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent\nfuture cash requirements.\nFinancial instruments whose contract amounts represents off-balance sheet credit risk and are not reflected in the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheets consist of the following at the dates stated:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nUnused commitments to extend credit $ 1,112,931 $ 723,175\nLetters of credit 7,471 6,106\nConcentrations of Credit Risk – The Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk\nconsist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, loans receivable, bank owned life insurance,\nborrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.\nCash and Cash Equivalents – The Company’s cash and due from bank accounts are maintained in high credit quality\nfinancial institutions. At times, such amounts on deposit at any one financial institution may be in excess of the FDIC\ninsurance limits. As of December 31, 2023, based on bank balances, the Company has no deposits in excess of federal-\ninsured limits.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company has approximately $182.1 million of uninsured investments in Federal Funds\nsold, which are obligations of the Federal Reserve.\nInvestment Securities Available for Sale – The Company’s investment securities as of December 31, 2023 consist entirely\nof debt securities, primarily U.S. Treasury Securities, Corporate Bonds, Municipal Obligations and other Agency\nMortgage-Backed Obligations. A full summary of the Company’s investment securities, of approximately $189.5 million\nas of December 31, 2023 and are classified as available for sale, is presented in Note 2.\nLoans Receivable – The Company’s most significant group of assets is its loan portfolio of $3.89 billion, which represents\napproximately 85% of total assets. The majority of the Company’s loans, 64.0%, are considered commercial loans, with\n20 loans comprising 19.2% of the total loan portfolio, and 30.7% are considered residential real estate loans granted to\ncustomers in the metro-west area of Boston. Most customers are also depositors of the Bank. Of the unused commitments\nto extend credit as of December 31, 2023, 39.9% is attributable to relationships with 15 borrowers. The concentrations of\ncredit by type of loan are set forth in Note 3 to these consolidated financial statements.\nBank Owned Life Insurance – The cash surrender values of bank owned life insurance policies approximate $50.5 million\nas of December 31, 2023, and relates to policies maintained with four reputable and sound life insurance companies.\nDeposits – As of December 31, 2023, $316.0 million (9.33% of total deposits) of the Company’s deposit obligations are\nwith customers in the cannabis industry.\nBorrowings – As of December 31, 2023, all of the Company’s borrowings approximating $283.3 million, which is 7.50%\nof total liabilities, are with the FHLB.\nDerivative Financial Instruments – The Company’s derivative contracts, including collateral deposits, are held with\nseveral financial institution counterparties. The credit risk of the counterparties is reviewed quarterly to ensure liquidity\nand capital levels are appropriate to not present increased counterparty risk.\n106\nNote 13 – Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to\ndetermine fair value disclosures. The Company records fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and\ndetermines fair value disclosures utilizing a definition of fair value of assets and liabilities that states that fair value is an\nexit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants. Fair value is best determined using quoted market prices, however additional\nconsiderations are involved to determine the fair value of financial assets in markets that are not active. Inputs to valuation\ntechniques refer to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Inputs may be\nobservable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability\ndeveloped based on market data obtained from independent sources, or unobservable, meaning those that reflect the\nreporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability\ndeveloped based on the best information available to management. FASB ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement and\nDisclosures Topic,” defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability\n(an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to\nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The\nstandard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles establish a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value, and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\nand the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1 – Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets.\nLevel 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted\nprices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable\nmarket data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data and are significant to the fair value\nmeasurement of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs include fair value measurements that use pricing models,\ndiscounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as significant management judgment or\nestimation.\nThe following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain financial assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements.\nInvestment securities – Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of\nthe valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities would include highly liquid government bonds (such as US Treasuries),\nmortgage products and exchange traded equities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated\nby using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. Level 2\nsecurities would include U.S. agency securities, mortgage-backed agency securities, obligations of states and political\nsubdivisions, and certain corporate, asset-backed and other securities. In certain cases where there is limited activity or\nless transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The\ncarrying value of restricted FRB and FHLB stock approximates fair value based upon the redemption provisions of each\nentity and is therefore excluded from the following table.\nDerivative arrangements – The fair values of derivative arrangements are estimated by the Company using a third-party\nderivative valuation expert who relies on Level 2 inputs, namely interest cash flow models to determine a fair value by\ncalculating a settlement termination value with the counterparty.\n107\nAssets measured and reported at estimated fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nAssets:\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 64,352 $ — $ — $ 64,352\nAgency mortgage-backed securities — 11,430 — 11,430\nAgency collateralized mortgage obligations — 2,418 — 2,418\nCorporate bonds — 82,367 9,868 92,235\nMunicipal obligations — 19,030 — 19,030\n$ 64,352 $ 115,245 $ 9,868 $ 189,465\nDerivative assets $ — $ 27,769 $ — $ 27,769\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities $ — $ 27,786 $ — $ 27,786\nDecember 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nAssets:\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nU.S. Treasury securities $ 106,801 $ — $ — $ 106,801\nAgency mortgage-backed securities — 12,141 — 12,141\nAgency collateralized mortgage obligations — 3,073 — 3,073\nCorporate bonds — 92,807 9,000 101,807\nMunicipal obligations — 21,658 — 21,658\n$ 106,801 $ 129,679 $ 9,000 $ 245,480\nInterest rate swap (cash flow hedge) $ — $ 321 $ — $ 321\nDerivative assets $ — $ 31,483 $ — $ 31,483\nLiabilities:\nDerivative liabilities $ — $ 31,492 $ — $ 31,492\nThe Company purchased $3.0 million in level 3 subordinated debentures during the year ended December 31, 2022. There\nwere no purchases during the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no sales or transfers of level 3 assets during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 or 2022. The changes in level 3 subordinated debentures during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 are attributable to total net gains (losses) included in other comprehensive income\nThe Company may also be required from time to time to measure certain other assets on a non-recurring basis in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles. Any adjustments to fair value usually result in write-downs of individual\nassets.\nCollateral-Dependent Loans – Collateral-dependent loans with specific reserves are carried at fair value, which equals\nthe estimated market value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. Collateral may be in the form of real estate or\nbusiness assets including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable. A loan may have multiple types of collateral;\nhowever, the majority of the Company’s loan collateral is real estate. The value of real estate collateral is generally\ndetermined utilizing a market valuation approach based on an appraisal conducted by an independent, licensed appraiser\noutside of the Company using observable market data (Level 2). However, if the collateral value is significantly adjusted\ndue to differences in the comparable properties or is discounted by the Company because of lack of marketability, then\nthe fair value is considered Level 3. The value of business equipment is based upon an outside appraisal if deemed\nsignificant or the net book value on the applicable borrower’s financial statements if not considered significant. Likewise,\nvalues for inventory and accounts receivables collateral are based on financial statement balances or aging reports (Level\n3). Fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred as provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements\nof income.\n108\nMortgage Servicing Rights – Mortgage servicing rights do not trade in an active market with readily observable market\ndata. As a result, the Company estimates the fair value of mortgage servicing rights by using a discounted cash flow model\nto calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow\nmodel are those that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. Assumptions in the valuation\nof mortgage servicing rights may include estimated loan repayment rates, the discount rate, servicing costs, and the timing\nof cash flows, among other factors. The Company measures the fair value of mortgage servicing rights accounted for using\nthe amortization method as nonrecurring Level 3.\nThe Company had no liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\nThe following table summarizes assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis:\nDecembe r 3 1 , 2023\n(in thousands)\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nCollateral-dependent loans $ — $ — $ 4,432 $ 4,432\nMortgage servicing rights $ — $ — $ 2,640 $ 2,640\nDecembe r 3 1 , 2022\n(in thousands)\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value\nImpaired Loans - Pre-ASC 326 $ — $ — $ 8,960 $ 8,960\nMortgage servicing rights $ — $ — $ 2,781 $ 2,781\nFor Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\nsignificant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements were as follows:\nSignificant Significant\nValuation Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, 2023 Technique Inputs Inputs\nCollateral-dependent loans (previously Appraisal Value/ Comparison Appraisals and/or sales of Appraisals discounted 5 to 20%\nknown as impaired loans) Sales comparable properties for sales commission and other\nholding costs\nMortgage servicing rights Discounted Cash Flows Comparable sales Weighted average discount rate -\n8%\nConstant prepayment rate–5%\nSignificant Significant\nValuation Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, 2022 Technique Inputs Inputs\nImpaired Loans Appraisal Value/ Comparison Appraisals and/or sales of Appraisals discounted 5 to 20%\nSales comparable properties for sales commission and other\nholding costs\nMortgage servicing rights Discounted Cash Flows Comparable sales Constant prepayment rate - 5%\nWeighted average discount rate -\n8%\nFair Value of Financial Instruments – The following table includes the estimated fair value of the Company’s financial\nassets and financial liabilities. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities\nmeasured on a recurring and nonrecurring basis are discussed above. The methodologies for estimating the fair value for\nother financial assets and financial liabilities are discussed below. The estimated fair value amounts have been determined\nby the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable\njudgment is required to interpret market data in order to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates\npresented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange.\nThe use of different market assumptions and/or estimation techniques may have a material effect on the estimated fair\nvalue amounts at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n109\nThe following tables present the estimated fair values, related carrying amounts, and valuation level of the financial\ninstruments as of the dates stated:\nD ec e mber 31, 20 23\nFair Value Measurements\nCarrying\n(Dollars in thousands) Value Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 272,591 $ 272,591 $272,591 $ — $ —\nNon-public investments 13,713 13,713 — — 13,713\nLoans receivable, net 3,857,057 3,732,361 — — 3,732,361\nAccrued interest receivable 17,284 17,284 — 17,284 —\nBank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) 50,516 50,516 — 50,516 —\nFinancial Liabilities\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 528,409 $ 528,409 $528,409 $ — $ —\nSavings, NOW and money markets 1,361,904 1,361,904 — 1,361,904 —\nTime deposits 1,497,035 1,495,008 — — 1,495,008\nFHLB borrowings 283,338 283,172 — 283,172 —\nD ec e mber 31, 20 22\nFair Value Measurements\nCarrying\n(Dollars in thousands) Value Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nFinancial Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 156,545 $ 156,545 $156,545 $ — $ —\nNon-public investments 10,592 10,592 — — 10,592\nLoans receivable, net 2,990,417 2,928,734 — — 2,928,734\nAccrued interest receivable 10,837 10,837 — 10,837 —\nBank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) 49,006 49,006 — 49,006 —\nFinancial Liabilities\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 445,518 $ 445,518 $445,518 $ — $ —\nSavings, NOW and money markets 1,231,606 1,231,606 — 1,231,606 —\nTime deposits 1,209,619 1,194,871 — — 1,194,871\nFHLB borrowings 293,082 293,056 — 293,056 —\nCash and cash equivalents – The carrying amount approximates fair value for these instruments.\nNon-public investments – Non-public investments are carried at original cost basis, as cost or accounted for using the\nequity method. This approximates fair value as there is no ready market for such investments.\nLoans receivable, net – Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics if collateral\ndependent. Loans are segregated by type. The fair value of performing loans is calculated by discounting scheduled cash\nflows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect observable market information\nincorporating the credit, liquidity, yield and other risks inherent in the loan. The estimate of maturity is based upon the\nCompany’s historical experience with repayments for each loan classification, modified, as required, by an estimate of the\neffect of the current economic and lending conditions. Fair value for significant non-performing loans is generally based\nupon recent external appraisals. If appraisals are not available, estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate\ncommensurate with the risk associated with the estimated cash flows. Assumptions regarding credit risk, cash flows and\ndiscounted rates are judgmentally determined using available market information and specific borrower information.\nAccrued interest receivable – The carrying amount approximates fair value for these instruments.\nBank–owned life insurance – Bank-owned life insurance is carried at net cash surrender value of the polices which\napproximates fair value since that is the approximate liquidation value of these assets.\n110\nDeposits – The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity date, such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits, savings,\nNOW and money market accounts, is based on the carrying value. The fair value of time deposits is based upon the\ndiscounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of\nsimilar remaining maturities.\nFederal Home Loan Bank borrowings – Fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows using current market\nrates for borrowings with similar terms.\nNote 14 – Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nRisk Management Objective of Using Derivatives – The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business\noperations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and\noperational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including\ninterest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities\nand the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to\nmanage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain\ncash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are\nused to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its\nknown or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s assets and liabilities.\nFair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk – The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its pools of\npre-payable fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swap agreements\nto manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark\ninterest rate. Interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a\ncounterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the\nexchange of the underlying notional amount.\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting\nloss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income.\nThe Company had previously entered into two “last of layer hedges” on a significant portion of its fixed rate residential\nloan pool. These amounts include the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging relationships in\nwhich the hedged item is the last layer expected to remain at the end of the hedging relationship.\nDuring September 2021, the Company terminated these last of layer hedges by paying out $2.15 million to the respective\nthird parties. These fees were capitalized into loans receivable and are being amortized against loan income over the\ncontractual lives of the remaining designated residential loans. The unamortized amount of this cost basis adjustment is\n$1.0 million and $1.2 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNon-designated Hedges – Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are used to manage the Company’s\nexposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements\nand/or the Company has not elected to apply hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in\nhedging relationships, exclusive of credit valuation adjustments, are recorded directly in earnings.\nThe Company executes interest rate swaps and cap agreements with commercial banking customers to facilitate its\nrespective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swap and cap agreements are simultaneously hedged by\noffsetting interest rate swaps and caps that are executed with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk\nexposure resulting from such transactions. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 52 interest rate swap agreements\nwith an aggregate notional amount of $338.58 million related to this program. As of December 31, 2022, the Company\nhad 36 interest rate swap agreements and one interest rate cap agreement with an aggregate notional amount of\n$263.9 million related to this program.\nRisk Participation Agreements – Risk Participation Agreements (“RPAs”) are guarantees issued by the Company to other\nparties for a fee, whereby the Company agrees to participate in the credit risk of a derivative customer of the other party.\n111\nUnder the terms of these agreements, the “participating bank” receives a fee from the “lead bank” in exchange for the\nguarantee of reimbursement if the customer defaults on an interest rate swap. The interest rate swap is transacted such that\nany and all exchanges of interest payments (favorable and unfavorable) are made between the lead bank and the customer.\nIn the event that an early termination of the swap occurs, and the customer is unable to make a required close out payment,\nthe participating bank assumes that obligation and is required to make this payment. RPAs where the Company acts as the\nlead bank are referred to as “participations-out,” in reference to the credit risk associated with the customer derivatives\nbeing transferred out of the Company. Participations-out generally occur concurrently with the sale of new customer\nderivatives. RPAs where the Company acts as the participating bank are referred to as “participations-in,” in reference to\nthe credit risk associated with the counterparty’s derivatives being assumed by the Company. The Company’s maximum\ncredit exposure is based on its proportionate share of the settlement amount of the referenced interest rate swap. Settlement\namounts are generally calculated based on the fair value of the swap plus outstanding accrued interest receivable from the\ncustomer. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 16 RPAs with an aggregate notional amount of $44.5 million\nrelated to this program compared to 8 RPAs with an aggregate notional amount of $31.4 million as of December 31, 2022.\nThese RPAs all represent “participations-in” and generally have terms ranging from five to ten years.\nTabular Disclosure of Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet – The table below presents\nthe fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments, as well as their\nclassification on the consolidated balance sheets as of the dates stated (in thousands):\nAsset Liability\nDecember 31, 2023 Derivatives (1) Derivatives (2)\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate products $ 27,769 $ 27,769\nRPA credit contracts — 17\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments $ 27,769 $ 27,786\nDecember 31, 2022\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate products $ 31,483 $ 31,483\nRPA credit contracts — 9\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments $ 31,483 $ 31,492\n(1) Recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets\n(2) Recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets\nThe table below presents the financial impact of the Company’s derivative financial instruments not designated as\nhedges in the consolidated statements of income, caused by changes in fair value and default termination fees paid on the\nswap arrangements for the year ended December 31 (in thousands):\nLocation of Gain or (Loss)\nRecognized Year ended December 31\nin Income on Derivative 2023 2022\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nRPA credit contracts-fair value adjustments Other non-interest income $ (8) $ 19\nSwap contract fees, net of brokerage costs, recognized in earnings on the above noted interest rate products and RPA\ncontracts approximated $2.2 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company\ndefaults (or is capable of being declared in default) on any of its indebtedness, then the Company could also be declared\nin default on its derivative obligations, and it could be required to terminate its derivative positions with the counterparty.\nThe Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision whereby if the\ncounterparty fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, then the Company could be required to terminate\nits derivative positions with the counterparty. In order to mitigate counterparty default risk in conjunction with these\n112\ninterest rate products and RPA credit contracts, the Company was required to maintain collateral deposit accounts with the\ncounterparties to these agreements in amounts of $9.1 million and $8.6 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNote 15 – Other Comprehensive Income\nThe components of the Company’s “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income”, along with the changes during the dates\nstated (net of deferred income tax effects), are as follows (in thousands):\nUnrealized Gain Director Unrealized Gain Total Accumulated\n(Loss) on AFS Pension (Loss) on Cash Other Comprehensive\nSecurities Plan Flow Hedge Income (Loss)\nBalances at December 31, 2021 $ (639) $(749) $ (884) $ (2,272)\nOther comprehensive (losses) income, net of taxes (13,100) (144) 1,115 (12,129)\nBalances at December 31, 2022 $ (13,739) $(893) $ 231 $ (14,401)\nOther comprehensive income (losses), net of taxes 2,811 (76) (231) 2,504\nBalances at December 31, 2023 $ (10,928) $(969) $ — $ (11,897)\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the changes in the components of “other comprehensive income” and the\nreclassifications out of “accumulated other comprehensive income” (in thousands):\nTax\nBefore-Tax (Expense) After-Tax\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 Amount Benefit Amount\nUnrealized Gains on AFS Securities:\nUnrealized holding gains arising during the year $ 3,740 $ (929) $ 2,811\nUnrecognized Pension Losses from Director Pension Plan:\nNet actuarial losses arising during the year (244) 69 (175)\nNew prior service costs related to plan amendments (430) 123 (307)\nReclassification adjustments into net periodic pension cost:\nAmortization of prior service costs 487 (139) 348\nAmortization of net actuarial losses 81 (23) 58\nNet change in unrecognized pension cost (106) 30 (76)\nUnrealized Losses on Cash Flow Hedge:\nUnrealized holding losses arising during the year (321) 90 (231)\nTotal other comprehensive income $ 3,313 $ (809) $ 2,504\nTax\nBefore-Tax (Expense) After-Tax\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Amount Benefit Amount\nUnrealized Losses on AFS Securities:\nUnrealized holding losses arising during the year $ (17,657) $ 4,557 $ (13,100)\nUnrecognized Pension Losses from Director Pension Plan:\nNet actuarial gains arising during the year 30 (8) 22\nNew prior service costs related to plan amendments (372) 104 (268)\nReclassification adjustments into net periodic pension cost:\nAmortization of prior service costs 57 (16) 41\nAmortization of net actuarial losses 85 (24) 61\nNet change in unrecognized pension cost (200) 56 (144)\nUnrealized Gains on Cash Flow Hedge:\nUnrealized holding gains arising during the year 1,548 (433) 1,115\nTotal other comprehensive loss $ (16,309) $ 4,180 $ (12,129)\n113\nNote 16 – Transactions with Officers and Directors\nThe Company has banking transactions with certain of its officers and directors. These transactions were made in the\nordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at\nthe time for comparable loans with persons not deemed related parties to the Company and did not involve more than the\nnormal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.\nThe following table presents loan transactions with such related parties as of December 31 (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nBalance at beginning of the year $ 2,245 $ 2,683\nNew loans 3,150 —\nRepayments (2,002) (438)\nBalance at the end of the year $ 3,393 $ 2,245\nThe Bank held related party deposits of approximately $1.6 million and $3.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nNote 17 – Earnings Per Share (“EPS)\nBasic EPS represents net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted-average number of common\nshares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other\ncontracts to issue common shares (such as stock options) were exercised or converted into additional common shares that\nwould then share in the earnings of the entity. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common\nshareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year, plus the effect of potential\ndilutive common share equivalents computed using the treasury stock method. There were no securities that had a dilutive\neffect during the year ended December 31, 2023, and therefore the weighted-average common shares outstanding used to\ncalculate both basic and diluted EPS are the same. Unallocated ESOP shares are not deemed outstanding for earnings per\nshare calculations.

As part of the agreement, customer relationships\ntransitioned to Needham Bank on April 1, 2022. The Eastern Bank team that served this customer base transitioned to\nNeedham Bank and are now employed at the Company’s new branch location in Medford, therefore the Company treated\nthis as a business combination. Approximately $297.7 million in deposits transitioned from Eastern Bank to Needham\nBank. Also, as a result of this transaction Needham Bank recognized a core deposit intangible of approximately\n$1.5 million as well as a corresponding after-tax bargain purchase gain of approximately $1.1 million. The core deposit\nintangible is being amortized over a 10-year period resulting in amortization expense of $149,000 and $112,000 during\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNote 21 – Employee Retention Tax Credit Claims\nThe CARES Act provided for an Employee Retention Tax Credit (“ERTC”), which is a broad-based refundable payroll\ntax credit that incentivized businesses to retain employees on the payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ERTC is\na credit against certain employment taxes of up to $5,000 per employee for eligible employers based on certain wages paid\nafter March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2020. In 2021, the ERTC increased to up to $7,000 for each quarter, equal\nto 70% of qualified wages paid to employees during a quarter, capped at $10,000 of qualified wages per employee per\nquarter. The ERTC terminated effective September 30, 2021.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Company made a determination that it was eligible to claim Employee Retention Tax\nCredits (“ERTC”) in the form of refunds based on the significant adverse financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs a result, during 2023 the Company filed amended employment tax returns for certain periods in 2021 to claim refunds\nrelated to the ERTC in the approximate amount of $3.5 million. Eligibility and qualification to file a claim for the ERTC\nis self-determined. Regardless of whether ERTC claims are pending payment by the IRS or have already been received by\nthe taxpayer, Congress has extended the time by which the IRS could audit ERTC claims from three years to five years.\nNote 22 – Variable Interest Entities (“VIE”)\nThe Company makes equity investments in various entities that are considered VIEs, as defined by GAAP. A VIE typically\ndoes not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other\nparties. The Company’s variable interest arises from contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in the entity, which\nchange with fluctuations in the fair value of the entity’s net assets. The Company consolidates a VIE if it is the primary\nbeneficiary of the entity. The Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if its variable interest provides\nit with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and the right to receive benefits (or the\nobligation to absorb losses) that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To determine whether or not a variable interest\nheld could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company considers both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding\nthe nature, size and form of its involvement with the VIE. The Company assesses whether or not it is the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis.\nUnconsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nLow Income Housing Tax Credit (“LIHTC”) Partnerships\nThrough designated wholly-owned subsidiaries, Needham Bank makes equity investments as a limited partner in various\npartnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the LIHTC. The purpose of these investments is to achieve\na satisfactory return on capital and to support the Company’s community reinvestment initiatives. LIHTC partnerships are\nmanaged by unrelated general partners that have the power to direct the activities which most significantly affect the\nperformance of the partnerships. The Company is therefore not the primary beneficiary of any LIHTC partnerships.\nAccordingly, the Company does not consolidate these VIEs and accounts for these investments in non-public investments\non the consolidated balance sheets.\n116\nThe Company accounts for all qualifying LIHTC investments under the proportional amortization method. Under this\nmethod, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits received\nand recognizes the net investment performance as a component of income tax expense.\nRenewable Energy Tax Credit Investments\nThe Company invests in renewable energy tax credits, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, 1892 Investments, whereby\nthe Company contributes capital to the energy providers as a non-managing member in return for income tax credits. The\npurpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to support clean-energy initiatives. These\nentities are considered VIEs as the Company’s subsidiaries represent the holders of the equity investments at risk, but do\nnot have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the performance of the entities. Accordingly, the\nCompany does not consolidate these VIEs and accounts for these investments in non-public investments on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. The Company accounts for all qualifying renewable energy tax credit investments under the\nproportional amortization method. Under this method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion\nto the tax credits and other tax benefits received and recognizes the net investment performance as a component of income\ntax expense.\nNote 23 – Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following is a summary of recent authoritative announcements:\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions”. ASU 2022-03 clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an\nequity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in\nmeasuring fair value. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning\nafter December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2022-03 to\nhave a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of\nTopic 848”. ASU 2022-06 extends the period of time preparers can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance in\nTopic 848. The objective of the guidance in Topic 848 is to provide relief during the temporary transition period, so the\nFASB included a sunset provision within Topic 848 based on expectations of when the London Interbank Offered Rate\n(LIBOR) would cease being published. In 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) delayed the intended cessation\ndate of certain tenors of USD LIBOR to June 30, 2023.\nTo ensure the relief in Topic 848 covers the period of time during which a significant number of modifications may take\nplace, the ASU defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, after which entities\nwill no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. The ASU is effective for all entities upon issuance. The\nCompany is assessing ASU 2022-06 and its impact on the Company’s transition away from LIBOR for its loan and other\nfinancial instruments that have not already been transitioned to an alternative reference rate.\nIn July 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-03, “Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Income Statement—\nReporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505),\nand Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718)”. This ASU amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification\nfor SEC paragraphs pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 120, SEC Staff Announcement at the March 24, 2022\nEITF Meeting, and Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 6.B, Accounting Series Release 280—General Revision of Regulation\nS-X: Income or Loss Applicable to Common Stock. ASU 2023-03 is effective upon addition to the FASB Codification.\nThe Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-03 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB amended ASC 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280)” to improve disclosures about a\npublic entity’s reportable segments and provide more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expense. The\namendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years\n117\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect these amendments to have\na material effect on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures” to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures. The amendments are effective for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been\nissued or made available for issuance. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not\nexpected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n118\nITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: An evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in Section 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”)) was carried out as\nof December 31, 2023 under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer,\nChief Financial Officer and several other members of the Company’s senior management as of the end of the period\ncovered by this report. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that based on\ntheir evaluation at December 31, 2023, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that\nthe information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is\n(i) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer) in a timely manner to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, specified in the SEC’s\nrules and forms, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s\nrules and forms.\n(b) Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting: The management of the Company\nis responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The internal control\nprocess has been designed under our supervision to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nManagement conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, utilizing the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this\nassessment, management has determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023 is effective.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of\nrecords that accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail, transactions and dispositions of assets; and provide\nreasonable assurances that: (1) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; (2) receipts and expenditures are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (3) unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s financial\nstatements are prevented or timely detected.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those\nsystems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation\nand presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\nThis Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation\nby the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company\nto provide only management’s report in this Form 10-K.\n(c) Changes in Internal Controls: There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n119\nITEM 9B. Other Information\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, none of our directors or officers adopted or terminated any contract, instruction\nor written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense\nconditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as that term is used in SEC regulations.\nITEM 9C.
