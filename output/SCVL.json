(Nasdaq: SCVL) (the “Company”), a leading retailer of footwear and accessories for the family, today reported results for the third quarter ended November 2, 2024. \n\n  * Achieved EPS expectations with third quarter 2024 GAAP EPS of $0.70 and Adjusted EPS of $0.71. \n  * Achieved year-to-date 2024 net sales growth of 4.9 percent versus prior year. \n  * Reiterated EPS guidance for full year Fiscal 2024. \n  * Expanded store rebannering test to 25 additional stores in the first half of Fiscal 2025. \n\n\n\n“Our Back-to-School results were strong, with comparable store sales growth across our banners and robust margins. Our flexible digital-first marketing campaign and great brand assortment drove demand during this peak shopping period and profitability in line with expectations for the third quarter. I am very proud of our team for delivering the Company’s profit results despite two significant hurricanes disrupting third quarter sales and a very warm October that delayed the start of our winter boot season,” said Mark Worden, President and Chief Executive Officer. \n\n“During the quarter, we also accelerated testing of our store rebanner growth strategy with the addition of seven stores, bringing the total number of rebannered stores from Shoe Carnival to Shoe Station to ten this year. Early results exceeded our sales and profit success criteria, encouraging the team to expand the rebanner test to an additional 25 stores during the first half of 2025 as part of our long-term vision to be the nation’s leading family footwear retailer,” concluded Mr. Worden. \n\n**Third Quarter Operating Results**\n\nNet sales in third quarter 2024 were $306.9 million as compared to $319.9 million in third quarter 2023, reflecting the impact of the retail calendar shift that resulted in approximately $20 million of net sales moving out of third quarter 2024 compared to prior year. Without the impact of the retail calendar shift, net sales increased by 2.2 percent versus prior year. On a year-to-date basis, which now includes the material impacts of the retail calendar shift that increased second quarter net sales and decreased third quarter net sales, net sales totaled $939.9 million, increasing 4.9 percent versus prior year. \n\nNet sales in the quarter were led by a strong Back-to-School performance, comparable store net sales growth in August, and net sales from the February 2024 acquisition of Rogan Shoes, Incorporated (“Rogan’s”). Comparable store net sales in September and October were significantly impacted by two hurricanes that disrupted many of the Company’s store operations and customer shopping trends, along with persistently warm weather that delayed the winter boot shopping season. Comparable store net sales for the thirteen-week period ended November 2, 2024 declined 4.1 percent compared to the thirteen-week period ended November 4, 2023. \n\nGross profit margin in third quarter 2024 was 36.0 percent, marking the 15 th  consecutive quarter the Company’s gross profit margin exceeded 35 percent. Gross profit margin was lower in the quarter by 80 basis points compared to prior year primarily due to buying, distribution and occupancy costs (“BD&O”) from operating more stores and the deleveraging effect of lower net sales in the quarter, as impacted by the retail calendar shift. Year-to-date 2024 gross profit margin was flat versus prior year. \n\nAs a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses in the quarter were 28.0 percent compared to 28.1 percent in prior year, reflecting 10 basis points of leverage, on the lower, shifted sales base. The decrease in SG&A expenses was due primarily to lower selling costs at Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station banner stores, which in the quarter more than offset the costs of operating the recently acquired Rogan’s stores. During third quarter 2024, the Company captured synergies within Rogan’s and is ahead of schedule on integrating the acquired operations. \n\nThird quarter 2024 operating income totaled $24.5 million, as compared to $27.9 million in third quarter 2023, as impacted by the lower net sales from the calendar shift, partially offset by growth from the Rogan’s acquisition and related synergies and lower SG&A. \n\nThird quarter 2024 net income was in line with the Company’s expectation at $19.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share (“EPS”), compared to third quarter 2023 net income of $21.9 million, or $0.80 per diluted share. In year-to-date 2024, net income and EPS have increased 2.2 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, versus the prior year. \n\nThird quarter 2024 GAAP results included $0.3 million in expenses related to the Rogan’s acquisition, of which $0.2 million were included in cost of sales and $0.1 million were included in SG&A. On an adjusted basis, excluding these expenses, third quarter Adjusted EPS was $0.71 and in line with the Company’s expectation. Year-to-date 2024 Adjusted EPS totaled $2.19, an increase of 3.8% versus prior year. \n\n**Rogan’s Acquisition**\n\nThe Company continues to expect the Rogan’s acquisition to deliver net sales of over $80 million in Fiscal 2024, with $22.3 million of net sales in third quarter 2024 and $63.9 million year-to-date in 2024. The Company has completed the integration of store operations, marketing, ecommerce platforms, point-of-sale systems, merchandising, and back office. As a result of this accelerated integration, synergy capture has also accelerated into Fiscal 2024 ahead of expectations. The Company continues to expect total synergies of approximately $2.5 million, with approximately half of the synergies now expected to be achieved in the second half of Fiscal 2024 in both BD&O and SG&A with a significant portion of that captured in third quarter 2024. \n\n**Store Count and Rebanner Growth Strategy**\n\nAs of November 21, 2024, the Company operated 431 stores, with 361 Shoe Carnival stores, 42 Shoe Station stores and the 28 Rogan’s locations. One new Shoe Station store opened in third quarter 2024 in Tennessee, expanding this banner into a new market. \n\nThe Company advanced its store rebanner growth strategy during the quarter, with seven Shoe Carnival stores being rebannered to Shoe Station stores. Ten stores have now been rebannered. Through third quarter 2024, rebannered stores have outperformed expectations. Stores with more than one fiscal month of operating history have experienced both a net sales increase and store-level profitability increase of over 10 percent. Based on the successful results of the strategy to date, the Company plans to rebanner 25 additional Shoe Carnival stores to Shoe Station stores in the first half of Fiscal 2025. \n\n**Share Repurchase Program**\n\nAs of November 21, 2024, the Company had $50 million available for future repurchases under its share repurchase program. During third quarter 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares. \n\n**Capital Management and Cash Flow**\n\nThe 2023 fiscal year end marked the 19 th  consecutive year the Company ended a year with no debt, and through third quarter 2024, the Company continued funding its operations and growth investments from operating cash flow and without debt. \n\nAt the end of third quarter 2024, the Company had approximately $91.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $20.0 million compared to prior year. Operating cash flow year-to-date 2024 totaled $58.1 million. \n\n**Fiscal 2024 Outlook**\n\nBased on year-to-date results, including third quarter profitability in line with the Company’s expectation and net sales lower than the Company’s expectation, the Company is providing guidance ranges as follows: \n\n**Net Sales:** Updated range to $1.20 billion to $1.23 billion, representing growth of 2 percent to 4.5 percent versus Fiscal 2023. (Prior guidance range $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion) \n\n**Gross Profit Margin:** Expected to be approximately even with Fiscal 2023. (No change) \n\n**Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG &A”): ** As a percent of net sales, SG&A is expected to be approximately 30 basis points higher than Fiscal 2023. (Previous guidance approximately 40 basis points higher than Fiscal 2023) \n\n**Income Tax Rate:** Expected to be approximately 25.6 percent to 26 percent in Fiscal 2024. (Prior guidance approximately 26 percent) \n\n**GAAP EPS:** Expected to be in a range of $2.55 to $2.70. (No change) \n\n**Non-GAAP EPS (“Adjusted EPS”):** Expected to be in a range of $2.60 to $2.75. (No change) \n\nThe Company notes that its Fiscal 2024 is a 52-week year and compares to a 53-week year in Fiscal 2023 and, combined with the impact of the retail calendar shift versus prior year, results in the loss of approximately $20 million in net sales in fourth quarter 2024 compared to fourth quarter 2023 with an estimated negative impact of approximately $0.10 on EPS. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nToday, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter results. Participants can listen to the live webcast of the call by visiting Shoe Carnival's Investors webpage at [www.shoecarnival.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shoecarnival.com&esheet=54156067&newsitemid=20241121755614&lan=en-US&anchor=www.shoecarnival.com&index=1&md5=04c8a24e06dfc7e5dee5c1efdd1b25e2).

A replay of the webcast will be available on the Company’s website beginning approximately two hours after the conclusion of the conference call and will be archived for one year. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe non-GAAP adjusted results for third quarter 2024 and in the Fiscal 2024 outlook discussed herein exclude purchase accounting impacts associated with the Company’s acquisition of Rogan’s. These impacts include the amortization expense included in cost of sales associated with the fair value adjustment to acquisition inventory and expenses included in SG&A related to deal formation and legal and accounting advice and purchase accounting and integration expenses.

(Nasdaq: SCVL) (the “Company”), a leading retailer of footwear and accessories for the family, today reported results for the third quarter ended November 2, 2024. \n\n  * Achieved EPS expectations with third quarter 2024 GAAP EPS of $0.70 and Adjusted EPS of $0.71. \n  * Achieved year-to-date 2024 net sales growth of 4.9 percent versus prior year. \n  * Reiterated EPS guidance for full year Fiscal 2024. \n  * Expanded store rebannering test to 25 additional stores in the first half of Fiscal 2025. \n\n\n\n“Our Back-to-School results were strong, with comparable store sales growth across our banners and robust margins. Our flexible digital-first marketing campaign and great brand assortment drove demand during this peak shopping period and profitability in line with expectations for the third quarter. I am very proud of our team for delivering the Company’s profit results despite two significant hurricanes disrupting third quarter sales and a very warm October that delayed the start of our winter boot season,” said Mark Worden, President and Chief Executive Officer. \n\n“During the quarter, we also accelerated testing of our store rebanner growth strategy with the addition of seven stores, bringing the total number of rebannered stores from Shoe Carnival to Shoe Station to ten this year. Early results exceeded our sales and profit success criteria, encouraging the team to expand the rebanner test to an additional 25 stores during the first half of 2025 as part of our long-term vision to be the nation’s leading family footwear retailer,” concluded Mr. Worden. \n\n**Third Quarter Operating Results**\n\nNet sales in third quarter 2024 were $306.9 million as compared to $319.9 million in third quarter 2023, reflecting the impact of the retail calendar shift that resulted in approximately $20 million of net sales moving out of third quarter 2024 compared to prior year. Without the impact of the retail calendar shift, net sales increased by 2.2 percent versus prior year. On a year-to-date basis, which now includes the material impacts of the retail calendar shift that increased second quarter net sales and decreased third quarter net sales, net sales totaled $939.9 million, increasing 4.9 percent versus prior year. \n\nNet sales in the quarter were led by a strong Back-to-School performance, comparable store net sales growth in August, and net sales from the February 2024 acquisition of Rogan Shoes, Incorporated (“Rogan’s”). Comparable store net sales in September and October were significantly impacted by two hurricanes that disrupted many of the Company’s store operations and customer shopping trends, along with persistently warm weather that delayed the winter boot shopping season. Comparable store net sales for the thirteen-week period ended November 2, 2024 declined 4.1 percent compared to the thirteen-week period ended November 4, 2023. \n\nGross profit margin in third quarter 2024 was 36.0 percent, marking the 15 th  consecutive quarter the Company’s gross profit margin exceeded 35 percent. Gross profit margin was lower in the quarter by 80 basis points compared to prior year primarily due to buying, distribution and occupancy costs (“BD&O”) from operating more stores and the deleveraging effect of lower net sales in the quarter, as impacted by the retail calendar shift. Year-to-date 2024 gross profit margin was flat versus prior year. \n\nAs a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses in the quarter were 28.0 percent compared to 28.1 percent in prior year, reflecting 10 basis points of leverage, on the lower, shifted sales base. The decrease in SG&A expenses was due primarily to lower selling costs at Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station banner stores, which in the quarter more than offset the costs of operating the recently acquired Rogan’s stores. During third quarter 2024, the Company captured synergies within Rogan’s and is ahead of schedule on integrating the acquired operations. \n\nThird quarter 2024 operating income totaled $24.5 million, as compared to $27.9 million in third quarter 2023, as impacted by the lower net sales from the calendar shift, partially offset by growth from the Rogan’s acquisition and related synergies and lower SG&A. \n\nThird quarter 2024 net income was in line with the Company’s expectation at $19.2 million, or $0.70 per diluted share (“EPS”), compared to third quarter 2023 net income of $21.9 million, or $0.80 per diluted share. In year-to-date 2024, net income and EPS have increased 2.2 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, versus the prior year. \n\nThird quarter 2024 GAAP results included $0.3 million in expenses related to the Rogan’s acquisition, of which $0.2 million were included in cost of sales and $0.1 million were included in SG&A. On an adjusted basis, excluding these expenses, third quarter Adjusted EPS was $0.71 and in line with the Company’s expectation. Year-to-date 2024 Adjusted EPS totaled $2.19, an increase of 3.8% versus prior year. \n\n**Rogan’s Acquisition**\n\nThe Company continues to expect the Rogan’s acquisition to deliver net sales of over $80 million in Fiscal 2024, with $22.3 million of net sales in third quarter 2024 and $63.9 million year-to-date in 2024. The Company has completed the integration of store operations, marketing, ecommerce platforms, point-of-sale systems, merchandising, and back office. As a result of this accelerated integration, synergy capture has also accelerated into Fiscal 2024 ahead of expectations. The Company continues to expect total synergies of approximately $2.5 million, with approximately half of the synergies now expected to be achieved in the second half of Fiscal 2024 in both BD&O and SG&A with a significant portion of that captured in third quarter 2024. \n\n**Store Count and Rebanner Growth Strategy**\n\nAs of November 21, 2024, the Company operated 431 stores, with 361 Shoe Carnival stores, 42 Shoe Station stores and the 28 Rogan’s locations. One new Shoe Station store opened in third quarter 2024 in Tennessee, expanding this banner into a new market. \n\nThe Company advanced its store rebanner growth strategy during the quarter, with seven Shoe Carnival stores being rebannered to Shoe Station stores. Ten stores have now been rebannered. Through third quarter 2024, rebannered stores have outperformed expectations. Stores with more than one fiscal month of operating history have experienced both a net sales increase and store-level profitability increase of over 10 percent. Based on the successful results of the strategy to date, the Company plans to rebanner 25 additional Shoe Carnival stores to Shoe Station stores in the first half of Fiscal 2025. \n\n**Share Repurchase Program**\n\nAs of November 21, 2024, the Company had $50 million available for future repurchases under its share repurchase program. During third quarter 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares. \n\n**Capital Management and Cash Flow**\n\nThe 2023 fiscal year end marked the 19 th  consecutive year the Company ended a year with no debt, and through third quarter 2024, the Company continued funding its operations and growth investments from operating cash flow and without debt. \n\nAt the end of third quarter 2024, the Company had approximately $91.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $20.0 million compared to prior year. Operating cash flow year-to-date 2024 totaled $58.1 million. \n\n**Fiscal 2024 Outlook**\n\nBased on year-to-date results, including third quarter profitability in line with the Company’s expectation and net sales lower than the Company’s expectation, the Company is providing guidance ranges as follows: \n\n**Net Sales:** Updated range to $1.20 billion to $1.23 billion, representing growth of 2 percent to 4.5 percent versus Fiscal 2023. (Prior guidance range $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion) \n\n**Gross Profit Margin:** Expected to be approximately even with Fiscal 2023. (No change) \n\n**Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG &A”): ** As a percent of net sales, SG&A is expected to be approximately 30 basis points higher than Fiscal 2023. (Previous guidance approximately 40 basis points higher than Fiscal 2023) \n\n**Income Tax Rate:** Expected to be approximately 25.6 percent to 26 percent in Fiscal 2024. (Prior guidance approximately 26 percent) \n\n**GAAP EPS:** Expected to be in a range of $2.55 to $2.70. (No change) \n\n**Non-GAAP EPS (“Adjusted EPS”):** Expected to be in a range of $2.60 to $2.75. (No change) \n\nThe Company notes that its Fiscal 2024 is a 52-week year and compares to a 53-week year in Fiscal 2023 and, combined with the impact of the retail calendar shift versus prior year, results in the loss of approximately $20 million in net sales in fourth quarter 2024 compared to fourth quarter 2023 with an estimated negative impact of approximately $0.10 on EPS. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nToday, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its third quarter results. Participants can listen to the live webcast of the call by visiting Shoe Carnival's Investors webpage at [www.shoecarnival.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shoecarnival.com&esheet=54156067&newsitemid=20241121755614&lan=en-US&anchor=www.shoecarnival.com&index=1&md5=04c8a24e06dfc7e5dee5c1efdd1b25e2). While the question-and-answer session will be available to all listeners, questions from the audience will be limited to institutional analysts and investors. A replay of the webcast will be available on the Company’s website beginning approximately two hours after the conclusion of the conference call and will be archived for one year. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe non-GAAP adjusted results for third quarter 2024 and in the Fiscal 2024 outlook discussed herein exclude purchase accounting impacts associated with the Company’s acquisition of Rogan’s. These impacts include the amortization expense included in cost of sales associated with the fair value adjustment to acquisition inventory and expenses included in SG&A related to deal formation and legal and accounting advice and purchase accounting and integration expenses. These adjusted results are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's historical operations and financial performance and future projections.

FQ32025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 21, 2024\nPresentation\nOperator\nGood morning, and welcome to Shoe Carnival's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's\nconference call is being recorded and is also being broadcast via webcast. Any reproduction or rebroadcast\nof any portion of this call is expressly prohibited.\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Steve Alexander with Shoe Carnival Investor Relations.\nSteve R. Alexander\nInvestor Relations\nThank you, and good morning. Thanks for joining us today. Earlier this morning, we issued our earnings\npress release for the third quarter of 2024. If you need a copy of the release, it is available on our website\nin the Investors section. Joining me on today's call are Mark Worden, President and Chief Executive Officer\nof Shoe Carnival; Carl Scibetta, Chief Merchandising Officer; and Patrick Edwards, Chief Financial Officer.\nManagement's remarks today may contain forward-looking statements that involve a number of risk\nfactors. These risk factors could cause the company's actual results to be materially different from those\nprojected in such statements. Forward-looking statements should also be considered in conjunction with\nthe discussion of risk factors included in the company's SEC filings and today's earnings press release.\nInvestors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak\nonly as of today's date. The company disclaims any obligation to update any of the risk factors or to\npublicly announce any revisions to the forward-looking statements discussed on today's conference call or\ncontained in today's press release to reflect future events or developments.\nToday's call will reference non GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures or adjusted results referenced\nexclude the purchase accounting, merger, integration and transaction costs related to the acquisition of\nRogan’s Shoes. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in this morning's release.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Mark.\nMark J. Worden\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Before discussing results for the quarter, I'd like to\nstart today by thanking all our team members for their hard work and tireless dedication. As a result of\nthe devastating hurricanes, Helene and Milton, the lives of both our employees and our customers were\ndramatically impacted. Importantly, all our team members are now safe and accounted for, and we're\nfortunate that we did not suffer meaningful damage to our stores. We're grateful for both outcomes, and\nthank you, team.\nMoving now to our results. I'm so proud of the profitability the team achieved in the quarter. We\ndelivered third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.71, which was in line with our expectations shared earlier this\nyear. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EPS totaled $2.19, an increase of 3.8% versus prior year. Gross\nprofit margin in the quarter was 36%, exceeding 35% for the 15th consecutive quarter.\nWe achieved year-to-date net sales of $939.9 million, an increase of 4.9% and year-to-date adjusted\noperating income of $78.4 million, an increase of 6.6% versus prior year and growing faster than sales.\nThe key drivers of our third quarter profit delivery included a very strong back-to-school performance with\ncomparable store sales growth across our banners, efficiencies in our digital-first marketing approach, the\naddition of Rogan's in February 2024 and the rapid progress testing our store rebanner strategy, which I\nwill discuss in a few moments.\nFrom a top line perspective, Rogan's continued to deliver in line with our expectation. And from a profit\nperspective, we further accelerated the Rogan's integration time-line and began capturing significant profit\nCopyright© 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ32025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 21, 2024\nsynergies in the third quarter, a full 6 months ahead of our previous schedule, which was to begin\ncapturing synergies in fiscal 2025.\nThe synergy capture in the quarter was primarily corporate and back-office support, where we had the\ncapacity to consolidate functions ahead of schedule. Patrick will go into more details in his comments,\nbut our ability to accelerate the capture of these savings into 2024 demonstrates our team's ability to\nquickly identify and capture profit synergies while also delivering on our top line expectations for\nRogan's.\nIn addition to the profit synergies on Rogan's, we also drove leverage in our SG&A led by our digital-first\nmarketing strategies. As we have previously discussed, our transition to a digital-first approach and\naway from more traditional forms of media, which began over a year ago, gives us the ability to quickly\npivot and adjust spending to invest strategically and maximize engagement when customers are ready to\npurchase, just as we did during back-to-school in the quarter. Importantly, the inverse is also a key\naspect of our digital strategy, to be flexible enough to ratchet spending down when consumers are not\nengaging with advertising investments at a sufficiently profitable level, such as the weeks surrounding\nHurricanes Helene and Milton. Our spending flexibility to match the customers' real-time behavior was\nessential to delivering our profit expectations this quarter.\nTurning to sales in the quarter. Back-to-school was an all-around success led by children's and athletics;\nwe achieved solid comparable store net sales growth. In the back-to-school weeks leading up to Labor\nDay, we achieved comparable store net sales growth in both Carnival and Station banners, delivered\nstrong product margins, customer traffic growth and transaction size increases versus prior year. And\nas I mentioned earlier, our flexible digital-first marketing campaigns were very effective, driving\nincreased customer engagement while also delivering continued profit efficiencies as we were able to\nreach more customers while spending less.\nAfter Labor Day, in September and October, sales slowed meaningfully as a result of the 2 hurricanes\nand persistently warm weather. While we did not experience major damage to our stores resulting from\nthe hurricanes, our business was significantly disrupted, ranging from some stores being closed for a\nday or 2, all the way to one of our stores in Western North Carolina being closed for nearly a month\nwithout electricity or water. From a high-level perspective, about half of our stores were affected to\nvarying degrees by the hurricanes, and our customers' lives were significantly impacted as well.\nUnderstandably, shopping for shoes during these storms was simply not a priority for them.\nLater in the quarter, the weather remained unseasonably warm into November, which delayed the start\nof our winter boot season. Carl will go into more details in his remarks, but as a point of reference, boots\nwere down over 35% in the month of October and our sandals assortment, given the very warm\nweather, continued to deliver sales up double digit in October. All in, the disruption from the hurricanes\nto our stores and to our customers' lives, combined with the lack of a boot season in the quarter were\nthe primary drivers of sales performing about $10 million below our goals in the back half of the quarter.\nNow shifting to thoughts on the balance of the year. Today, we revised our full year sales guidance given\nthe sales performance in the third quarter. We anticipate customer purchasing behaviors during non-event\nperiods, which we are in now until the holidays, will continue to be in decline across the industry. And\nwhile the winter boot season was delayed out of the third quarter due to the warm weather, I expect\ntrends to improve materially when the weather turns cooler and we enter the winter holiday event period.\nConsistent with last quarter, we anticipate the lower side of our guidance range is the most likely outcome\nconsidering where we stand today. But if boot trends turn to significant growth once the weather gets cold\nand strong holiday results are achieved, then the mid to higher side of the range is a possible outcome.\nAs I said, we believe the lower end is most likely as persistent warm weather has continued into early\nfourth quarter.\nWe also reiterated our fiscal 2024 EPS guidance range based on our strong margins and profit delivery in\nthe third quarter and year-to-date. Patrick will go into more details on guidance, but I'm proud of the team\nfor delivering such strong profit results in the third quarter in the face of many unexpected weather\nchallenges.\nCopyright© 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/ marketintelIigence 4\nSHOE CARNIVAL, INC. FQ32025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 21, 2024\nI would now like to take a few moments to discuss two core growth strategies that support our vision to be\nthe nation's leading family footwear retailer. One of those core strategies is profitable M&A activity.\nRogan's, which we acquired in February 2024, continues to deliver top line results in line with our\nexpectation. And as I discussed earlier, we achieved full run rate synergies in the quarter, 6 months faster\nthan we anticipated. With integration largely complete and full synergies now being captured, the team is\nturning to building out our Shoe Perks CRM program in the Rogan’s stores, which we just rolled out and\nare mining customer data for new growth opportunities in the years ahead.\nShoe Station, which we acquired in December 2021, continues to deliver strong sales growth year-over-\nyear since the acquisition, along with profitable results that are accretive to our bottom line. In addition to\nbeing a profitable acquisition, the Shoe Station brand, product assortment and in-store shopping\nexperience make Shoe Station a key component of a second core growth strategy, which is to grow our\nexisting business.\nOne of the primary focus areas in this strategy is to evaluate data on community characteristics,\npurchasing trends, product assortment and mix at a store level. As part of that analysis, we have defined\nexisting Shoe Carnival locations where the customer and real estate characteristics are better aligned\nwith Shoe Station.\nAs I discussed on our last call, we rebannered 3 stores from Carnival to Station during the second quarter\nin the core station markets of Alabama and Mississippi. The results were very encouraging, surpassing\nour expectations early on and continuing to do so in the third quarter.\nDuring the third quarter, we expanded the testing of this strategy by rebannering 7 more stores, bringing\nthe total number of rebannered stores to 10. Our focus on this round of testing was to further validate that\nrebannering stores in core markets is profit accretive and to test expansion into additional southern\nmarkets where Shoe Station is present or known, but not the market leader.\nWith the addition of these 7 newly rebannered stores, we entered multiple new station markets in Florida,\nAlabama and Mississippi, along with the state of Tennessee. It's still early days on these 7 stores, but\nthe results are promising.\nOur success criteria for rebannered stores are plus 3% to 5% sales and profit growth. And based on the\nfirst 10 stores, we are very encouraged with the early results. The stores with more than 1 fiscal month\nof operating history have delivered a total sales and profit increase of over 10%. We will continue to\nlearn from the rebannered stores during the fourth quarter and the important holiday shopping period,\nbut it is very clear that these stores are significantly outperforming as Shoe Station bannered stores\ncompared to their performance prior as Shoe Carnival stores.\nAs such, we plan to further expand the testing by rebannering an additional 25 stores in the first half of\nfiscal 2025. The markets currently planned are in the South and include new Shoe Station markets in\nTennessee, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia and possibly Kentucky and the Carolinas.\nWith this round of testing, we plan to further test the success of this strategy by expanding it to markets\noutside of Alabama and Mississippi into markets further away from where the Shoe Station brand is\nknown. With the additional 25 stores planned in early 2025, the number of rebannered stores will total 35\nand represent approximately 10% of Shoe Carnival stores that will have been rebannered during the first\nphase of our testing. We see this strategy as a potential long-term source of growth, and I look forward to\nproviding an update on our next earnings call as well as our expectations for 2025 impact and thoughts on\npotentially expanding testing further geographically in the years ahead. I'd like to thank our team for their\nspirit of innovation and reimagining ways to better meet our customers' needs. This new strategy is\nenergizing teams, delighting customers and early days are very profit accretive.\nBefore handing it over to Carl, I'll summarize with a few closing thoughts. We delivered a very profitable\nquarter and EPS that was in line with our expectation, led by a successful back-to-school, strong margins\nand continued efficiencies in our successful digital-first marketing approach.\nRogan's delivered top line results that were in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we\naccelerated the integration and delivered full profit synergies in the quarter, 6 months ahead of schedule.\nCopyright© 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/ marketintelIigence 5\nSHOE CARNIVAL, INC. FQ32025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 21, 2024\nAs part of our store rebanner strategy, we expanded testing in the quarter with 7 additional stores,\nbringing the total number of stores to 10. We continue to be encouraged by the early results and currently\nplan to further expand the strategy by rebannering 25 additional stores in the first half of fiscal 2025.\nAnd as we announced in October, Carl Scibetta has decided to retire during the spring of 2025 after over\n50 years in the retail industry and over a decade of service to Shoe Carnival. I'd like to thank Carl for his\npartnership over the last decade as well as his valuable leadership, his friendship and many contributions\nto Shoe Carnival's successful growth during his tenure. The process to select Carl's successor is\nunderway, and we plan to share further information at the appropriate time in 2025. We are grateful that\nCarl will remain with the company to close out fiscal 2024 and to facilitate a smooth transition during\nfiscal 2025.\nAnd now I'll hand it over to Carl.\nCarl N. Scibetta\nSenior EVP & Chief Merchandising Officer\nThank you, Mark. I appreciate your kind words and have very much enjoyed working with you and the\nteam over the last decade, and I look forward to closing out the year strong.\nAs you discussed, we delivered a strong back-to-school season with comparable store sales growth led\nby mid to high single digit growth in children's and athletics. In September and October, sales slowed as\nthe 2 hurricanes disrupted our business and impacted our customers. The weather also remained\npersistently warm in October, resulting in a boot season that was delayed out of the third quarter.\nFrom a category perspective, athletics performed well, growing low single digits in the quarter with growth\nin women's and children's, partially offset by a decline in men's.\nBoots in the third quarter, which historically has represented about 1/3 of our entire winter boot season,\nwere down over 35% in the month of October and over 30% in the third quarter with declines in women's,\nmen's and children's.\nIn the quarter, we again delivered gross profit margin above 35% for the 15th consecutive quarter, and we\nremain committed to our targeted CRM strategies to continue delivering sustained gross profit margin\nperformance. Our merchandise margins in the quarter increased by approximately 50 basis points versus\nprior year. And on a year-to-date basis, our merchandise margins were even with the prior year.\nInventory at the end of the quarter totaled $406.6 million, an increase of $38.3 million versus prior year,\nprimarily reflecting the impacts of the Rogan's acquisition in February 2024. Excluding the impacts from\nRogan's, our merchandise inventory at the end of Q3 was lower by approximately 1% on a dollar basis than\nprior year. And on a unit basis, merchandise inventory was down approximately 3% versus prior year.\nNow moving to sales and categories for the quarter. Total Q3 comp sales were down 4.1%, which reflected\nweakness in boots that was partially offset by growth in athletics, driven by strong back-to-school\nperformance. From a category perspective, total adult athletics comp sales increased low single digit in the\nquarter. Comp sales in women's adult athletics were up high singles, led by court and basketball, partially\noffset by a decline in skate. Comp sales in men's adult athletics were down low singles with declines in\nskate and running partially offset by strength in court and walking.\nChildren's comp sales were down low single digit with athletic up low single digit led by court and non\nathletics down high single digit. The children's non-athletic performance was primarily due to softness\nin boots, which were down over 30% in the quarter.\nThird quarter comp sales in women's non-athletic footwear were down mid-teens. Dress and casual\nwere both down high teens and sport was down low single digit. Sandals were down high single digit\nand boots were down over 35% in the quarter. Men's non athletic comp sales were down mid-single\ndigit. Dress was down low double digit and casual was down low single digit. Men's boots were down\nhigh single digit.\nComing out of the quarter, inventory content is clean and in good position. Specifically, our boot\ninventory is over 15% lower than prior year. And with our strong vendor relationships, the team has\nCopyright© 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/ marketintelIigence 6\nSHOE CARNIVAL, INC. FQ32025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 21, 2024\nbeen able to adjust receipts based on category trends to date, and we are on target to finish the\nseason in line with our boot inventory plan.\nIn closing, we achieved a strong back-to-school performance led by children's and athletics in the quarter.\nSales in September and October slowed due to the impacts of hurricanes on our business and our\ncustomers and the persistently warm weather, which resulted in the winter boot season being delayed out\nof the quarter. Despite these significant impacts to sales after Labor Day, we delivered a very profitable\nquarter with strong margins, and our inventory is well positioned to continue providing the product\nassortment, mix and value that our customers want.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Patrick for a review of our financials.\nPatrick C. Edwards\nSenior VP, CFO, Secretary & Treasurer\nThanks, Carl. Moving on to our financial results. We were pleased to deliver EPS in line with expectations\nfor the quarter and grow our year-to-date top line and EPS compared to the prior year. As a reminder,\nthe 53rd week in fiscal 2023 will not recur in fiscal 2024. And as a result, the retail calendar weeks\nin each quarter shift in 2024 as compared to prior year. This shift benefited second quarter net sales\napproximately $20 million and unfavorably impacted our third quarter by approximately $20 million. On a\nyear-to-date basis, comparisons to the prior year now incorporate the material elements of the shift\nbetween these 2 quarters.\nIn the third quarter, net sales totaled $306.9 million, down $13 million compared to the prior year or\n4.1%. This decrease was due to the $20 million retail calendar shift. In the quarter, net sales otherwise\nincreased $7 million or 2.2% compared to Q3 last year. On a year-to-date basis, which now includes the\nmaterial impacts of the retail calendar shift, net sales totaled $939.9 million, an increase of 4.9% versus\nprior year.\nNow going into a little more detail on the top line in the quarter. Net sales were led by strong back-to-school\nperformance and comparable store sales growth across our banners in August. Net sales in the quarter\nwere also favorably impacted by Rogan's, which we acquired in mid-February of this year. I'll discuss\nRogan's sales activity and integration successes in more detail in a moment. Net sales in September and\nOctober were significantly impacted by the 2 hurricanes that disrupted many of our store operations and\ncustomer shopping trends. Net sales were also negatively impacted by persistently warm weather that\ndelayed a meaningful start to the winter boot shopping season out of the third quarter.\nOn a comparable store sale basis, which excludes the impact of the retail calendar shift, Rogan’s sales\nand other new store growth, net sales in the third quarter declined 4.1 % as impacted by August back-to\nschool low singles comp growth and the weather-related declines in September and October. Comparable\nstore sales in these 2 months were down high singles compared to last year's combined September and\nOctober, with boots driving about half of the decline. For the entire quarter, the slower boot sales also\ndrove about half of the 4.1% comparable store sales decline, partially offset by continued strength in\nathletics.\nQ3 gross profit margin was 36% compared to Q3 2023 gross profit margin of 36.8%, declining 80 basis\npoints compared to last year's third quarter. The decrease was primarily due to BD&O costs, which\nincreased in the quarter on higher occupancy costs from operating more stores and deleverage as\nimpacted by the retail calendar shift. On a year-to-date basis, gross profit margin was even with the prior\nyear, consistent with our expectations and full year guidance. For the quarter, merchandise margins were\nup 50 basis points, as Carl discussed. And on a year-to-date basis, merchandise margins were flat to\nprior year, consistent with our overall gross profit margin and in line with expectations.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 28%, reflecting a 10 basis point decrease in the quarter, even\nwith the lower shifted net sales. SG&A in Q3 was $85.9 million, representing a decrease of $3. 9 million\nversus 2023's third quarter, primarily related to lower selling costs at Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station\nCopyright© 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/ marketintelIigence 7\nSHOE CARNIVAL, INC. FQ32025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 21, 2024\nstores. As Mark discussed, these lower selling costs reflected optimized advertising spend driven by our\ndigital-first marketing strategy. These lower selling expenses more than offset the cost of operating\nRogan's stores in the quarter.\nNow going into more detail on Rogan's top line results and accelerated integration. We are very happy with\nhow the Rogan's acquisition has performed with net sales approximating $22.3 million in the quarter and\n$63.9 million year-to-date, in line with our full year expectation. We continue to expect Rogan's to deliver\nannual net sales of over $80 million in fiscal 2024. We have completed integration of store operations,\nmarketing, e-commerce platforms, point-of-sale systems, merchandising and back office. With respect to\ncustomer-facing technology, Rogan's customers can now participate in Shoe Perks, our customer loyalty\nprogram. And toward the end of the third quarter, we integrated the Rogan's e-commerce platform into\nShoe Station’s. For Rogan's customers, these changes expand merchandise selection and provide access to\nother new benefits.\nAs Mark discussed, we captured significant profit synergies in the quarter, 6 months ahead of our\npreviously expected schedule, which was to generate savings beginning in fiscal 2025. We currently\nestimate Rogan's synergy capture of over $1 million in fiscal 2024, with a significant portion of that total\nbanked in the third quarter. Our estimate for total Rogan's profit synergies continues to be approximately\n$2.5 million, with approximately half of that total now expected to be captured in fiscal 2024.\nMoving back to results in the quarter. Operating income totaled $24.5 million, a decrease of $3.4 million\nversus prior year on a GAAP basis and a decrease of $3 million on an adjusted basis as impacted by the\nlower net sales from the retail calendar shift, partially offset by growth, principally from the Rogan's\nacquisition and related profit synergies as well as lower SG&A.\nYear-to-date, adjusted operating income totaled $78.4 million, increasing 6.6% versus the prior year. On\na GAAP basis in the quarter, operating income included approximately $300,000 of merger and integration\nexpenses related to the Rogan's acquisition, of which approximately $200,000 was in cost of sales and\n$100,000 was in SG&A. Year-to-date, these expenses totaled $1.3 million with approximately $800,000\nin cost of sales and $500,000 in SG&A.\nOur income tax rate in the quarter was 24. 7%, resulting in a headwind to EPS of approximately $0.01\nper share versus the prior year third quarter rate of 23.8%. This higher rate primarily reflected discrete\nbenefits that favorably impacted the prior year and did not recur in 2024. Year-to-date, our tax rate is\n25.5% in fiscal 2024 compared to 23% last year, a headwind to the year-to-date EPS of approximately\n$0.07.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income for third quarter 2024 was $19.2 million or $0.70 per diluted share and in\nline with expectation. On a year-to-date basis, GAAP net income and EPS have increased 2.2% and 1.9%,\nrespectively, versus prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the Rogan's acquisition-related costs,\nadjusted net income for the third quarter was $19.5 million or $0.71 per diluted share and in line with\nexpectation. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EPS totaled $2.19, an increase of 3.8% versus prior year,\neven with the challenging market conditions experienced in September and October.\n2023 fiscal year-end marked the 19th consecutive year the company ended the year with no debt. And\nthrough the third quarter of 2024, we have continued to fund our operations and growth investments from\nour operating cash flow and without debt.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately\n$91 million, an increase of $20 million versus third quarter 2023, even with the all-cash acquisition of\nRogan's earlier this year. Cash flow from operations year-to-date in fiscal 2024 totaled $58.1 million. Our\nstrong balance sheet and history of generating steady operating cash flow are key drivers to internally\nfund our growth objectives, including our emerging rebanner strategy and profitable M&A as well as to\ndeliver dividends and when desirable, share repurchases. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any\nshares and have $50 million available under our current share repurchase program.\nInventory at the end of the quarter totaled $406.6 million, an increase of approximately $38 million versus\nprior year, primarily reflecting Rogan's acquired inventory. As Carl discussed earlier, our inventory content\nCopyright© 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/ marketintelIigence 8\nSHOE CARNIVAL, INC. FQ32025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 21, 2024\nis clean and in good position, including boot inventory.\nIncluding the newly rebannered stores in Q3, at the end of the quarter we operated 431 stores with 361\nShoe Carnival stores, 42 Shoe Station stores and the 28 Rogan's locations. One new Shoe Station store\nopened in Q3, entering Tennessee, an expansion into a new market for the banner. And as Mark\nmentioned, we plan to rebanner 25 additional stores in the first half of fiscal 2025.\nMoving on to our 2024 outlook. Based on year-to-date results, inclusive of third quarter profitability that\nwas in line with expectation and net sales that was lower than expectation, today we provided the\nfollowing fiscal 2024 guidance ranges.\nWe now expect full year 2024 net sales in a range of $1.20 billion to $1.23 billion, reflecting growth of\n2% to 4.5% versus fiscal 2023. We continue to expect gross profit margin to be approximately even with\nfiscal 2023. We now expect SG&A as a percent of net sales to be approximately 30 basis points higher\nthan fiscal 2023 compared to our previous guidance of 40 basis points higher. This improved guidance is\ndriven by expected synergy capture and third quarter operating expense management. We now expect\nour income tax rate to be lower than our previous guidance at approximately 25.6% to 26%. Our previous\nguidance was a tax rate of 26%. We continue to expect GAAP EPS in a range of $2.55 to $2.70 and\nadjusted EPS in a range of $2.60 to $2.75.\nGoing into a little more detail on our revised guidance and what it means for the balance of the year. We\nare currently in a non-event buying period until we get to the holidays. As Mark discussed, we expect that\ncustomer purchasing behavior during non-event periods will continue to be in decline across the industry.\nWe will continue to monitor customer buying behavior closely during this period before and after the\nholiday season and pivot accordingly. While we see a path to achieving the higher side of our net sales\nguidance and the higher side of our EPS guidance, consistent with last quarter, we anticipate the more\nlikely outcome is the lower side of both ranges, unless, as Mark pointed out, we have a record boot season\nand holiday to close out fiscal 2024.\nOur guidance assumes fourth quarter growth from Rogan's and Shoe Station new stores and a comparable\nstore sale decline led by Shoe Carnival brick-and-mortar stores, consistent with the low to mid-single-digit\ncomparable store sales decrease experienced in the quarter and year-to-date at the lower side of our\nguidance range. In Q4 2024, the loss of the 53rd week and the retail calendar shift will result in the loss of\napproximately $20 million in net sales compared to the prior year. We estimate the retail calendar shift\nand the loss of the 53rd week will be a headwind to EPS of approximately $0.10 in the fourth quarter\ncompared to the prior year fourth quarter when we earned EPS of $0.57.\nTo close, we delivered a profitable third quarter and EPS that was in line with the expectations set in our\nlast earnings call. We are very proud of the team and teamwork it took to achieve this for our\nshareholders. Achievement was driven by a very successful August back-to-school and overcoming\nsubsequent softness in market demand caused by 2 natural disasters that affected about half our stores\nand that changed the landscape of consumer spending, in addition to very warm weather that delayed\nour boot season. Lower boot sales were about half of our comparable store sales decline in the quarter.\nWe pivoted in the quarter to accelerated synergy capture and expense management to offset the slower-\nthan-expected September and October market conditions.\nWith respect to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024, we lowered our sales guidance given the\nSeptember and October market conditions and reiterated our EPS guidance. We now expect lower SG&A\nas a percent of net sales given synergy capture and Q3 expense management. And while our tax rate is\nhigher than last year, we are now anticipating it will be lower than originally expected. And we are excited\nabout our product assortment for holiday and our plans to drive traffic and profitability in the fourth\nquarter. Our strategy to drive long-term growth remains unchanged.\nCopyright© 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ32025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 21, 2024\nOur strong balance sheet and solid, steady cash flow put us in a great position to continue to fund internal\ngrowth, including our emerging rebanner strategy, to execute on desirable M&A opportunities, and most\nimportantly, the continued ability to deliver long-term shareholder return.\nThis concludes our financial review. Now we would like to open up the call for questions.\nCopyright© 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

FQ32025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 21, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mitch Kummetz with Seaport Research\nPartners.\nMitchel John Kummetz\nSeaport Research Partners\nCarl, congrats and best of luck to you. And unfortunately, I'm going to break your rule about one question\nand one follow-up. I've got maybe a handful here. So let me start just, Mark, on the hurricanes. Is there\nany way to quantify the sales impact from those 2 hurricanes? And I'm curious, have you seen any\nreplacement buying kick in of late as far as those impacted markets? That's my first question.\nMark J. Worden\nPresident, CEO & Director\nMitch, thanks for the question. When you look at the losses, I think Patrick summed it up well. About\nhalf of our loss came from that persistently warm weather and boot decline, with boots down over 35%,\nspecifically in the month of October. The other half, not all of it, but most of the other half would come\nfrom the hurricane disruption we had from about half of our fleet during the Hurricane Helene and Milton.\nSo roughly half and half.\nMitchel John Kummetz\nSeaport Research Partners\nAnd then how about replacement buying? Anything there? Are you seeing any benefit from that?\nMark J. Worden\nPresident, CEO & Director\nWe have not yet. We still believe as the weather turns cold, people will be rethinking about the lost boots,\nthe lost product that they suffered during some of these catastrophic storms in the South. So, we remain\noptimistic that once it gets colder and people really start to pivot from recovery mode, which they've been\nin for the last 6-8 weeks to starting to think about more joyful things, the holiday, time with families\ntogether. They'll start to think about repurchasing and things they need to do, whether they lost that dress\nshoe so they can go to a special Thanksgiving next week or holiday gifting. We think that is ahead of us,\nand we remain optimistic, as you could see in our guidance that a profitable quarter remains ahead of us.\nMitchel John Kummetz\nSeaport Research Partners\nAnd then on boots, obviously, a slow start as you've detailed. What is your expectation for the fourth\nquarter? And Carl, I'm curious, do you see any pent-up demand potentially benefiting you in the fourth\nquarter, just given the slow start? Or is that just lost business?\nCarl N. Scibetta\nSenior EVP & Chief Merchandising Officer\nMitch, we believe there's some pent-up demand that's going to come our way in the fourth quarter.\nHowever, we don't see any recovery from the lost business in Q3. And while we are planning Q4 in our\nguidance, we are still planning boots down and managing that boot inventory down in Q4, much less than\nwe did in Q3, but we do not see any recovery nor do we see boots turning positive in the quarter.\nMark J. Worden\nPresident, CEO & Director\nMitch to build on that real quick, we're only a couple of weeks in, so I can't share how the holiday is going\nto play out. But that persistent warm weather I spoke about, it continued to now. So, boots have not\nCopyright© 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11\nSHOE CARNIVAL, INC. FQ32025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 21, 2024\nstarted to turn to that positive place. We expect it coming. And while we're no weather forecasters, cold\nweather is coming. Winter is coming, and we do anticipate growth then. But as you all know; the highly\naccretive margin capture was not made in these early weeks. And so that's going to make it very unlikely\nit's a record boot season. It will be strong, but it's getting shorter by the week before it kicks in.\nMitchel John Kummetz\nSeaport Research Partners\nAnd it sounds like your boot inventory coming out of 3Q is in pretty good shape. And I'm guessing that\nas we're early in 4Q, you've been able to continue to work down those receipts as the weather hasn't\ncooperated.\nCarl N. Scibetta\nSenior EVP & Chief Merchandising Officer\nSure, Mitch. The team did a great job planning the boot season out, holding back on some Q4 receipts so\nthey can get a good glimpse at what was going to happen. That on top of the fact that our partners have\nreally come to the table and helped us. We believe we're going to be in great boot position coming out of\nthe quarter. And we're in a great boot position to take advantage of what's remaining in the season right\nnow. So very pleased with the way the team managed this. They did an outstanding job handling the boot\nseason this year.\nMitchel John Kummetz\nSeaport Research Partners\nAnd then a couple of last ones. Maybe sort of big picture on the sales guide. It looks like the low end of\nthe range is down $30 million, and that would seem to factor in 3Q coming in about $13 million below\nplan, which would suggest that maybe the fourth quarter is looking about $17 million worse than prior\nexpectations. First of all, I don't know if you want to confirm my math, but I guess more so, what's\nchanged in terms of your outlook for 4Q versus prior expectations? And how much of that is what you're\nseeing quarter-to-date with boots?\nMark J. Worden\nPresident, CEO & Director\nAs I said in my speech, we anticipate mid to low side of the guidance being likely. The big change, you've\ncharacterized it accurately. We're building into the lower side of the revenue forecast that persistently\nwarm weather has continued through today as we speak. And so, the boot season is getting shorter and\nshorter for positive impacts and revenue impacts. We've built that in to say it turns, but it hasn't turned\nyet. But I want to reiterate, if boots really kick in next week when the holiday season starts in earnest, the\nmid to upper side of our guide remains squarely in reach. And if we have a great holiday, we have great\nconfidence that we have in our sights the profit delivery.\nMitchel John Kummetz\nSeaport Research Partners\nAnd then, Mark, maybe lastly, on the rebannering. I know you're still super early in the process. But is\nthere anything that you're seeing now that you've moved outside of Alabama in terms of the performance\nof the rebannered stores, Alabama versus non-Alabama?\nMark J. Worden\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes. We are very excited about this for a long-term growth strategy. The first test, inclusive of the 10\nstores, it showed us explosive results in markets where the Shoe Station brand is known, and we were\noperating a Shoe Carnival, far stronger than plus 10% sales and profit. As we get further away and\nwe're building brand awareness, we're still seeing very strong results with over 10% sales and profit.\nBut now we're starting to enter new markets like the state of Tennessee. We're very excited. We've just\nrebannered 2 stores in the state of Tennessee and opened a new one and progressing in earnest in 2025\nwith rebannering in Tennessee. They're still showing promising results as well.\nCopyright© 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12\nSHOE CARNIVAL, INC. FQ32025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 21, 2024\nBut our expectation is as we get further and further away from the mothership of core Alabama, we get\ncloser and closer to our success criteria, which is in that plus 3% to 5% sales and profit range. We're still\ndoing better than that now. But as we branch further and further into those new states I mentioned, we\nwould anticipate things get incredibly profitable, strong leverage and a significant outperform compared\nto, say, the Shoe Carnival low to mid-single comp declines. We're flipping that dramatically. But I would\nset the stage as we're in these early learnings, the 3% to 5% range is probably a more likely anticipation.\nWe hope to beat it. A lot more to learn when we rebanner 25 more in all these new markets during Ql,\nbut it is a big winner so far.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Sam Poser with Williams Trading.\nSamuel Marc Poser\nWilliams Trading, LLC, Research Division\nI just want to verify one thing and then ask another question. Did you say on the prior earnings calls that\nRogan's was expected to $84 million. Has Rogan's guidance changed? Or are you wording it differently?\nMark J. Worden\nPresident, CEO & Director\nWe have said that. There's no change. It's still over 80. We still expect it to deliver that.\nSamuel Marc Poser\nWilliams Trading, LLC, Research Division\nAnd then your inventory levels are higher than I anticipated going into the quarter, taking Rogan’s into\naccount. When we get to the end of the year, what's it going to look like? And have any of the inventory\nreceipts or planned receipts going forward impacted by the potential for tariffs? And I also want to know\nwhat your thoughts are about tariffs within your mix and how you're thinking about that going into 2025?\nPatrick C. Edwards\nSenior VP, CFO, Secretary & Treasurer\nSam, it's Patrick. I'll take the first part of your question about our inventory balances, and then I'll pass it\noff to Carl to talk about tariffs. Our inventory balance, we expect it's -- right now, it's 3% down on a unit\nbasis, 1% down on a dollar basis. We do see currently reductions in that by the time we get to the end\nof the year. But that balance reduction won't be as great as previously disclosed. This rebanner strategy\nthat we're very excited about requires us to carry a little bit more inventory and investing in those hot\nbrands that Shoe Station sells and having them ready for rebannering these 25 stores in the first quarter\nrequires us to carry a little bit more inventory at year-end.\nCarl N. Scibetta\nSenior EVP & Chief Merchandising Officer\nSam, on the tariff front, seems to be the topic of conversation with every vendor appointment we have.\nWe're watching it closely. We direct import ourselves a very small percentage of our own inventory. So,\nwe'll see how that gets affected and how the vendors, if indeed the tariffs come across at whatever they\ncome, we'll have to be very careful about pricing to our consumer and certainly look at where products are\nbeing made and how we can best provide the value that our consumers are used to at this point. But at\nthis point, we're like everybody else, we're watching it very carefully, and we will adjust where we need to,\nbut most importantly, continue to deliver value to our customers.\nSamuel Marc Poser\nWilliams Trading, LLC, Research Division\nWhat percent exposure of your purchases or sales, however you want to talk about it, do you have to\nChina right now?\nCopyright© 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

Scibetta\nSenior EVP & Chief Merchandising Officer\nThe percentage of our own imports from China-\nSamuel Marc Poser\nWilliams Trading, LLC, Research Division\nI'm talking about total, like from the brand.\nCarl N. Scibetta\nSenior EVP & Chief Merchandising Officer\nSam, I don't have that number. I would say it's less than 50% because the majority of the athletic product\nis coming out of countries other than China. And I would say on the non-athletic side, it's probably 60-40 in\nChina. But as you put it all together, it will be less than 50%.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Jim Chartier with Monness Crespi Hardt.\nJames Andrew Chartier\nMonness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division\nSo, it looks like SG&A is coming down about $5 million from where I had it previously. In addition to the\nRogan’s synergies and some advertising savings, what are the other key components of that?\nPatrick C. Edwards\nSenior VP, CFO, Secretary & Treasurer\nJim, it's Patrick Edwards. You're spot on with the synergy concepts and you're spot on, on the digital-first\nmarketing strategy, the flexibility that it brings. Those are the 2 and really only variables that we were\nable to press on in the quarter in order to do that expense management, synergy capture to bring our\nEPS in line with our expectations.\nJames Andrew Chartier\nMonness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division\nAnd that's the same component for fourth quarter. Any SG&A savings in fourth quarter would be those 2\ncomponents as well?\nPatrick C. Edwards\nSenior VP, CFO, Secretary & Treasurer\nSure, Jim. In the fourth quarter, obviously, there's a wide range on sales, plus or minus $30 million, I\nbelieve. So, we are able to manage those 2 levers reasonably well, especially the advertising spend. When\ndemand is there, we're going to ramp that up. And if we see weak demand during non-event periods, like\nwe did this quarter, we'll be less in the market with our advertising.\nJames Andrew Chartier\nMonness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division\nAnd then in terms of the rebanner opportunity, how many stores fit the Shoe Station profile from a\ndemographic and store size standpoint?\nMark J. Worden\nPresident, CEO & Director\nJim, it's Mark. We don't know how wide the legs to the strategy go yet. We know it's resonating across\nthe South, and now we're going to push that limit further into these new states further and further where\nthe brand is not known. The next 25 stores that we complete in the first half of next year are going to\nhelp us answer that question. I can give you one thing. We're very confident that we're going to have\nover 100 Shoe Station stores near term and ahead of what we previously disclosed as a 2028 objective.\nCopyright© 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 14\nSHOE CARNIVAL, INC. FQ32025 EARNINGS CALL NOV 21, 2024\nThe rebannering is rapidly accelerating that expectation. And as we get into guidance next year, we'll be\nable to be far more explicit when we get into these new states. But we see the opportunity is significant.\nWe see the opportunity has potential to go beyond just Alabama and Mississippi profitably. And we're\ngoing to learn by early next year if this thing has legs to go beyond those core markets into new places\nlike Kentucky, the Carolinas, Atlanta and even further beyond that. We don't have those answers yet, but\nwe're excited with what it is delivering so far.\nOperator\nAt this time, there are no other questions. So, I will hand the call back over to Steve Alexander for closing\nremarks.\nSteve R. Alexander\nInvestor Relations\nThanks for joining the call today. We're available all day if you have any follow-up questions, and I'd like to\nquickly hand it over to Mark as well.\nMark J. Worden\nPresident, CEO & Director\nAs we wrap up 2024, I just want to take a moment to wish all of you, your families a happy holiday. I\nhope you have a safe and enjoyable time ahead. And we thank you so much for your time spent getting\nto know Shoe Carnival, spending time with us in person, in NDRs, on the road or wherever we may have\njoined you. Best wishes from Shoe Carnival to all of you.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.
