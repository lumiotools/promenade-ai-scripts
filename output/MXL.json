All forward-looking statements are based on the\nestimates, projections and assumptions of management as of October 23, 2024, and\nMaxLinear is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any such obligation) to update or\nrevise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events,\nor otherwise.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented on a basis\nconsistent with GAAP, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-\nGAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses as a\npercentage of net revenue, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, non-GAAP income\n(loss) from operations as percentage of revenue, non-GAAP interest and other income\n(expense), non-GAAP diluted earnings (loss) per share, and non-GAAP diluted share count.\nThese supplemental measures exclude the effects of (i) stock-based compensation\nexpense; (ii) accruals related to our performance-based bonus plan for 2024, which we\nintend to settle in shares of our common stock; (iii) accruals related to our performance-\nbased bonus plan for 2023, which we settled in shares of common stock in February 2024;\n(iv) amortization of purchased intangible assets; (v) research and development funded by\nothers; (vi) acquisition and integration costs related to our acquisitions, including costs\nincurred related to the termination of the previously pending (now terminated) merger with\nSilicon Motion; (vii) impairment of intangible assets; (viii) severance and other restructuring\ncharges; (ix) other non-recurring interest and other income (expenses), net attributable to\nacquisitions, including impairment of investments in a privately held entity and ticking fees\npaid to lenders in August 2023 following the termination of the previously pending (now\nterminated) merger with Silicon Motion; and (x) non-cash income tax benefits and expenses.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute\nfor the comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to\nlimitations, and should be read only in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have\nany standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures presented by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have\nlimitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our GAAP results of\noperations. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying\nupon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of our performance.\nWe believe that non-GAAP financial measures can provide useful information to both\nmanagement and investors by excluding certain non-cash and other one-time expenses that\nwe believe are not indicative of our core operating results. Among other uses, our\nmanagement uses non-GAAP measures to compare our performance relative to forecasts\nand strategic plans and to benchmark our performance externally against competitors. In\naddition, management’s incentive compensation will be determined in part using these non-\nGAAP measures because we believe non-GAAP measures better reflect our core operating\nperformance.\nThe following are explanations of each type of adjustment that we incorporate into non-\nGAAP financial measures:\nStock-based compensation expense relates to equity incentive awards granted to our\nemployees, directors, and consultants. Our equity incentive plans are important components\nof our employee incentive compensation arrangements and are reflected as expenses in our\nGAAP results. Stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be a\nsignificant recurring expense for MaxLinear. While we include the dilutive impact of equity\nawards in weighted average shares outstanding, the expense associated with stock-based\nawards reflects a non-cash charge that we exclude from non-GAAP net income or loss.\nPerformance-based equity consists of accruals related to our executive and non-executive\nbonus programs, and have been excluded from our non-GAAP net income or loss for all\nperiods reported. Bonus payments for the 2023 performance periods were settled through\nthe issuance of shares of common stock under our equity incentive plans in February 2024.\nWe currently expect that bonus awards under our fiscal 2024 program will be settled in\ncommon stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nExpenses incurred in relation to acquisitions include amortization of purchased intangible\nassets, acquisition and integration costs primarily consisting of professional and consulting\nfees, including costs incurred related to the termination of the previously pending (now\nterminated) merger with Silicon Motion; ticking fees paid to lenders following the termination\nof such merger which were recorded in other expense; and accretion of discount on\ncontingent consideration to interest expense.\nResearch and development funded by others represents proceeds received under contracts\nfor jointly funded R&D projects to develop technology that may be commercialized into a\nproduct in the future. Initially such proceeds may not yet be recognized in GAAP results if,\npursuant to contract terms, the Company may be required to repay all or a portion of the\nfunds provided by the other party under certain conditions. Management believes it is not\nprobable that it will trigger such conditions. Once such conditions have been resolved, the\nproceeds are recognized in GAAP results, and accordingly, reversed from non-GAAP\nresults.\nImpairment losses are related to abandonment of acquired or purchased intangible assets.\nRestructuring charges incurred are related to our restructuring plans which eliminate\nredundancies and primarily include severance and restructuring costs related to impairment\nof leased right-of-use assets or from exiting certain facilities.\nOther expense also includes losses from impairment of privately held investments.\nIncome tax benefits and expense adjustments are those that do not affect cash income\ntaxes payable.\nReconciliations of non-GAAP measures for the historic periods disclosed in this press\nrelease appear below. Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with our ability to\nproject future charges, we are also unable to predict their probable significance, particularly\nrelated to stock-based compensation and its related tax effects as well as potential\nimpairments, a quantitative reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts and\naccordingly, in reliance on the exception provided by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K,\nwe have not provided a reconciliation for non-GAAP guidance provided for the fourth quarter\n2024.\nAbout MaxLinear, Inc.\nMaxLinear, Inc.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nDescription of Business\n\nMaxLinear, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in September 2003. MaxLinear, Inc., together with its directly and indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to as MaxLinear, or the Company, is a provider of communications systems-on-chip, or SoC, solutions used in broadband, mobile and wireline infrastructure, data center, and industrial and multi-market applications. MaxLinear is a fabless integrated circuit design company whose products integrate all or substantial portions of a high-speed communication system, including radio frequency, or RF, high-performance analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, security engines, data compression and networking layers, and power management. MaxLinear’s customers primarily include electronics distributors, module makers, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and original design manufacturers, or ODMs, who incorporate the Company’s products in a wide range of electronic devices. Examples of such devices include broadband modems compliant with Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications, or DOCSIS, Passive Optical Network, or PON, and DSL; Wi-Fi and wireline routers for home networking; radio transceivers and modems for 4G/5G base-station and backhaul infrastructure; optical transceivers targeting hyperscale data centers; as well as power management and interface products used in these and many other markets.\n\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MaxLinear, Inc. and its directly and indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. All intercompany transactions and investments have been eliminated in consolidation. \n\nIn the opinion of management, the Company’s unaudited consolidated interim financial statements contain adjustments, including normal recurring accruals necessary to present fairly the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows. \n\nThe consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements at that date. The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on January 31, 2024, or the Annual Report. Interim results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\n\nThe functional currency of certain foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date and historical rates for equity. Revenue and expense components are translated at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are included as a component of stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations, and to date, have not been material.\n\nUse of Estimates and Significant Risks and Uncertainties\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or adjustments to the carrying value of its assets and liabilities as of October 23, 2024, the issuance date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for its acquisitions. It requires the Company to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the acquisition date fair values of the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, its estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nCosts to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or the Company’s internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. \n\nFor a given acquisition, the Company may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend its review, evaluation, and adjustment of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether the Company includes these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. A pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) is only recognized as an asset or a liability if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period, changes in estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.\n\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed, if any, in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. The Company re-evaluates these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to the preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the end of the measurement period or final determination of the estimated value of the tax allowance or contingency, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect the income tax provision (benefit) in the consolidated statements of operations and could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position.\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nThe Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates market value.\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nThe Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and assesses each customer’s credit worthiness. The Company monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is based upon applying an expected credit loss rate to receivables based on the historical loss rate from similar high risk customers adjusted for current conditions, including any specific customer collection issues identified, and forecasts of economic conditions. Delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is remote.\n\nInventory\n\nThe Company assesses the recoverability of its inventory based on assumptions about demand and market conditions. Forecasted demand is determined based on historical sales and expected future sales. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or \n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nnet realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis and net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company reduces its inventory to the lower of its cost or net realizable value on a part-by-part basis to account for obsolescence or lack of marketability. Reductions are calculated as the difference between the cost of inventory and its net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand, market conditions and costs. Once established, these adjustments are considered permanent and are not revised until the related inventory is sold or disposed of.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and compensation are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature of these accounts.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from three to five years, using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term.\n\nProduction Masks\n\nProduction masks with alternative future uses or discernible future benefits are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years. To determine if a production mask has alternative future uses or benefits, the Company evaluates risks associated with developing new technologies and capabilities, and the related risks associated with entering new markets. Production masks that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as research and development costs.\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the acquisition method. Intangible assets represent purchased intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&D, technologies acquired or licensed from other companies, customer relationships, non-compete covenants, backlog, and trademarks and tradenames. Purchased finite-lived intangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Technologies acquired or licensed from other companies, customer relationships, non-compete covenants, backlog, and trademarks and tradenames are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the terms of the agreement, or estimated useful life. The Company capitalizes IPR&D projects acquired as part of a business combination. On completion of each project, IPR&D assets are reclassified to developed technology and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment using either a qualitative assessment, and/or quantitative assessment, which is based on comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recorded. The Company tests by reporting unit, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of October 31 each year or more frequently if it believes indicators of impairment exist.\n\nThe Company reviews indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment using a qualitative assessment, followed by a quantitative assessment, as needed, each year as of October 31, the date of its annual goodwill impairment review, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. In certain cases, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method when appropriate, and a fair value will be obtained based on analysis over the costs saved by owning the right instead of leasing it. \n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nDuring development, IPR&D is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Once an IPR&D project is complete, it becomes a finite-lived intangible asset and is evaluated for impairment both immediately prior to its change in classification and thereafter in accordance with the Company’s policy for long-lived assets.\n\nThe Company regularly reviews the carrying amount of its long-lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization, as well as the useful lives, to determine whether indicators of impairment may exist which warrant adjustments to carrying values or estimated useful lives. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Should impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset’s fair value.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company’s revenue is generated from sales of the Company’s integrated circuits and intellectual property, typically under individual customer purchase orders, some of which have underlying master sales agreements that specify terms governing the product or intellectual property sales. The Company recognizes such revenue at the point in time when control of the products or intellectual property is transferred to the customer at the estimated net consideration for which collection is probable, taking into account the customer’s rights to price protection, other pricing credits, unit rebates, and rights to return unsold product. Transfer of control occurs either when products are shipped to or received by the distributor or direct customer, based on the terms of the specific agreement with the customer, if the Company has a present right to payment and transfer of legal title and the risks and rewards of ownership to the customer has occurred. For most of the Company’s product sales, transfer of control occurs upon shipment to the distributor or direct customer. Under certain intellectual property sale agreements, we are entitled to fixed upfront consideration upon sale and variable consideration in the form of a portion of revenue generated by the recipient from the intellectual property. Fixed consideration is recognized when control of the functional intellectual property transfers; variable consideration may be constrained but is continuously monitored and recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company recognized a material amount of variable consideration during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as uncertainties related to such consideration were resolved. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was no variable consideration recognized related to resolution of uncertainties related to such consideration.\n\nIn assessing whether collection of consideration from a customer is probable, the Company considers the customer’s ability and intention to pay that amount of consideration when it is due. Payment of invoices is due as specified in the underlying customer agreement, typically 30 days from the invoice date, which occurs on the date of transfer of control of the products to the customer. Since payment terms are less than a year, the Company has elected the practical expedient and does not assess whether a customer contract has a significant financing component.\n\nA five-step approach is applied in the recognition of revenue: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Customer purchase orders plus the underlying master sales agreements are considered to be contracts with the customer for purposes of applying the five-step approach.\n\nPricing adjustments and estimates of returns under contractual stock rotation rights are treated as variable consideration for purposes of determining the transaction price, and are estimated at the time control transfers using the expected value method based on the Company’s analysis of actual price adjustment claims by distributors and historical product return rates, and then reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company also considers whether any variable consideration is constrained, since such amounts for which it is probable that a significant reversal will occur when the contingency is subsequently resolved are required to be excluded from revenues. Price adjustments are finalized at the time the products are sold through to the end customer and the distributor or end customer submits a claim to reduce the sale price to a pre-approved net price. Stock rotation allowances are capped at a fixed percentage of the Company’s sales to a distributor for a period of time, up to six months, as specified in the individual distributor contract. If the Company’s current estimates of such credits and rights are materially inaccurate, it may result in adjustments that affect future revenues and gross profits. Returns under the Company’s general assurance warranty of products for a period of one to three years have not been material and warranty-related services are not considered a separate performance obligation under the customer contracts. Most of the Company’s customers resell the Company’s product as part of their product and thus are tax-exempt; however, to the extent the Company \n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \ncollects and remits taxes on product sales from customers, it has elected to exclude from the measurement of transaction price such taxes.\n\nEach distinct promise to transfer products is considered to be an identified performance obligation for which revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the products to the customer. Although customers may place orders for products to be delivered on multiple dates that may be in different quarterly reporting periods, all of the orders are scheduled within one year from the order date. The Company has elected to record sales commissions when incurred, as the period over which the sales commission asset that would have been recognized is less than one year.\n\nCustomer contract liabilities consist primarily of obligations to deliver rebates to customers in the form of units of products which are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Other obligations to customers, which are included in accrued price protection liability in the consolidated balance sheets, consist of estimates of price protection rights offered to the Company’s end customer on products sold by the Company to the end customer’s contract manufacturer at a standard price that are later incorporated into the end customers’ product. The Company’s price adjustments included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities are discounts and rebates expected to be claimed by the Company’s distributors upon sell-through of the products to their customers, which are initially sold by the Company to the distributors at a standard price. Also included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities are amounts expected to be returned by distributors under stock rotation rights. The Company also records a right of return asset, consisting of amounts representing the products the Company expects to receive from customers in returns, which is included in inventory in the consolidated balance sheets, and is typically settled within six months of transfer of control to the customer, or the period over which stock rotation rights are based. Upon lapse of the time period for stock rotations, or the contractual end to price protection and rebate programs, which is approximately one to two years, and when the Company believes unclaimed amounts are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid, any remaining asset or liability is derecognized by an offsetting entry to cost of net revenue and net revenue. For additional disclosures regarding contract liabilities and other obligations to customers, see Note 12.\n\nThe Company assesses customer accounts receivable and contract assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 310-10-35.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe Company generally provides a warranty on its products for a period of one to three years. The Company makes estimates of product return rates and expected costs to replace the products under warranty at the time revenue is recognized based on historical warranty experience and any known product warranty issues. If actual return rates and/or replacement costs differ significantly from these estimates, adjustments to recognize additional warranty expenses in cost of net revenue may be required in future periods.\n\nSegment Information\n\nThe Company operates under one segment as it has developed, marketed and sold primarily only one class of similar products, radio-frequency, high-performance analog and mixed-signal communications system-on-chip solutions for the connected home, wired and wireless infrastructure markets and industrial and multi-market applications.\n\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. The Company has one business activity and there are no segment managers who are held accountable for operations, operating results and plans for products or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, the Company reports under a single operating segment.\n\n14\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nStock-based Compensation \n\nThe Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity incentive awards, including restricted stock units, employee stock purchase rights and stock options based on the grant date fair value of the award. The Company calculates the fair value of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense is then determined based on the number of restricted stock units that are expected to vest; for performance-based restricted stock units, this is the number of units that are expected to vest during the performance period if it is probable that the Company will achieve the performance metrics specified in the underlying award agreement. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase rights granted to employees. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, which is usually the vesting period. The Company recognizes compensation expense over the vesting period using the straight-line method and classifies these amounts in the consolidated statements of operations based on the department to which the related employee reports.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the development of the Company’s technology and future products are charged to research and development expense as incurred. From time to time, the Company enters into contracts for jointly funded research and development projects to develop technology that may be commercialized into a product in the future. The Company also obtains research and development funding grants from governments in certain jurisdictions in which it operates.Both of these types of income are reflected as a credit to research and development expense when such income has been earned and any contingencies associated with retaining such income have been resolved. In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized aggregate income from jointly funded R&D projects and government grants of approximately $0.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized aggregate income from jointly funded R&D projects and government grants of approximately $3.1 million and $11.3 million, respectively. While the Company retains ownership and rights to the underlying technology developed under the joint development projects, the Company may be required to repay all or a portion of the funds provided by the other parties under certain conditions, and defers such funds as liabilities until the repayment conditions have been resolved (Note 15).\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company’s leases primarily consist of facility leases which are classified as operating leases. The Company assesses whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. The Company recognizes a lease liability to make contractual payments under all leases with terms greater than twelve months and a corresponding right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term using the collateralized incremental borrowing rate when the implicit rate is unknown. Options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such an option. The right-of-use asset is initially measured as the contractual lease liability plus any initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments made, less any lease incentives. Upon adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the carrying value of lease-related restructuring liabilities for certain restructured leases existing at that date was offset against the related right-of-use assets. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nUpon adoption of ASC 842, the Company elected certain practical expedients and accordingly has (1) carried forward its prior assessments of (a) whether existing contracts on the January 1, 2019 adoption date contain leases, (b) classification of leases as operating or financing and (c) initial direct costs for existing leases and (2) considered hindsight in determining the lease term and assessing impairment of the right-of-use-asset. In addition, the Company used a portfolio approach for its facility leases when making judgments and estimates, such as the discount rate. \n\nLeased right-of-use assets are subject to impairment testing as a long-lived asset at the asset-group level. The Company monitors its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. As the Company’s leased right-of-use assets primarily relate to facility leases, early abandonment of all or part of a facility as part of a restructuring plan is typically an indicator of impairment. If impairment indicators are present, the Company tests whether the carrying amount of the leased right-of-use \n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nasset is recoverable including consideration of sublease income, and if not recoverable, measures impairment loss for the right-of-use asset or asset group.\n\nPension and Other Defined Benefit Retirement Obligations\n\nThe costs of pension and certain other defined benefit employee retirement benefits are required to be recognized based upon actuarial valuations. The related net retirement benefit obligation is recognized as the excess of the projected benefit obligation over the fair value of the plan assets. In measuring the retirement benefit obligation, the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and long-term rate of salary increase are the most significant assumptions. Retirement benefit costs primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the retirement benefit obligation.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes are presented net as noncurrent. The provision for income taxes generally represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from the differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when a judgment is made that is considered more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. A decision to record a valuation allowance results in an increase in income tax expense or a decrease in income tax benefit. If the valuation allowance is released in a future period, income tax expense will be reduced accordingly.\n\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. The impact of an uncertain income tax position is recognized at the largest amount that is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\n\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company continually assesses the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was enacted into U.S. tax law. In 2018, the Company made an accounting policy election to treat Global Intangible Low Taxed Income in accordance with the Tax Act as a period cost.\n\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nComprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business entity during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes certain changes in equity that are excluded from net income (loss), net of tax, such as foreign currency translation gains and losses and changes in fair value of projected benefit obligations for defined benefit plans.\n\nLitigation and Settlement Costs\n\nLegal costs are expensed as incurred. The Company is involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions in the ordinary course of business. The Company continually evaluates uncertainties associated with litigation and records a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nRecently Issued, Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-02, Codification Improvements - Amendments to Remove References to the Concepts Statements to remove various references to concepts statements from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This guidance is to clarify guidance, simplify wording or structure of guidance, and other minor improvements. These amendments are effective for the Company for annual periods in 2025, applied prospectively, with early adoption and retrospective application permitted. The Company intends to adopt the amendments in this update prospectively in 2025. The impact of the adoption of the amendments in this update is not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards, to clarify whether profits interest and similar awards should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The guidance applies to all business entities that issue profits interest awards as compensation to employees or nonemployees in exchange for goods or services. These amendments are effective for the Company for annual and interim periods in 2025, applied prospectively, with early adoption and retrospective application permitted. As the Company does not issue profit interest awards, the impact of the adoption of the amendments in this update is not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, to require enhanced income tax disclosures to provide information to assess how an entity’s operations and related tax risks, tax planning, and operational opportunities affect its tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. The amendments in this update provide that a business entity disclose (1) a tabular income tax rate reconciliation, using both percentages and amounts, (2) separate disclosure of any individual reconciling items that are equal to or greater than 5% of the amount computed by multiplying the income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes by the applicable statutory income tax rate, and disaggregation of certain items that are significant and (3) amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, including separate disclosure of any individual jurisdictions greater than 5% of total income taxes paid. These amendments are effective for the Company for annual periods in 2025, applied prospectively, with early adoption and retrospective application permitted. The Company intends to adopt the amendments in this update prospectively in 2025. The impact of the adoption of the amendments in this update is not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations, since the amendments require only enhancement of existing income tax disclosures in the footnotes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, to require enhanced disclosures that include reportable segment expenses. The amendments in this update provide that a business entity disclose significant segment expenses, segment profit or loss (after significant segment expenses), and allows reporting of additional measures of a segments profit or loss if used in assessing segment performance. Such disclosures apply to entities with a single reportable segment. These amendments are effective for the Company for annual periods in 2024 and interim periods in 2025, retrospectively to all prior periods using the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The impact of the adoption of the amendments in this update is not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations, since the requirements impact only segment reporting disclosures in the footnotes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\n2. Net Income (Loss) Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share, or EPS, is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and the weighted-average number of dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method. For purposes of this calculation, stock options and restricted stock units are considered to be common stock equivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted EPS when their effect is dilutive.

Business Combinations\n\nTerminated Silicon Motion Merger\n\nOn May 5, 2022, MaxLinear entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Silicon Motion Technology Corporation, or Silicon Motion, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, MaxLinear agreed to acquire Silicon Motion pursuant to a statutory merger, under the laws of the Cayman Islands, of Shark Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MaxLinear, with and into Silicon Motion, with Silicon Motion surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of MaxLinear. Silicon Motion is a provider of NAND flash controllers for solid state drives, or SSDs, and other solid state storage devices.\n\nOn July 26, 2023,MaxLinear terminated the Merger Agreement and notified Silicon Motion that MaxLinear was relieved of its obligations to close because, among other reasons, (i) certain conditions to closing set forth in the Merger Agreement were not satisfied and were incapable of being satisfied, (ii) Silicon Motion had suffered a Material Adverse Effect that was continuing, (iii) Silicon Motion was in material breach of representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in the Merger Agreement that gave rise to the right of the Company to terminate, and (iv) in any event, the First Extended Outside Date had passed and was not automatically extended because certain conditions in Article 6 of the Merger Agreement were not satisfied or waived as of May 5, 2023. For these same reasons, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, MaxLinear was not required to pay a break-up fee or other fee to Silicon Motion as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement. Undefined capitalized terms in this paragraph have the same meaning as in the Merger Agreement. On August 16, 2023, Silicon Motion delivered to MaxLinear a notice, which Silicon Motion publicly disclosed, that it was purporting to terminate the Merger Agreement and that Silicon Motion would be commencing an arbitration to seek damages from MaxLinear arising from MaxLinear's alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement.\n\nOn October 5, 2023, Silicon Motion filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre alleging that MaxLinear breached the Merger Agreement. See Note 15 for more information on legal matters related to the termination of the Merger Agreement.\n\nThe second amended and restated commitment letter dated October 24, 2022 with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., or Wells Fargo Bank, and other lenders, and related financing commitments for the previously pending (now terminated) merger were also terminated upon termination of the Merger Agreement. As a result of the termination of the financing, in August 2023, the Company was required to pay to Wells Fargo Bank a ticking fee of $18.3 million.\n\n18\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nAcquisition of Company Y\n\nOn January 17, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of a business, or Company Y, pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement. The transaction consideration included $9.8 million in cash. In addition, Company Y stockholders are eligible to receive up to $2.6 million in consideration due to the acquired business satisfying certain personnel objectives by June 17, 2024.\n\nCompany Y is headquartered in Bangalore, India and operates as a provider of engineering design services.\n\nAcquisition Consideration\n\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of purchase price consideration to acquire Company Y (in thousands):\n\nDescription| Amount  \n---|---  \nFair value of purchase consideration:  \nCash| $| 9,824  \nContingent consideration(1)| 2,600  \nTotal purchase price| $| 12,424  \n_________________\n\n(1) The fair value of contingent consideration is based on applying the Monte Carlo simulation method to forecast achievement under various contingent consideration events which may result in up to $2.6 million in payments due to the acquired business’s satisfying certain financial and personnel objectives by June 17, 2024 under the Purchase Agreement. Key inputs in the valuation include forecasted revenue, revenue volatility and discount rate. Underlying forecast mathematics were based on Geometric Brownian Motion in a risk-neutral framework and discounted back to the applicable period in which the accumulative thresholds were achieved at discount rates commensurate with the risk and expected payout term of the contingent consideration.\n\nPurchase Price Allocation\n\nThe final allocation of purchase price as of the January 17, 2023 acquisition closing date based upon an estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by the Company in the acquisition primarily includes $2.0 million in net operating liabilities, with $11.8 million in goodwill.\n\nAssumptions in the Allocations of Purchase Price\n\nManagement prepared the purchase price allocations for Company Y and in doing so considered or relied in part upon reports of a third party valuation expert to calculate the fair value of certain acquired assets, which primarily included an acquired workforce and contingent consideration. Certain stockholders that are employees of Company Y were not required to remain employed in order to receive the contingent consideration; accordingly, the fair value of the contingent consideration was accounted for as a portion of the purchase consideration.\n\nEstimates of fair value require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to the acquired workforce. Certain liabilities included in the purchase price allocations are based on management’s best estimates of the amounts to be paid or settled and based on information available at the time the purchase price allocations were prepared. \n\nGoodwill recorded in connection with Company Y was $11.8 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company does not expect to deduct any of the acquired goodwill for tax purposes.\n\n19\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \n4. Restructuring Activity\n\nFrom time to time, the Company approves and implements restructuring plans as a result of internal resource alignment and cost saving measures. Such restructuring plans may include terminating employees, vacating certain leased facilities, and cancellation of contracts. \n\nRestructuring costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included costs pertaining to restructuring plans initiated in 2023 and 2024 as described below.\n\nIn July 2024, the Company initiated a reduction of its workforce, or the 2024 Workforce Reduction. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred $26.8 million in restructuring costs pertaining to the 2024 Workforce Reduction, which included $17.0 million in charges under contracts associated with cancelled projects and related impairment of assets, $9.1 million in severance costs and related expenses, and $0.7 million from exiting facilities. \n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into restructuring plans to reduce its workforce, or the 2023 Workforce Reductions. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed notification to remaining affected employees of the 2023 Workforce Reductions, and incurred $23.5 million in restructuring costs, including $19.8 million in severance and related costs, or a cumulative total of $43.3 million pertaining to the 2023 Workforce Reductions. Substantially all of the severance and related costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the 2023 Workforce Reductions pertained to statutory severance benefits in the jurisdictions in which the terminated employees were employed.\n\nThe Company expects to incur additional restructuring costs associated with the 2023 Workforce Reductions and 2024 Workforce Reduction of approximately $3.0 million to $5.0 million, which is expected to pertain to severance due to statutory requirements in the jurisdictions in which the terminated employees were employed, as well as exiting facilities. The Company expects to complete notifications to employees regarding the 2024 Workforce Reduction and finalize its plans to exit facilities by the end of 2024. The estimate of costs that the Company expects to incur, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results may differ. The Company may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the 2023 Workforce Reductions and 2024 Workforce Reduction. \n\nAll statements other than statements of historical facts contained in the paragraphs above are forward-looking statements including statements relating to the Company’s plans, expectations, forecasts and future events. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the potential of, and expectations regarding the Company’s statements relating to the expected impacts, charges and costs associated with the 2023 Workforce Reductions and 2024 Workforce Reduction that the Company expects to incur.\n\nThe following table presents the activity related to the restructuring plans, which is included in restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of operations:Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nEmployee separation expenses| $| 9,109 | $| (13)| $| 28,902 | $| 8,863  \nLease related charges| 674 | — | 3,628 | 42  \nOther| 17,045 | 67 | 17,793 | 233  \n$| 26,828 | $| 54 | $| 50,323 | $| 9,138  \n  \n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table presents a roll-forward of the Company’s restructuring liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill\n\nGoodwill arises from the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired. The fair values of net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired are based upon preliminary valuations and the Company’s estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (potentially up to one year from the acquisition date). \n\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the periods indicated:Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nBeginning balance| $| 318,588 | $| 306,739  \nAcquisitions (Note 3)| — | 11,717  \nEnding balance| $| 318,588 | $| 318,456  \n  \nThe Company performs an annual goodwill impairment assessment on October 31st each year, using a quantitative assessment comparing the fair value of each reporting unit, which the Company has determined to be the entity itself, with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded. As a result of the Company’s impairment assessment, no goodwill impairment was recognized as of October 31, 2023.\n\nIn addition to its annual review, the Company performs a test of impairment when indicators of impairment are present. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no indications of impairment of the Company’s goodwill balances. \n\nAcquired Intangibles\n\nFinite-lived Intangible Assets\n\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s finite-lived intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions and other purchases, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives:September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nWeightedAverageUseful Life(in Years)| Gross Carrying Amount| Accumulated Amortization| Net Carrying Amount| Gross Carrying Amount| Accumulated Amortization| Net Carrying Amount  \n(in thousands)  \nLicensed technology| 7.0| $| 23,857 | $| (2,172)| $| 21,685 | $| 20,133 | $| (1,431)| $| 18,702  \nDeveloped technology| 6.9| 311,261 | (280,443)| 30,818 | 311,261 | (263,635)| 47,626  \nTrademarks and trade names| 6.2| 14,800 | (14,383)| 417 | 14,800 | (14,276)| 524  \nCustomer relationships| 5.0| 128,800 | (127,502)| 1,298 | 128,800 | (126,347)| 2,453  \nPatents| 7.0| 4,780 | (967)| 3,813 | 4,780 | (455)| 4,325  \n6.1| $| 483,498 | $| (425,467)| $| 58,031 | $| 479,774 | $| (406,144)| $| 73,630  \n  \n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nThe following table sets forth amortization expense associated with finite-lived intangible assets, which is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows:Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)| (in thousands)  \nCost of net revenue| $| 3,745 | $| 8,581 | $| 17,549 | $| 27,372  \nResearch and development| — | — | — | 2  \nSelling, general and administrative| 591 | 653 | 1,774 | 2,290  \n$| 4,336 | $| 9,234 | $| 19,323 | $| 29,664  \n  \nAmortization of finite-lived intangible assets in cost of net revenue in the consolidated statements of operations results primarily from acquired developed technology.\n\nThe following table sets forth the activity related to finite-lived intangible assets:Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nBeginning balance| $| 73,630 | $| 109,316  \nAdditions| 4,961 | 6,198  \nOther disposals| — | (769)  \nAmortization| (19,323)| (29,664)  \nImpairment losses| (1,237)| (2,438)  \nEnding balance| $| 58,031 | $| 82,643  \n  \nThe Company regularly reviews the carrying amount of its long-lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization, as well as the related useful lives, to determine whether indicators of impairment may exist that warrant adjustments to carrying values or estimated useful lives. An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Should impairment exist, the impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset’s fair value. During each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, impairment losses related to finite-lived intangible assets of $1.2 million were recognized. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, impairment losses related to finite-lived intangible assets of $0 and $2.4 million were recognized, respectively. The impairment losses were attributable to abandonment of certain purchased licensed technology. \n\nThe following table presents future amortization of the Company’s finite-lived intangible assets at September 30, 2024:Amount  \n---  \n(in thousands)  \n2024 (3 months)| $| 3,992  \n2025| 14,619  \n2026| 13,916  \n2027| 10,437  \n2028| 5,099  \nThereafter| 9,968  \nTotal| $| 58,031  \n  \n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \n6.

The levels are described below:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available.\n\nThe Company classifies its financial instruments that are categorized within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy on the basis of valuations using quoted market prices or alternate pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs, respectively. \n\nThe contingent consideration liability as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is associated with the Company’s acquisition of Company Y in January 2023 (Note 3). The contingent consideration liability is classified as a Level 3 financial instrument. The contingent consideration as it relates to Company Y was subject to the acquired business’s satisfaction of certain personnel objectives by June 17, 2024. The fair value of contingent consideration is based on (1) applying the Monte Carlo simulation method, with underlying forecast mathematics based on Geometric Brownian motion in a risk-neutral framework, to forecast achievement of the acquired business’ financial objectives, if applicable, under various possible contingent consideration events and (2) a probability based methodology using management’s inputs and assumptions to forecast achievement of the acquired business’ personnel objectives which included an assumption of total payments up to $2.6 million to Company Y. Key inputs in the valuation include forecasted revenue, revenue volatility, discount rate and discount term as it relates to the financial objectives and probability of achievement, discount term and discount rate as it relates to the personnel objectives. \n\nFair Value Measurements at September 30, 2024  \n---  \nBalance at September 30, 2024| Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1)| SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2)| SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3)  \n(in thousands)  \nLiabilities  \nContingent consideration| $| 2,600 | $| — | $| — | $| 2,600  \n  \nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023  \n---  \nBalance at December 31, 2023| Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdentical Assets(Level 1)| SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2)| SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3)  \n(in thousands)  \nLiabilities  \nContingent consideration| $| 2,462 | $| — | $| — | $| 2,462  \n  \n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nThe following summarizes the activity in Level 3 financial instruments:\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nContingent consideration  \nBeginning balance| $| 2,462 | $| 2,941  \nAcquisitions(1)(Note 3)| — | 2,200  \nPayments| — | (2,700)  \nAccretion of discount(1)| 138 | 249  \nEnding balance| $| 2,600 | $| 2,690  \n  \n_____________________\n\n(1) These changes to the balance associated with the estimated fair value of contingent consideration for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were due to the addition of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of Company Y in January 2023 and accretion of discounts on contingent consideration.\n\nThere were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 fair value hierarchy categories of financial instruments. for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n\nSome of the Company’s financial instruments are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature or by election on investments in privately-held entities as described below. Such financial assets and financial liabilities include: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, net receivables, investments in privately-held entities, certain other assets, accounts payable, accrued price protection liability, accrued expenses, accrued compensation costs, and other current liabilities.\n\nThe Company’s long-term debt is not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes (Note 8). \n\nIncluded in other long-term assets as of December 31, 2023 were investments in a privately held entity of $11.8 million, which were impaired in the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence or control over such entity and had accounted for the investments as financial instruments. Given that fair values for such investments were not readily determinable, the Company had elected to measure these investments at cost, less any impairment, and adjust the carrying value to fair value if any observable price changes for similar investments in the same entity are identified. The impairment loss of $11.8 million is included in other expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n7.

In September 2023, the terms of this note receivable were renegotiated, and the first initial repayment of $1.5 million is due by March 31, 2025, and annual repayments of $1.7 million per year are due annually thereafter by March 31, from 2026 through 2030, provided that certain production utilization targets for the prior year are met. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, a portion of the note receivable, or $0.5 million, was written off to other expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The amount written off represents the portion of the payment associated with production utilization that is anticipated to be less than target.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized total amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs of $0.5 million and $0.5 million.\n\nThe approximate aggregate fair value of the term loans outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023was $115.7 million and $114.5 million, respectively, which was estimated on the basis of inputs that are observable in the market and which is considered a Level 2 measurement method in the fair value hierarchy (Note 6).\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of $125.0 million is due in full on June 23, 2028, upon maturity of the loan.Initial Term Loan and Revolving Facility under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement\n\nOn June 23, 2021, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement, or the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement, by and among the Company, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent, that provides for a senior secured term B loan facility, or the “Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement,” in an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million and a senior secured revolving credit facility, or the “Revolving Facility,” in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million. The proceeds of the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement were used (i) to repay in full all outstanding indebtedness under that certain Credit Agreement dated May 12, 2017, by and among the Company, MUFG Bank Ltd., as administrative agent and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as collateral agent and the lenders from time to time party thereto (as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated July 31, 2020) and (ii) to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The remaining proceeds of the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes and the proceeds of the Revolving Facility may be used to finance the working capital needs and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2024, the Revolving Facility was undrawn. Under the terminated amended and restated commitment letter with Wells Fargo Bank and other lenders entered into in connection with the previously pending (now terminated) merger with Silicon Motion (Note 3), the Company had expected to repay the remaining outstanding term loans under this agreement upon closing of the merger.\n\nThe June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement permits the Company to request incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the sum of an amount equal to the greater of (x) $175.0 million and (y) 100% of consolidated EBITDA, plus the amount of certain voluntary prepayments, plus an unlimited amount that is subject to pro forma compliance with certain first lien net leverage ratio, secured net leverage ratio and total net leverage ratio tests. Incremental loans are subject to certain additional conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from the lenders then party to the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement or new lenders.\n\nUnder the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement, the Initial Term Loan bears interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate equal to either (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (x) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50%, (y) the prime rate then in effect and (z) an adjusted Term SOFR rate determined on the basis of a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, in each case, plus an applicable margin of 1.25% or (ii) an adjusted Term SOFR rate, subject to a floor of 0.50%, plus an applicable margin of 2.25%. Loans under the Revolving Facility initially bear interest, at a per annum rate equal to either (i) a base rate (as calculated above) plus an applicable margin of 0.00%, or (ii) an adjusted Term SOFR rate (as calculated above) plus an applicable margin of 1.00%. Following delivery of financial statements for the Company’s fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, the applicable margin for loans under the Revolving Facility will range from 0.00% to 0.75% in the case of base rate loans and 1.00% to 1.75% in the case of Term SOFR rate loans, in each case, depending on the Company’s secured net leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter. The Company is required to pay commitment fees ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum on the daily undrawn commitments under the Revolving Facility, depending on the Company’s secured net leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter. Commencing on September 30, 2021, the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement will amortize in equal quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement, with the balance payable on the maturity date. The June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement was amended on June 29, 2023 to implement a benchmark replacement.\n\nThe Company is required to make mandatory prepayments of the outstanding principal amount of term loans under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement with the net cash proceeds from the disposition of certain assets and the receipt of insurance \n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nproceeds upon certain casualty and condemnation events, in each case, to the extent not reinvested within a specified time period, from excess cash flow beyond stated threshold amounts, and from the incurrence of certain indebtedness. The Company has the right to prepay its term loans under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain limitations and a 1.0% soft call premium applicable during the first six months following the closing date of the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement. The Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement will mature on June 23, 2028, at which time all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement must be repaid. The Revolving Facility will mature on June 23, 2026, at which time all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the Revolving Facility must be repaid. The Company is also obligated to pay fees customary for a credit facility of this size and type.\n\nThe Company’s obligations under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by certain of its domestic subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement. Such obligations, including the guaranties, are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors pursuant to a Security Agreement, dated as of June 23, 2021, by and among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors from time to time party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as collateral agent. \n\nThe June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, undergo certain fundamental changes, make investments, make certain restricted payments, and sell assets, in each case, subject to limitations and exceptions set forth in the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement. The Revolving Facility also prohibits the Company from having a secured net leverage ratio in excess of 3.50:1.00 (subject to a temporary increase to 3.75:1.00 following the consummation of certain material permitted acquisitions) as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of the Company (commencing with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021) if the aggregate borrowings under the Revolving Facility exceed 1% of the aggregate commitments thereunder (subject to certain exceptions set forth in the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement) as of such date. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with such covenants. The June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default that include, among other things, certain payment defaults, cross defaults to other indebtedness, covenant defaults, change in control defaults, judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency defaults. If an event of default exists, the lenders may require immediate payment of all obligations under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement and may exercise certain other rights and remedies provided for under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement, the other loan documents and applicable law.\n\nThe debt is carried at its principal amount, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, and is not adjusted to fair value each period. The issuance date fair value of the liability component of the debt in the amount of $350.2 million was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, in which the projected interest and principal payments were discounted back to the issuance date of the term loan at a market interest rate for nonconvertible debt of 3.4%, which represents a Level 2 fair value measurement. The debt discount of $0.9 million and debt issuance costs of $2.9 million associated with the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement are being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over its seven-year term. Debt issuance costs of $0.4 million associated with the Revolving Facility are being amortized to interest expense over its five-year term.\n\n9. Stock-Based Compensation\n\nEmployee Stock-Based Compensation Plans\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had stock-based compensation awards outstanding under the following plans: the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, or 2010 Plan, and the 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, and the 2024 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan, or the Inducement Plan. Refer to the Company’s Annual Report for a summary of the 2010 Plan and the ESPP.\n\nOn May 22, 2024, the Board of Directors adopted the Inducement Plan pursuant to Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and, subject to the adjustment provisions of the Inducement Plan, reserved 4,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock for issuance under equity awards granted under the Inducement Plan. The Inducement Plan provides for the grant of equity-based awards, including non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and performance shares, and its terms are substantially similar to the 2010 Plan, including with respect to treatment of equity awards in the event of a merger or “change in control” as defined under the Inducement Plan, but with such other terms and conditions intended to comply with the Nasdaq inducement award exception. Awards under the Inducement Plan may only be made to individuals not previously employees or non-employee directors of the Company as an inducement material to the individuals’ entry into employment with the Company.\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, the number of shares of common stock available for future issuance under the 2010 Plan was 15,417,601 shares. As of September 30, 2024, the number of shares of common stock available for future issuance under the ESPP was 6,451,538 shares. As of September 30, 2024, the number of shares of common stock available for future issuance under the Inducement Plan was 4,000,000 shares.\n\nEmployee Incentive Bonus\n\nThe Company’s Executive Incentive Bonus Plan permits the settlement of awards under the plan in any combination of cash or shares of its common stock. The Company settles a majority of bonus awards for its employees, including executives, in shares of common stock under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. When bonus awards are settled in common stock issued under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, the number of shares issuable to plan participants is determined based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock as determined in trading on the applicable stock exchange, on a date approved by the Board of Directors. In connection with the Company’s bonus programs, in February 2024, the Company issued 0.4 million freely-tradable (subject to certain restrictions for affiliates) shares of the Company’s common stock in settlement of bonus awards to employees, including executives, for the 2023 performance period. At September 30, 2024, the Company has an accrual of $3.5 million for bonus awards for employees for year-to-date achievement in the 2024 performance period, which the Company intends to settle primarily in shares of its common stock, unless otherwise required to be settled in cash due to local laws or agreements. The Company’s compensation committee retains discretion to effect payment in cash, stock, or a combination of cash and stock.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation in the consolidated statements of operations, based on the department to which the related employee reports, as follows:Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)| (in thousands)  \nCost of net revenue| $| 81 | $| 170 | $| 436 | $| 626  \nResearch and development| 7,423 | 9,436 | 27,952 | 33,128  \nSelling, general and administrative| 5,284 | (4,488)| 18,820 | 5,009  \n$| 12,788 | $| 5,118 | $| 47,208 | $| 38,763  \n  \nThe total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units as of September 30, 2024 was $112.0 million, and the weighted average period over which these equity awards are expected to vest is 2.39 years. \n\nThe total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance-based restricted stock units as of September 30, 2024 was $1.4 million, and the weighted average period over which these equity awards are expected to vest is 1.40 years.

The expected term of the options was calculated using the simplified method as prescribed by guidance provided by the SEC. This decision was based on the lack of historical data due to the Company’s limited number of stock option exercises under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. Estimated volatility incorporates historical volatility of the Company over the expected term based on the Company's daily closing stock prices.\n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nThe intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $0 and $47.0 thousand in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $0.5 million and $0.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\nCash received from exercise of stock options was negligible during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash received from exercise of stock options was $0.1 million and $0.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. \n\nThe tax benefit from stock options exercised was $0 and $0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The tax benefit from stock options exercised was $0.8 million and $0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n10. Income Taxes\n\nThe provision for income taxes primarily relates to projected federal, state, and foreign income taxes. To determine the quarterly provision for income taxes, the Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate, which is generally based on expected annual income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In addition, the tax effects of certain significant or unusual items are recognized discretely in the quarter during which they occur and can be a source of variability in the effective tax rates from quarter to quarter.\n\nThe Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred taxes are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the temporary differences reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred taxes to the amount it believes is more likely than not to be realized. In making such determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence quarterly, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. Based upon the Company’s review of all positive and negative evidence, the Company continues to have a valuation allowance on its state deferred tax assets, certain of its federal deferred tax assets, and certain foreign deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where the Company has cumulative losses or otherwise is not expected to utilize certain tax attributes. The Company does not incur expense or benefit in certain tax-free jurisdictions in which it operates. \n\nThe Company recorded an income tax benefit of $6.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and an income tax benefit of $1.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $10.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an income tax provision of $13.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe difference between the Company’s effective tax rate and the 21.0% United States federal statutory rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to the mix of pre-tax income among jurisdictions, permanent tax items, and stock based compensation. \n\nThe difference between the Company’s effective tax rate and the 21.0% U.S. federal statutory rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to the mix of pre-tax income among jurisdictions, permanent tax items including the tax on global intangible low-taxed income, stock based compensation, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the release of uncertain tax positions under ASC 740-10. The permanent tax item related to global intangible low-taxed income also reflected the then recent legislative changes requiring the capitalization of research and experimentation costs, as well as limitations on the creditability of certain foreign income taxes.\n\nIncome tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are de-recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company records potential penalties and interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense. \n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased by $0.2 million. The Company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months. Accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2024 were approximately $0.1 million and $4 thousand, respectively.\n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company is subject to federal and state income tax in the United States and is also subject to income tax in certain other foreign tax jurisdictions. At September 30, 2024, the statutes of limitations for the assessment of federal, state, and foreign income taxes are closed for the years before 2020, 2019, and 2017, respectively. \n\nThe Company’s subsidiary in Singapore operates under certain tax incentives in Singapore, which are generally effective through March 2027, and are conditional upon meeting certain employment and investment thresholds in Singapore. Under the incentives, qualifying income derived from certain sales of the Company’s integrated circuits is taxed at a concessionary rate over the incentive period, and there are reduced Singapore withholding taxes on certain intercompany royalties during the incentive period. The Company recorded a tax benefit in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 at the incentive rate.\n\n11. Concentration of Credit Risk, Significant Customers and Geographic Information\n\nConcentration of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Collateral is generally not required for customer receivables. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. At times, such deposits may be in excess of insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nSignificant Customers\n\nThe Company markets its products and services to manufacturers of a wide range of electronic devices (Note 1). The Company sells its products both directly to end-customers and through third-party distributors, both of which are referred to as the Company’s customers (Note 12). Revenue is also generated from sales of intellectual property, and the recipients of such intellectual property are also referred to as the Company’s customers. The Company makes periodic evaluations of the credit worthiness of its customers. \n\nOne customer comprised 10% or greater of net revenues for each of the periods presented, Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nPercentage of total net revenue  \nCustomer A| 25 | %| 11 | %| 13 | %| 11 | %  \n  \nThe following table presents balances that are 10% or greater of accounts receivable, based on the Company’s billings to its customers.September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nPercentage of gross accounts receivable  \nCustomer B| 12 | %| 33 | %  \nCustomer C| 18 | %| 24 | %  \n  \nSignificant Suppliers\n\nSuppliers comprising greater than 10% or greater of total inventory purchases are as follows:Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nVendor A| 27 | %| 28 | %| 18 | %| 21 | %  \nVendor B| 26 | %| 17 | %| 35 | %| 24 | %  \nVendor C| 12 | %| 14 | %| 11 | %| 10 | %  \nVendor D| *| *| *| 10 | %  \n____________________________\n\n* Represents less than 10% of total inventory purchases for the period presented.\n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nGeographic Information\n\nThe Company’s consolidated net revenues by geographic area based on ship-to location are as follows (in thousands):Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nAmount| % of total net revenue| Amount| % of total net revenue| Amount| % of total net revenue| Amount| % of total net revenue  \nAsia | $| 65,293 | 80 | %| $| 98,647 | 73 | %| $| 193,555 | 72 | %| $| 419,478 | 74 | %  \nEurope| 10,208 | 13 | %| 24,886 | 18 | %| 29,034 | 11 | %| 110,058 | 19 | %  \nUnited States| 3,955 | 5 | %| 8,757 | 6 | %| 41,586 | 15 | %| 29,847 | 5 | %  \nRest of world| 1,646 | 2 | %| 3,240 | 2 | %| 4,186 | 2 | %| 8,527 | 2 | %  \nTotal| $| 81,102 | 100 | %| $| 135,530 | 100 | %| $| 268,361 | 100 | %| $| 567,910 | 100 | %  \n  \nThe products shipped to individual countries or territories representing greater than 10% of net revenue for each of the periods presented are as follows:Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nPercentage of total net revenue  \nHong Kong| 49 | %| 41 | %| 37 | %| 34 | %  \nChina| *| *| *| 12 | %  \nTaiwan, ROC| *| 10 | %| *| *  \nThailand| 11 | %| *| *| *  \n____________________________\n\n* Represents less than 10% of total net revenue for the respective period.\n\nThe determination of which country a particular sale is allocated to is based on the destination of the product shipment.

Revenues from sales through the Company’s distributors accounted for 42% and 47% of net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue related to the sales of intellectual property recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 has been allocated by market based upon the usage of such intellectual property.\n\nContract Liabilities\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, customer contract liabilities were approximately $0.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of advanced payments received for which performance obligations have not been completed. Revenue recognized in each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 that was included in the contract liability balance as of the beginning of each of those respective periods was immaterial.\n\nThere were no material changes in the contract liabilities balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. \n\nObligations to Customers for Price Adjustments and Returns and Assets for Right-of-Returns\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, obligations to customers consisting of estimates of price protection rights offered to the Company’s end customers totaled $44.5 million and $71.7 million, respectively, and are included in accrued price protection liability in the consolidated balance sheets. For activity in this account, including amounts included in net revenue, refer to Note 7. \n\nOther obligations to customers representing estimates of price adjustments to be claimed by distributors upon sell-through of their inventory to their end customer and estimates of stock rotation returns to be claimed by distributors on products sold as of September 30, 2024 were $20.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and as of December 31, 2023 were $54.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (Note 7). The reason for the significant decrease in accrued obligations to customers for price adjustments from approximately $54.8 million as of December 31, 2023 to approximately $20.6 million as of September 30, 2024, was due to a significant decrease in sales to distributors which decreased the corresponding accrued obligations to such customers. The increase or decrease in revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 from net changes in transaction prices for amounts included in obligations to customers for price adjustments and estimates of stock rotation returns to be claimed by distributors as of the beginning of those respective periods was not material. \n\n36\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, right of return assets under customer contracts representing the estimates of product inventory the Company expects to receive from customers in stock rotation returns were approximately $58 thousand and $0.1 million, respectively. Right of return assets are included in inventory in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no impairment losses recorded on customer accounts receivable.\n\n13. Leases\n\nOperating Leases\n\nOperating lease arrangements primarily consist of office leases expiring in various years through 2029. These leases have original terms of approximately 2 to 8 years and some contain options to extend the lease up to 5 years or terminate the lease, which are included in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when the Company is reasonably certain it will renew the underlying leases. Since the implicit rate of such leases is unknown and the Company is not reasonably certain to renew its leases, the Company has elected to apply a collateralized incremental borrowing rate to facility leases on the original lease term in calculating the present value of future lease payments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted average discount rate for operating leases was 4.9% and 4.6%, respectively, and the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was 3.4 years and 3.9 years, respectively, as of the end of each of these periods.\n\nThe table below presents aggregate future minimum payments due under leases, reconciled to total lease liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024:Operating Leases  \n---  \n(in thousands)  \n2024 (3 months)| $| 2,864  \n2025| 10,791  \n2026| 8,391  \n2027| 6,031  \n2028| 2,467  \nThereafter| 1,596  \nTotal minimum payments| 32,140  \nLess: imputed interest| (2,906)  \nLess: unrealized translation loss| (2)  \nTotal lease liabilities| 29,232  \nLess: short-term lease liabilities| (9,799)  \nLong-term lease liabilities| $| 19,433  \n  \nOperating lease cost was $2.4 million and $2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating lease cost was $7.5 million and $8.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nShort-term lease costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were not material. \n\nThere were $0 and $0 of right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were $1.2 million and $12.2 million of right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n14. Employee Retirement Plans\n\nDefined Contribution Plan\n\nThe Company has a 401(k) defined contribution retirement plan (the 401(k) Plan) covering all eligible employees. Participants may voluntarily contribute on a pre-tax basis an amount not to exceed a maximum contribution amount pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company is not required to contribute, nor has it contributed, to the 401(k) Plan for any of the periods presented.\n\n37\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nPension and Other Defined Benefit Retirement Obligations\n\nThe Company maintains defined benefit retirement plans, including a pension plan, in certain foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2024, the net defined benefit obligation, primarily related to other defined benefit plans, was $0.4 million. As of December 31, 2023, the net defined benefit obligation was $1.4 million. The benefit is based on a formula applied to eligible employee earnings. \n\nNet periodic benefit costs were $45 thousand and $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were recorded to research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Net periodic benefit costs were $0.2 million and $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were recorded to research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n15. Commitments and Contingencies\n\nInventory Purchase and Other Contractual Obligations\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, future minimum payments under inventory purchase and other obligations are as follows:Inventory Purchase Obligations| Other Obligations| Total  \n---|---|---  \n2024 (3 months)| $| 3,004 | $| 7,708 | $| 10,712  \n2025| 13,419 | 32,131 | 45,550  \n2026| — | 19,482 | 19,482  \n2027| — | 3,673 | 3,673  \nTotal minimum payments| $| 16,423 | $| 62,994 | $| 79,417  \n  \nOther obligations consist primarily of contractual payments due for software licenses. \n\nJointly Funded Research and Development\n\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into contracts for jointly funded research and development projects to develop technology that may be commercialized into a product in the future and receives payments as milestones under the contracts are met. If the Company is required to repay all or a portion of the funds provided by the other parties under certain conditions, the Company defers such funds in other-long term liabilities. As of September 30, 2024, funds of $15.0 million received from the other parties have been deferred in other long-term liabilities. The Company de-recognizes the liabilities when the contingencies associated with the repayment conditions have been resolved. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not recognize income from any previously deferred amounts from other parties upon resolution of such repayment conditions.\n\nDispute with Silicon Motion\n\nAs previously disclosed, on July 26, 2023, MaxLinear terminated the Merger Agreement on multiple grounds (Note 3). On August 16, 2023, Silicon Motion delivered to MaxLinear a notice, which Silicon Motion publicly disclosed, that it was purporting to terminate the Merger Agreement and that Silicon Motion would be commencing an arbitration before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre to seek damages from MaxLinear arising from MaxLinear’s alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement. Silicon Motion’s position is that MaxLinear’s Willful and Material Breaches (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger Agreement prevented the Merger from being completed by August 7, 2023, and that MaxLinear is consequently liable for substantial monetary damages in excess of the termination fee as provided in the Merger Agreement.\n\nOn October 5, 2023, Silicon Motion filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre alleging that MaxLinear breached the Merger Agreement. Silicon Motion seeks payment of the termination fee, additional damages, fees, and costs. The arbitration will be confidential.\n\nMaxLinear believes that it properly terminated the Merger Agreement. MaxLinear remains confident in its decision and will vigorously defend its right to terminate the Silicon Motion transaction without penalty.\n\n38\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nSilicon Motion Stockholder Litigation\n\nMaxLinear and certain of its officers have been named as defendants in two lawsuits brought by stockholders of Silicon Motion.\n\nOn August 31, 2023, a Silicon Motion stockholder filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California captioned Water Island Event-Driven Fund v. MaxLinear, Inc., No. 23-cv-01607 (S.D. Cal.), against MaxLinear and certain of its current officers, alleging two claims: (1) an alleged violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; and (2) an alleged violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On December 20, 2023, the court appointed the lead plaintiffs, who filed the Consolidated Complaint on February 15, 2024. The Consolidated Complaint alleged that the defendants made false and misleading statements and/or omitted material facts that MaxLinear had a duty to disclose, concerning the Company’s intention to close the merger with Silicon Motion. On August 28, 2024, the court granted the defendants a motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue MaxLinear and its officers. The case was dismissed without prejudice.\n\nOn September 18, 2024, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Consolidated Complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\"). The Amended Complaint includes the same two claims as alleged in the Consolidated Complaint and makes similar factual allegations against the MaxLinear defendants, but adds Silicon Motion and certain of its officers as additional defendants. The Amended Complaint seeks compensatory damages, including interest, costs and expenses and such other relief that the court deems appropriate. MaxLinear intends to continue to vigorously defend its position.\n\nOn June 13, 2024, HBK Master Fund L.P. and HBK Merger Strategies Master Fund L.P., stockholders of Silicon Motion, filed an additional complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California captioned HBK Master Fund L.P. v. MaxLinear, Inc., No. 24-cv-01033 (S.D. Cal.), against MaxLinear and certain of its current officers, which also alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and other violations. The complaint alleges that the defendants concealed their intention to terminate the merger with Silicon Motion from Silicon Motion’s shareholders. The complaint seeks compensatory damages, including interest, costs and expenses, punitive damages, and such other equitable or injunctive relief that the court deems appropriate. On July 12, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this complaint, which is pending. MaxLinear intends to continue to vigorously defend its position.\n\nComcast Litigation\n\nOn December 1, 2023, MaxLinear filed claims against Comcast Management, LLC and Comcast Cable Communications, LLC, or together, Comcast, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. MaxLinear alleges that in 2020, MaxLinear shared its proprietary design and know-how for a full-duplex, or FDX, amplifier with Comcast in the hope of securing future business with Comcast. MaxLinear shared its design and know-how on several occasions, all pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement between MaxLinear and Comcast, with the expectation that Comcast would keep the information confidential. MaxLinear alleges that Comcast needed this technology in order to effectively compete with fiber-optic internet providers. Instead of engaging MaxLinear to develop the FDX amplifier, Comcast allegedly shared MaxLinear’s proprietary designs with MaxLinear’s direct competitor. Comcast allegedly then worked with MaxLinear’s competitor to develop the FDX-amplifier technology. MaxLinear brought claims for trade secret misappropriation, unfair competition, and breach of the parties’ non-disclosure agreement, and it sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, costs, expenses, and attorney fees as well as an injunction against Comcast’s use or disclosure of MaxLinear’s trade secrets.\n\nOn March 19, 2024, Comcast amended its claims for declaratory judgments, indemnification, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and on April 3, 2024, MaxLinear moved to dismiss all claims against it. On September 19, 2024, the court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to certain claims for declaratory judgment claim and denied the motion to dismiss with respect to the remaining claims. On September 23, 2024, Comcast filed amended claims for declaratory judgment, indemnification, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and on October 14, 2024, MaxLinear amended and refiled its trade secret and related claims. MaxLinear intends to continue to vigorously defend its position.\n\nDish Litigation\n\nOn February 10, 2023, Entropic Communications, LLC, or Entropic, filed claims for patent infringement against Dish Network Corporation, Dish Network LLC, Dish Network Service, LLC, and Dish Network California Service Corporation in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. At that time, MaxLinear was not a party to the action. On September 21, 2023, Dish Network California Service Corporation, or Dish California, filed four counterclaims against \n\n39\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nMaxLinear. The four claims are declaratory judgment, breach of contract, fraud and negligent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy.\n\nOn January 31, 2024, the Dish defendants, together with DISH Technologies L.L.C., or collectively, Dish, filed eight counterclaims (amended counterclaims for Dish California) against MaxLinear. The eight counterclaims are (1) breach of contract, (2) fraud and negligent misrepresentation, (3) fraud arising from a civil conspiracy, (4) quasi-contract for restitution/unjust enrichment, (5) combination in restraint of trade, (6) violation of the Cartwright Act (by Dish California only), (7) patent misuse, and (8) violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq. Dish’s eight counterclaims revolve around a core allegation that MaxLinear is a member of the Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA) and that MaxLinear violated its obligation under MoCA’s Intellectual Property Rights Policy, or IPR Policy, by acting with Entropic to rid the asserted patents of the RAND encumbrances. Dish seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, disgorgement, attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, and costs. On February 21, 2024, MaxLinear moved to dismiss the Dish defendants’ counterclaim.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, a Special Master issued a report and recommendation, or the R&R, which recommended granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice as to the following counterclaims: (1) quasi-contract for restitution/unjust enrichment, (2) combination in restraint of trade, (3) violation of the Cartwright Act, (4) patent misuse, and (5) violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. MaxLinear submitted objections to the R&R as to the remaining claims that were not dismissed. Dish submitted objections to the R&R’s recommended dismissal of the quasi-contract for restitution/unjust enrichment counterclaim. The court has not yet issued any ruling regarding the R&R or MaxLinear’s pending motion to dismiss.\n\nOn July 30, 2024, this case was stayed until September 17, 2024. There was a motion to stay this case pending resolution of Inter Partes Review (“IPR”). MaxLinear intends to continue to vigorously defend its position.\n\nCox Litigations\n\nOn February 10, 2023, Entropic sued Cox Communications, Inc., CoxCom, LLC, and Cox Communications California, LLC, or together, Cox, in two separate actions in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On October 6, 2023, Cox filed counterclaims against MaxLinear in each of the two actions.\n\nIn the first action, Cox alleges that when MaxLinear assigned certain patents to Entropic, MaxLinear violated its obligations under MoCA’s IPR Policy by assigning these patents and by allegedly failing to ensure that Cox would be offered a FRAND license for these patents. Cox amended its counterclaims on January 9, 2024 and is asserting claims of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and declaratory judgment against MaxLinear. Cox seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs. MaxLinear moved to dismiss Cox’s amended counterclaims on February 6, 2024.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, a Special Master issued the R&R, which recommended granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice as to the unjust enrichment counterclaim but denying the motion as to the breach of contract and declaratory judgment counterclaims. MaxLinear submitted objections to the R&R’s denial-in-part. Cox submitted objections to the R&R as to the unjust enrichment counterclaim and as to certain findings related to the breach of contract counterclaim. The court has not yet issued any ruling regarding the R&R or MaxLinear’s pending motion to dismiss.\n\nIn the second action, in response to Entropic suing Cox for patent infringement, Cox filed counterclaims against MaxLinear. Cox alleges that MaxLinear granted CableLabs a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to all patents essential for compliance with DOCSIS specifications. It further alleges that MaxLinear breached this agreement when MaxLinear assigned certain patents to Entropic. Cox amended its counterclaims on January 9, 2024 and is asserting claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and declaratory judgment. Cox seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs. MaxLinear moved to dismiss Cox’s amended counterclaims on February 6, 2024.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, a Special Master issued the R&R, which recommended dismissing all Cox counterclaims with prejudice. Cox submitted objections to the R&R as to the unjust enrichment counterclaim. The court has not yet issued any ruling regarding the R&R or MaxLinear’s pending motion to dismiss.\n\nOn July 30, 2024, these cases were stayed until September 17, 2024. There was a motion to stay pending resolution of IPR. MaxLinear intends to continue to vigorously defend its position.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of September 30, 2024, no material loss contingencies have been accrued for litigation and other legal claims in the consolidated financial statements, since the Company’s management currently does \n\n40\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)| MAXLINEAR, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(unaudited)  \n---|---  \n  \nnot believe that the ultimate outcome of any of the matters described above is probable. An unfavorable outcome of these matters may be reasonably possible in excess of recorded amounts; however, a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of such loss cannot be made at this time.\n\nOther Matters\n\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to threats of litigation or actual litigation in the ordinary course of business as described above and in “Part II. — Other Information, Item 1. — Legal Proceedings,” some of which may be material. The results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have a material adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\n\n16. Stock Repurchases\n\nOn February 23, 2021, the Company’s board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to $100 million of the Company’s common stock over a period which ended February 16, 2024. The amount and timing of repurchases were subject to a variety of factors including liquidity, share price, market conditions, and legal requirements. Any purchases were funded from available working capital and were effected through open market purchases, block transactions, and privately negotiated transactions. The share repurchase program did not obligate the Company to make any repurchases and was able to be modified, suspended, or terminated by the Company at any time without prior notice. \n\nThe share repurchase program was suspended from July 2022 until its expiration due to the Company’s previously pending (now terminated) merger with Silicon Motion (Note 3). As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock under the repurchase program. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, the aggregate value of common stock repurchased under the program was approximately $55.0 million and no shares remained available for repurchase under the program, as the plan expired on February 16, 2024.\n\n41\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included in Part II, Item 1A in this report.\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a provider of communications systems-on-chips, or SoCs, used in broadband, mobile and wireline infrastructure, data center, and industrial and multi-market applications. We are a fabless integrated circuit design company whose products integrate all or substantial portions of a high-speed communication system, including radio frequency, or RF, high-performance analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, security engines, data compression and networking layers, and power management. In most cases, these products are designed on a single silicon-die, using standard digital complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, manufacturing processes and conventional packaging technologies. Importantly, our ability to design analog and mixed-signal circuits in CMOS allows us to efficiently combine analog functionality and complex digital signal processing logic in the same integrated circuit. As a result, we believe our solutions have exceptional levels of functional integration and performance, low manufacturing cost, and reduced power consumption versus competition. These solutions also enable shorter design cycles, significant design flexibility and low system-level cost across a range of markets.\n\nOur customers primarily include electronics distributors, module makers, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs and original design manufacturers, or ODMs, which incorporate our products in a wide range of electronic devices. Examples of such devices include radio transceivers and modems for 4G/5G base-station and backhaul infrastructure; optical transceivers targeting hyperscale data centers; Wi-Fi and wireline routers for home networking; broadband modems compliant with Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications, or DOCSIS, passive optical fiber standards, or PON, and digital subscriber line, or DSL; as well as power management and interface products used in these and many other markets. In addition, we generate revenue from certain intellectual property sale agreements.\n\nIn the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net revenue was $268.4 million, which was derived in part from sales of RF receivers and RF receiver SOC and connectivity solutions and intellectual property into broadband operator voice and data modems and gateways and connectivity adapters, global analog and digital RF receiver products, radio and modem solutions into wireless carrier access and backhaul infrastructure platforms, high-speed optical interconnect solutions sold into optical modules for data-center, metro and long-haul networks, and high-performance interface and power management solutions into a broad range of communications, industrial, automotive and multi-market applications. We have experienced slower than expected recovery in sales and our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend, among other factors, on our ability to improve revenue in key markets such as the broadband market which has experienced slower than expected recovery; our ability to further penetrate existing markets; our ability to expand our target addressable markets by developing new and innovative products such as researching, developing and designing capabilities for new solutions in advanced semiconductor process nodes such as 16nm and 5nm and beyond, and addressing challenges of capturing and processing high quality broadband communications and high-speed optical interconnect signals; changes in government trade policies; changes in export control regulations; our ability to carry on licensed activities with entities on the Entity List, which have been paused, delayed or halted by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS at certain times; and our ability to obtain design wins with device manufacturers, in particular manufacturers of data modems, and gateways for the broadband service provider, storage networking market, cable infrastructure market, industrial and automotive markets, and optical module and telecommunications infrastructure markets.\n\nProducts shipped to Asia accounted for 72% and 74% of net revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, including 37% from products shipped to Hong Kong during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 34% from products shipped to Hong Kong and 12% from products shipped to mainland China during nine months ended September 30, 2023. Although a large percentage of our products is shipped to Asia, we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers and incorporating our semiconductor products are then sold outside Asia. For example, revenue generated from sales of our products during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related principally to \n\n42\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nsales to Asian ODMs and contract manufacturers delivering products into European and North American markets. To date, all of our sales have been denominated in United States dollars.\n\nA significant portion of our net revenue has historically been generated by a limited number of customers through sales of our products, as well as consideration under intellectual property sale agreements. Sales of products to customers comprise both direct sales to customers and indirect sales through distributors. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, one customer accounted for 25% of our net revenue, and our ten largest customers collectively accounted for 71% of our net revenue, of which distributor customers accounted for 8% of our net revenue. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, one customer accounted for 13% of our net revenue, and our ten largest customers collectively accounted for 64% of our net revenue, of which distributor customers accounted for 15% of our net revenue. For certain customers, we sell multiple products into disparate end user applications such as PON outdoor units, or PON ODUs, Wi-Fi routers, broadband gateways, and cable modems.\n\nOur business depends on winning competitive bid selection processes, known as design wins, to develop integrated circuits for use in our customers’ products. These selection processes are typically lengthy, and as a result, our sales cycles will vary based on the specific market served, whether the design win is with an existing or a new customer and whether our product being designed in our customer’s device is a first generation or subsequent generation product. Our customers’ products can be complex and, if our engagement results in a design win, can require significant time to define, design and result in volume production. Because the sales cycle for our products is long, we can incur significant design and development expenditures in circumstances where we do not ultimately recognize any revenue. We do not have any long-term purchase commitments with any of our customers, all of whom purchase our products on a purchase order basis. Once one of our products is incorporated into a customer’s design, however, we believe that our product is likely to remain a component of the customer’s product for its life cycle because of the time and expense associated with redesigning the product or substituting an alternative chip. Product life cycles in our target markets will vary by application. For example, in the broadband data modem and gateway sectors, a design-in can have a product life cycle of 24 to 60 months. In the industrial and wired and wireless infrastructure markets, a design-in can have a product life cycle of 24 to 84 months and beyond.\n\nImpact of Global Economic Uncertainty and Inventory Build\n\nInflation and uncertainty in customer demand and the worldwide economy has continued, and we could experience continued volatility in our sales and revenues. Inventory oversupply could potentially lead to more inventory write-downs, including charges for any excess or obsolete inventory which could negatively impact our gross margins. However, the magnitude of such volatility on our business and its duration is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. As supplier lead times continue to stabilize, we have seen and expect to continue to see a more normalized demand-planning horizon. \n\nTerminated Silicon Motion Merger \n\nOn May 5, 2022, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Silicon Motion Technology Corporation, or Silicon Motion, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the Law of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire Silicon Motion pursuant to a statutory merger of Shark Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MaxLinear, with and into Silicon Motion, with Silicon Motion surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of MaxLinear. Silicon Motion is a provider of NAND flash controllers for solid state drives and other solid state storage devices.\n\nOn July 26, 2023,we terminated the Merger Agreement and notified Silicon Motion that we were relieved of our obligations to close because, among other reasons, (i) certain conditions to closing set forth in the Merger Agreement were not satisfied and were incapable of being satisfied, (ii) Silicon Motion had suffered a Material Adverse Effect that was continuing, (iii) Silicon Motion was in material breach of representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in the Merger Agreement that gave rise to the right of the Company to terminate, and (iv) in any event, the First Extended Outside Date had passed and was not automatically extended because certain conditions in Article 6 of the Merger Agreement were not satisfied or waived as of May 5, 2023. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, MaxLinear was not required to pay a break-up fee or other fee as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement on these grounds. On August 16, 2023, Silicon Motion delivered a notice to us, which Silicon Motion publicly disclosed, that it was purporting to terminate the Merger Agreement and that Silicon Motion would be commencing an arbitration to seek damages from us arising from our alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement. Undefined capitalized terms in this paragraph have the same meaning as in the Merger Agreement.\n\n43\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nOn October 5, 2023, Silicon Motion filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre alleging that we breached the Merger Agreement. See Part II, Item 1 (Legal Proceedings) of this report for more information on legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement.\n\nThe second amended and restated commitment letter dated October 24, 2022 with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., or Wells Fargo Bank, and other lenders, and related financing commitments for the previously pending (now terminated) merger were also terminated upon termination of the Merger Agreement. As a result of the termination of the financing, in August 2023, the Company was required to pay to Wells Fargo Bank a ticking fee of $18.3 million.\n\nWorkforce Reductions\n\nWe initiated a reduction in our workforce in July 2024, or the 2024 Workforce Reduction, following slower than expected recovery in our sales as a result of macroeconomic conditions and the demand environment. Previously, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we entered into two plans of restructuring to reduce our workforce, or the 2023 Workforce Reductions, which together with the 2024 Workforce Reduction, are referred to collectively as the Workforce Reductions. The Workforce Reductions are intended to align our operational needs with the changes in macroeconomic conditions and the demand environment while continuing to support the long-term business strategy by reducing our operating expenses. \n\nIn the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred $26.8 million in restructuring costs pertaining to the 2024 Workforce Reduction, which included $17.0 million charges under contracts associated with cancelled projects and related impairment of assets, $9.1 million in severance costs and related expenses, and $0.7 million from exiting facilities. \n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed notification to the remaining affected employees of the 2023 Workforce Reductions, and incurred $23.5 million in restructuring costs, including $19.8 million in severance costs and related expenses, or a cumulative total of $43.3 million in restructuring costs under the 2023 Workforce Reductions. Substantially all of the severance and related costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that related to the 2023 Workforce Reductions pertained to statutory severance benefits in the jurisdictions in which the terminated employees were employed.\n\nWe expect to incur additional restructuring costs associated with the 2023 Workforce Reductions and 2024 Workforce Reduction of approximately $3.0 million to $5.0 million, which is expected to pertain to severance due to statutory requirements in the jurisdictions in which the terminated employees were employed, as well as exiting facilities. We expect to complete notifications to employees regarding the 2024 Workforce Reduction and finalize our plans to exit facilities by the end of 2024. \n\nThe estimate of costs that we expect to incur, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results may differ. We may also incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the Workforce Reductions.\n\nInducement Equity Incentive Plan for New Employees\n\nOn May 22, 2024, the Board of Directors adopted the Inducement Plan pursuant to Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and, subject to the adjustment provisions of the Inducement Plan, reserved 4,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock for issuance under equity awards granted under the Inducement Plan. The Inducement Plan provides for the grant of equity-based awards, including non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and performance shares, and its terms are substantially similar to the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, including with respect to treatment of equity awards in the event of a merger or “change in control” as defined under the Inducement Plan, but with such other terms and conditions intended to comply with the Nasdaq inducement award exception. Awards under the Inducement Plan may only be made to individuals not previously employees or non-employee directors of the Company as an inducement material to the individuals’ entry into employment with the Company.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the \n\n44\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nconsolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, the most critical of which are those related to business combinations, revenue recognition, inventory valuation, production masks, goodwill and other intangible assets valuation, and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.\n\nWe believe that accounting policies we have identified as critical involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, those are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFor a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on January 31, 2024, or our Annual Report. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this report.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nThe following describes the line items set forth in our unaudited consolidated statements of operations.\n\nNet Revenue. Net revenue is generated from sales of radio-frequency, analog, digital, and mixed-signal integrated circuits and intellectual property for access and connectivity, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multi-market applications. A significant portion of our sales are to distributors, who then resell our products. \n\nCost of Net Revenue. Cost of net revenue includes the cost of finished silicon wafers processed by third-party foundries; costs associated with our outsourced packaging and assembly, test and shipping; costs of personnel, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation; equipment associated with manufacturing support, logistics and quality assurance; amortization of acquired developed technology and purchased licensed technology intangible assets; inventory fair value adjustments, if any; amortization of certain production mask costs and computer-aided design software license costs; cost of production load boards and sockets; and an allocated portion of our occupancy costs.\n\nResearch and Development. Research and development, or R&D, expense includes personnel-related expenses, including salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation, new product engineering mask costs, prototype integrated circuit packaging and test costs, computer-aided design software license costs, intellectual property license costs, reference design development costs, development testing and evaluation costs, depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs, partially offset by income from joint R&D projects and/or governmental R&D grants, if any. Research and development activities include the design of new products, refinement of existing products and design of test methodologies to ensure compliance with required specifications. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expense includes personnel-related expenses, including salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation, amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, merger, acquisition and integration costs, if any, third-party sales commissions, field application engineering support, travel costs, professional and consulting fees, legal fees, depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs.\n\nImpairment Losses. Impairment losses consist of charges resulting from the impairment of intangible assets.\n\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges consist of severance, lease and leasehold impairment charges, and other charges related to restructuring plans.\n\n45\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income (expense), net includes interest income, interest expense and other income (expense). Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances. Interest expense consists of interest accrued on debt and amortization of discounts on debt and other liabilities. Other income (expense) consists of income (expense) generated from non-operating transactions, including a ticking fee paid to lenders following the termination of the Silicon Motion merger, net gains (losses) from sales or impairment of investments and/or income or losses from investments, if any, including unrealized holding gains (losses) from certain investments required to be marked to market value, if any, and a gain from partial curtailment of employee defined benefit obligations.\n\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit). We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income taxes for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes and the realizability of assets in future years.\n\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated:Three Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nNet revenue| 100 | %| 100 | %| 100 | %| 100 | %  \nCost of net revenue| 46 | 45 | 47 | 44   \nGross profit| 54 | 55 | 53 | 56   \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development| 65 | 49 | 65 | 36   \nSelling, general and administrative| 37 | 19 | 37 | 17   \nImpairment losses| 2 | — | — | —   \nRestructuring charges| 33 | — | 19 | 2   \nTotal operating expenses| 137 | 68 | 121 | 55   \nIncome (loss) from operations| (82)| (13)| (68)| 1   \nInterest income| 2 | 1 | 2 | 1   \nInterest expense| (3)| (2)| (3)| (1)  \nOther income (expense), net| (18)| (17)| (5)| —   \nTotal other income (expense), net| (19)| (17)| (6)| (4)  \nLoss before income taxes| (102)| (31)| (74)| (4)  \nIncome tax provision (benefit)| (8)| (1)| (4)| 2   \nNet loss| (93)| %| (29)| %| (70)| %| (6)| %  \n  \nNet RevenueThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| $ Change| % Change| 2024| 2023| $ Change| % Change  \n(dollars in thousands)| (dollars in thousands)  \nBroadband| $| 32,275 | $| 34,416 | $| (2,141)| (6)| %| $| 87,157 | $| 169,646 | $| (82,489)| (49)| %  \n% of net revenue| 40 | %| 25 | %| 32 | %| 30 | %  \nConnectivity| 12,726 | 15,025 | (2,299)| (15)| %| 35,700 | 119,232 | (83,532)| (70)| %  \n% of net revenue| 16 | %| 11 | %| 13 | %| 21 | %  \nInfrastructure| 23,046 | 49,985 | (26,939)| (54)| %| 87,436 | 145,549 | (58,113)| (40)| %  \n% of net revenue| 28 | %| 37 | %| 33 | %| 26 | %  \nIndustrial and multi-market| 13,055 | 36,104 | (23,049)| (64)| %| 58,068 | 133,483 | (75,415)| (56)| %  \n% of net revenue| 16 | %| 27 | %| 22 | %| 23 | %  \nTotal net revenue| $| 81,102 | $| 135,530 | $| (54,428)| (40 | %)| $| 268,361 | $| 567,910 | $| (299,549)| (53)| %  \n  \n46\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nNet revenue decreased $54.4 million to $81.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $135.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand, including excess inventory in the channel built up following the supply shortages in 2022. The decrease in broadband net revenue of $2.1 million was driven by decreases in the volume of broadband SOC, satellite ODU, and tuner shipments in this category, partially offset by increases from reversals of unclaimed rebates due to expiration of rebate pricing and improvements in shipments of cable data shipments. The decrease in connectivity net revenue of $2.3 million was driven by decreased volume of shipments of certain products associated with residential broadband market decline, while ethernet product shipments improved. The decrease in net infrastructure revenues of $26.9 million was driven by a decrease in the volume of wireless backhaul and high performance analog product shipments. The decrease in industrial and multi-market net revenue of $23.0 million was driven by decreased volume of shipments of component and high-performance analog products, while high speed interconnect product shipments improved. Price changes did not have a material impact to revenues period over period.\n\nNet revenue decreased $299.5 million to $268.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $567.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand, including excess inventory in the channel built up following the supply shortages in 2022. The decrease in broadband net revenue of $82.5 million was driven by decreases in the volume of broadband SOC shipments in this category, partially offset by revenue from certain intellectual property sale agreements and increases from reversals of unclaimed rebates due to expiration of rebate pricing. The decrease in connectivity net revenue of $83.5 million was driven by decreased volume of shipments of certain products associated with residential broadband market decline, partially offset by revenue from certain intellectual property sale agreements. The decrease in net infrastructure revenues of $58.1 million was driven by decreases in the volume of wireless backhaul products, and to a lesser extent, high performance analog shipments, partially offset by improvement in shipments of from high speed interconnect products, and revenues from certain intellectual property sale agreements. The decrease in industrial and multi-market net revenue of $75.4 million was driven by decreased volume of shipments of component and high-performance analog products. Price changes did not have a material impact to revenues period over period.\n\nWe currently expect that revenue will fluctuate in the future, from period-to-period, consistent with the cyclical nature of our industry.\n\nCost of Net Revenue and Gross ProfitThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| $ Change| % Change| 2024| 2023| $ Change| % Change  \n(dollars in thousands)| (dollars in thousands)  \nCost of net revenue| $| 37,022 | $| 61,586 | $| (24,564)| (40)| %| $| 124,827 | $| 250,786 | $| (125,959)| (50)| %  \n% of net revenue| 46 | %| 45 | %| 47 | %| 44 | %  \nGross profit | 44,080 | 73,944 | (29,864)| (40)| %| 143,534 | 317,124 | (173,590)| (55)| %  \n% of net revenue| 54 | %| 55 | %| 53 | %| 56 | %  \n  \nCost of net revenue decreased $24.6 million to $37.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $61.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by a decreased volume of shipments as a result of macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand for our products as described above under “Net Revenue.” Gross profit percentage declined for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to reduced absorption of intangible amortization and fixed costs.\n\nCost of net revenue decreased $126.0 million to $124.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $250.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by a decreased volume of shipments as a result of macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand for our products as described above under “Net Revenue.” Gross profit percentage declined for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to reduced absorption of intangible amortization and fixed costs.\n\nWe currently expect that gross profit percentage will fluctuate in the future, from period-to-period, based on changes in product mix, average selling prices, and average manufacturing costs. \n\n47\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nResearch and DevelopmentThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| $ Change| % Change| 2024| 2023| $ Change| % Change  \n(dollars in thousands)| (dollars in thousands)  \nResearch and development| $| 52,604 | $| 66,306 | $| (13,702)| (21)| %| $| 173,911 | $| 204,254 | $| (30,343)| (15)| %  \n% of net revenue| 65 | %| 49 | %| 65 | %| 36 | %  \n  \nResearch and development expense decreased $13.7 million to $52.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $66.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by decreases in payroll and benefits expense of $5.6 million, bonuses of $3.1 million, stock based compensation of $2.0 million, CAD design tools expense of $1.7 million, consulting expense of $0.9 million and prototype expense of $0.7 million. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of a decrease to income from joint R&D projects and government grants of $0.7 million offset against R&D expense. The decrease in payroll and benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation are attributable to the 2023 Workforce Reductions. The decrease in CAD design tool, consulting and prototype expenses are due to timing of project completion. The decrease in research and development funded by others is due to timing of governmental R&D grants and termination of certain programs during the third quarter of 2024 as a result of the 2024 Workforce Reduction. The amount of income from research and development funded by others also varies from period to period depending on availability of such funding, including governmental grants.\n\nResearch and development expense decreased $30.3 million to $173.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $204.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by decreases in payroll and benefits expense of $15.8 million, CAD design tools expense of $5.9 million, stock based compensation of $5.2 million, bonuses of $3.3 million, consulting expense of $3.0 million, prototype expense of $2.3 million, depreciation expense of $1.7 million and occupancy expenses of $0.6 million. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in income from joint R&D and governmental grants of $8.1 million offset against R&D expense. The decrease in payroll and benefits expense, stock-based compensation, and bonuses are attributable to the 2023 Workforce Reductions and cost reduction measures. The decrease in CAD design tool, consulting and prototype expenses are due to timing of project completion. The decrease in depreciation expense is from acquired assets becoming fully amortized as they reached the end of their useful lives. The decrease in income from joint R&D projects and governmental grants is due to timing of governmental R&D grants and termination of certain programs during the first and third quarters of 2024 as a result of the 2023 Workforce Reductions and 2024 Workforce Reduction. The amount of income from research and development funded by others also varies from period to period depending on availability of such funding, including governmental grants.\n\nWe are reducing our research and development spending, including via our Workforce Reductions, to meet evolving demand; however, we expect our research and development expenses to increase in future years as we develop products to drive future growth.\n\nSelling, General and AdministrativeThree Months Ended September 30,| Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| $ Change| % Change| 2024| 2023| $ Change| % Change  \n(dollars in thousands)| (dollars in thousands)  \nSelling, general and administrative| $| 30,154 | $| 25,402 | $| 4,752 | 19 | %| $| 100,242 | $| 97,772 | $| 2,470 | 3 | %  \n% of net revenue| 37 | %| 19 | %| 37 | %| 17 | %  \n  \nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $4.8 million to $30.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $25.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase in stock-based compensation expense is a result of incremental grants made to executives for retention purposes in the first quarter of 2024. The decrease in professional fees is mainly due to a decrease in merger and acquisition related fees following the termination of our merger with Silicon Motion.

The permanent tax item related to global intangible low-taxed income also reflected the then recent legislative changes requiring the capitalization of research and experimentation costs, as well as limitations on the creditability of certain foreign income taxes.\n\nWe continue to maintain a valuation allowance to offset state and certain federal and foreign deferred tax assets, as realization of such assets does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold required under accounting guidelines. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence quarterly, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Based upon our review of all positive and negative evidence, we continue to have a valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets, certain federal deferred tax assets, and certain foreign deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where we have cumulative losses or otherwise are not expected to utilize certain tax attributes. We do not incur income tax expense or benefit in certain tax-free jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nOur subsidiary in Singapore operates under certain tax incentives in Singapore, which are effective through March 2027. Under these incentives, qualifying income derived from certain sales of our integrated circuits is taxed at a concessionary rate over the incentive period. We also receive a reduced withholding tax rate on certain intercompany royalty payments made by our Singapore subsidiary during the incentive period. We recorded income taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 at the incentive rate. The incentives are conditional upon our meeting certain minimum employment and investment thresholds within Singapore over time, and we may be required to return certain tax benefits in the event we do not achieve compliance related to that incentive period. We currently believe that we will be able to satisfy these conditions without material risk.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $148.5 million, restricted cash of $1.0 million and net accounts receivable of $47.9 million. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, our working capital, which we define as current assets less current liabilities, was $159.7 million. Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Collateral is generally not required for customer receivables. We limit our exposure to credit loss by placing our cash with high credit quality financial institutions. At times, such deposits may be in excess of insured limits. We have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses and purchases of inventory, property and equipment, and from time to time, the acquisition of businesses. In May 2022, we entered into the Merger Agreement to acquire Silicon Motion. However, on July 26, 2023, we terminated the Merger Agreement and were relieved of our obligations to close.\n\nFrom time to time, we may also use cash to pay down outstanding debt and/or make investments. As of September 30, 2024, $125.0 million of principal was outstanding under a senior secured term B loan facility or the “Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement.” The Company also has available, subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement, a senior secured revolving credit facility, in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million which remained undrawn as of September 30, 2024. The proceeds of the revolving facility may be used to finance the working capital needs and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. \n\n51\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nCommencing on September 30, 2021, the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement has amortized in equal quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement, with the balance payable on June 23, 2028. We could be subject to substantial variable interest rate risk because our interest rate under term loans typically vary based on a fixed margin over an indexed rate or an adjusted base rate. While we had been mitigating the impact of high interest rates with large amounts of prepayments on our outstanding debt, if interest rates were to further increase substantially, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could affect our ability to service the indebtedness. Please refer to the Risk Factor entitled “As of September 30, 2024, our aggregate indebtedness was $125.0 million, and we are subject to a variable amount of interest on the principal balance of our credit agreements and could continue to be adversely impacted by high interest rates in the future. Such indebtedness adversely affects our operating results and cash-flows as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations and contains financial and operational covenants that could adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interest of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions. In addition, high interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers, and our distributors to obtain financing and service their interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on customer demand for our products and our distributors' business” for a discussion of how our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.\n\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including changes in revenue, the expansion or contraction of our engineering, sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of our expansion into new territories, the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, the continuing market acceptance of our products, any damages from legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement with Silicon Motion or any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement that we are required to pay, or any amounts we agree to pay in any settlement and any other potential material investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may not be able to sustain our operations or execute our strategic plans.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents are impacted by the timing of when we pay expenses as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. Cash used to fund operating expenses in our consolidated statements of cash flows excludes the impact of non-cash items such as, but not limited to, amortization and depreciation of acquired intangible assets and leased right-of-use assets and property and equipment, stock-based compensation, impairment of assets, and gain on extinguishment of lease liabilities. Cash used to fund capital purchases and acquisitions of businesses and investments are included in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash paid to satisfy minimum tax withholdings on behalf of employees for restricted stock units are included in financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our material cash requirements include long-term debt, non-cancelable operating leases, inventory purchase obligations and other obligations, which primarily consist of contractual payments due for computer-aided design software, as follows:Payments due  \n---  \nTotal| Less than 1 year| 1-3 years| 3-5 years| More than 5 years  \n(in thousands)  \nLong-term debt obligations| $| 125,000 | $| — | $| — | $| 125,000 | $| —   \nOperating lease obligations| 32,140 | 2,864 | 19,182 | 8,498 | 1,596   \nPurchase obligations| 16,423 | 3,004 | 13,419 | — | —   \nOther obligations| 62,994 | 7,708 | 51,613 | 3,673 | —   \nTotal| $| 236,557 | $| 13,576 | $| 84,214 | $| 137,171 | $| 1,596   \n  \nOur planned capital expenditures as of September 30, 2024 were not material. Our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 included $4.4 million in other long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions, some of which may result in cash payment and $15.0 million received from other parties for jointly funded research and development projects which will be recognized into income when the contingencies associated with the repayment conditions have been resolved. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions recorded as other long-term liabilities have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities.\n\n52\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nOur primary sources of cash are cash receipts on accounts receivable from our shipment of products to distributors and direct customers, as well as proceeds that we receive under certain intellectual property sale agreements. Aside from the amounts billed to our customers, net cash collections of accounts receivable are impacted by the efficiency of our cash collections process, which can vary from period to period depending on the payment cycles of our major distributor customers, and relative linearity of shipments period-to-period. \n\nThe June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement, under which we entered into a senior secured term B loan facility and a revolving credit facility, permits us to request incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the sum of an amount equal to the greater of (x) $175.0 million and (y) 100% of “Consolidated EBITDA” (as defined in such agreement), plus the amount of certain voluntary prepayments, plus an unlimited amount that is subject to pro forma compliance with certain first lien net leverage ratio, secured net leverage ratio and total net leverage ratio tests.\n\nThe following is a summary of our working capital, cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the periods indicated:September 30, 2024| December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \n(in thousands)  \nWorking capital| $| 159,663 | $| 265,896   \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 148,476 | $| 187,288   \nShort-term restricted cash| 993 | 1,051   \nLong-term restricted cash| 23 | 17   \nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash| $| 149,492 | $| 188,356   \n  \nWe believe that our $148.5 million of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2024, our indebtedness totaled $125.0 million, which consists of outstanding principal under the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement. The June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement also provides the Company with the Revolving Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million, which remained undrawn as of September 30, 2024. The Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement has a seven-year term expiring in June 2028 and bears interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate equal to either (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (x) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50%, (y) the prime rate then in effect and (z) an adjusted SOFR rate determined on the basis of a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, in each case, plus an applicable margin of 1.25% or (ii) an adjusted SOFR rate, subject to a floor of 0.50%, plus an applicable margin of 2.25%. Loans under the Revolving Facility initially bear interest, at a per annum rate equal to either (i) a base rate (as calculated above) plus an applicable margin of 0.00%, or (ii) an adjusted SOFR rate (as calculated above) plus an applicable margin of 1.00%. Following delivery of financial statements for the Company’s fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, the applicable margin for loans under the Revolving Facility will range from 0.00% to 0.75% in the case of base rate loans and 1.00% to 1.75% in the case of SOFR rate loans, in each case, depending on the Company’s secured net leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter. The Company is required to pay commitment fees ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum on the daily undrawn commitments under the Revolving Facility, depending on the Company’s secured net leverage ratio as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter. Commencing on September 30, 2021, the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement amortizes in equal quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount, with the balance payable at maturity on June 23, 2028. The June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement was amended on June 29, 2023 to implement a benchmark replacement.\n\n53\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nThe following is a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the periods indicated:Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities| $| (17,457)| $| 59,945   \nNet cash used in investing activities| (20,448)| (30,762)  \nNet cash used in financing activities| (135)| (27,527)  \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash| (824)| (1,861)  \nDecrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash| $| (38,864)| $| (205)  \n  \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $17.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $59.9 million nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decline in operating cash flows was driven by a decline in revenue from decreased volume of shipments of our products as a result of macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand for our products (as discussed under the heading, “Results of Operations,” above). Operating cash flows were also impacted by changes in our working capital, which increased $88.7 million, in particular, in the first nine months of 2024, we collected accounts receivable of $177.6 million, which was partially offset by payments against our price protection liability of $54.0 million and severance and other payments from the Workforce Reductions of $31.5 million.\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nOur use of cash in investing activities declined by $10.3 million driven by a reduction our acquisition investments, offset by increased capital purchases. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used $12.4 million in acquiring a small business. We did not make any acquisition-related payments in the 2024 period. Our capital purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets increased $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the timing of purchases of production masks and other property and equipment. \n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $20.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted of purchases of property and equipment of $15.5 million, and purchases of intangible assets of $5.0 million.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities was $30.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and consisted of cash used in acquisitions of Company X and Y of $12.4 million (including $2.7 million contingent consideration paid to shareholders of Company X), purchases of property and equipment of $12.2 million, and purchases of intangible assets of $6.2 million.\n\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\nOur use of cash in financing activities for the 2023 period included payment of debt commitment, or ticking fees, of $18.3 million in connection with the termination of the merger with Silicon Motion. Both the 2024 and 2023 periods included minimum tax withholding paid on behalf of employees for restricted stock, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock for stock-related awards to employee. The employee stock-related amounts declined due to a smaller amount of restricted stock units released for bonuses and a decline in value of other stock-related awards released during the periods. \n\nWarranties and Indemnifications\n\nIn connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, we often make representations affirming, among other things, that our products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, and agree to indemnify customers against third-party claims for such infringement. Further, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws require us to indemnify our officers and directors against any action that may arise out of their services in that capacity, and we have also entered into indemnification agreements with respect to all of our directors and certain controlling persons.\n\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n54\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. \n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nTo date, our international customer and vendor agreements have been denominated mostly in United States dollars. Accordingly, we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and do not enter into foreign currency hedging transactions. The functional currency of certain foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Accordingly, the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets of these foreign subsidiaries’ operations are accounted for as translation gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity. A hypothetical change of 100 basis points in such foreign currency exchange rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would result in a change to translation gain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately $1.1 million.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nWe are subject to a variable amount of interest on the principal balance of our credit agreements described above and could be adversely impacted by high interest rates in the future. If SOFR interest rates had increased by 10% during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the rate increase would have resulted in an immaterial increase to interest expense. We currently believe our operating cash held primarily for working capital purpose is sufficient to cover our interest obligations, but we are monitoring the impact of high interest rates on our ability to service our interest and debt obligations, obtain financing, and on our business in general.\n\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure and Procedures\n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and no evaluation of controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, prior to filing this Quarterly Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on their evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nAn evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to determine whether any change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n55\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1.

On August 16, 2023, Silicon Motion delivered to MaxLinear a notice, which Silicon Motion publicly disclosed, that it was purporting to terminate the Merger Agreement and that Silicon Motion would be commencing an arbitration before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre to seek damages from MaxLinear arising from MaxLinear’s alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement. Silicon Motion’s position is that MaxLinear’s Willful and Material Breaches (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger Agreement prevented the Merger from being completed by August 7, 2023, and that MaxLinear is consequently liable for substantial monetary damages in excess of the termination fee as provided in the Merger Agreement.\n\nOn October 5, 2023, Silicon Motion filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre alleging that MaxLinear breached the Merger Agreement. Silicon Motion seeks payment of the termination fee, additional damages, fees, and costs. The arbitration will be confidential.\n\nMaxLinear believes that it properly terminated the Merger Agreement. MaxLinear remains confident in its decision and will vigorously defend its right to terminate the Silicon Motion transaction without penalty.\n\nSilicon Motion Stockholder Litigation\n\nMaxLinear and certain of its officers have been named as defendants in two lawsuits brought by stockholders of Silicon Motion.\n\nOn August 31, 2023, a Silicon Motion stockholder filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California captioned Water Island Event-Driven Fund v. MaxLinear, Inc., No. 23-cv-01607 (S.D. Cal.), against MaxLinear and certain of its current officers. The complaint included two claims: (1) an alleged violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; and (2) an alleged violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. On December 20, 2023, the court appointed the lead plaintiffs, who filed the Consolidated Complaint on February 15, 2024. The Consolidated Complaint alleged that the defendants made false and misleading statements and/or omitted material facts that MaxLinear had a duty to disclose, concerning the Company’s intention to close the merger with Silicon Motion. On August 28, 2024, the court granted the defendants a motion to dismiss holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue MaxLinear and its officers. The case was dismissed without prejudice.\n\nOn September 18, 2024, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Consolidated Complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\"). The Amended Complaint includes the same two claims as alleged in the Consolidated Complaint and makes similar factual allegations against the MaxLinear defendants, but adds Silicon Motion and certain of its officers as additional defendants. The Amended Complaint seeks compensatory damages, including interest, costs and expenses and such other relief that the court deems appropriate. MaxLinear intends to continue to vigorously defend its position.\n\nOn June 13, 2024, HBK Master Fund L.P. and HBK Merger Strategies Master Fund L.P., stockholders of Silicon Motion, filed an additional complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California captioned HBK Master Fund L.P. v. MaxLinear, Inc., No. 24-cv-01033 (S.D. Cal.), against MaxLinear and certain of its current officers, which also alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and other violations. The complaint alleges that the defendants concealed their intention to terminate the merger with Silicon Motion from Silicon Motion’s shareholders. The complaint seeks compensatory damages, including interest, costs and expenses, punitive damages, and such other equitable or injunctive relief that the court deems appropriate. On July 12, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss this complaint, which is pending. MaxLinear intends to continue to vigorously defend its position.\n\n56\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nComcast Litigation\n\nOn December 1, 2023, MaxLinear filed claims against Comcast Management, LLC and Comcast Cable Communications, LLC, or together, Comcast, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. MaxLinear alleges that in 2020, MaxLinear shared its proprietary design and know-how for a full-duplex, or FDX, amplifier with Comcast in the hope of securing future business with Comcast. MaxLinear shared its design and know-how on several occasions, all pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement between MaxLinear and Comcast, with the expectation that Comcast would keep the information confidential. MaxLinear alleges that Comcast needed this technology in order to effectively compete with fiber-optic internet providers. Instead of engaging MaxLinear to develop the FDX amplifier, Comcast allegedly shared MaxLinear’s proprietary designs with MaxLinear’s direct competitor. Comcast allegedly then worked with MaxLinear’s competitor to develop the FDX-amplifier technology. MaxLinear brought claims for trade secret misappropriation, unfair competition, and breach of the parties’ non-disclosure agreement, and it sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, costs, expenses, and attorney fees as well as an injunction against Comcast’s use or disclosure of MaxLinear’s trade secrets.\n\nOn March 19, 2024, Comcast amended its claims for declaratory judgments, indemnification, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and on April 3, 2024, MaxLinear moved to dismiss all claims against it. On September 19, 2024, the court granted the motion to dismiss with respect to certain claims for declaratory judgment claim and denied the motion to dismiss with respect to the remaining claims. On September 23, 2024, Comcast filed amended claims for declaratory judgment, indemnification, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and on October 14, 2024, MaxLinear amended and refiled its trade secret and related claims. MaxLinear intends to continue to vigorously defend its position.\n\nDish Litigation\n\nOn February 10, 2023, Entropic Communications, LLC, or Entropic, filed claims for patent infringement against Dish Network Corporation, Dish Network LLC, Dish Network Service, LLC, and Dish Network California Service Corporation in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. At that time, MaxLinear was not a party to the action. On September 21, 2023, Dish Network California Service Corporation, or Dish California, filed four counterclaims against MaxLinear. The four claims are declaratory judgment, breach of contract, fraud and negligent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy.\n\nOn January 31, 2024, the Dish defendants, together with DISH Technologies L.L.C., or collectively, Dish, filed eight counterclaims (amended counterclaims for Dish California) against MaxLinear. The eight counterclaims are (1) breach of contract, (2) fraud and negligent misrepresentation, (3) fraud arising from a civil conspiracy, (4) quasi-contract for restitution/unjust enrichment, (5) combination in restraint of trade, (6) violation of the Cartwright Act (by Dish California only), (7) patent misuse, and (8) violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq. Dish’s eight counterclaims revolve around a core allegation that MaxLinear is a member of the Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA) and that MaxLinear violated its obligation under MoCA’s Intellectual Property Rights Policy, or IPR Policy, by acting with Entropic to rid the asserted patents of the RAND encumbrances. Dish seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, disgorgement, attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, and costs. On February 21, 2024, MaxLinear moved to dismiss the Dish defendants’ counterclaim.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, a Special Master issued a report and recommendation, or the R&R, which recommended granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice as to the following counterclaims: (1) quasi-contract for restitution/unjust enrichment, (2) combination in restraint of trade, (3) violation of the Cartwright Act, (4) patent misuse, and (5) violation of Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200. MaxLinear submitted objections to the R&R as to the remaining claims that were not dismissed. Dish submitted objections to the R&R’s recommended dismissal of the quasi-contract for restitution/unjust enrichment counterclaim. The court has not yet issued any ruling regarding the R&R or MaxLinear’s pending motion to dismiss. \n\nOn July 30, 2024, this case was stayed until September 17, 2024. There was a motion to stay this case pending resolution of Inter Partes Review (“IPR”). MaxLinear intends to continue to vigorously defend its position.\n\nCox Litigations\n\nOn February 10, 2023, Entropic sued Cox Communications, Inc., CoxCom, LLC, and Cox Communications California, LLC, or together, Cox, in two separate actions in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. On October 6, 2023, Cox filed counterclaims against MaxLinear in each of the two actions.\n\nIn the first action, Cox alleges that when MaxLinear assigned certain patents to Entropic, MaxLinear violated its obligations under MoCA’s IPR Policy by assigning these patents and by allegedly failing to ensure that Cox would be offered a FRAND license for these patents. Cox amended its counterclaims on January 9, 2024 and is asserting claims of breach of \n\n57\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\ncontract, unjust enrichment, and declaratory judgment against MaxLinear. Cox seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs. MaxLinear moved to dismiss Cox’s amended counterclaims on February 6, 2024.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, a Special Master issued the R&R, which recommended granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice as to the unjust enrichment counterclaim but denying the motion as to the breach of contract and declaratory judgment counterclaims. MaxLinear submitted objections to the R&R’s denial-in-part. Cox submitted objections to the R&R as to the unjust enrichment counterclaim and as to certain findings related to the breach of contract counterclaim. The court has not yet issued any ruling regarding the R&R or MaxLinear’s pending motion to dismiss.\n\nIn the second action, in response to Entropic suing Cox for patent infringement, Cox filed counterclaims against MaxLinear. Cox alleges that MaxLinear granted CableLabs a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to all patents essential for compliance with DOCSIS specifications. It further alleges that MaxLinear breached this agreement when MaxLinear assigned certain patents to Entropic. Cox amended its counterclaims on January 9, 2024 and is asserting claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and declaratory judgment. Cox seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs. MaxLinear moved to dismiss Cox’s amended counterclaims on February 6, 2024.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, a Special Master issued the R&R, which recommended dismissing all Cox counterclaims with prejudice. Cox submitted objections to the R&R as to the unjust enrichment counterclaim. The court has not yet issued any ruling regarding the R&R or MaxLinear’s pending motion to dismiss.\n\nOn July 30, 2024, these cases were stayed until September 17, 2024. There was a motion to stay pending resolution of IPR. MaxLinear intends to continue to vigorously defend its position.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of September 30, 2024, no material loss contingencies have been accrued for litigation and other legal claims in our consolidated financial statements, since our management currently does not believe that the ultimate outcome of any of the matters described above is probable. An unfavorable outcome of these matters may be reasonably possible in excess of recorded amounts; however, a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of such loss cannot be made at this time.\n\nOther Matters\n\nFrom time to time, we are subject to threats of litigation or actual litigation in the ordinary course of business as described above, some of which may be material. Results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and claims can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\n\n58\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nITEM 1A.

The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and situations that may cause our or our industry’s actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These factors include those listed below in this Part II, Item 1A and those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. We encourage investors to review these factors carefully. We may from time to time make additional written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC. However, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of us, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\nThe following discussion provides information concerning the material risks and uncertainties that we have identified and believe may adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations. Before you decide whether to invest in our securities, you should carefully consider these risk factors together with all of the other information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and in our other public filings, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Our risk factors are not guarantees that no such conditions exist as of the date of this report and should not be interpreted as an affirmative statement that such risks or conditions have not materialized, in whole or in part. \n\nFor the risks relating to our terminated merger with Silicon Motion, please refer to the section of these risk factors captioned “Risks Relating to the Terminated Merger with Silicon Motion.”\n\nRisk Factor Summary\n\nRisks Relating to the Terminated Merger with Silicon Motion\n\n•The termination of the Merger Agreement and the related legal proceedings have caused us to incur substantial costs, may divert management’s attention from our business and could otherwise adversely affect our business, financial results and operations.\n\n•If we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement with Silicon Motion, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such damages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash resources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional capital for any such payments.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Business\n\n•We face intense competition and expect competition to increase in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and market share.\n\n•Global economic conditions, including factors such as high inflation or a potential recession, could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n•We are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.\n\n•A significant variance in our operating results or rates of growth, if any, could continue to lead to substantial volatility in our stock price. Our revenue has declined, and we may not sustain our current level of revenue, which has declined, and/or manage future growth effectively. The impact of excess inventory in the channel has continued to influence our customers’ expected demand for certain of our products and negatively impact our revenue.\n\n•Our business, financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by military conflicts, geopolitical and economic tensions among or with countries in which we conduct business, including between the United States and China, Israel (and its conflicts with Iran and Lebanon), and among other countries. For example, as more entities are added to restricted export control lists, or as semiconductor technology exports to other countries are further controlled, our need to seek authorization from the U.S. government may impact our ability to do business and/or the speed with which we can deliver, if at all.\n\n•We also are subject to risks associated with international geopolitical and military conflicts.\n\n59\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\n•Changes in trade policies among the United States and other countries, in particular the imposition of new or higher tariffs, could place pressure on our average selling prices as our customers seek to offset the impact of increased tariffs on their own products. Increased tariffs or the imposition of other barriers to international trade could decrease demand and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.\n\n•We will lose sales if we are unable to obtain or retain government authorization to export certain of our products or technology or if such authorizations are revoked. In addition, we will be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations.\n\n•We depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from major customers has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\n\n•Any legal proceedings or claims against us or potential violations of applicable regulations could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could harm our reputation regardless of the outcome.\n\n•We have been and may in the future be subject to information technology failures, including security breaches, cyber-attacks, design defects or system failures, that could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.\n\n•Average selling prices of our products have previously decreased and could decrease in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margins.\n\n•If we fail to penetrate new applications and markets, our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\n•A significant portion of our revenue is attributable to demand for our products in markets for broadband solutions, and development delays and consolidation trends among cable and satellite Pay-TV and broadband operators could adversely affect our future revenues and operating results.\n\n•We may be unable to make the substantial productive research and development investments that are required to remain competitive in our business.\n\n•The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses caused by undetected defects or bugs, which could reduce the market acceptance of our new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and adversely affect our operating costs.\n\n•Our revenue and operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors that could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\n\n•If we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impaired and our competitive position could be harmed.\n\n•We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties, and differences between our estimates of customer demand and product mix and our actual results could continue to negatively affect our inventory levels, sales and operating results.\n\n•We may have difficulty accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses particularly as we seek to enter new markets where we may not have prior experience.\n\n•Our customers require our products and our third-party contractors to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process which does not assure product sales.\n\n•We incur significant expenditures to win business and customer product plan cancellations may adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n•A failure to maintain compliance with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n•If we are unable to attract, train and retain qualified personnel and senior management, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer.\n\n•We are subject to a variable amount of interest on the principal balance of our credit agreements and could continue to be adversely impacted by high interest rates in the future. Such indebtedness adversely affects our operating results and cash-flows, as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations and contains financial and operational covenants that could adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions. In addition, high interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers, and our distributors to obtain financing and service our respective interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on customer demand for our products and our distributors’ business. \n\n•We are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. Our inability to comply with such obligations may negatively impact our business.\n\n•Our products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted by end users in our markets.\n\n•We may, from time to time, make additional business acquisitions or investments, which involve significant risks.\n\n60\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\n\n•We have settled in the past intellectual property litigation and may in the future face additional claims of intellectual property infringement, including indemnification claims based on intellectual property allegations. Any current or future litigation could be time-consuming, costly to prosecute, defend or settle and result in damages and/or the loss of significant rights.\n\n•If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\n\n•We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.\n\n•The use of open source software in our products, processes and technology may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\n\nRisks Relating to Reliance on Third Parties\n\n•A lack of long-term supply contracts, and any supply disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\n•Failure to manage our relationships with our third-party contractors successfully, or impacts from volatility in global supply, natural disasters, public health crises, or other labor stoppages in the regions where such contractors operate, could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products.\n\n•Should any of our distributors cease or be forced to stop distributing our products, our business would suffer.\n\n•Any failure of third parties to provide services and technology could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\n\n•Our share price may be volatile as a result of various factors.\n\n•Our management team may use our available cash and cash equivalents in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a return.\n\n•Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\n\nRisks Relating to our Terminated Merger with Silicon Motion\n\nThe termination of the Merger Agreement and the related legal proceedings have caused us to incur substantial costs, may divert management’s attention from our business and could otherwise adversely affect our business, financial results and operations.\n\nWe terminated the Merger Agreement on July 26, 2023 and notified Silicon Motion that we are relieved of our obligation to close the merger. Silicon Motion has challenged the validity of that termination. On August 16, 2023, Silicon Motion delivered to us a notice, which Silicon Motion publicly disclosed, that it was purporting to terminate the Merger Agreement and that Silicon Motion would be commencing an arbitration before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre to seek damages from us arising from our alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement. On October 5, 2023, Silicon Motion filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre alleging that we breached the Merger Agreement. Additionally, on August 31, 2023, a Silicon Motion stockholder filed a class action complaint against us and certain of our current officers alleging that we materially misrepresented the likelihood the merger would close, and a similar individual action was filed by a different Silicon Motion stockholder on June 13, 2024. Other potential plaintiffs may file additional lawsuits related to the previously contemplated merger. See Part II, Item 1 (Legal Proceedings) of this report for more information on the Silicon Motion arbitration and the class action lawsuit. We intend to vigorously defend against these legal proceedings and any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, but due to the uncertainties inherent in any legal proceedings, we cannot predict the outcome of any legal proceedings. Legal proceedings are time-consuming, and may divert management’s attention from our business. Legal proceedings are also expensive and could result in substantial costs to us, including any damages we are required to pay and costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers. Please refer to the Risk Factor entitled “If we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement with Silicon Motion, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such damages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash resources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional capital for any such payments. Even if we are able to finance such payments through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, any material increase in our indebtedness would adversely affect our operating results and cash-\n\n61\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nflows as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations. Issuing additional shares of our common stock, if material, will result in dilution of existing shares outstanding. Any loan agreement is also expected to contain financial and operational covenants that would adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions.”\n\nWe have already incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial costs in connection with the previously pending merger, the termination of the Merger Agreement, and the related legal proceedings. Aside from any damages or settlement amounts we may be required to pay, these costs are primarily associated with the fees of our financial advisors, accountants, lenders, and legal counsel. Since the merger has been terminated, we will have received little or no benefit in respect of such costs incurred. We may also experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our suppliers, customers, customer prospects, and employees with regard to legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition or on the trading price of our common stock.\n\nIf we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement with Silicon Motion, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such damages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash resources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional capital for any such payments. Even if we are able to finance such payments through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, any material increase in our indebtedness would adversely affect our operating results and cash-flows as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations. Issuing additional shares of our common stock, if material, will result in dilution of existing shares outstanding. Any loan agreement is also expected to contain financial and operational covenants that would adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions.\n\nIf we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such damages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash resources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional capital for any such payments. However, if we finance all or a portion of the payment of damages or settlement amounts through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, any material payment and increase in our indebtedness would adversely affect our ability to use cash generated from operations as we repay interest and principal under the term loans and revolving credit facility, as applicable. Issuing additional shares of common stock, if material, would result in dilution of existing shares outstanding. In addition, our current credit agreement, and any new loan agreements, contain and would likely contain financial and operational covenants that may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain activities, including certain financing and acquisition transactions, any future stock repurchases, guarantees, and similar transactions, without obtaining the consent of the lenders, which may or may not be forthcoming. Such financial and operational covenants include compliance with a secured net leverage ratio test. Accordingly, outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders.\n\nSpecifically, if we are required to pay damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, including for alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, and we finance all or a portion of the payment of damages through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, any materially increased indebtedness could have important consequences to investors in our common stock, including the following:\n\n•our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, or other purposes may be limited or financing may be unavailable;\n\n•high interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers, and our distributors to obtain financing and service our respective interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on customer demand for our products as well as the business of our distributors; \n\n62\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\n•we could be subject to substantial variable interest rate risk because our interest rate under term loans typically varies based on a fixed margin over an indexed rate (such as for the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement) or an adjusted base rate. If interest rates were to continue to increase substantially, and we incur additional indebtedness, it would adversely affect our operating results and could affect our ability to service the indebtedness;\n\n•a portion of our cash flows is dedicated to the payment of interest and when applicable, principal, on our indebtedness and other obligations and will not be available for use in our business;\n\n•our level of indebtedness, combined with high interest rates, could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate, including limiting our future investments or ability to enter into acquisitions and strategic partnerships, and obtain financing for such transactions; and\n\n•our high degree of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and/or a downturn in our business, thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations.\n\nIf we fail to make required debt payments, or if we fail to comply with other covenants in our debt service agreements, we would be in default under the terms of these agreements. Subject to customary cure rights, any default would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate repayment of this debt and could cause defaults under other indebtedness that we have, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\nWe face intense competition and expect competition to increase in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and market share.\n\nThe global semiconductor market in general, and the broadband, wired and wireless infrastructure, and broader industrial and communications analog and mixed-signal markets in particular, are highly competitive. We compete in different target markets to various degrees on the basis of a number of principal competitive factors, including our products’ performance, features and functionality, energy efficiency, size, ease of system design, customer support, product roadmap, reputation, reliability and price. We expect competition to increase and intensify as a result of industry consolidation and the resulting creation of larger semiconductor companies. Large semiconductor companies resulting from industry consolidation could enjoy substantial market power, which they could exert through, among other things, aggressive pricing that could adversely affect our customer relationships, revenues, margins and profitability. In addition, we expect the internal resources of large, integrated OEMs may continue to enter our markets. Increased competition has resulted in price pressure, decreased demand, reduced revenue and profitability, and loss of market share, any of which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business, revenue, revenue growth rates, if any, and operating results.\n\nAs our products are integrated into a variety of communications and industrial platforms, our competitors range from large, international merchant semiconductor companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets, to internal or vertically integrated engineering groups within certain of our customers. Our primary merchant semiconductor competitors include Broadcom Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, Realtek Semiconductor Corp., Skyworks Solutions, Inc., Credo Semiconductor Inc., MediaTek, Inc., Marvell Technology Group Ltd., MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated, Analog Devices, Inc., Renesas Electronics Corporation, Microchip Technology Inc. and Semtech Corporation. It is quite likely that competition in the markets in which we participate will increase in the future as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings. In addition, other companies are in the process of developing competing products for our current and target markets. Because our products often are building block semiconductors which provide functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits, we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits, some of which may be existing customers or platform partners that develop their own integrated circuit products. If we cannot offer an attractive solution for applications where our competitors offer more fully integrated products, we may lose significant market share to our competitors. Some of our targeted customers for our optical interconnect solutions are module makers who are vertically integrated, where we compete with internally supplied components, and we compete with much larger analog and mixed-signal catalog competitors in the multi-market high-performance analog markets.\n\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on factors both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. During past periods of downturns in our industry, competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as manufacturers of semiconductors reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand similar adverse economic or market conditions in the future. Moreover, the competitive landscape is changing as a result of intense \n\n63\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nconsolidation within our industry as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors, and other competitors have begun to collaborate with each other, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape. In addition, changes in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, as well as actions by government agencies, could limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers and adversely affect our ability to compete successfully. These developments may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets. See the risk factors “We also are subject to risks associated with international geopolitical and military conflicts” and “We will lose sales if we are unable to obtain or retain government authorization to export certain of our products or technology or if such authorizations are revoked. In addition, we will be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations” below.\n\nGlobal economic conditions, including factors such as high inflation or a potential recession, could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nInflation and uncertainty in customer demand and the worldwide economy has continued, and we have experienced and could continue to experience volatility in our sales and revenues in the future. Inventory oversupply could potentially lead to more inventory write-downs, including charges for any excess or obsolete inventory which could negatively impact our gross margins. Our products are incorporated in numerous consumer devices, and demand for such products is ultimately driven by consumer demand for products such as televisions, personal computers, automobiles, and cable modems. Many of these purchases are discretionary. Global economic volatility and economic volatility in the specific markets in which the devices that incorporate our products are ultimately sold, including the impacts of current high rates of inflation and a potential recession, can cause extreme difficulties for our customers and third-party vendors in accurately forecasting and planning future business activities. If banks and financial institutions with whom we have banking relationships enter receivership or become insolvent in the future, we may be unable to access, and we may lose, some or all of our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to the extent those funds are not insured or otherwise protected by the FDIC. This unpredictability has and could continue to cause our customers to delay or reduce their capital expenditures and spending on our products, which delays and lengthens sales cycles and negatively affects the overall demand for our products. Worsening economic instability could continue to result in a cancellation of such orders or otherwise adversely affect spending for information technology and limit our ability to forecast future demand for our products, which could reduce expected revenues or result in a write-down of any excess or obsolete inventory. Furthermore, during inflationary economic times, our customers may face challenges in gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impact their ability to make timely payments to us. These events, together with economic volatility that may face the broader economy and, in particular, the semiconductor and communications industries, may adversely affect, our business, particularly to the extent that consumers decrease their discretionary spending for devices deploying our products. However, the magnitude of such volatility on our business and its duration is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n\nOther areas of our business which could be disrupted or subject to negative impacts of negative global economic conditions may include, but may not be limited to, the following: \n\n•Reduced ability to accurately predict our future revenue and budget future expenses;\n\n•Inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in design win, product development, production and fulfillment;\n\n•Accounts receivable collection issues should any of our limited and significant customers experience liquidity concerns;\n\n•Material impacts to the value of our common stock, which may result in impairment of our goodwill;\n\n•Material impairment of our assets, if recoverability thereof becomes a concern; and\n\n•Decreased availability of capital or access thereto in the United States and from other jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The current downturn, which was aggravated by certain factors such as high interest rates and excess channel inventory, has resulted in, or any future downturns may result in, diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of our average selling prices. Furthermore, any future upturn in the semiconductor \n\n64\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nindustry could result in increased competition for access to third-party foundry and assembly capacity. We are dependent on the availability of this capacity to manufacture and assemble all of our products. None of our third-party foundry or assembly contractors has provided assurances that adequate capacity will be available to us in the future. A significant downturn or upturn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\nA significant variance in our operating results or rates of growth, if any, could continue to lead to substantial volatility in our stock price. Our revenue has declined, and we may not sustain our current level of revenue, which has declined, and/or manage future growth effectively. The impact of excess inventory in the channel has continued to influence our customers’ expected demand for certain of our products and negatively impact our revenue.\n\nOur net revenue decreased from $567.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $268.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the decline in net revenue could continue in future periods. Among other factors, the decrease is as a result of macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand; for example, the broadband market which has experienced slower than expected recovery. Prior to 2023, our net revenues grew to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. We currently expect that revenue will fluctuate in the future, from period-to-period, consistent with the cyclical nature of our industry, and we could experience further decline in revenue in the future due to current macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand for various products. Further, the impact of excess inventory in the channel has continued to influence our customers’ expected demand for some of our products and negatively affected our revenue. \n\nIn addition, in July 2024, we initiated the 2024 Workforce Reduction and in the first half of 2024, we completed notifications to remaining affected employees regarding the 2023 Workforce Reductions. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements from the reductions of our workforce if our revenue continues to decline. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from reductions of our workforce, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. \n\nYou should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance. Please refer to the Risk Factor entitled “Our revenue and operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors that could adversely affect our business and our stock price” for a discussion of factors contributing to variances in our operating results or rates of growth, if any. If we are unable to resume adequate revenue growth and manage our operating expenses, our financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline.\n\nTo manage any future growth successfully, we believe we must effectively, among other things:\n\n•successfully develop new products and penetrate new applications and markets;\n\n•recruit, hire, train and manage additional qualified engineers for our research and development activities, especially in the positions of design engineering, product and test engineering and applications engineering;\n\n•implement and improve our administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls; and\n\n•enhance our information technology support for enterprise resource planning and design engineering by adapting and expanding our systems and tool capabilities, and properly training new hires as to their use.\n\nIf we are unable to resume and manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new products and we may fail to satisfy customer requirements, maintain product quality, execute our business plan, or respond to competitive pressures.\n\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by military conflicts, geopolitical and economic tensions among or with countries in which we conduct business, including between the United States and China, Israel (and its conflicts with Iran and Lebanon), and among other countries. For example, as more entities are added to restricted export control lists, or as semiconductor technology exports to other countries are further controlled, our need to seek authorization from the U.S. government may impact our ability to do business.\n\nWe sell our products throughout the world. Products shipped to Asia accounted for 72% of our net revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, approximately 77% of our employees are located outside of the United States. The majority of our products are manufactured, assembled and tested in Asia, and our major distributors are located in Asia. Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we \n\n65\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\noperate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include:\n\n•changes in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions, including as a result of the upcoming U.S. presidential election;\n\n•geopolitical conflicts and tensions, especially between the United States and China, that could destabilize trading relationships and economic activity;\n\n•restrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments and trade protection measures, including export controls and restrictions, duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs;\n\n•disruptions of capital and trading markets;\n\n•changes in import and/or export control restrictions and regulations by governments, such as changes to licensing requirements or other anti-diversion enforcement measures, as a result of ongoing armed conflict and geopolitical tensions among the United States, China, Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, and other countries or due to a change in administration from the upcoming U.S. presidential election;\n\n•transportation delays;\n\n•civil disturbances or political instability;\n\n•other unpredictable geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups, including the current conflict in Israel and continued escalation of Israel’s conflicts with Iran and Lebanon;\n\n•differing employment practices and labor standards;\n\n•limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;\n\n•local business and cultural factors that differ from our customary standards and practices;\n\n•nationalization and expropriation;\n\n•changes in tax laws;\n\n•public health emergencies, such as another outbreak of COVID-19 or other communicable disease;\n\n•currency fluctuations relating to our international operating activities; and\n\n•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support.\n\nIn addition to a significant portion of our wafer supply coming from Taiwan, Singapore, China and South Korea, substantially all of our products undergo packaging and final testing in Taiwan, Singapore, China, South Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand. Any conflict or uncertainty in these countries, including due to geopolitical conditions, natural disasters, public health or safety concerns, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the government of any country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards for products manufactured in or imported into their country that are not widely shared, it may lead some of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country, require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt cross-border manufacturing relationships which, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nWe also are subject to risks associated with international geopolitical and military conflicts. \n\nOur business has been impacted and may continue to be impacted by geopolitical conditions such as international trade wars (including between the United States and China), the military conflict in Israel, including the escalation in its conflicts with Iran and Lebanon, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and increased political tensions in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Currently, significant uncertainty surrounds the future trade relationships among the United States, China, and Russia. The U.S. government continues to make significant changes in U.S. trade policies that could negatively affect our business, and there may be further changes in U.S. trade policy if there is a change in administration as a result of the upcoming U.S. \n\n66\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\npresidential election. Additionally, policies made by other countries, such as China and Russia or their allies, could also negatively impact our business. In a number of cases, compliance with these policies has required us to take actions adverse to our business.\n\nBeginning in May 2019, we ceased normal business operations with entities affiliated with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., and certain other entities following an amendment to the EAR which added these entities to the Entity List for acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy of the United States. We obtained export licenses for certain transactions with these entities. As noted above, such export licenses can be revoked or BIS could choose not to renew such licenses and we have been required by BIS to pause, delay or halt licensed activities under such licenses at certain times and could continue to do so in the future, which negatively impacts our revenue. Also, as described in more detail in the risk factor, “We will lose sales if we are unable to obtain or retain government authorization to export certain of our products or technology related to the development or production of our products or if such authorizations are revoked, and we will be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations”, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, was added to the BIS Entity list in December 2020.\n\nIn September 2020, we further restricted business operations with additional entities affiliated with Huawei when the BIS again amended the EAR to add such entities to the Entity List. \n\nSince October 2022, the United States government has taken steps to restrict the export of certain advanced semiconductor products and technology to the People’s Republic of China and/or certain companies located in China due to national security and human rights concerns.In October 2022, BIS announced additional restrictions on products and/or technology destined for use in the People’s Republic of China, including additional export controls and/or requirements on (1) certain advanced computing integrated circuits, computer commodities that contain such integrated circuits and certain semiconductor manufacturing items; (2) products and/or technologies that may be destined for facilities capable of producing certain advanced node integrated circuits; and (3) transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end uses. In October 2023, BIS announced additional restrictions on the export of certain advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing technology to China, primarily focused on integrated circuits with military, data center, or artificial intelligence applications. Pursuant to those October 2023 export control amendments, various categories of integrated circuits are now subject to export licensing and export control restrictions for export or reexport to China and certain other countries. We have confirmed that some of our products are subject to these new controls. BIS also announced restrictions on exports to (1) companies headquartered in China or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in China or Macau, and (2) end users in certain countries of concern, in order to prevent diversion of controlled products or technology to China. The United States government has also continued to add Chinese entities to the Entity List.We regularly monitor changes to applicable export control regulations to assess the impact to our business, if any. To date, none of our material customers located in China has been added to the Entity List or other restricted party list.\n\nThe BIS continues to add many new entities to the Entity List and Unverified List. As noted above and in the risk factor,\n\n“Changes in trade policies among the United States and other countries, in particular the imposition of new or higher tariffs\n\ncould place pressure on our average selling prices as our customers seek to offset the impact of increased tariffs on their own\n\nproducts. Increased tariffs or the imposition of other barriers to international trade could decrease demand and have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on our revenues and operating results” below, our ability to manufacture, sell or distribute products or technology will be limited if BIS further amends the EAR to add restrictions against parties who are or may be our customers. \n\nWe are required to obtain special licenses to conduct business with entities on the Entity List and to conduct additional diligence and recordkeeping, including obtaining user statements from entities on the Unverified List. Failure to obtain any required license would likely result in a loss of business and a corresponding negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\nWe cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, which products may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. In addition, there may be further changes in U.S. trade policy if there is a change in administration as a result of the upcoming U.S. presidential election. In response to the United States tightening export controls on China, China has instituted restrictions of its own that affect U.S. companies and may impact us and related entities. We have experienced weakening demand in China, and such future developments related to U.S.-China relations may also have an impact on our supply chain. Additionally, the geopolitical developments in relations between Taiwan and China could affect the supply of our products from Taiwan, including from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited, or TSMC. Such developments could \n\n67\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\ninclude restriction on the export of products from Taiwan to China and/or restriction on the import of Taiwanese-origin products into China. \n\nWe believe direct impacts of the U.S. and European economic sanctions against Russia and the military conflict in Ukraine are currently limited to volatility in the prices of metals used by our outsourced semiconductor assembly and test, or OSAT, supply chain, in particular around the supply of palladium, for which Russia is the top producer in the world, as well as increased fuel costs, which has global impact on transportation costs, including the shipping and delivery of our products. However, the magnitude of such price volatility on our business and its duration is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We currently do not sell product in Russia, or sell product to distributors for resale in Russia.\n\nThe ongoing military conflict in Israel, and the recent escalation in Israel’s conflicts with Iran and Lebanon, have resulted in our employees located in Israel having to perform military service and/or being negatively impacted by violence or political instability, which could interrupt business and increase costs associated with relocating employees, engaging with alternative third-party contractors or hiring additional employees outside of Israel. The United States has also imposed additional sanctions on Iran in response to attacks on Israel by Iran. As the conflict and its escalation continues, we cannot provide assurances that our business will not be impacted in the future.\n\nWe cannot provide assurances that we will not face disruptions of distribution arrangements in the future, including through the imposition of governmental prohibitions on selling our products to particular customers, further sanctions on Russia or other countries, and/or increases in costs of certain raw materials and transportation that will also adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Loss of a key distributor or customer under similar circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues and operating results. \n\nChanges in trade policies among the United States and other countries, in particular the imposition of new or higher tariffs, could place pressure on our average selling prices as our customers seek to offset the impact of increased tariffs on their own products. Increased tariffs or the imposition of other barriers to international trade could decrease demand and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.\n\nThe United States has imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on certain products exported by a number of U.S. trading partners, including China, Europe, Canada, and Mexico. In response, many of those trading partners, including China, have imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on American products. We have experienced weakening demand in China, and continuing changes in government trade policies (including as a result of any change in administration due to the upcoming U.S. presidential election) create a heightened risk of further increased tariffs that impose barriers to international trade and could further decrease international demand. Our business and operating results are substantially dependent on international trade. Many of our manufacturers sell products incorporating our integrated circuits into international markets. \n\nTariffs on our customers’ products may adversely affect our gross profit margins in the future due to the potential for increased pressure on our selling prices by customers seeking to offset the impact of tariffs on their own products. In addition, tariffs could make our OEM and ODM customers’ products less attractive relative to products offered by their competitors, which may not be subject to similar tariffs. Some OEM and ODMs in our industry have already implemented short-term price adjustments to offset such tariffs and transitioned their production and supply chain to locations outside of China. We believe that increases in tariffs on imported goods or the failure to resolve current international trade disputes could further decrease demand and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\nFurthermore, compliance with export controls and implementation of additional tariffs may increase compliance costs and further affect our business and operating results.\n\nWe will lose sales if we are unable to obtain or retain government authorization to export certain of our products or technology related to the development or production of our products or if such authorizations are revoked, and we will be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations.\n\nCertain of our products and technologies are subject to export and/or import controls imposed by countries in which we do business, including the United States Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, administered by BIS. Certain of our products and technologies are subject to the EAR, which may require a license authorization from BIS prior to the shipment or sharing of certain products and technologies with certain end users or destinations. Such approval may be delayed, denied, or even revoked after initially being granted by BIS, depending on one or more factors including the type of product or technology at issue, the intended end use, the identity of the end user, the identity of other companies involved in the production process, and whether a license exception might apply, among others. We are subject to similar export controls regulations in other jurisdictions where we operate, including the European Union, Singapore, and Taiwan, among others.\n\n68\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nExport control laws, regulations, and orders are complex, change frequently and with limited or no notice, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified as U.S.-China geopolitical tensions worsen. Since October 2022, the United States has announced export control restrictions on a number of entities based in China due to national security and human rights concerns and additional more severe restrictions may be possible. The addition of new entities to restricted party lists can further increase the scope of export restrictions applicable to our business. The United States has also announced measures intended to further restrict the export of certain advanced semiconductor products and technology, as well as products that incorporate those advanced semiconductor products, to the People’s Republic of China, or China, and/or certain companies located in China due to national security and human rights concerns, including the imposition of new license requirements for certain semiconductor technologies. Failure to obtain required export licenses for our products or the placement of one or more of our customers on any restricted parties lists could significantly reduce our revenue and harm our business.\n\nObtaining export licenses can be difficult, costly and time-consuming and we may not always be successful in obtaining necessary export licenses due to reasons beyond our control. Our inability to obtain required import or export approval for our products may adversely affect our business, and other limitations imposed on our ability to export or sell our products may also harm our international and domestic revenue. In addition, it is possible that BIS can revoke licenses that have been granted or decline to re-issue such licenses upon their expiration or in the event modifications are required to a previously-issued license. Although our policies, procedures, and controls are designed to detect and prevent potential violations and maintain ongoing compliance with applicable export controls laws, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. For example, our products could be diverted to bad actors by third parties. In addition, if our customers or business partners fail to comply with applicable regulations and laws or to timely notify us of material changes to the licenses, we may be subject to liability and may be required to suspend sales or take other action which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. If we violate or fail to comply with any of these requirements, a range of consequences could result, including fines, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. The absence of comparable restrictions imposed on competitors based in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position.\n\nTo the extent that we do business with parties on the Entity List under approved export licenses, our business could be affected if the government delays, denies, or otherwise does not grant, amend, or renew required licenses. We currently have licenses from BIS that permit certain of our transactions with two restricted parties, but those licenses may be revoked at any time or denied for renewal when the license expires. One of our third-party foundry partners, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, was added to the BIS Entity list in December 2020. As a result of that Entity List listing, we have been required to obtain export licenses from BIS for the export or reexport to SMIC of any technology for the development or production (fabrication) of our products. Although we have obtained export licenses in order to have SMIC manufacture certain products for us, those export licenses could be revoked at any time. Revocation of any of those export licenses could significantly disrupt our ability to obtain the products in question and fulfill customer requirements. Moreover, the issuance of export licenses for other technology transfers to SMIC is a matter of discretion with the U.S. government, and it is uncertain whether we will be able to obtain export licenses, in a timely manner, for the transfer of technology required by SMIC to produce semiconductor wafers for us. If we are unable to obtain those export licenses, it may be necessary to have the products fabricated by other semiconductor foundries, which may be more costly alternatives to SMIC, and which may have limited capacity to fabricate sufficient products to meet our requirements. \n\nAdditionally, current and future business with parties subject to significant export restrictions, including those named on the Entity List may be limited in scope or suspended entirely in order to comply with the EAR or other applicable laws or regulations and, as a result, our revenue could be adversely impacted until a license is granted or renewed. It is possible that the U.S. government may not grant licenses or renew licenses to transact business with entities on the Entity List.\n\nIn September 2022, we self-identified a potential violation of the EAR related to certain transactions with one of our foundry partners in China on the Entity List in which limited technology was furnished to our Specific Foundry Partner without authorization under the EAR. Upon discovery, we took immediate action to remediate, including by implementing additional measures to prevent recurrence. Our Audit Committee engaged outside counsel to conduct a privileged investigation. On March 3, 2023, we submitted a comprehensive voluntary self-disclosure to BIS regarding the potential EAR violation described above and other potential export control violations. On June 8, 2023, BIS closed out its review of our voluntary self-disclosure without monetary or other penalties and with the issuance of a “warning letter.”\n\n69\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nWe depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, one or more of our major customers has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\n\nOur customers include electronics distributors, module makers, OEMs and ODMs, which incorporate our products in a wide range of electronic devices. Revenue is also generated from sales of intellectual property and consideration under intellectual property agreements. The recipients of such intellectual property are also referred to as the Company’s customers. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, one customer accounted for 13% of our net revenue, and our ten largest customers collectively accounted for 64% of our net revenue, of which distributor customers accounted for 15% of our net revenue. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have continued to experience a decrease in customer demand, and consequently a reduction in orders, primarily due to macroeconomic factors, including slower than expected recovery in sales, and excess inventory in the channel following the industry-wide supply shortage in 2021 and 2022. We expect that our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue to show a substantial percentage of sales dependent on a relatively small number of customers. In the future, these customers may decide, as they have at times before, not to purchase our products at all, may purchase fewer products than they did in the past, or may defer or cancel purchases or otherwise alter their purchasing patterns. While we are entitled to consideration under intellectual property sales agreements, which consideration has been and could be material, we may not receive such consideration in the future. Factors that could affect our revenue from these large customers include the following:\n\n•macroeconomic and business factors influencing such customers’ demand for our products, including excess inventory in the channel;\n\n•substantially all of our sales to date have been made on a purchase order basis, and we do not have long-term product purchase commitments with our customers;\n\n•some of our customers have sought or are seeking relationships with current or potential competitors which may affect their purchasing decisions; \n\n•service provider and OEM consolidation across cable, satellite, and fiber markets could result in significant changes to our customers’ technology development and deployment priorities and roadmaps, which could affect our ability to forecast demand accurately and could lead to increased volatility in our business; \n\n•technological changes in our markets could lead to substantial volatility in our revenues based on product transitions, and particularly in our broadband markets, we face risks based on changes in the way consumers are accessing and using broadband and cable services, which would affect operator demand for our products; and\n\n• any decrease in revenue generated by the recipient of intellectual property under certain intellectual property sale agreements, including due to any inability to enforce our intellectual property rights as described in the section “Risks Relating to Intellectual Property” under the risk factor “We utilize a significant amount of intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.”\n\nIn addition, delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic customers and negatively impact sales of the products under development. Moreover, it is possible that our customers may develop their own products or adopt a competitor’s solution for products that they currently buy from us. When this occurs, our sales could decline and/or our market share could be reduced.\n\nOur relationship with customers has been and could continue to be impaired by our sale of patents. For example, our customers are and could be subject to patent infringement based on patents we divested to the extent that our customers also source components from our competitors, such as those referenced in Part II, Item 1 (Legal Proceedings) of this report.\n\nOur relationships with some customers may deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products. To attract new customers or retain existing customers, we sometimes offer customers favorable prices on our products which results in a decline in our average selling prices and, if material, a decline in our gross margins. The loss of a key customer, a reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could seriously impact our revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n70\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nA significant portion of our revenues are from sales of product to distributors, who then resell our product. Our agreements with certain of these distributors provide protection against price reduction on their inventories of our products. The loss of certain distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and price reductions associated with their inventories of our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the event of a dramatic decline in selling prices for these products.\n\nIn addition, the current situation relating to trade with China and governmental and regulatory concerns relating to specific Chinese companies continue to remain fluid and unpredictable and may further change as a result of any change in administration from the upcoming U.S. presidential election. Products shipped to mainland China accounted for less than 10% of our net revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our current and future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by limitations on our ability to sell to one or more Chinese customers, as described in the section “Risks Related to Our Business” under the risk factors “We are also subject to risks associated with international geopolitical and military conflict” and “We will lose sales if we are unable to obtain or retain government authorization to export certain of our products or technology related to the development or production of our products or if such authorization are revoked, and we will be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations”, and by tariffs and other trade barriers that have or may be implemented by governmental authorities. \n\nAny legal proceedings or claims against us or potential violations of applicable regulations could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could harm our reputation regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn addition to the legal proceedings referenced in Part II, Item 1 (Legal Proceedings) of this report, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and/or inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property, product liability, employment, class action, customer claims, whistleblower and other litigation claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings regarding potential violations of applicable law, and we may not be successful in resolving such proceedings or inquiries. In addition, we have implemented a reduction in force and the attendant layoffs has resulted and could result in the risk of claims being made by or on behalf of affected employees. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, or require us to change our business practices. In addition, the expense of litigation or responding to inquiries and the timing of such expenses from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the potential risks, expenses, and uncertainties of litigation or government proceedings, we may, from time to time, resolve disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe have been and may in the future be subject to information technology failures, including security breaches, cyber-attacks, design defects or system failures, that could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.\n\nWe rely on our information technology systems for the effective operation of our business and for the secure maintenance and storage of confidential data relating to our business and third-party businesses. In June 2020, we announced a security incident resulting from a Maze ransomware attack affecting certain but not all operational systems within our information technology infrastructure. Because we did not satisfy the attacker’s monetary demands, on June 15, 2020, the attacker released online certain proprietary information obtained from our network. In response, our internal information technology team, supplemented by a leading cyber defense firm, took steps aimed at containing and assessing this incident, including implementing enhanced security controls aimed at protecting our information technology systems. Since that event, security breaches and incidents, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have continued to become more prevalent and sophisticated. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against or implement adequate preventive measures. We experience cyber-attacks of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and systems and notwithstanding our defensive measures, experienced programmers, hackers, state actors, or others may be able to penetrate our security controls through attacks such as phishing, impersonating authorized users, ransomware, viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, software supply chain attacks, exploitation of design flaws, bugs and other security weaknesses and vulnerabilities, covert introduction of malware to computers and networks, including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create heightened risk of cyber-attacks and attackers have used artificial intelligence and machine learning to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks against targets. Businesses we acquire may increase the scope and complexity of our information technology systems, and this may increase our risk exposure to cyber-attack when there are difficulties integrating diverse legacy systems that support operations for the acquired businesses. Our information technology infrastructure also includes products and services provided \n\n71\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nby third parties, and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products, or provide inadequate updates or support, which can impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information.\n\nA cybersecurity incident or other compromise of our information technology systems could result in unauthorized publication or misuse of confidential business or proprietary information belonging to us, a customer, supplier, employee or other third party, including personal data, result in violations of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation, cause us to incur direct losses if attackers initiate wire transfers or access our bank or investment accounts, or damage our reputation. More generally, any theft, loss, misuse, or other unauthorized processing of any confidential business or proprietary information, including personal data, collected, used, stored, transferred, or otherwise processed by us or on our behalf could result in significantly increased costs, expenses, damage to our reputation, and claims, litigation, demands, and regulatory investigations or other proceedings. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures either as a response to specific breaches or incidents or as a result of evolving risks could be significant. In addition, our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could adversely affect the timely and efficient operation of our business. Any delayed sales, significant costs or lost customers resulting from these technology failures could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. We also may face difficulties or delays in identifying and remediating and otherwise responding to any security breach or incident.\n\nFrom time-to-time, we upgrade software that we use in our business, including our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Our business may be disrupted if our software does not work as planned or if we experience issues relating to any implementation, or accessing our software as has happened in a previous cybersecurity attack, in which case we may be unable to timely or accurately prepare financial reports, make payments to our suppliers and employees, or ship to, invoice and collect from our customers.\n\nWe may be subject to supply chain attacks where threat actors attempt to inject malicious code into our products thus infecting our products and the systems of our customers. Any such supply chain attack could have magnified damages to our business as a direct result of the attack as well as due to a loss of credibility or reputation with our customers. Such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, and if successful, expose us and the affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations, including our manufacturing operations.\n\nThird parties with which we conduct business, such as foundries, assembly and test contractors, and distributors, have access to certain portions of our sensitive data, and we rely on third parties to store and otherwise process data for us. We are dependent on the information security systems of these third parties and they face substantial security risks similar to those outlined above. Any security breaches or incidents or other unauthorized access by third parties to the systems of our suppliers, service providers, or other third parties with access to our sensitive data, or the existence of computer viruses, ransomware or other malicious code in their data, software, or hardware, could result in disruptions or failures of systems used in our business, payments to fraudulent bank accounts, and expose us to a risk of loss, misappropriation, unavailability and other unauthorized processing of information. Any of the foregoing, or the perception any of them has occurred, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial results.\n\nAdditionally, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate or otherwise protect us with respect to claims, expenses, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, litigation, regulatory actions, or other impacts arising from any of the security breaches or incidents outlined above, or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any of these results could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results, potentially in a material manner.\n\nAverage selling prices of our products have previously decreased and could decrease in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margins.\n\nWe have and may in the future experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our operating results due to erosion of our average selling prices. From time to time, we have reduced the average unit price of our products due to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors, and for other reasons, and we expect that we will have to do so again in the future. In particular, we believe that industry consolidation has provided a number of larger semiconductor companies with substantial market power, which has had a material adverse impact on selling prices in some of our markets. If we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or introducing new products with higher margins, our revenue and gross margins will suffer. To support our gross margins, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our and our customers’ costs. Our inability to do so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline. In addition, under certain of our agreements with key distributors, \n\n72\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nwe provide protection for reductions in selling prices of the distributors’ inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results if the selling prices for those products fell dramatically. \n\nIf we fail to penetrate new applications and markets, our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe sell a significant portion of our products to manufacturers of cable broadband voice and data modems and gateways, satellite outdoor units, optical modules for long-haul and metro telecommunications markets, and RF transceivers and modem solutions for wireless infrastructure markets. Our product offerings also include broadband data access, power management and interface technologies which are ubiquitous functions in new and existing markets such as wireless and wireline communications infrastructure, broadband access, industrial, enterprise network, and automotive applications. We have further expanded our product offerings to include Wi-Fi, ethernet and broadband gateway processor SoCs and intellectual property that utilizes patented machine learning techniques to improve signal integrity and power efficiency in SoCs, ASICs, and field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, used in next-generation communication and artificial intelligence systems. Our future revenue growth, if any, will depend in part on our ability to further penetrate into, and expand beyond, these markets with analog, digital and mixed-signal solutions targeting the markets for Wi-Fi and broadband, high-speed optical interconnects for data center, metro, and long-haul optical modules, telecommunications wireless infrastructure, and cable DOCSIS 3.1 network infrastructure products. Each of these markets presents distinct and substantial risks. If any of these markets do not develop as we currently anticipate, or if we are unable to penetrate them successfully, it could materially and adversely affect our revenue and revenue growth rate, if any.\n\nBroadband data modems and gateways and video gateways continue to represent a significant North American and European revenue generator. The North American and European Pay-TV market is dominated by a few OEMs, including Vantiva SA, Commscope Holding Company, Inc., Hitron Technologies Inc., Compal Broadband Networks, Inc., Humax Co., Ltd., and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. These OEMs are large multinational corporations with negotiating power relative to us and are undergoing significant consolidation. Securing design wins with any of these companies requires a substantial investment of our time and resources. Even if we succeed, additional testing and operational certifications will be required by the OEMs’ customers, which include large Pay-TV television companies such as Comcast Corporation, Liberty Global plc, Charter Communications, Inc., Sky UK Limited, AT&T Inc. and EchoStar Corporation. In addition, our products will need to be compatible with other components in our customers’ designs, including components produced by our competitors or potential competitors. There can be no assurance that these other companies will support or continue to support our products.\n\nIf we fail to penetrate these or other new markets upon which we target our resources, our revenue and revenue growth rate, if any, likely will decrease over time and our financial condition could suffer.\n\nA significant portion of our revenue is attributable to demand for our products in markets for broadband solutions, and development delays and consolidation trends among cable and satellite Pay-TV and broadband operators could adversely affect our future revenues and operating results.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue directly attributable to broadband applications accounted for approximately 32% and 30% of our net revenue, respectively. We have experienced a decrease in broadband net revenue of $82.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and negative impact to our revenues is expected to continue in the fourth quarter of 2024 and possibly beyond due to slower than expected recovery in this market. Delays in the development of, or unexpected developments in, the broadband markets, including international macroeconomic headwinds, has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on order activity by OEMs in these markets for the fourth quarter of 2024 and possibly thereafter and, as a result, on our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition. In addition, consolidation trends among Pay-TV and broadband operators may continue, which could delay or lead to cancellations of major spending programs and have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and financial condition. \n\n73\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nWe may be unable to make the substantial and productive research and development investments that are required to remain competitive in our business.\n\nThe semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products. Many of our products originated with our research and development efforts, which we believe have provided us with a significant competitive advantage. For nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, our research and development expense was $173.9 million and $204.3 million, respectively. While we have decreased our research and development spending to meet evolving demand, we expect our research and development expenses to increase in future years when we return to expanding our product portfolio and enhancing existing products. We monitor such expenditures as part of our strategy of devoting focused research and development efforts on the development of innovative and sustainable product platforms. We are committed to investing in new product development internally in order to stay competitive in our markets and plan to maintain research and development and design capabilities for new solutions in advanced semiconductor process nodes such as 16nm and 5nm and beyond, as well as to address challenges of capturing and processing high quality broadband communications and high-speed optical interconnect signals. However, we do not know whether we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development required to remain competitive as semiconductor process nodes continue to shrink and become increasingly complex. In addition, we cannot assure you that the technologies that are the focus of our research and development expenditures will become commercially successful. Furthermore, we currently receive grants from certain non-U.S. governments, but those grants and any future grants may not be available to us in the future.\n\nThe complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses caused by undetected defects or bugs, which could reduce the market acceptance of our new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and adversely affect our operating costs.\n\nHighly complex products like our Wi-Fi and broadband RF receivers and RF receiver SoCs, physical medium devices for optical modules, RF transceiver and modem solutions for wireless infrastructure markets, and high-performance analog solutions may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released. Where any of our products, including legacy acquired products, contain defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we may not be able to successfully correct these problems. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers, and our financial results. In addition, these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers. If any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product, we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs, and our operating costs could be adversely affected. These problems may also result in warranty or product liability claims against us by our customers or others that may require us to make significant expenditures to defend these claims or pay damage awards. In the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we compensate the affected customer. We maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance is limited in amount and subject to significant deductibles. There is no guarantee that our insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all claims. We also may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of one of our customers’ products containing one of our devices. The process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources, and we may incur significant replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm. Costs or payments made in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations, and ability to obtain future coverage. Although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses, any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results. Although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance, if a catastrophic product liability claim were to occur, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate, may not cover the claims, and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\n\nOur revenue and operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors that could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\n\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. For example, our revenue declined from $567.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $268.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and revenue could continue to decline. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and on an annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\n•seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets;\n\n74\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\n•overall demand volatility for semiconductor solutions across a diverse range of communications, industrial and multi-market applications;\n\n•changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers;\n\n•the receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers;\n\n•fluctuations in the levels of component inventories held by our customers;\n\n•the gain or loss of significant customers;\n\n•market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products;\n\n•our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and technologies on a timely basis;\n\n•size and timing of any consideration received under our intellectual property sale agreements;\n\n•the availability and cost of products from our suppliers;\n\n•the timing and extent of operating expenses, including costs related to product development and personnel compensation and benefits;\n\n•new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;\n\n•incurrence of research and development and related new product expenditures;\n\n•government actions, by the United States, China or other countries, that impose barriers or restrictions that would impact our ability to sell or ship products to customers;\n\n•currency fluctuations;\n\n•fluctuations in manufacturing yields of integrated circuits;\n\n•significant warranty claims, including those not covered by our suppliers;\n\n•changes in our product mix or customer mix;\n\n•potential indemnification claims, including those arising as a result of our contractual arrangements or intellectual property disputes;\n\n•intellectual property disputes;\n\n•timing and extent of product development costs;\n\n•loss of key personnel or inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified skilled workers; \n\n•impairment of long-lived assets, including masks and production equipment; and \n\n•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products.\n\n75\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nIf our growth rate continues to slow, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. We typically are required to incur substantial development costs in advance of a prospective sale with no certainty that we will ever recover these costs. A substantial amount of time may pass between a design win and the generation of revenue related to the expenses previously incurred, which can potentially cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales, research and development costs. Any failure to adjust spending or our operations quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify its adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impaired and our competitive position could be harmed.\n\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence. To compete successfully, we must design, develop, market and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability and meet the cost expectations of our customers. The introduction of new products by our competitors, the market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future products obsolete. Our failure to anticipate or timely develop new or enhanced products or technologies in response to technological shifts has resulted, and could in the future, result in decreased revenue and our competitors winning more competitive bid processes, known as “design wins.” In particular, we may experience difficulties with product design, manufacturing, marketing or certification that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products. If we fail or are slow to introduce new or enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers or penetrate new markets in a timely fashion, as has happened previously or in the future, we will lose market share and our operating results will be adversely affected.\n\nIn particular, we believe that we will need to develop new products in part to respond to changing dynamics and trends in our end user markets, including (among other trends) consolidation among cable and satellite operators, potential industry shifts away from the hardware devices and other technologies that incorporate certain of our products, advances in artificial intelligence, and changes in consumer television viewing habits and how consumers access and receive broadcast content and digital broadband services. We cannot predict how these trends will continue to develop or how or to what extent they may affect our future revenues and operating results. We believe that we will need to continue to make substantial investments in research and development in an attempt to ensure a product roadmap that anticipates these types of changes; however, we cannot provide any assurances that we will accurately predict the direction in which our markets will evolve or that we will be able to develop, market, or sell new products that respond to such changes successfully or in a timely manner, if at all.\n\n76\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties, and differences between our estimates of customer demand and product mix and our actual results could continue to negatively affect our inventory levels, sales and operating results.\n\nOur revenue is generated on the basis of shipments of products under purchase orders with our customers rather than long-term purchase commitments. In addition, our customers can and have requested to cancel purchase orders or defer the shipments of our products under certain circumstances. Our products are manufactured using a silicon foundry according to our estimates of customer demand, which requires us to make separate demand forecast assumptions for every customer, each of which may introduce significant variability into our aggregate estimate. We have limited visibility into future customer demand and the product mix that our customers will require, which has in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our revenue forecasts and operating margins. Also, as customer lead times continue to improve, we have seen and expect to continue to see a more normalized demand-planning horizon. Moreover, because our target markets are relatively new, many of our customers have difficulty accurately forecasting their product requirements and estimating the timing of their new product introductions, which ultimately affects their demand for our products. Historically, because of this limited visibility, actual results have been different from our forecasts of customer demand. Some of these differences have been material which has led to and could continue to lead to excess inventory or product shortages and revenue and margin forecasts above those we were actually able to achieve. These differences may occur in the future, and the adverse impact of these differences between forecasts and actual results could grow if we are not successful in expanding the customer base for our products. In addition, the rapid pace of innovation in our industry could render significant portions of our inventory obsolete. Excess or obsolete inventory levels has resulted and continue to result in unexpected expenses or increases in our reserves that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we were to underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity were unavailable, we could forego revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any significant future cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products due to manufacturing defects could materially and adversely impact our profit margins, increase our write-offs due to product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.\n\nWe may have difficulty accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses particularly as we seek to enter new markets where we may not have prior experience.\n\nOur operating history had historically focused on developing integrated circuits for specific applications and more recently, the wired whole-home broadband connectivity market and markets for wireless telecommunications infrastructure and power management and interface technologies which are ubiquitous functions in wireless and wireline communications infrastructure, broadband access, industrial, enterprise network, and automotive applications. As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand our addressable market into new product categories. For example, we expanded intothe markets for Wi-Fi, ethernet and broadband gateway processor SoCs and intellectual property that utilizes patented machine learning techniques to improve signal integrity and power efficiency in SoCs, ASICs, and FPGAs used in next-generation communication and artificial intelligence systems. Our limited operating experience in new markets or potential markets we may enter, combined with the rapidly evolving nature of our markets in general, substantial uncertainty concerning how these markets may develop and other factors beyond our control reduces our ability to accurately forecast quarterly or annual revenue. If our revenue does not increase particularly in new markets, we could continue to incur significant losses due to our higher expense levels if we are not able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall in current or future revenue.\n\nOur customers require our products and our third-party contractors to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process which does not assure product sales.\n\nPrior to purchasing our products, our customers require that both our products and our third-party contractors undergo extensive qualification processes, which involve testing of the products in the customer’s system and rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or more. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not assure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to our solutions, or changes in our customer’s manufacturing process or our selection of a new supplier may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, sales of this product to the customer may be precluded or delayed, which may result in a decrease in our revenue and cause our business to suffer.\n\n77\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nWinning business is subject to lengthy competitive selection processes that require us to incur significant expenditures. Even if we begin a product design, customers may decide to cancel or change their product plans, which could cause us to generate no revenue from a product and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nWe are focused on securing design wins to develop RF receivers and RF receiver SoCs, MoCA and G.hn SoCs, DBS-ODU SoCs, physical medium devices for optical modules, interface and power management devices, and SoC solutions targeting infrastructure opportunities within the telecommunications, wireless, industrial and multi-market and Wi-Fi and broadband operator markets for use in our customers’ products. These selection processes typically are lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures and dedicate scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that some of our customers’ products likely will have short life cycles. Although this has not occurred to date, failure to obtain a design win could prevent us from offering an entire generation of a product. This could cause us to lose revenue and require us to write off obsolete inventory, and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes. After securing a design win, we may experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development cycle typically required. Our customers generally take a considerable amount of time to evaluate our products. The typical time from early engagement by our sales force to actual product introduction runs from nine to twelve months for the broadband and communications market, and 36 months or longer for industrial, wired and wireless infrastructure markets. The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel, curtail, reduce or delay its product plans, causing us to lose anticipated sales. In addition, any delay or cancellation of a customer’s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we may have incurred significant expense and generated no revenue. Finally, our customers’ failure to successfully market and sell their products could reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were unable to generate revenue after incurring substantial expenses to develop any of our products, our business would suffer.\n\nOur business is subject to various international and U.S. laws and governmental regulations, and compliance with these laws and regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses. A failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\n\nOur business is subject to various laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions where we do business, including but not limited to laws, regulations and other legal requirements related to packaging; product content; labor and employment; import and customs; export controls; anti-corruption; personal and data privacy; cybersecurity; human rights; conflict minerals; environment, health and safety; competition and antitrust; and intellectual property ownership and infringement. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and with little or no notice, occasionally are conflicting or ambiguous, and have generally become more stringent over time. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and we may be required to incur significant costs to remedy any potential gaps or violations that are identified. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. Although our policies, procedures, and controls are designed to detect and prevent potential violations and maintain ongoing compliance with applicable laws, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with such laws and regulations. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other penalties or sanctions. The costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of any investigations, remediation, auditing and monitoring) could adversely affect our current or future business.\n\n78\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nAs indicated elsewhere in this report, we do a substantial portion of our business in Asia, including in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China, or China. Since October 2022, the United States has taken steps to restrict the export of certain advanced semiconductor products and technology to China as well as a number of specific Chinese companies, due to national security and human rights concerns. There has also been a substantial focus by regulators in the United States and Europe on the business practices of certain major Chinese technology companies. Complying with changing export control laws may require us to develop additional policies, procedures, and controls, or incur additional costs, including in connection with the development or performance of additional due diligence in order to prevent diversion of restricted products or technology to China, Russia, or other destinations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also result in the loss of revenue. Since October 2022, we have restricted shipments and exports to certain major Chinese technology companies, including a semiconductor foundry and OSAT providers. While we intend to continue to conduct our businesses in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to export controls and anti-corruption, it is possible that the nature of our business and customers could result in a review of our relationships and practices by regulatory authorities. At times, we may discover issues that we bring to the attention of the relevant government agencies, as we did on March 3, 2023, when we submitted a comprehensive voluntary self-disclosure to BIS regarding the potential EAR violation described above and other potential export control violations. Although the March 2023 voluntary self-disclosure to BIS resulted in a warning letter, we could incur increased administrative and legal costs in order to remediate any potential compliance gaps or violations, to respond to any inquiries, or in connection with the preparation and submission of any voluntary self-disclosures to the government agencies, as appropriate. Any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulatory approvals could adversely affect our business and operating results. We have implemented policies and procedures, including adoption of an anti-corruption policy and procedures with respect to applicable export control laws, but there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prove effective.\n\nOur products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. If we fail to adequately address any of these rules or regulations, our business could be harmed.\n\nIn addition, climate change and new or revised rules and regulations related thereto, including regulations with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and regulations enacted by the SEC and recent legislation enacted in California, may impact our business in numerous ways. Climate change and its effects could lead to further increases in raw material prices or their reduced availability due to, for example, increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events and any supply chain disruptions resulting therefrom, and could cause increased incidence of disruption to the production and distribution of our products and an adverse impact on consumer demand and spending. For example, as a fabless semiconductor company, we outsource our manufacturing to countries outside of the United States, and our manufacturers’ suppliers reside in areas that are more susceptible to extreme weather impacts. If our suppliers have difficulty obtaining raw materials and natural resources due to extreme weather impacts, this could increase the cost associated with extraction of raw materials or limit the supply available for our key suppliers to manufacture our products, driving the cost up for us and/or threaten our upstream supply chain. In recent months, there have been substantial legislative and regulatory developments on climate-related issues, including proposed, issued and implemented legislation and rulemakings that would require companies to assess and/or disclose climate metrics, risks, opportunities, policies and practices. For example, on March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted rules mandating climate-related disclosures that would require increased climate change-related disclosure in our periodic reports and other filings with the SEC for fiscal year 2025 and beyond, which were stayed on April 4, 2024. The potential impact to us of these legislative and regulatory developments is uncertain at this time, although we expect that the emerging legal and regulatory requirements on climate-related issues will result in additional compliance and may require us to spend or add significant resources and divert management attention. We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully adapt our operations in response to any climate-related changes or comply with any increased reporting obligations in a cost-effective manner, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe must also conform the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, we could be required to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\n\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain qualified personnel and senior management, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer.\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified personnel, including our management, sales and marketing and finance teams, and especially our design and technical staff. In July 2024, we initiated the 2024 Workforce Reduction, and previously, in March and October 2023, we initiated the 2023 Workforce Reductions, to align our \n\n79\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\noperational needs with the changes in macroeconomic conditions and the demand environment. These workforce reductions may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our intended reduction in workforce and reduced employee morale, which may cause our employees who were not affected by the reduction in workforce to seek alternate employment. Employees whose positions were eliminated or those who determine to seek alternate employment may seek employment with our competitors. In addition, our reductions in workforce may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy and respond rapidly to any new product, growth or revenue opportunities. Additionally, reductions in workforce may make it more difficult to recruit and retain new employees. If we need to increase the size of our workforce in the future, we may encounter a competitive hiring market due to labor shortages, increased employee turnover, changes in the availability of workers and increased wage costs. Employee litigation related to the reduction of our workforce could be costly and time-consuming. \n\nWe do not know whether we will be able to attract and retain the required and desirable personnel as we continue to pursue our business strategy. Historically, we have encountered difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified engineers because there is a limited pool of engineers with the expertise required in our field, and expect to continue facing such difficulties in seeking talent. Competition for these personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our design and technical personnel represent a significant asset. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the high-technology industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock-based compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment. We have experienced declines in the market price of our stock and reductions in force which could adversely affect our ability to attract, motivate or retain key employees. In addition, our future performance also depends on the ability of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. Our employment arrangements with our employees do not generally require that they continue to work for us for any specified period, and therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees, especially our management and key design and technical personnel, or our inability to retain, attract and motivate our management and qualified design and technical and other personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOur future success also depends on the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel. None of our senior management team or other key personnel is bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a specified period. In addition, we have not entered into non-compete agreements with members of our senior management team or other key personnel, except in limited circumstances (e.g., in connection with the acquisition of other companies). We are fortunate that certain members of our senior management team have long tenures with us, but recently we also have been required to recruit new members of senior management. With respect to recruitment and retention of senior management, we need to ensure that our compensation programs provide sufficient recruitment and retention incentives as well as incentives to achieve our long-term strategic business and financial objectives. We expect competition for individuals with our required skill sets, particularly technical and engineering skills, to remain intense even in weak global macroeconomic environments. The loss of any member of our senior management team or other key personnel could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our aggregate indebtedness was $125.0 million, and we are subject to a variable amount of interest on the principal balance of our credit agreements and could continue to be adversely impacted by high interest rates in the future. Such indebtedness adversely affects our operating results and cash-flows as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations and contains financial and operational covenants that could adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions. In addition, high interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers, and our distributors to obtain financing and service our respective interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on customer demand for our products and our distributors’ business. \n\nAs of September 30, 2024, our aggregate indebtedness was $125.0 million from an initial secured term B loan facility, or the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement. The June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement also provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million, or the Revolving Facility, which remains undrawn as of September 30, 2024. The credit agreement also permits us to request incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the sum of an amount equal to the greater of (x) $175.0 million and (y) 100% of “Consolidated EBITDA” (as defined in such agreement), plus the amount of certain voluntary prepayments, plus an unlimited amount that is subject to pro forma compliance with certain first lien net leverage ratio, secured net leverage ratio and total net leverage ratio tests. The June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement was amended on June 29, 2023 to implement a benchmark replacement.\n\n80\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nThe Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement has a seven-year term expiring in June 2028 and bears interest at either an Adjusted Term SOFR plus a fixed applicable margin of 2.25% or an Adjusted Base Rate plus a fixed applicable margin of 1.25%, at our option. Commencing on September 30, 2021, the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement amortizes in equal quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount, with the balance payable on June 23, 2028. We are subject to commitment fees ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Facility, and any outstanding loans under the Revolving Facility will bear interest at either an Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of 1.00% to 1.75% or an Adjusted Base Rate plus a margin of 0% to 0.75%. Our obligations under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the credit agreement. Such obligations, including the guaranties, are secured by substantially all of our assets and those of the subsidiary guarantors.\n\nOur material indebtedness adversely affects our operating expenses through increased interest payment obligations and adversely affects our ability to use cash generated from operations as we repay interest at a variable rate, and principal under the term loans. In addition, the Revolving Facility provisions under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement include financial covenants such as an initial maximum secured net leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00, which temporarily increases to 3.75 to 1.00 following the consummation of certain material permitted acquisitions, and operational covenants that may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain activities, including obtaining additional financing, granting liens, undergoing certain fundamental changes, or making investments or certain restricted payments, and selling assets, and similar transactions, without obtaining the consent of the lenders, which may or may not be forthcoming. The Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement is only subject to operational covenants. Lastly, our borrowing costs can be affected by periodic credit ratings from independent rating agencies. Such ratings are largely based on our performance, which may be measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. Accordingly, outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions.\n\nSpecifically, our indebtedness and high interest rates have important consequences to investors in our common stock, including the following:\n\n•high interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers, and our distributors to obtain financing and service our respective interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on customer demand for our products as well as the business of our distributors;\n\n•we are subject to variable interest rate risk because our interest rate under the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement varies based on a fixed margin of 2.25% per annum over an adjusted Term SOFR rate or 1.25% per annum over an adjusted base rate and our interest rate for any outstanding principal under the revolving credit facility varies based a margin of 0% to 0.75% over adjusted base rate or a margin of 1.00% to 1.75% over an adjusted Term SOFR rate, and we are also subject to commitment fees ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Facility. If interest rates were to continue to increase substantially, it would adversely affect our operating results and could affect our ability to service our indebtedness; \n\n•a portion of our cash flows is dedicated to the payment of interest and when applicable, principal, on our indebtedness and other obligations and will not be available for use in our business;\n\n•our level of indebtedness, combined with high interest rates, could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate, including limiting our future investments or ability to enter into acquisitions and strategic partnerships, and obtain financing for such transactions; and\n\n•our high degree of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and/or a downturn in our business, thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations.\n\nIf we fail to make required debt payments, or if we fail to comply with financial or other covenants in our debt service agreements, which include a maximum leverage ratio, we would be in default under the terms of these agreements. Subject to customary cure rights, any default would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate repayment of this debt and could cause defaults under other indebtedness that we have, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\n\n81\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nWe and our subsidiaries may, subject to any limitations in the terms of our existing loan facilities, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, recapitalize our debt or take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of our term loans that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments under the indebtedness when due. If we incur any additional debt, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify. Please refer to the Risk Factor entitled “If we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement with Silicon Motion, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such damages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash resources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional capital for any such payments. Even if we are able to finance such payments through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, any material increase in our indebtedness would adversely affect our operating results and cash-flows as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations. Issuing additional shares of our common stock, if material, will result in dilution of existing shares outstanding. Any loan agreement is also expected to contain financial and operational covenants that would adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions”. \n\nWe are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity, and any inability of us to comply with such obligations may negatively impact our business.\n\nThe legislative, enforcement policy and regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and cybersecurity issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and complex and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We collect and otherwise process data, including personal data and other regulated or sensitive data, as part of our business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including China, the European Union and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal data, and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are currently more restrictive than those in the U.S. These laws may require that our overall information technology security environment meet certain standards and/or be certified. For example, effective May 2018, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that imposed stringent data protection requirements and provided for greater penalties for noncompliance. The United Kingdom has adopted legislation that substantially implements the GDPR and provides for a similar penalty structure. Similarly, California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which took effect in 2020. The CCPA gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt out of certain sharing of their information, and imposes penalties for failure to comply. California has adopted a new law, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 that substantially expands the CCPA and was effective as of January 1, 2023. Additionally, other U.S. states continue to propose and enact privacy and security-focused legislation. In addition, governments around the world continue to enact laws relating to privacy and data security. For example, in 2021, the National People’s Congress passed the Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China, or the Data Security Law and the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China, or PIPL. The Data Security Law is the first comprehensive data security legislation in the People’s Republic of China, or China, and aims to regulate a wide range of issues in relation to the collection, storage, processing, use, provision, transaction and publication of any kind of data. In March 2024, the Cyberspace Administration of China published the Provisions on Promoting and Standardizing Cross-Border Data Flows to implement the mechanisms for the cross-border data transfers, including the security assessment. These regulations contain provisions that allow substantial government oversight and include fines for failure to obtain required approval from China’s cyber and data protection regulators for cross-border personal data-related data transfers. However, there is still some uncertainty in how regulators will interpret and enforce these laws.\n\nThe laws outlined above are only a sample of the governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity to which we are subject. Various aspects of these laws, including their interpretation and enforcement, remain unclear, resulting in further uncertainty and potentially requiring us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Because the interpretation and application of many such laws and regulations, remain uncertain and continue to evolve, it is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products or solutions, and we could face fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and other claims and penalties, and we could be required to fundamentally change our products or our business practices, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, or to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, even if unfounded, \n\n82\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\ncould result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nOur products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted by end users in our markets.\n\nGenerally, our products comprise only a part or parts of a communications device. All components of these devices must uniformly comply with industry standards in order to operate efficiently together. We depend on companies that provide other components of the devices to support prevailing industry standards. Many of these companies are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are. Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our customers or end users. If larger companies do not support the same industry standards that we do, or if competing standards emerge, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected, which would harm our business.\n\nProducts for communications applications are based on industry standards that are continually evolving. Our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards. The emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by other suppliers. As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins. We may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance. Our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense.\n\nWe may, from time to time, make additional business acquisitions or investments, which involve significant risks. \n\nWe have completed multiple acquisitions in the past nine years. We may also enter into alliances or make investments in other businesses to complement our existing product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. Any such transactions has resulted and could result in:\n\n•issuances of equity securities dilutive to our existing stockholders;\n\n•substantial cash payments;\n\n•the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\n•large one-time write-offs;\n\n•amortization expenses related to intangible assets;\n\n•a limitation on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards;\n\n•the diversion of management’s time and attention from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges;\n\n•stockholder or other litigation relating to the transaction;\n\n•adverse tax consequences; \n\n•costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities; and\n\n•the potential loss of, or ability to attract, key personnel, customers and suppliers of the acquired businesses.\n\nTo the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash or through borrowings under our Revolving Facility, it would reduce our cash balances and/or result in indebtedness we must service, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. If the purchase price is paid with our stock, it would be dilutive to our stockholders. In addition, we may assume liabilities associated with a business acquisition or investment, including unrecorded liabilities that are not discovered at the time of the transaction, and the repayment of those liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. \n\nIntegrating acquired organizations and their products and services, including the integration of completed acquisitions, may be expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationships with employees, customers, distributors and suppliers, and ultimately may not be successful. The benefits or synergies we may expect from the acquisition of \n\n83\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\ncomplementary or supplementary businesses may not be realized to the extent or in the time frame we initially anticipate. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses include those associated with:\n\n•failure to successfully further develop the acquired products or technology;\n\n•conforming the acquired company’s standards, policies, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n\n•coordinating new product and process development, especially with respect to highly complex technologies;\n\n•loss of key employees or customers of the acquired business;\n\n•hiring additional management and other key personnel;\n\n•in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\n•increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\n•consolidation of facilities, integration of the acquired businesses’ accounting, human resource and other administrative functions and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions;\n\n•the geographic distance between the businesses;\n\n•liability for activities of the acquired businesses before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\n•litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired businesses, including claims for terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.\n\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates, or even if we do identify suitable candidates, they may be difficult to finance, expensive to fund and there is no guarantee that we can obtain any necessary antitrust approvals or complete such transactions on terms that are favorable to us. \n\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be party to litigation related to acquisitions. Any adverse determination in litigation resulting from acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\n\nWe have settled in the past intellectual property litigation and may in the future face additional claims of intellectual property infringement, including indemnification claims based on intellectual property allegations. Any current or future litigation could be time-consuming, costly to prosecute, defend or settle and result in damages and/or the loss of significant rights.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by companies that hold large numbers of patents and other intellectual property rights and that vigorously pursue, protect and enforce intellectual property rights. Third parties have in the past and may in the future assert against us and our customers and distributors their patent and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. For example, we were involved in a litigation with Bell Semiconductor, which has since been settled pursuant to a Settlement and Patent License Agreement. In addition, from time to time, we receive correspondence from competitors and other third parties seeking to engage us in discussions concerning potential claims against us, and we receive correspondence from customers seeking indemnification for potential claims related to infringement claims asserted against down-stream users of our products. We investigate these requests and claims as received and could be required to enter license agreements with respect to third-party intellectual property rights or indemnify third parties, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results. \n\nClaims that our products, processes or technology infringe third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit or resolution are costly to defend or settle and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. In addition, many of our customer and distributor agreements require us to indemnify and defend our customers or distributors from third-party infringement claims and pay damages and attorneys’ fees in the case of adverse rulings. Claims of this sort also could harm our relationships with our customers or distributors and might deter future customers from doing business with us. In order to maintain our relationships with existing customers and secure business from new customers, we \n\n84\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nhave been required from time to time to provide additional assurances beyond our standard terms. If any of our current or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:\n\n•cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology;\n\n•pay substantial damages, indemnification expenses and attorneys’ fees;\n\n•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing products, processes or technology;\n\n•license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\n•cross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to compete with that competitor; or\n\n•pay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue their use of or to replace infringing technology sold to them with non-infringing technology.\n\nAny of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe utilize a significant amount of intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in some countries. Some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application. We cannot guarantee that:\n\n•any of our present or future patents or patent claims will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned;\n\n•our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us;\n\n•our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes will not be limited by our agreements with third parties or obligations, if any, to standards organizations;\n\n•any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought;\n\n•our intellectual property rights will be enforced in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak;\n\n•any of the trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned;\n\n•we will not lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against or to license our technology to others and collect consideration that we are entitled to under certain intellectual property sale agreements; or\n\n•our ability to monetize our portfolio through divestiture and/or exclusive licensing transactions will not be impacted by conduct of counterparties to any such transactions, and we will not face liability arising from our monetization efforts.\n\nIn addition, our competitors or others may design around our protected patents or technologies. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or more limited in one or more relevant jurisdictions relative to those protections available in the United States, or may not be applied for in one or more relevant jurisdictions. If we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights, an adverse decision in any of these legal actions could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n85\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may have occurred or may occur in the future. Although we have taken steps to minimize the risk of this occurring, any such failure to identify unauthorized use and otherwise adequately protect our intellectual property would adversely affect our business. Moreover, if we are required to commence litigation, whether as a plaintiff or defendant as has occurred in the past, not only will this be time-consuming, but we will also be forced to incur significant costs and divert our attention and efforts of our employees, which could, in turn, result in lower revenue and higher expenses.\n\nWe also rely on customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees and consultants, and we implement security measures to protect our trade secrets. We cannot assure you that these contractual protections and security measures will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our suppliers, employees or consultants will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of such contracts. For example, as described in Part II, Item 1 (Legal Proceedings), Comcast shared our proprietary designs with our direct competitor. Comcast then worked with our competitor to develop the FDX-amplifier technology. We have brought claims for trade secret misappropriation, unfair competition, and breach of the parties’ non-disclosure agreement, and sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, costs, expenses, and attorney fees as well as an injunction against Comcast’s use or disclosure of our trade secrets. However, our claims may not be successful. \n\nIn addition, we have a number of third-party patent and intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time payments or ongoing royalty payments. Also, a few of our license agreements contain most-favored nation clauses or other price restriction clauses which may affect the amount we may charge for our products, processes or technology. We cannot guarantee that the third-party patents and technology we license will not be licensed to our competitors or others in the semiconductor industry. In the future, we may need to obtain additional licenses, renew existing license agreements or otherwise replace existing technology. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed or the technology can be replaced on acceptable terms, or at all.\n\nWhen we originally settled a trademark dispute with Analog Devices International Unlimited Company (ADIUC) and its predecessor, Linear Technology Corporation, we agreed not to register the “MAXLINEAR” mark or any other marks containing the term “LINEAR”. Pursuant to the original settlement agreement, we agreed not to use the “MAXLINEAR” mark on our products. We have since entered into another settlement agreement with ADIUC that now allows us to use and register the “MAXLINEAR” mark on our products, in addition to continuing to use “MAXLINEAR” as a corporate identifier, including to advertise our products and services. We have filed trademark applications to register the “MAXLINEAR” mark, but prior to approval of the applications and registration of the mark in the relevant jurisdictions, our ability to effectively prevent third parties from using the “MAXLINEAR” mark in connection with similar products or technology will be based on our common law rights in the mark, which may make enforcement challenging. If we are unable to protect our trademarks in certain jurisdictions, we may experience difficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition and customer loyalty in such jurisdictions.\n\nWe face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products. \n\nWe regularly become aware of security vulnerabilities with respect to our products as well as intellectual property that we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products. Our products are used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud, Internet of Things, or artificial intelligence, and critical infrastructure, payment card applications, and automotive applications. Security features in our products cannot make our products entirely secure, and security vulnerabilities identified in our products have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, attempts by third parties to identify and exploit additional vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited.\n\nMitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely basis, or at all, and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether, when, and how to develop and deploy mitigations. We and such third parties make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the \n\n86\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nimpact of a security vulnerability, which can cause certain claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as result in litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.\n\nSecurity vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, non-compliance with standards, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers, regulators and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties. Security vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. \n\nThe use of open source software in our products, processes and technology may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\n\nOur products, processes and technology sometimes utilize and incorporate software that is subject to an open source license. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user’s software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user’s software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost. This can subject previously proprietary software to open source license terms.\n\nWhile we monitor the use of all open source software in our products, processes and technology and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product, processes or technology when we do not wish to do so, such use could inadvertently occur. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our products, processes or technology, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our products, processes or technology. This could harm our intellectual property position and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nRisks Relating to Reliance on Third-Parties\n\nWe do not have long-term supply contracts with most of our contract manufacturers or suppliers, and any disruption in our supply of products or materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and operating results.\n\nCurrently we do not have long-term supply contracts with most of our other third-party vendors, including but, not limited to Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, or ASE, TSMC, and United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC. Certain products are supplied to us by Intel on a turnkey basis at agreed upon prices under terms of a supply agreement with an initial term of five years, which will expire in July 2025. Intel can also terminate its supply agreement with us under certain circumstances. If Intel does not continue to supply us with such products, we would need to seek alternative sources of supply for those products in a short timeframe, which would cause us to incur additional costs, could delay the sale of such products, and could increase our supply costs with a new vendor, which in turn, could negatively impact our revenue and our gross margins. Alternatively, if Intel does continue to supply us with such products, the costs of such products would likely increase and reduce our margins on such products, and their minimum purchase requirements may exceed our current customer demand. \n\nWe make substantially all of our purchases on a purchase order basis, and our contract manufacturers are not required to supply us products for any specific period or in any specific quantity. Foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. Availability of foundry capacity has in the past been reduced from time to time due to strong demand. Foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies’ products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice. It is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are, or that have long-term agreements with our foundry, may induce our foundry to reallocate capacity to them. This reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need. We generally place orders for products with some of our suppliers approximately four to five months prior to the anticipated delivery date, with order volumes based on our forecasts of demand from our customers. Accordingly, if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products or if orders are placed with a short lead-time, we may be unable to obtain adequate and cost-effective foundry or assembly capacity from our third-party contractors to meet our customers’ delivery requirements, which could harm our reputation and customer relationships, or we may accumulate excess inventories. On occasion, we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer purchase orders and therefore were unable to benefit from this incremental demand. None of our third-party contractors has provided any assurance to us that adequate capacity will be available to us within the time required to meet additional demand for our products.\n\n87\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nWe do not have our own manufacturing facilities and rely on a limited number of third parties to manufacture, assemble, and test our products. The failure to manage our relationships with our third-party contractors successfully, or impacts from volatility in global supply, natural disasters, public health crises, or other labor stoppages in the regions where such contractors operate, could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products.\n\nWe operate an outsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities. As a result, we rely on third-party foundry wafer fabrication, including sole sourcing for many components or products. Currently, a large portion of our products are manufactured by ASE, TSMC, and UMC, at foundries located in Taiwan, Singapore, and China. We also use third-party contractors for all of our assembly and test operations. We also rely on Intel Corporation, or Intel, for certain products on a turnkey basis at agreed upon prices under terms of a supply agreement with an initial term of five years, which will expire in July 2025 and may be terminated by Intel under certain circumstances.\n\nRelying on third-party manufacturing, assembly and testing presents significant risks to us, including the following:\n\n•capacity shortages during periods of high demand or from events beyond our control or inventory oversupply during periods of decreased demand. For example, we have experienced and could continue to experience inventory oversupply in certain of our products due to changes in customer demand which has added to volatility in managing the business. Inventory oversupply has also led and could continue to lead to inventory write-downs, including charges for any excess or obsolete inventory, which could negatively impact our gross margins;\n\n•failure by us, our customers, or their end customers to qualify a selected supplier;\n\n•reduced control over delivery schedules and quality;\n\n•shortages of materials;\n\n•misappropriation of our intellectual property;\n\n•limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us; \n\n•potential increases in costs of our products;\n\n•costs to switch to alternate sources of supply for certain products and/or delays in sales of such products, if a supplier does not continue to supply certain products; and\n\n•our use of foundry partners who are currently subject to BIS restrictions, such as SMIC, to manufacture certain of our products may be impaired if one or more of the following were to occur: (1) we are unable to obtain U.S. export licenses authorizing its interactions and technology exchanges with these foundry partners or if there are delays in obtaining such licenses, or (2) if BIS increases export control restrictions to Chinese foundries without the ability for us to obtain a U.S. export license, or (3) U.S. providers of semiconductor manufacturer equipment are unable to export such equipment or related spare or replacement parts used in the manufacture of our products, or obtain a license to export such equipment and parts, to current or future Chinese foundry partners.\n\nThe ability and willingness of our third-party contractors to perform is largely outside our control. If one or more of our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, in the event that manufacturing capacity is reduced or eliminated at one or more facilities, manufacturing could be disrupted, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders and our net revenue could decline. In addition, if these third parties fail to deliver quality products and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders, our net revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n\n88\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nAdditionally, our product shipment and manufacturing capacity may be similarly reduced or eliminated at one or more facilities due to the fact that the majority of our fabrication and assembly and test contractors are all located in the Pacific Rim region, principally in China, Taiwan, and Singapore. The risk of earthquakes in these geographies is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines, and Taiwan in particular is also subject to typhoons and other Pacific storms, and more recently, a drought impacting the water supply which chip manufacturers rely upon to fabricate chip products. Earthquakes, fire, flooding, drought, or other natural disasters in Taiwan or the Pacific Rim region, or political unrest, war, labor strikes, work stoppages or public health crises, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, in countries where our contractors’ facilities are located could result in the disruption of our product shipments, foundry, assembly, or test capacity. If such disruption were to recur over a prolonged period, it could have a material impact on our revenues and our business. Any disruption resulting from similar events on a larger scale or over a prolonged period could cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to resume such shipments, or shift our manufacturing, assembly, or test from the affected contractor to another third-party vendor, if needed. If such disruption were to recur over a prolonged period, it could have a material impact on our revenue and business. There can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.\n\nWe are subject to risks associated with our distributors’ product inventories and product sell-through. Should any of our distributors cease or be forced to stop distributing our products, our business would suffer.\n\nWe currently sell a significant portion of our products to customers through our distributors, who maintain their own inventories of our products. Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 42%, and 47% of our net revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Upon shipment of product to these distributors, title to the inventory transfers to the distributor and the distributor is invoiced, generally with 30 to 60 day terms. Distributor sales are also recognized upon shipment to the distributor and estimates of future pricing credits and/or stock rotation rights reduce revenue recognized to the net amount before the actual amounts are known. If our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period.\n\nIf our distributors are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventories of our products in a given quarter to manufacturers and end users or if they decide to decrease their inventories of our products for any reason, our sales through these distributors and our revenue may decline. In addition, if some distributors decide to purchase more of our products than are required to satisfy end customer demand in any particular quarter, inventories at these distributors would grow in that quarter. These distributors could then reduce future orders until inventory levels realign with end customer demand, which has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our product revenue.\n\nOur reserve estimates with respect to the products stocked by our distributors are based principally on reports provided to us by our distributors, typically on a weekly basis. To the extent that this resale and channel inventory data is inaccurate or not received in a timely manner, we may not be able to make reserve estimates accurately or at all.\n\nWe rely on third parties to provide services and technology necessary for the operation of our business. Any failure of one or more of our partners, vendors, suppliers or licensors to provide these services or technology could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide critical services, including, among other things, services related to accounting, billing, compliance, internal audit, human resources, information technology, network development, network monitoring, in-licensing and intellectual property that we cannot or do not create or provide ourselves. We depend on these vendors to ensure that our corporate infrastructure will consistently meet our business requirements and legal obligations. The ability of these third-party vendors to successfully provide reliable and high quality services is subject to technical and operational uncertainties that are beyond our control. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, our agreements with these vendors limit the amount of damages we may receive. In addition, we do not know whether we will be able to collect on any award of damages or that these damages would be sufficient to cover the actual costs we would incur as a result of any vendor’s failure to perform under its agreement with us. Any failure of our corporate infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.\n\nAdditionally, we incorporate third-party technology into and with some of our products, and we may do so in future products. The operation of our products could be impaired if errors occur in the third-party technology we use, including as a result of information technology failures from cyber-attacks on or security breaches of third parties. It may be more difficult for \n\n89\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nus to correct any errors in a timely manner if at all because the development and maintenance of the technology is not within our control. There can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to make their technology, or improvements to the technology, available to us, or that they will continue to support and maintain their technology. Further, due to the limited number of vendors of some types of technology, it may be difficult to obtain new licenses or replace existing technology. Any impairment of the technology or our relationship with these third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\n\nOur share price may be volatile as a result of various factors.\n\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the trading price of our common stock ranged from a low of $11.08 to a high of $26.59. These factors include those discussed in this “Risk Factors” section of this report and others such as:\n\n•any developments related to our terminated merger with Silicon Motion;\n\n•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\n•overall conditions in the semiconductor market;\n\n•addition or loss of significant customers;\n\n•changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products, including export controls;\n\n•geopolitical changes impacting our business and markets, including with respect to China and Taiwan and the upcoming U.S. presidential election;\n\n•actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\n•announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\n•announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\n•departures of, and inability to attract, qualified key personnel;\n\n•competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\n•issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\n•fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\n•disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our technologies;\n\n•actions by institutional or activist stockholders;\n\n•acquisitions may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share;\n\n•announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\n•sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders; and\n\n•general economic and market conditions, including the impacts from sanctions against Russia and the military conflicts in Ukraine and among Israel, Iran and Lebanon, increased inflationary pressures, and interest rate changes.\n\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including us. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. \n\n90\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock are attractive to momentum, hedge, day-trading, or activist investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction, and have also been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of momentum, hedge, day-trading, or activist investors, and have been and may continue to be the target of securities class action litigation in the future. Stockholder activism or securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. A proxy contest or other activist behaviors could have an adverse effect on us. \n\nEven if a proxy contest or other activist efforts are not successful, the increased costs that we would bear and the distraction of our Board of Directors and senior management could negatively impact our business, although we cannot predict with certainty the extent of such negative impacts.\n\nOur management team may use our available cash and cash equivalents in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a return.\n\nWe use our cash and cash equivalents for general corporate purposes, including working capital and for repayment of outstanding long-term debt. We may also, in the future, use a portion of our assets to acquire other complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. Our management has considerable discretion in the application of our cash and cash equivalents, and resources, and you will not have the opportunity to assess whether these liquid assets are being used in a manner that you deem best to maximize your return. We may use our available cash and cash equivalents and resources for corporate purposes that do not increase our operating results or market value. In addition, in the future our cash and cash equivalents, and resources may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value.\n\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\n\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions provide for the following:\n\n•authorize our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 25,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\n•require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\n•specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, or our President;\n\n•establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors;\n\n•establish that our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving staggered terms;\n\n•provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\n•provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\n•specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n\n•require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter documents.\n\n91\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally restricts a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder.\n\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\n\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\n\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to decline.\n\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 84.4 million shares of common stock outstanding.\n\nAll shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act unless held by our “affiliates,” as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. \n\nOur Executive Incentive Bonus Plan permits the settlement of awards under the plan in the form of shares of our common stock. We have issued shares of our common stock to settle such bonus awards for our employees, including executives, for the 2014 to 2023 performance periods, and we intend to continue this practice in the foreseeable future, subject to availability of such shares under our stock plans. We issued 0.4 million shares of our common stock for the 2023 performance period in February 2024. If we issue additional shares of our common stock to settle bonus awards in the future, such shares may be freely sold in the public market immediately following the issuance of such shares, subject to the applicable conditions of Rule 144 and our insider trading policy, and the issuance of such shares may have a material adverse effect on our share price once they are issued.\n\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\nIf we suffer losses to our facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed. \n\nOur facilities and distribution system, and those of our third-party contractors, are subject to risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, drought or other natural or man-made disasters. A number of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are located in areas with above average seismic activity and/or which have experienced more frequent, more extreme and less predictable weather conditions. For example, the risk of an earthquake in the Pacific Rim region, including Taiwan, or Southern California is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines, and Taiwan in particular is also subject to typhoons and other Pacific storms, and more recently, a drought impacting the water supply which chip manufacturers rely upon to fabricate chip products. We have experienced higher insurance costs and may experience a decrease in available coverage in such areas and an increased likelihood of damage, power outages and catastrophic loss to these facilities, which would likely disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility. The majority of the factories we use for foundry, assembly and test, and warehousing services, are located in Asia, principally in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Our corporate headquarters is located in Southern California. Our operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed in the event of a major \n\n92\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nearthquake, fire, flooding, drought, or other natural disasters in Taiwan or the Pacific Rim region, or political unrest, war, labor strikes, work stoppages or public health crises, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, or other natural or man-made disaster in countries where our contractors’ facilities are located. Such catastrophes could result in the disruption of our product shipments, foundry, assembly, or test capacity.\n\nWe have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with business acquisitions. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets could become impaired and adversely affect our future operating results.\n\nWe account for business acquisitions as business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. Our acquisitions have resulted in the creation of goodwill and recording of a large amount of intangible assets based upon the application of the acquisition method of accounting. To the extent the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment. We conduct our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis on October 31 each year, or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Our reported financial condition and results of operations reflect the balances and results of the acquired businesses but are not restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of acquired businesses for periods prior to the acquisitions. As a result, comparisons of future results against prior period results will be more difficult for investors. In addition, there can be no guarantee that acquired intangible assets, particularly in-process research and development, will generate revenues or profits that we include in our forecast that is the basis for their fair values as of the acquisition date. Any such impairment charges relating to goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material impact on our operating results in future periods, and the announcement of a material impairment could have a material adverse effect on the trading price and trading volume of our common stock. As of September 30, 2024, our balance sheet reflected goodwill of $318.6 million and other intangible assets of $58.0 million. Consequently, we could recognize material impairment charges in the future.\n\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or unanticipated tax obligations could affect our future results.\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, Singapore and various other foreign jurisdictions. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to our interpretation and application of tax laws in jurisdictions in which we file. Changes in current or future laws or regulations, the imposition of new or changed tax laws or regulations or new interpretations by taxing authorities or courts could affect our results of operations and lead to volatility with respect to tax expenses and liabilities from period to period. For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 174. This has increased our effective tax rate and our cash tax payable since 2022. Further, following the enactment of the Tax Act, most of our income is now subject to U.S. taxation, with a large portion taxed under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI, regime. Starting in 2026, the GILTI deduction will decrease from 50% to 37.5%, leading to a higher effective tax rate on our income. The application of tax laws and related regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. We cannot determine whether any legislative proposals may be enacted into law or what, if any, changes may be made to such proposals prior to their being enacted into law. If U.S. or international tax laws change in a manner that increases our tax obligation, it could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial position. In addition, many countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s, or OECD, Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” proposals). The European Union and other countries (including those in which we operate) have enacted or committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may adversely impact our provision for income taxes, existing tax incentives, net income and cash flows. As a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.\n\n93\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nOur income tax provision is subject to volatility and our ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income may be limited since we are subject to tax examinations, which may adversely impact our future effective tax rate and operating results.\n\nExcess tax benefits associated with employee stock-based compensation are included in income tax expense. However, since the amount of such excess tax benefits and deficiencies depend on the fair market value of our common stock, our income tax provision is subject to volatility in our stock price and in the future, could unfavorably affect our future effective tax rate.\n\nOur future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the ultimate use and depletion of these various tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. Changes in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence quarterly, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income in the applicable jurisdiction. On a periodic basis we evaluate our deferred tax assets for realizability. Based upon our review of all positive and negative evidence, as of September 30, 2024, we continue to have a valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets, certain federal deferred tax assets, and certain foreign deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where we have cumulative losses or otherwise are not expected to utilize certain tax attributes. The impact of releasing some or all of such valuation allowance in a future period could be material in the period in which such release occurs. Additionally, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted in the subsequent periods if estimates of future taxable income are reduced or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is present. Any future changes in the deferred tax asset realizability assertion may require a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets, which would increase our tax expense in the period the allowance is recognized and affect our results of operations. \n\nOur corporate income tax liability could materially increase if tax incentives we have negotiated in Singapore cease to be effective or applicable or if we are challenged on our use of such incentives. \n\nWe operate under certain favorable tax incentives in Singapore which are effective through March 2027, and generally are dependent on our meeting certain headcount and investment thresholds. Such incentives allow certain qualifying income earned in Singapore to be taxed at reduced rates and are conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds over time. If we fail to satisfy the conditions for receipt of these tax incentives, or to the extent U.S. or other tax authorities challenge our operation under these favorable tax incentive programs or our intercompany transfer pricing agreements, our taxable income could be taxed at higher federal or foreign statutory rates and our income tax liability and expense could materially increase beyond our projections. Each of our Singapore tax incentives is separate and distinct from the others, and may be granted, withheld, extended, modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives. Absent these tax incentives, our corporate income tax rate in Singapore would generally be the 17% statutory tax rate. We are also subject to operating and other compliance requirements to maintain our favorable tax incentives. If we fail to comply with such requirements, we could lose the tax benefits and could possibly be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits. Additionally, in the future, we may fail to qualify for renewal of our favorable tax incentives or such incentives may not be available to us, which could also cause our future taxable income to increase and be taxed at higher statutory rates. Loss of one more of our tax incentives could cause us to modify our tax strategies and our operational structure, which could cause disruption in our business and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, there can be no guarantee that such modification in our tax strategy will yield tax incentives as favorable as those we have negotiated with Singapore. Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows.\n\nInvestor confidence may be adversely impacted if we are unable to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and as a result, our stock price could decline.\n\nWe are subject to rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require us to include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K our management’s report on, and assessment of the effectiveness of, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n94\n\n[Table of Contents](#if8bf655bb6914b4380667f4fedd67cf6_7)\n\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, there is a risk that we will not comply with all of the requirements imposed by Section 404. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. Any of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements and could result in investigations or sanctions by the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, or other regulatory authorities or in stockholder litigation. Any of these factors ultimately could harm our business and could negatively impact the market price of our securities. Ineffective control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\n\nITEM 2.

          "content": "2023 ANNUAL REPORT\nApril 4, 2024\nDear Fellow MaxLinear Stockholders:\nI am pleased to note that, in 2023, we made tremendous progress towards establishing MaxLinear as a broad-based\nleader in radio frequency (RF)/analog and high-performance mixed-signal semiconductor system-on-chip solutions for\nnetworking products. Our products and technology address the significant growth in the long-term in demand for fatter and\nfaster data pipes across various end markets. In 2023, we realized revenue of $693 million, gross profit of approximately $386\nmillion and we generated approximately $43 million in operating cash flows. Our Broadband Access, Infrastructure, Industrial\nand Multi-Market, and Connectivity revenues represented 29%, 26%, 25%, and 20% respectively, of overall sales. Looking\nforward, I anticipate that our multi-year investments and initiatives in Infrastructure will be the highlight of our growth story,\nand my increased optimism is borne by the initial revenues and design-win momentum of our new product initiatives.\nWith regards to our new infrastructure product initiatives, high-speed optical interconnects for datacenter applications\nare of strategic importance. We are steadily gaining product traction with new design wins driving our initial revenue growth.\nEarly-stage revenue contributions from our high-speed optical interconnect 5nm CMOS 800G PAM4 Digital Signal Processors\n(DSP) family, Keystone, have already begun. Additionally, there are new production ramps slated for the second half of 2024,\nwhich are expected to drive more meaningful run-rate growth in 2025. The accelerating deployment of AI or Artificial\nIntelligence in the Cloud Datacenter and Enterprise Compute markets is driving unprecedented growth of and the demand for\nhigh-speed optical interconnects. It is also providing a strong catalyst for the transition to 800Gbps and beyond speeds. Our\ninvestment and innovation over several years has enabled us to differentiate with a highly competitive and broad portfolio of\nPAM4 DSPs addressing optical transceiver, Active Optical Cable (AOC) and Active Electrical Cable (AEC) high-speed\ninterconnect applications.\nWe continue to execute well on our growth plans for our wireless infrastructure business, with the launch of our new\nindustry-leading product, Sierra, which is our flagship 5G Open Radio Access Network (RAN) system-on-chip device\naddressing Macro and Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radio remote units (RRUs) and small cell applications.\nSierra is a complete silicon and software solution that provides radio unit (RU) designers with a flexible system building block\nto deliver Macro, Massive MIMO, and Small Cell radios for Open RAN applications with high performance, low power\nconsumption, and short time-to-market advantages. Entering 2025, along with the increasing demand for 5G RUs, we expect\nthe demand for our wireless backhaul microwave and millimeter wave transport radio and modem products to grow as part of a\nmulti-year upgrade cycle. In 2023 alone, our 5G Wireless backhaul product sales were up 131% compared with 2022 and\nunderpinned the strong growth of our overall Infrastructure revenues. We believe that our early success in this very large, high-\ngrowth 5G wireless market has the potential to drive strong overall Infrastructure revenue growth.\nWe continue to execute well on our growth plans for Enterprise product revenues, with new industry-leading product\nintroductions addressing both Ethernet and Storage Accelerator enterprise market opportunities. In 2023, we taped out and have\nstarted to sample our new Ethernet product Swan Creek, which integrates eight 2.5Gbps speed capable Ethernet physical layer\n(EPHY) ports and a switch in a single chip. Swan Creek can operate both as a smart switch and as a multi-port PHY for\nenterprise applications. We have secured design wins at a major Tier-1 enterprise original equipment manufacturer (OEM)\ncustomer and multiple design wins in the small and medium business (SMB) market, and we anticipate initial revenues in 2024\nand strong revenue growth momentum to continue into 2025. Additionally, our latest storage accelerator product, Panther-3, has\nentered mass production with strong design-win momentum and revenue traction at major enterprise storage and server OEMs.\nWe believe that our initial Panther-3 revenues in 2023 have the potential to grow significantly to approximately $50M to $75M\nover the next 3 years.\nWhile the Infrastructure market remains our most important area of new product initiatives and strategic focus, in\n2023, within broadband access and connectivity, we began ramping our single-chip integrated fiber Passive Optical Network\n(PON) and 10Gbit processor gateway and Wi-Fi-6E connectivity solutions with a major Tier-1 North American service\nprovider. We also expect to begin ramping a new opportunity with a second major provider in 2024. This further establishes\nMaxLinear’s competitive positioning in the fiber PON market and builds on our PON revenue of approximately $50M in 2023.\nWe expect to be able to more than double our PON revenues over the next two years. We also announced the successful\ndevelopment of our next-generation Wi-Fi Connectivity product, Wav700, which is the world’s first single-chip tri-band, quad-\nMIMO, Wi-Fi7 standard compliant product. Our Wav700 device has been selected by the Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA) as one of only\nfour devices for the WFA interoperability compliance certification test bed. We expect industrywide Wi-Fi7 rollout and Telco\nfiber PON broadband upgrades to be major drivers of our revenue growth in broadband access and connectivity for years to\ncome.\nOverall, we are increasingly optimistic and believe that our disciplined strategic investments can deliver on our long-\nterm growth aspirations.\nIn closing, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the entire MaxLinear family – our\ncustomers, our suppliers, our employees and their families, and our stockholders. Together, we have set MaxLinear on an\nexciting path of innovation, growth and transformative scale. I want to wish you and your families health, cheer and prosperity.\nSincerely,\nKishore Seendripu, Ph.D., Chairman of the Board of Directors and President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nUNITED STATES\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\nWashington, D.C. 20549\nFORM 10-K\n☑ ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES\nEXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2023\nOR\n☐ TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE\nSECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\nFor the Transition Period From to\nCommission file number: 001-34666\nMaxLinear, Inc.\n(Exact name of Registrant as specified in its charter)\nDelaware 14-1896129\n(State or other jurisdiction of (I.R.S.

BUSINESS\n5\nCorporate Information\nWe incorporated in the State of Delaware in September 2003. Our executive offices are located at 5966 La Place Court,\nSuite 100, Carlsbad, California 92008, and our telephone number is (760) 692-0711. In this Form 10-K, unless the context\notherwise requires, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to MaxLinear, Inc. and its directly and indirectly wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries. Our website address is www.maxlinear.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into\nthis Form 10-K. We provide free of charge through a link on our website access to our Annual Reports on Form 10-K,\nQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as amendments to those reports, as soon as\nreasonably practical after the reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or\nSEC. Refer to Intellectual Property Rights section below for a list of our trademarks and trade names. All other trademarks and\ntrade names appearing in this Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners.\nOverview\nWe are a provider of communications systems-on-chip, or SoCs, used in broadband, mobile and wireline infrastructure,\ndata center, and industrial and multi-market applications. We are a fabless integrated circuit design company whose products\nintegrate all or substantial portions of a high-speed communication system, including radio frequency, or RF, high-performance\nanalog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, security engines, data compression and networking layers, and power\nmanagement. In most cases, these products are designed on a single silicon-die using standard digital complementary metal\noxide semiconductor, or CMOS, manufacturing processes and conventional packaging technologies. Importantly, our ability to\ndesign analog and mixed-signal circuits in CMOS allows us to efficiently combine analog functionality and complex digital\nsignal processing logic in the same integrated circuit. As a result, we believe our solutions have exceptional levels of functional\nintegration and performance, low manufacturing cost, and reduced power consumption versus competition. These solutions also\nenable shorter design cycles, significant design flexibility and low system-level cost across a range of markets.\nOur customers include electronics distributors, module makers, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and original\ndesign manufacturers, or ODMs, which incorporate our products in a wide range of electronic devices. Examples of such\ndevices include radio transceivers and modems for 4G/5G base-station and backhaul infrastructure; optical transceivers\ntargeting hyperscale data centers; Wi-Fi and wireline routers for home networking; broadband modems compliant with Data\nOver Cable Service Interface Specifications, or DOCSIS, passive optical fiber standards, or PON, and digital subscriber line, or\nDSL; as well as power management and interface products used in these and many other markets.\nIndustry Background\nOver the last three decades, ubiquitous internet connectivity has driven exponential growth in data content, delivery,\ndistribution, and consumption. We expect this trend to continue owing to:\n• Accelerated expansion of advanced data center technologies and cloud-based services including, Amazon Web\nService, or AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and software as service, or SAAS, in general;\n• The explosive emergence of artificial intelligence, or AI, platforms and services such as OpenAI/Bing and Google\nBard, which broadly amplify human ability to harness high-performance computing within the data center;\n• Continued proliferation of on-demand Over-The-Top, or OTT, video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and\nDisney+;\n• The “remote economy” accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift to work-from-home, and increasing reliance\non services such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet;\n• The proliferation of “Internet of Things”, or IoT, including internet-connected devices and systems within the home,\nmanufacturing industries, and enterprises; and\n• Large-scale proliferation and advancement of wireless broadband services, whether through 5G+ or WiFi, which act as\nan accelerant for all these technologies.\nThese factors, individually and combined, have created economic pressure to continuously upgrade network bandwidth\nand latency (i.e. the delay between sender and receiver) in order to exploit the exponential growth of the above activities. For\nexample, cloud-based services increasingly require stringent low latency and extremely high-speed network connections\nbetween servers and storage within a data center. These cloud services may leverage generative AI, which requires racks of\nhigh-performance servers and storage connected by the fastest-available networks. They may also rely on real-time\ncommunication with systems of IoT devices including sensors, lighting, and actuators; smart speakers, smart lighting and other\n6\nsmart appliances in the connected home; commercial air-conditioning and refrigeration; video surveillance equipment;\nmanufacturing machinery; and point-of-sale and asset tracking systems. All these usage scenarios depend on reliable, fast, low-\nlatency networks, enabled by advances in semiconductor devices which integrate wide spectrum/broadband, high-frequency\ncircuits together with digital signal processing algorithms. Such devices not only expand the available network bandwidth, but\nalso utilize that bandwidth more efficiently.\nMarkets\nThe above trends propel demand across many of our target end markets, such as:\n• Data Center Infrastructure: Inside hyperscale data centers operated by Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and others,\nhigh-speed optical transceivers connect racks of servers and storage through a hierarchical network of switches and routers.\nCloud services and machine learning are dependent upon the ability to interconnect vast numbers of servers and storage\ninside a data center with extremely low latency and the highest bandwidth to enable the entire data center to act as a single\ncomputing or data processing unit. Consequently, the data traffic growth inside the data center has significantly outstripped\nthe data traffic flowing to and from the data center. Currently, while server connections are transitioning from 10Gbps to\n25Gbps or 100Gbps speeds, router and switch connections are moving from 100G to 400 and 800Gbps interconnections,\nwith the next generation of switch connections (under development) targeting 1600Gbps. These transitions are possible, in\nlarge part, owing to the innovations in semiconductor design, incorporating high-speed digital signal processing together\nwith broadband analog and mixed signal circuits in advanced CMOS process nodes. The physical limits and challenges of\nremoving the heat dissipated by these optical transceivers and switches are the primary barriers to even higher interconnect\nspeeds. For all these reasons, improving the bandwidth and power efficiency of data center networking technology within\nand between data centers remains a critical challenge for the evolution of next-generation data centers.\n• 5G Wireless Infrastructure: Expensive, finite, fractured and discontiguous 5G wireless spectrum is being utilized more\nefficiently by aggregating or bonding multiple non-contiguous channels of spectrum with highly complex radio\ntransceivers in a wireless base-station radio unit. These complex radio transceivers can also be configured in large antenna\narrays to direct wireless signals more efficiently to specific users, also known as Massive Multiple-Input Multiple Output\nbeamforming, or MMIMO. Beamforming vastly improves the efficiency with which spectrum is used (thereby increasing\nnetwork capacity), as well as cell tower coverage (range), allowing an operator to do more with less. Densification, the\nprocess of increasing the number of wireless base-stations per unit area, also improves network capacity and coverage. In\nturn, the wireless and optical backhaul transport networks required to connect the higher number of base-station cells must\nhave greater data capacity. As a result, microwave wireless backhaul and fronthaul transport links are migrating to\nmillimeter wave operating frequencies where the availability of spectrum improves data capacity by more than tenfold.\nImplementing 5G access and transport functionality within base-stations requires radio transceivers that can process larger\nradio spectrum bandwidths; have expanded RF range; compensate for signal distortion from high-power amplifiers;\nsupport beamforming in large antenna arrays; and have the ability to transport high speed data to and from the network, all\nin a low-cost, power-efficient design.\n• Broadband Access: Several drivers of broadband services have grown in significance in the last few years, including\nhybrid work-from-home, and the number and diversity of streaming service offerings. The focal point of network\nperformance to and within the location is a gateway. These gateways not only determine the internet speeds coming into\nthe location, but also the speed at which content is distributed throughout the location. Broadband modems – whether\ncoaxial, fiber, or DSL, are needed to process increasingly wider portions of the spectrum carried by these media. Advances\nin these modems, powered by advanced SoCs, are enabling operators to aggregate the bandwidth of more channels and to\nwiden the channels themselves, thereby increasing the download and upload speeds available to the consumer.\n• Connectivity: Connectivity is ubiquitous in our modern and transforming economy, where increasingly every device,\nincluding those inside our smart homes, enterprises, manufacturing robots, automobiles, commercial infrastructure,\npersonal computers, personal health wear and gadgets, etc. are connected to the internet and each other. For example, each\nbroadband access gateway, which is the entry point for internet connection into a home, typically implements several\ndifferent communication standards for distributing content and internet connectivity throughout, including Wi-Fi, Ethernet,\nMultimedia over Coax (MoCA), and power line communications. Each of these standards relies on dedicated transceivers\nand signal processing powered by custom semiconductor products. For example, newer generations of Wi-Fi utilize\nincreasing multiplicity of transceivers to enhance throughput. Advanced implementations of Wi-Fi deploy as many as eight\ntransceivers inside a single gateway box, combined with Wi-Fi extenders to improve coverage in a large area.\n7\nConsequently, the number of transceivers required, whether for wireless or broadband wireline access and distribution,\nincreases proportionally to the increase in the number of broadband access connections. All connectivity standards rely on\nmultiple wireless or wireline transceivers or single large bandwidth transceivers to improve the data handling capacity and\nability to talk to multiple devices simultaneously.\n• Industrial & Multi-Market: Manufacturing systems are increasingly being connected to each other and to the cloud.\nSuch connectivity enables a range of operational improvements, such as better plant utilization and scheduling, reduction in\npower consumption, and the detection of precursors to equipment failure, enabling proactive maintenance and\nmanagement. Connectivity is also at the heart of powerful new approaches to plant management such as digital twinning\nand industrial AI. To make connectivity economical, legacy equipment and new installations need to communicate with\neach other via newer and older connectivity protocol standards. Our product portfolio, featuring serial interfaces, Universal\nSerial Bus, or USB, Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitters, or UARTS, Peripheral Component Interconnect\nExpress, or PCIe, devices, data converters, and Power Management Integrated Circuits, or PMICs, is strategically\npositioned to capitalize on such growth opportunities in this expanding market. Such a diverse range of interface and bridge\nproducts effectively serves a broad spectrum of end markets, including industrial automation, process control and\nmanufacturing IT, among others.\nTo summarize, the innovation in broadband, low power, integrated communication SoCs is the engine of\ncompetitiveness across a range of different businesses spanning broadband wireline access, mobile data services, hyperscale\ncloud data centers, and cloud computation and storage markets. This has led to a long term and continuing secular trend of\ncompounded growth in demand for systems that feature multiplier RF, mixed signal, and high-performance analog and digital\nsignal processing transceiver SoCs.\nChallenges Faced by Providers of Systems and RF Transceivers and Optical Interconnects\nDesigning and implementing state-of-the-art RF and optical transceiver systems is difficult owing to the high operating\nfrequency ranges and wide frequency bands employed by communication signals, and the low power budgets of applications.\nAs an example of difficulty, system designers must contend with significantly more sources of interference and signal\nimpairments than in the case of traditional narrow band, low-frequency communication systems. Wider bandwidths require\nfaster devices, but demand has outstripped the rate at which semiconductor processes improve, particularly so for the\nmainstream CMOS process roadmap.\nThe key challenges of capturing and processing high quality broadband communications signals include:\n• Receiving RF/digital communications signals spanning multiple frequency bands over a wide spectrum: Many of the\nadvanced high-data-rate applications require the simultaneous RF reception of multiple channels or frequency bands in\norder to first aggregate, and subsequently demodulate, the data signal, which is spread over discrete disparate frequency\nbands. Likewise, data transmission is achieved by disaggregating the user’s data signal and transmitting it over multiple\navailable frequency bands spanning a wide frequency spectrum. For example, in the cable modem and broadband gateway\nmarkets, it is necessary to support the simultaneous reception of multiple high-definition video streams, video\nconferencing, and data applications in many system designs. OEMs meet these stringent requirements via multiple narrow-\nor wide-band RF receivers, each of which is dedicated to the reception of a single frequency band. An alternate, but highly\nchallenging, approach involves Full Spectrum Capture, or FSCTM, receiver SoCs, which can process the entire available\nRF frequency spectrum in the transmission medium. They can then select and aggregate the relevant frequency bands over\nwhich the data is spread using analog and mixed-signal digital co-processing techniques. In contrast, use of multiple\ndiscrete conventional narrowband RF receivers is impractical due to increased design complexity, overall cost, circuit\nboard space, power consumption and heat dissipation limitations. In addition, such narrowband receiver implementations\nsuffer from signal integrity issues, reliability, and thermal challenges owing to the proximity of sensitive multiple RF\nreceivers and discrete components in a limited PCB footprint.\n• Signal Clarity Performance Requirements: In communications systems, performance is limited by the quality of the\nreceived/transmitted signal that can be supported throughout the channel bandwidth. Signal-to-noise, or SNR, ratio\nmeasures the strength of the desired signal relative to the sum of the noise and undesired signal energy in the same channel.\nHigh capacity 5G wireless cellular data networks operate across non-contiguous wireless spectrum bands, while wired\ncoaxial cable and power-line networks require broadband RF transceivers supporting high SNR. Optical transceivers\noperate across the widest bandwidths available and must preserve the necessary SNR throughout their bandwidth. These\n8\ntransceiver systems must compensate for impairments introduced as the signal propagates through wire, fiber or wireless\nmediums, as well as isolate the desired signals from the undesired signals that are invariably present in their wide operating\nfrequency range. The undesired signals not only include the noise generated by the natural environment, but also\ninterference produced by home appliances, enterprise communications equipment, and other wireless networking systems.\nFor example, in 5G mobile infrastructure applications, a radio transceiver receiving a channel at 1710MHz must cope with\nreflections in the environment as well as interference from a neighboring channel at 1660MHz picked up by the receiving\nantenna. The transceiver must also compensate for distortion introduced by the strong signals out of the transmitting\nantenna. Analog and digital signal processing is employed to improve SNR in the received and transmitted signals.\nBeamforming and MMIMO of radio signals also significantly improves SNR ratio, but requires sophisticated RF, analog\nand digital signal co-processing, and software expertise. Broadband reception and beamforming of RF signals in mobile\nenvironments are extremely difficult to implement due to the stringent size, cost, and power consumption constraints. Also,\nhigher order modulation of communication signals requires extremely high SNR to maximize data capacity in a finite\nspectrum, which greatly increases the difficulty of implementing broadband systems.\n• Power Consumption: Power consumption has become a major concern inside communication systems, including\naccess gateways, wireless base-stations and data center infrastructure applications. For example, Wi-Fi capacity and\nbandwidth improvement require increasing the number of transceivers per access point with greater channel bandwidths.\nAs a result, Wi-Fi gateway faces significant heat dissipation challenges within the system as more performance and\nfunctionality are squeezed into smaller enclosures. Likewise, within the data center, physical limitations in the ability to\nremove heat efficiently from network switches, and the optical transceivers plugged into them, are the main obstacles to\nincreasing data center network bandwidth at and beyond 400Gbps speed per optical transceiver since these transceivers\nmust fit into the same standardized module form factors as prior generations. These switches and transceivers now\nconsume an increasingly significant fraction of total data center power. In 5G wireless access infrastructure applications,\nthe cost of provisioning power to base-station antenna towers and the operating cost attributable to energy consumption is\nhigh. In many multiple-transceiver system designs, a majority of the system’s overall power consumption can be ascribed\nto radio transceivers.\n• Size: The size of electronic components, such as RF transceivers and digital signal processing SoCs, is a key\nconsideration for system designers and the service providers that deploy them. In wired optical infrastructure applications\ninside data centers, rapidly increasing network server and switch face-plate density trends are aggressively driving\nreduction of the size of optical transceiver interconnects. In 5G wireless infrastructure, space and weight capacity on the\nbase-station radio towers where the radios and modems are mounted, is highly constrained and is a significant portion of\noperating costs. The deployment of MMIMO and antenna arrays, and cell densification for 5G wireless coverage and\ncapacity, greatly increase the number of radio transceivers required in each base station radio tower and the number of base\nstations in a cell. As a result, there is a growing trend and an increasing need for highly complex integrated SoCs with\ngreater numbers of transceivers per SoC.\nThere are also challenges that are specific to the processing of high-speed optical interconnect signals in our target data\ncenter markets.\n▪ Optical Fiber Channel Impairments: The inherent optical properties of fiber cables and connectors result in\nimpairments to the optical signal as it propagates along the fiber. These impairments degrade signal integrity due to the loss\nof light intensity, reflections from connectors, and other adverse modal, chromatic and polarization dispersion effects on\nthe propagating light. Further, electrical signal impairments are introduced in the process of conversion of optical signals to\nelectrical signals, which together reduce the maximum data throughput and limit the distance over which data can\npropagate over fiber. Therefore, communications SoCs present inside optical modules (often referred to as digital signal\nprocessors, or DSPs) are required to correct both electrical and optical signal impairments at both ends of the fiber\ntermination.\n▪ Photonics Device Technology: Today’s state-of-the art in photonic device technology lags the rapidly increasing speed\nrequirements of data traffic within cloud data centers and optical transport links between telecom data centers. Photonic\nmodulators often require relatively high voltage drive levels, while photodetectors are sensitive to speed degradation when\nconnected to electrical circuits. This imposes severe limits to the high-speed conversion of electrical signals to optical\nsignals, and vice versa, owing to the bandwidth limitations, nonlinearities, and noise properties in lasers, modulators, and\nphoto detectors used in optical modules.\n9\n▪ Form Factor: Optical transceivers are required to conform to multi-source agreement, or MSA, standardized form\nfactors, which in turn determine the number of transceiver ports that can fit in the face plates of standard server, storage,\nand switch rack units. Standardization of transceiver form factors and rack unit face plates allows data center operators to\nupgrade network speeds of existing installations by simply replacing older optical transceivers and switches with newer\nfaster ones, rather than having to overhaul installed fiber infrastructure and floorplan. The dimensions of the standard face\nplate impose a severe constraint on the amount of heat that can be practically removed from a rack unit. A major challenge\nfacing optical transceiver SoCs is to support exponentially growing data rates within the standardized form factor and\nthermal constraints.\nOur RF, Mixed-Signal and Digital SoC Platform Solutions\nWe are a provider of communications SoC solutions for the connected home, mobile and wireline infrastructure, data\ncenters, and industrial and multi-market applications. Our products exemplify our core integrated circuit design and\ncommunications systems engineering capabilities:\n• Proprietary broadband/RF, analog and mixed-signal transceiver front ends: Our analog and mixed-signal integrated\ncircuit designers implement complex broadband radio transceiver front-ends and data converters in standard silicon CMOS\nprocesses, which enables single-die integration of a complete digital signal processing communication system. This results\nin state-of-the-art performance, highest energy efficiency or lowest power, smallest form factor, and the lowest\nmanufacturing cost of a target function. For example, in cable DOCSIS3.1 data gateways, our single-chip FSC receivers\ndigitize the entire cable spectrum and aggregate multiple frequency bands or channels using analog and digital signal co-\nprocessing to enable multi-gigabit data services. There is a 100-fold reduction in power per unit bandwidth while\nincreasing the total data throughput by an even greater factor. Our high-performance mixed-signal design capability, which\ninvolves the high-speed conversion of signals precisely and efficiently between analog and digital domains, is core to all\nour products and market applications, including high-speed optical interconnect applications inside data centers, 5G Access\ninfrastructure MMIMO radios, and millimeter wave and microwave wireless backhaul transport.\n• Advanced digital signal processing ASIC design and algorithms: Our signal processing algorithm and digital\napplication-specific integrated circuits, or ASIC, design expertise is at the core of our ability to employ digital signal\nprocessing to enable breakthroughs in CMOS analog RF front-end design and vice-versa. For example, impairments\nintroduced by analog systems such as power amplifiers and photonics devices are canceled using sophisticated digital\nsignal processing algorithms to achieve superior signal quality, reduce power consumption, and improve the speed of\noperation. Communication systems across a range of our current and future target markets share common signal processing\nfunctions, such as efficient error control coding, compensation for transmission medium or channel induced impairments,\nand digital processing of wideband signals. As such, algorithmic breakthroughs in one application are directly applicable to\nother product areas.\n• Embedded systems and software architecture: Our products contain complex integrated computer processing unit\nsubsystems. These subsystems typically include multiple low-power microprocessor cores, packet processor, bus and\nperipherals, memory controllers, and interrupt processing. In addition to signal processing and supervisory activity\nfunctions, we also implement multiple layers of real-time embedded firmware and protocol stacks on a single chip. We\nbelieve our expertise and track record of successfully developing widely deployed, reliable embedded protocols for\nnetworking applications are essential to the evolution of connected home products of the future. Our firmware design\ncapability is critical to the ease of use of our products in end customer platforms.\n• Architecture and system design for highly integrated end-to-end communication platform solutions: Our novel design\ntechniques tradeoff individual signal path circuit level performance to optimize the overall system performance. Our\nholistic platform and system level design approach eliminates costly, and power-hungry overdesign of individual circuit\nelements. It allows us to address more complex customer problems that require a deeper understanding of the customer’s\nend product. Our products not only integrate the entire physical layer, or PHY, but also implement complete protocol\nstacks along with ready-for-use product level interface functionality and associated platform software. We also provide\nefficient and cost-effective platform level power management integrated circuit solutions that regulate and monitor the\npower consumption for our chips and other circuits on the platform. The integration of the entire system on a single-chip or\nutilizing minimal number of silicon dies reduces the number of external board-level components, decreases board space,\nimproves performance, simplifies customers’ product design, and significantly reduces power consumption.\n10\n• Low-power design methodology: The superior energy efficiency of our products reflects our years of cumulative\nexperience and research and development, or R&D, investment in system architecture, semiconductor device modeling,\nand integrated circuit design expertise. At extremely high data rates, when electrical signals transit on and off the chip,\nthere is a severe penalty in speed and power consumption. Therefore, significant reduction in power consumption of a\ndevice requires minimization of signal transitions between multiple chips. Our ability to achieve the highest levels of\nintegration of all analog/RF and digital signal processing functionality on the same chip minimizes power consumption by\neliminating such signal transitions. Our solutions disproportionately impact our end-customer’s product power dissipation,\nsuch as in cable modems, cable FDX fiber nodes, 400Gbps optical transceiver modules, and large 5G antenna radio\ntransceiver arrays. Low power dissipation not only simplifies costly thermal design, but also eliminates the need for bulky\nfans and other cooling aids. This in turn improves end customer product reliability, increases the density of product\nfeatures that can be supported in a compact footprint, and reduces overall system cost.\n• Scalable Platform: Our products share common, modular components such as data converters, radio architectures,\nsignal processing algorithms, and digital signal processing circuit architectures, which enables us to offer fully integrated\nbroadband RF transceiver based digital communication SoC solutions across a wide variety of markets while meeting the\nstringent performance requirements of these end market applications and standards. This contrasts to legacy solutions that\nrequire significant customization to conform to the various regional standards, technical performance and product feature\nrequirements. As a result, our customers can minimize their design resources required to develop applications for multiple\ntarget markets using our platform solutions. In addition, we are able to deploy our engineering resources more efficiently to\nboth diversify and address larger communications end markets.\nOur Strategy\nOur objective is to be the leading provider of communications SoCs for the connected home, wired and wireless\ninfrastructure, and industrial and multi-market applications. We aim to continue to leverage our core analog and digital signal\nco-processing competencies to expand into other communications markets with similar performance requirements. The key\nelements of our strategy are:\n• Extend Technology Leadership in RF Transceivers and RF Transceiver + Digital Signal Processing + Embedded\nProcessor SoCs: We believe that our success thus far is largely attributable to a combination of our RF and mixed-signal\ndesign capability together with advanced digital design expertise. We have leveraged this core competency to develop\nhigh-performance, low-cost semiconductor solutions for broadband communications applications spanning the connected\nhome, wireless access and backhaul network infrastructure, and high-speed fiber-optic modules for data center, metro, and\nlong-haul infrastructure markets. We will continue to invest in this capability and strive to be an innovation leader in this\nmarket.\n• Leverage and Expand our Existing Customer Base: We target customers who are leaders in their respective markets.\nWe intend to continue to focus on sales to customers who are leaders in our current target markets, and to build on our\nrelationships with these leading customers to define and enhance our product roadmap. By solving the specific problems\nfaced by our customers, we can minimize the risks associated with our customers’ adoption of our new integrated circuit\nproducts and reduce the length of time from the start of product design to customer revenue. Further, engaging with market\nleaders will enable us to participate in emerging technology trends and new industry standards.\n• Target Additional High-Growth Markets: Our core competency is in RF analog and mixed-signal integrated circuit\ndesign in CMOS process technology. Several of the technological challenges involved in developing RF solutions for video\nbroadcasting and broadband reception are common to a majority of broader communications markets. We intend to\nleverage our core competency in developing highly integrated RF transceiver and RF transceiver SoCs in standard CMOS\nprocess technology to address additional markets within broadband communications, communications infrastructure, and\nconnectivity markets that we believe offer high growth potential.\n• Expand Global Presence: Due to the global nature of our supply chain and customer locations, we intend to resume\nexpansion of our sales, design and technical support organization both in the United States and overseas in future years as\nwe develop products to drive future growth. In particular, we expect to align our regional support to our customer base. We\nbelieve that our customers will increasingly expect this kind of local capability and support.\n• Attract and Retain Top Talent: We are committed to recruiting and retaining highly talented personnel with proven\nexpertise in the design, development, marketing and sales of communications integrated circuits. We believe that we have\n11\nassembled a high-quality team in all the areas of expertise required at an integrated circuit design and communications\nsystems company. Providing an attractive work environment for all of our employees is important to us. We believe that\nour ability to attract the best engineers is a critical component of our future growth and success in our chosen markets.\nCustomers\nWe sell our products, directly and indirectly, to OEMs, module makers and ODMs, and we refer to these as our end\ncustomers. By providing a highly integrated reference design solution that our customers can incorporate in their products with\nminimal modifications, we enable our customers to design cost-effective high-performance SoC-based solutions rapidly. A\nsignificant portion of our sales are through distributors based in Asia, who then resell our product.\nA significant portion of our net revenue has historically been generated by a limited number of customers. In the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, ten customers accounted for approximately 54%, 65% and 69% of our net revenue,\nrespectively. In the year ended December 31, 2023, one of our direct customers represented 10% of our net revenue, and in the\nyears ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, two of our direct customers represented 31% and 26%, respectively, of our net\nrevenue.\nProducts shipped to Asia accounted for 75%, 82% and 83% of our net revenue in the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. Products shipped to Hong Kong accounted for 37%, 43%, and 40% of our net revenue in the years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Products shipped to China accounted for 11%, 16% and 12% of our\nnet revenue in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Products shipped to Vietnam accounted for\n13% of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although a large percentage of our products are shipped to Asia,\nwe believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers and incorporating our semiconductor products\nare then sold outside Asia. For example, revenue generated from sales of our cable modem products during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 related principally to sales to Asian ODM’s and contract manufacturers delivering products\ninto European and North American markets. To date, all of our sales have been denominated in United States dollars.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell our products worldwide through multiple channels, using our direct sales force, third party sales representatives,\nand a network of domestic and international distributors. We have direct sales personnel covering the United States, Europe and\nAsia. We also employ a staff of field applications engineers to provide direct engineering support locally to some of our\ncustomers.\nOur distributors are independent entities that assist us in identifying and servicing customers in a particular territory,\nusually on a non-exclusive basis. Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 50%, 46%, and 47% of our net revenue in\nthe years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOur sales cycles typically require a significant amount of time and a substantial expenditure of resources before we can\nrealize revenue from the sale of products, if any. Our typical sales cycle consists of a multi-month sales and development\nprocess involving our customers’ system designers and management.\nWe generally receive purchase orders from our customers approximately six to twenty-six weeks prior to the scheduled\nproduct delivery date. Because of the scheduling requirements of our foundries and assembly and test contractors, we generally\nprovide our contractors production forecasts six to twelve months in advance and place firm orders for products with our\nsuppliers up to twenty-six weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date, in some cases without a purchase order from our own\ncustomers. Our standard warranty provides that products containing defects in materials, workmanship or product performance\nmay be returned for a refund of the purchase price or for replacement, at our discretion.\nRaw Materials\nAs a fabless designer of integrated circuits, we do not directly procure raw materials and instead, rely on third parties to\nmanufacture, assemble and test, or supply, our products, as described in further detail under the below heading\n“Manufacturing.” To a lesser extent, we also purchase certain turnkey, or finished goods product, for resale. Raw materials used\nby third party foundries, assembly and test contractors and turnkey product vendors include silicon wafers, as well as lead\nframes or substrate materials, gold or copper wires, and molding compounds used in assembly/packaging and test of our\nproducts. We work closely with our vendors in providing a supplier forecast six to twelve months in advance to ensure they\nhave an adequate supply of raw materials to cover our forecast.\n12\nManufacturing\nWe use third-party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture, assemble and test our products. We also\nrely on certain vendors to supply turnkey products, including, in particular, Intel Corporation, for certain products we sell. This\noutsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design, sale and marketing of our products. Our\nengineers work closely with our foundries and other contractors to increase yield, lower manufacturing costs and improve\nproduct quality while maintaining a socially responsible supply chain.\nWafer Fabrication. We utilize an increasing range of process technologies to manufacture our products, from standard\nCMOS to more exotic processes including SiGe and GaAs. Within this range of processes, we use a variety of process\ntechnology nodes ranging from 0.25µ down to 5 nanometer. We depend on independent silicon foundry manufacturers to\nsupport our wafer fabrication requirements. Our key foundry partners include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\nCorporation, or TSMC, in Taiwan, and United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, in Taiwan and Singapore. We generally\ndo not depend on a single source for the supply of our materials. Additionally, certain of products are supplied to us under the\nterms of a supply agreement with Intel.\nOutsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test. Upon completion of the silicon processing at the foundry, we forward the\nfinished silicon wafers to independent semiconductor assembly and test service subcontractors. The majority of our assembly/\npackaging and test requirements are supported by the following independent subcontractors: Advanced Semiconductor\nEngineering, or ASE, Greatek Electronics, Inc., JCET Group Co., Ltd, Signetics Corporation, SIGURD Microelectronics Corp.,\nand Silicon Precision Industries.\nQuality Assurance. We have implemented significant quality assurance procedures to assure high levels of product\nquality for our customers. Our operations are certified under ISO 9001:2015 standards. We closely monitor the work-in-\nprogress information and production records maintained by our suppliers, and communicate with our third-party contractors to\nassure high levels of product quality and an efficient manufacturing time cycle. Upon successful completion of the quality\nassurance procedures, all of our products are stored and shipped to our customers or distributors directly from third-party\ncontractors and logistics agents in accordance with our shipping instructions.\nCorporate Social Responsibility\nAs we continue to expand our presence around the world, we are mindful of our responsibility to reduce our carbon\nfootprint, maintain a socially responsible supply chain, and advance equity, diversity and inclusion. Our board of directors and\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees our environmental, social and governance directives.\nReduce our carbon footprint. MaxLinear takes our common stewardship of the environment seriously. We believe\nhuman activities are contributing to climate change, and that we, and global society, must do our part to reduce our greenhouse\ngas emissions and to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5ºC as called for in the Paris Agreement. Among other things,\nwe monitor our global environmental footprint, both directly and indirectly, and in our development efforts, our engineers are\nconsistently focused on improving the power efficiency and thermal performance of our chips, minimizing water consumption\nand waste, promoting recycling of reusable materials, and providing customer satisfaction through compliance with global\nenvironmental regulations as they relate to our products and operations. We are committed to contributing to the reduction of\ngreenhouse gas emissions, and we are currently taking measures to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and environmental\nimpact such as purchasing 100% renewable energy for our facilities in California and elsewhere where available, using key\nsuppliers that focus on sustainability as described below, enhancing our offices with energy saving improvements, and\ntransitioning away from one-time use plastics used in the office to sustainable reusable products. We are currently assessing\nadditional measures to further reduce our emissions, which are reported annually on our website, and we plan to set formal\ntargets for reducing emissions in the future.\nAs a fabless semiconductor design company, we do not manufacture our products and, with respect to the activities we\nconduct directly, we believe we leave a limited environmental footprint. With respect to our indirect environmental impact, we\nconsider and monitor the practices of our current and prospective foundry partners and suppliers in assessing environmental\nrisks in our supply chain and in selecting key vendors. We believe that our key suppliers have made a public commitment to\nintegrate sustainability and sensitivity to environmental impact into their manufacturing processes. For example, according to\ntheir company websites, four of our largest manufacturing partners, Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Intel Corporation,\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, and United Microelectronics Corporation, each maintain well-developed environmental\nmanagement and sustainability programs that are publicly avowed and supported by the highest levels of management within\nthose organizations and have either set targets to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions, or otherwise reduce such emissions,\n13\nincluding in their manufacturing plans and processes. We aim to have all manufacturing partners that are certified with ISO\n14001 international standards for environmental management systems and plan to launch manufacturing partner audits in the\nfuture. We also participate in recycling of integrated circuits and boards. Additionally, our products are compliant with the\nRestriction of Hazardous Substances, or RoHS, and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, or\nREACH, standards in the European Union, or EU.\nSocially responsible supply chain. We are committed to the use of a socially responsible supply chain to reduce the risk\nof human rights violations and the use of conflict minerals (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, or 3TG) from the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo and certain adjoining countries. We are committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights\nunder the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Our efforts\ninclude maintaining an anti-slavery policy, and a business partner labor standards policy which bars the use of forced or child\nlabor and slavery and a conflict minerals policy governing the use and distribution of 3TG minerals, as well as conducting due\ndiligence before allowing a potential supplier to become a preferred supplier. We request the return of reporting forms related to\nconflict minerals from our suppliers under the Responsible Minerals Initiative, or RMI, Conflict Minerals Survey. We file an\nannual conflict minerals report. Further, we remove any suppliers that continue to fail to meet our business partner labor\nstandards and conflict minerals policies after being provided the opportunity to remedy non-compliance via implementation of a\ncorrective action plan.\nEquity, diversity, and inclusion. We acknowledge that we, along with the semiconductor and broader technology\nindustry, can do more to advance gender and racial equality by increasing representation of underrepresented minorities as well\nas females in leadership and technical positions including engineering and other roles. We aim to increase our hiring and\nretention of female and diverse talent including direct hires or interns from universities, including other applicable affirmative\naction programs requested by our customers. In November 2023, we formed a Women in Engineering group in the United\nStates to promote leadership skills and opportunities for female engineers and seek opportunities to recruit more female\nengineering graduates. We report employee gender and race statistics under the below heading “Human Capital” elsewhere in\nthis document and in our annual proxy statement.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to both improve our existing products and to develop new\nproducts for both existing and new markets. We direct our R&D efforts largely to the development of new high-performance,\nmixed-signal RF transceivers and SOCs for the connected home, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multi-\nmarket applications. We target applications that require stringent overall system performance and low power consumption. As\nnew and challenging communication applications proliferate, we believe that many of these applications may benefit from our\nSoC solutions combining analog and mixed-signal processing with digital signal processing functions. We have assembled a\nteam of highly skilled semiconductor and embedded software design engineers with expertise in broadband RF, mixed-signal\nand high-performance analog integrated circuit design, digital signal processing, communications systems and SoC design. As\nof December 31, 2023, we had approximately 1,328 employees in our R&D group. Our engineering design teams are located in\nCarlsbad, Irvine, and San Jose in California; Boston, Massachusetts; Singapore; Shanghai, and Shenzhen in China; Taipei and\nHsinchu in Taiwan; Bangalore and Chennai in India; and Austria, Canada, Germany, Israel, and Spain.\nCompetition\nWe compete with both established and development-stage semiconductor companies that design, manufacture and\nmarket analog and mixed-signal broadband RF receivers, optical interconnects, high-performance interface, data and video\ncompression and encryption, and power management products. Our competitors include companies with much longer operating\nhistories, greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases and substantially greater financial, technical and operational\nresources, as well as smaller companies specializing in narrow markets, to internal or vertically integrated engineering groups\nwithin certain of our customers. In addition, our industry is experiencing substantial consolidation. As a result, our competitors\nare increasingly large multi-national semi-conductor companies with substantial market influence. Our competitors may\ndevelop products that are similar or superior to ours. We consider our primary competitors to be companies with a proven track\nrecord of supporting market leaders and the technical capability to develop and bring to market competing broadband RF\nreceiver and RF receiver SoC, modem, and optical interconnect products. Our primary merchant semiconductor competitors\ninclude Broadcom, Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, Realtek Semiconductor Corp., Skyworks Solutions, Inc., Credo\nSemiconductor Inc., MediaTek, Inc., Marvell Technology Group Ltd., MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., Texas\nInstruments Incorporated, Analog Devices, Inc., Renesas Electronics Corporation, Microchip Technology Inc. and Semtech\nCorporation. Because our products often are building block semiconductors which provide functions that in some cases can be\nintegrated into more complex integrated circuits, we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits, some of\n14\nwhich may be existing customers or platform partners that develop their own integrated circuit products. If we cannot offer an\nattractive solution for applications where our competitors offer more fully integrated products, we may lose significant market\nshare to our competitors. Some of our targeted customers for our optical interconnect solutions are module makers who are\nvertically integrated, where we compete with internally supplied components, and we compete with much larger analog and\nmixed-signal catalog competitors in the multi-market high-performance analog markets.\nThe market for RF, mixed-signal and high-performance analog semiconductor products is highly competitive, and we\nbelieve that it will grow more competitive as a result of continued technological advances. We believe that the principal\ncompetitive factors in our markets include the following:\n• product performance;\n• features and functionality;\n• energy efficiency;\n• size;\n• ease of system design;\n• customer support;\n• product roadmap;\n• reputation;\n• reliability; and\n• price.\nWe believe that we compete favorably as measured against each of these criteria. However, our ability to compete in the\nfuture will depend upon the successful design, development and marketing of compelling RF, analog, digital, and mixed-signal\nsemiconductor integrated solutions for high growth communications markets. In addition, our competitive position will depend\non our ability to continue to attract and retain talent while protecting our intellectual property.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nOur success and ability to compete depends, in part, upon our ability to establish and adequately protect our proprietary\ntechnology and confidential information. To protect our technology and confidential information, we rely on a combination of\nintellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks. We also protect our proprietary\ntechnology and confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with\nemployees, contractors, business partners, consultants and advisors. Protecting mask works, or the “topography” or\nsemiconductor material designs, of our integrated circuit products is of particular importance to our business and we seek to\nprevent or limit the ability of others to copy, reproduce or distribute our mask works.\nWe have over one thousand issued patents and numerous patent applications pending in the United States. We also have\nissued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications. We file U.S and foreign patent applications to protect our\nintellectual property. Patents generally have a duration of twenty years from filing. While the remaining duration on the\nindividual patents in our patent portfolio varies, we believe that the duration of our issued patents is adequate relative to the\nexpected lives of our products.\nWe own numerous trademarks related to our current products that have been registered in the United States and 5\npending U.S. trademark applications. We own foreign counterparts of certain of these registered trademarks in Brazil, Canada,\nChile, China, the EU, Germany, Great Britain, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. We also\nclaim common law rights in certain other trademarks that are not registered. Trademark rights may continue for a limited\nduration or in perpetuity, provided certain requirements are met.\nWe may not gain any competitive advantages from our patents and other intellectual property rights. Our existing and\nfuture patents may be circumvented, designed around, blocked or challenged as to inventorship, ownership, scope, validity or\nenforceability. It is possible that we may be provided with information in the future that could negatively affect the scope or\nenforceability of either our present or future patents. Furthermore, our pending and future patent applications may or may not\n15\nbe granted under the scope of the claims originally submitted in our patent applications. The scope of the claims submitted or\ngranted may or may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements for various technologies, such as a license agreement with Intel\nCorporation relating to demodulator technologies that are licensed specifically for use in our products for cable gateways. The\nlicense agreement with Intel Corporation has a perpetual term, but Intel Corporation may terminate the agreement for any\nuncured material breach or in the event of bankruptcy. If the agreement is terminated, we would not be able to manufacture or\nsell products that contain the demodulator technology licensed from Intel Corporation, and there would be a delay in the\nshipment of our products containing the technology until we found a replacement for the demodulator technology in the\nmarketplace on commercially reasonable terms or we developed the demodulator technology itself. We believe we could find a\nsubstitute for the currently licensed demodulator technology in the marketplace on commercially reasonable terms or develop\nthe demodulator technology ourselves. In either case, obtaining new licenses or replacing existing technology could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, as described in “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property — We utilize a\nsignificant amount of intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business\ncould be adversely affected.”\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation and other vigorous offensive and protective\nenforcement actions over rights to intellectual property. Moreover, there are numerous patents in the semiconductor industry,\nand new patents are being granted rapidly worldwide. Third parties may obtain patents that block or limit our ability to develop\nnew technology and/or improve our existing products. If our products were found to infringe any patents or other intellectual\nproperty rights held by third parties, we could be prevented from selling our products or be subject to litigation fees, statutory\nfines and/or other significant expenses. We have initiated and could in the future be required to initiate litigation in order to\nenforce any patents issued to us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third-party’s patent or other proprietary rights, as\ndescribed in “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Intellectual Property – We utilize a significant amount of intellectual property in\nour business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected\" and in “Item 3 –\nLegal Proceedings.” We may in the future be contacted by third parties suggesting that we seek a license to intellectual property\nrights that they may believe we are infringing. In addition, in the future, we may be subject to lawsuits by third parties seeking\nto enforce their own intellectual property rights, as described in “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property — We\nhave settled in the past intellectual property litigation and may face additional claims of intellectual property infringement.\nCurrent litigation and any future litigation could be time-consuming, costly to defend or settle and result in the loss of\nsignificant rights” and in “Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.”\nGovernmental Regulation\nOur business and operations around the world are subject to government regulation at the international, national, state,\nprovincial, and local level. These regulations various aspects of our business and include regulations regarding environmental,\nhealth, and safety matters, such as laws and regulations adopted by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration or\nsimilar authorities in other jurisdictions. We believe that our properties and operations comply in all material respects with\napplicable laws protecting the environment and worker health and safety. We do not manufacture our own products but do\nmaintain laboratory space at certain of our facilities to facilitate the development, evaluation, and testing of our products. These\nlaboratories may maintain quantities of hazardous materials. While we believe we are in material compliance with applicable\nlaw concerning the safeguarding of these materials and with respect to other matters relating to health, safety, and the\nenvironment, the risk of liability relating to hazardous conditions or materials cannot be eliminated completely. To date, we\nhave not incurred significant expenditures relating to environmental compliance at our facilities nor have we experienced any\nmaterial issues relating to employee health and safety. We cannot provide assurances, however, that issues will not arise in the\nfuture or that applicable law will not require us to incur significant compliance expenditures.\nCertain of our products and technology are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, which are\nadministered by the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, and we are required to\nobtain an export license before we can export certain controlled products or technology to specified countries or customers. In\naddition, BIS imposes broad restrictions on certain identified entities and individuals, including those identified on the BIS\n“Denied Persons” list and BIS Entity List.\nSince October 2022, the United States government has taken steps to restrict the export of certain advanced\nsemiconductor products and technology to the People’s Republic of China and/or certain companies located in China due to\nnational security and human rights concerns. In October 2022, BIS announced additional restrictions on products and/or\ntechnology destined for use in the People’s Republic of China, including additional export controls and/or requirements on (1)\n16\ncertain advanced computing integrated circuits, computer commodities that contain such integrated circuits and certain\nsemiconductor manufacturing items; (2) products and/or technologies that may be destined for facilities capable of producing\ncertain advanced node integrated circuits; and (3) transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor\nmanufacturing end uses. In October 2023, BIS announced additional restrictions on the export of certain advanced\nsemiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing technology to China, primarily focused on integrated circuits with military,\ndata center, or artificial intelligence applications. Pursuant to those October 2023 export control amendments, various\ncategories of integrated circuits are now subject to export licensing and export control restrictions for export or reexport to\nChina and certain other countries. Since October 2022, we have restricted or curtailed business with certain customers and\npartners in China as a result of BIS restrictions.\nWe have experienced and could continue to experience a loss of revenues or supply while we are obtaining licenses\nneeded to do business with certain customers, suppliers, and any other business partners who are added to the Entity List, and\nfailure to obtain any required license has resulted and could in the future result in a reduction of anticipated revenues or supply\nuntil an alternate source of supply can be obtained. We cannot guarantee that additional export control restrictions or any\nsanctions imposed in the future will not restrict, prevent, or materially limit, our ability to conduct business with certain\ncustomers, suppliers, business partners or in certain countries. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to\nmaintain ongoing compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or\nagents will not violate such laws or policies. Any such violations of trade laws, restrictions, or regulations can result in fines;\ncriminal sanctions against us or our officers, directors, or employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage\nto our reputation. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to remedy violations of, these regulations\nand laws. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations and laws, we may be required to suspend sales to\nthese customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. The technology industry is\nsubject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal\nactions, and penalties.\nOur business is also subject to various rules and regulations applicable to multinational public companies in the\nsemiconductor industry, including: federal securities laws; competition laws and regulations, such as those promulgated by the\nU.S. Federal Trade Commission or authorities in the European Union; anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977; and, additional global trade regulation, such as export controls and trade sanctions,\namong others. We are also subject to the rules and regulations of industry standards bodies such as the International\nOrganization for Standardization, among others. These laws and regulations are complex, may change frequently and with\nlimited notice, and may continue to become more stringent over time. We may incur significant expenditures in a future period\nas a result.\nHuman Capital\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified personnel, and achieving those\nobjectives requires us to maintain a work environment and culture that values diversity. As the source of our technological and\nproduct innovations, our design and technical personnel represent a significant asset. We operate across eighteen countries and\nare sensitive to the many cultures and backgrounds constituting our employee base.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 1,759 full-time employees, including 1,328 in R&D, 265 in sales and marketing, 37 in\noperations and semiconductor technology and 129 in administration. We have employees across 18 countries: 49% are in Asia,\n25% in the Americas, 14% in Europe and 12% in the Middle East. Our workforce is represented by the following race/\nethnicities: 62% Asian, 30% White or Middle Eastern, 8% Latinx or Hispanic origin, with 44% Asian and 56% White or\nMiddle Eastern in senior management. Females represented 29% of our outside directors, 11% of senior management, 15% of\nour technical roles, and 19% of our total workforce. Of our total employee workforce, 9% is represented by Work Councils in\nAustria and Germany. The Work Council groups, common to these countries, are comprised of employees elected by the\ngeneral employee base. We consider our global employee relations to be good. In 2023, our employee voluntary turnover rate\nwas 7%.\nOur human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, attracting and retaining talented and experienced\nemployees, advisors, and consultants. We utilize multiple online search tools, specialized recruiting firms, employee referral\nprograms and university hires to ensure a varied outreach approach for candidates. We aim to increase our hiring and retention\nof female talent including direct hires or interns from universities. We offer this via a combination of competitive base salary,\ntime-based equity incentives and bonus plans linked to financial performance that are designed to motivate and reward\npersonnel with annual grants of stock-based and cash-based incentive compensation awards to our employees, some of which\n17\nvest over a period of four years, plus other benefits, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by\nmotivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve both our short and long-term objectives. We\noffer competitive benefits tailored to local markets and laws and designed to support employee health, welfare and retirement;\nexamples of such benefits may include hybrid work schedules with one flexible day allowing all employees globally to work\nfrom home; paid time off; 401(k), pension or other retirement plans; employee leave or part-time arrangements to support well-\nbeing of employees and their dependents; sabbaticals; bereavement leave; employee stock purchase plan; basic and voluntary\nlife, disability and supplemental insurance; medical, dental and vision insurance; health savings and flexible spending accounts;\nrelocation assistance; and employee assistance programs. Our global training and development program includes internal on-\nthe-job training and we have launched a pilot training program which includes seminars, podcasts and recommended learnings\nunder which we have received significant employee participation. Our corporate training program, which is mandatory, covers\ntraining on discrimination-free workplace, as well as our code of ethics and employee conduct, insider trading policy, global\nexport controls and economic sanctions policy, global anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy, and anti-trust and competition\nlaw.\nOur executive compensation structure aligns executive incentives with the long-term growth objectives of MaxLinear,\nincluding long-term share price appreciation. In that regard, our executive compensation programs have tended to place a\nrelatively heavier weighting on equity compensation than our peers and include a performance-based metric to executives’\nequity incentives in addition to other forms of compensation offered to all employees. For more details regarding our executive\ncompensation, refer to information incorporated by reference from the information set forth under the captions “Executive\nCompensation” and “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” in either an amendment to this Form 10-K or our upcoming 2024\nProxy Statement.\nWe also comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety and are subject to audits by entities\nsuch as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, in the United States. We rely on third parties to\nmanufacture our products and require our suppliers to maintain a safe work environment, as described in further detail under the\nabove heading “Manufacturing.”\nSeasonality\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid\nproduct obsolescence and price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product\nsupply and demand. From time to time, these and other factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause\nsignificant upturns and downturns in the industry, and in our business in particular.\nIn addition, our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors,\nsuch as the overall demand volatility for semiconductor solutions across a diverse range of communications, industrial and\nmultimarket applications, the timing of receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant orders, the gain or loss of significant\ncustomers, market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products, our ability to timely develop, introduce and market\nnew products and technologies, the availability and cost of products from our suppliers, new product and technology\nintroductions by competitors, intellectual property disputes and the timing and extent of product development costs. For\nexample, we often experience flat-to-declining revenue in the first quarter of each fiscal year and increasing revenue in the\nsecond quarter of each fiscal year. Our historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might\nhave influenced our business to date. If our growth rate continues to slow, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may\nbecome more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and\nprospects.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Form 10-K, including any information that may be incorporated by reference\nherein, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,\nreferred to as the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. In\nsome cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,”\n“intend,” “forecast,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue” or the negative of these terms or\nother comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K involve known and unknown risks,\nuncertainties and situations that may cause our or our industry’s actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements\nto be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these\nstatements. These factors include those listed below in this Item 1A and those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We\nencourage investors to review these factors carefully. We may from time to time make additional written and oral forward-\n18\nlooking statements, including statements contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.\nHowever, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of\nus, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.\nThe following discussion provides information concerning the material risks and uncertainties that we have identified\nand believe may adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations. Before you decide whether\nto invest in our securities, you should carefully consider these risk factors together with all of the other information included in\nthis Form 10-K, and in our other public filings, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results.\nOur risk factors are not guarantees that no such conditions exist as of the date of this report and should not be interpreted as\nan affirmative statement that such risks or conditions have not materialized, in whole or in part.\nFor the risks relating to our terminated merger with Silicon Motion, please refer to the section of these risk factors\ncaptioned “Risks Relating to the Terminated Merger with Silicon Motion.”\nRisk Factor Summary\nRisks Relating to the Terminated Merger with Silicon Motion\n• The termination of the Merger Agreement and the related legal proceedings have caused us to incur substantial costs,\nmay divert management’s attention from our business and could otherwise adversely affect our business, financial\nresults and operations.\n• If we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger\nAgreement with Silicon Motion, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make\nany payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount\nof such damages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and\nuse our cash resources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain\nfinancing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional capital for any such payments.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n• We face intense competition and expect competition to increase in the future, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and market share.\n• Global economic conditions, including factors such as high inflation or a potential recession, could continue to\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n• We are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.\n• A significant variance in our operating results or rates of growth, if any, could continue to lead to substantial volatility\nin our stock price. Our revenue has declined, and we may not sustain our current level of revenue, which has declined,\nand/or manage future growth effectively. The impact of excess inventory in the channel has continued to influence our\ncustomers’ expected demand for certain of our products.\n• Our business, financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by military\nconflicts, geopolitical and economic tensions among countries in which we conduct business, including between the\nUnited States and China, among other countries. For example, as more entities are added to restricted export control\nlists, or as semiconductor technology exports to other countries are further controlled, our need to seek authorization\nfrom the U.S. government may impact our ability to do business.\n• Changes in trade policies among the United States and other countries, in particular the imposition of new or higher\ntariffs, could place pressure on our average selling prices as our customers seek to offset the impact of increased tariffs\non their own products. Increased tariffs or the imposition of other barriers to international trade could decrease demand\nand have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.\n• We will lose sales if we are unable to obtain or retain government authorization to export certain of our products or\ntechnology or if such authorizations are revoked, and we will be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do\nnot comply with applicable export control laws and regulations.\n• We also are subject to risks associated with international geopolitical and military conflicts.\n• We depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or a significant\nreduction in orders from major customers has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our revenue\nand operating results.\n• Any legal proceedings or claims against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could harm our\nreputation regardless of the outcome.\n19\n• We have been and may in the future be subject to information technology failures, including security breaches, cyber-\nattacks, design defects or system failures, that could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and adversely affect\nour business, operations, and financial results.\n• Average selling prices of our products have and could decrease in the future, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our revenue and gross margins.\n• If we fail to penetrate new applications and markets, our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and financial condition\ncould be materially and adversely affected.\n• A significant portion of our revenue is attributable to demand for our products in markets for broadband solutions, and\ndevelopment delays and consolidation trends among cable and satellite Pay-TV and broadband operators could\nadversely affect our future revenues and operating results.\n• We may be unable to make the substantial productive research and development investments that are required to\nremain competitive in our business.\n• The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses caused by undetected defects or bugs,\nwhich could reduce the market acceptance of our new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective\ncustomers and adversely affect our operating costs.\n• Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and have fluctuated in the past and\nmay fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors that could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\n• If we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain\ncustomers could be impaired and our competitive position could be harmed.\n• We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties, and differences between our estimates of customer demand and\nproduct mix and our actual results could continue to negatively affect our inventory levels, sales and operating results.\n• We may have difficulty accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses particularly\nas we seek to enter new markets where we may not have prior experience.\n• Our customers require our products and our third-party contractors to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification\nprocess which does not assure product sales.\n• We incur significant expenditures to win business and customer product plan cancellations may adversely affect our\nresults of operations.\n• A failure to maintain compliance with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n• If we are unable to attract, train and retain qualified personnel and senior management, our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects could suffer.\n• We are subject to a variable amount of interest on the principal balance of our credit agreements and could continue to\nbe adversely impacted by rising interest rates in the future. Such indebtedness adversely affects our operating results\nand cash-flows, as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations and contains financial and\noperational covenants that could adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that\nwe would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to\nfinance such transactions. In addition, rising interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers, and our\ndistributors to obtain financing and service our respective interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on\ncustomer demand for our products and our distributors’ business.\n• We are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, and\ncybersecurity.\n• Our products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted by end users in our markets.\n• We may, from time to time, make additional business acquisitions or investments, which involve significant risks.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\n• We have settled in the past intellectual property litigation and may in the future face additional claims of intellectual\nproperty infringement. Any current or future litigation could be time-consuming, costly to defend or settle and result in\nthe loss of significant rights.\n• If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\n• We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.\n• The use of open source software in our products, processes and technology may expose us to additional risks and harm\nour intellectual property.\n20\nRisks Relating to Reliance on Third Parties\n• Failure to manage our relationships with our third-party contractors successfully, or impacts from volatility in global\nsupply, natural disasters, public health crises, or other labor stoppages in the regions where such contractors operate,\ncould adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products.\n• Should any of our distributors cease or be forced to stop distributing our products, our business would suffer.\n• A lack of long-term supply contracts, and any supply disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n• Any failure of third parties to provide services and technology could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\n• Our management team may use our available cash and cash equivalents in ways with which you may not agree or in\nways which may not yield a return.\n• Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more\ndifficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of\nour common stock.\n• Our share price may be volatile as a result of various factors.\n• Any future decisions to reduce or discontinue purchasing our common stock, after we resume such purchasing,\npursuant to our stock repurchase programs could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nRisks Relating to our Terminated Merger with Silicon Motion\nThe termination of the Merger Agreement and the related legal proceedings have caused us to incur substantial costs,\nmay divert management’s attention from our business and could otherwise adversely affect our business, financial results and\noperations.\nWe terminated the Merger Agreement on July 26, 2023 and notified Silicon Motion that we are relieved of our obligation\nto close the merger. Silicon Motion has challenged the validity of that termination. On August 16, 2023, Silicon Motion\ndelivered to us a notice, which Silicon Motion publicly disclosed, that it was purporting to terminate the Merger Agreement and\nthat Silicon Motion would be commencing an arbitration before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre to seek damages\nfrom us arising from our alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement. On October 5, 2023, Silicon Motion filed a Notice of\nArbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre alleging that we breached the Merger Agreement. Additionally,\non August 31, 2023, a Silicon Motion stockholder filed a class action complaint against us and certain of our current officers\nalleging that we materially misrepresented the likelihood the merger would close. Other potential plaintiffs may file additional\nlawsuits related to the previously contemplated merger. See Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) of this report for more\ninformation on the Silicon Motion arbitration and the class action lawsuit. We intend to vigorously defend against these legal\nproceedings and any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, but due to the uncertainties inherent in any legal proceedings,\nwe cannot predict the outcome of any legal proceedings. Legal proceedings are time-consuming, and may divert management’s\nattention from our business. Legal proceedings are also expensive and could result in substantial costs to us, including any\ndamages we are required to pay and costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers. Please refer to the Risk\nFactor entitled “If we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the\nMerger Agreement with Silicon Motion, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make\nany payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such\ndamages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash\nresources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms\nif at all or raise additional capital for any such payments. Even if we are able to finance such payments through the incurrence\nof additional indebtedness, any material increase in our indebtedness would adversely affect our operating results and cash-\nflows as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations. Issuing additional shares of our common stock, if\nmaterial, will result in dilution of existing shares outstanding. Any loan agreement is also expected to contain financial and\noperational covenants that would adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we\nwould otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such\ntransactions.”\nWe have already incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial costs in connection with the previously pending\nmerger, the termination of the Merger Agreement, and the related legal proceedings. Aside from any damages or settlement\namounts we may be required to pay, these costs are primarily associated with the fees of our financial advisors, accountants,\nlenders, and legal counsel. Since the merger has been terminated, we will have received little or no benefit in respect of such\ncosts incurred. We may also experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our suppliers, customers, customer\n21\nprospects, and employees with regard to legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement. Any of these\nfactors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition or on the trading price of\nour common stock.\nIf we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger\nAgreement with Silicon Motion, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any\npayments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such\ndamages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash\nresources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms\nif at all or raise additional capital for any such payments. Even if we are able to finance such payments through the incurrence\nof additional indebtedness, any material increase in our indebtedness would adversely affect our operating results and cash-\nflows as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations. Issuing additional shares of our common stock, if\nmaterial, will result in dilution of existing shares outstanding. Any loan agreement is also expected to contain financial and\noperational covenants that would adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we\nwould otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such\ntransactions.\nIf we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger\nAgreement, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any\nsettlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such damages or payments\ncould be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash resources, which may not\nbe sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,\nand financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional\ncapital for any such payments. However, if we finance all or a portion of the payment of damages or settlement amounts\nthrough the incurrence of additional indebtedness, any material payment and increase in our indebtedness would adversely\naffect our ability to use cash generated from operations as we repay interest and principal under the term loans and revolving\ncredit facility, as applicable. Issuing additional shares of common stock, if material, would result in dilution of existing shares\noutstanding. In addition, our current credit agreement, and any new loan agreements, contain and would likely contain financial\nand operational covenants that may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain activities, including certain financing and\nacquisition transactions, stock repurchases, guarantees, and similar transactions, without obtaining the consent of the lenders,\nwhich may or may not be forthcoming. Such financial and operational covenants include compliance with a secured net\nleverage ratio test. Accordingly, outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue\nstrategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders.\nSpecifically, if we are required to pay damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the\nMerger Agreement, including for alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any\nsettlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, and we finance all or a portion of the\npayment of damages through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, any materially increased indebtedness could have\nimportant consequences to investors in our common stock, including the following:\n• our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service\nrequirements, or other purposes may be limited or financing may be unavailable;\n• rising interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers, and our distributors to obtain financing and\nservice our respective interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on customer demand for our products\nas well as the business of our distributors;\n• we could be subject to substantial variable interest rate risk because our interest rate under term loans typically varies\nbased on a fixed margin over an indexed rate (such as for the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit\nAgreement) or an adjusted base rate. If interest rates were to continue to increase substantially, and we incur additional\nindebtedness, it would adversely affect our operating results and could affect our ability to service the indebtedness;\n• a portion of our cash flows is dedicated to the payment of interest and when applicable, principal, on our indebtedness\nand other obligations and will not be available for use in our business;\n• our level of indebtedness, combined with rising interest rates, could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to,\nchanges in our business and the markets in which we operate, including limiting our future investments or ability to\nenter into acquisitions and strategic partnerships, and obtain financing for such transactions; and\n22\n• our high degree of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and/or a\ndownturn in our business, thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations.\nIf we fail to make required debt payments, or if we fail to comply with other covenants in our debt service agreements,\nwe would be in default under the terms of these agreements. Subject to customary cure rights, any default would permit the\nholders of the indebtedness to accelerate repayment of this debt and could cause defaults under other indebtedness that we have,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face intense competition and expect competition to increase in the future, which could have a material adverse effect\non our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and market share.\nThe global semiconductor market in general, and the broadband, wired and wireless infrastructure, and broader industrial\nand communications analog and mixed-signal markets in particular, are highly competitive. We compete in different target\nmarkets to various degrees on the basis of a number of principal competitive factors, including our products’ performance,\nfeatures and functionality, energy efficiency, size, ease of system design, customer support, product roadmap, reputation,\nreliability and price. We expect competition to increase and intensify as a result of industry consolidation and the resulting\ncreation of larger semiconductor companies. Large semiconductor companies resulting from industry consolidation could enjoy\nsubstantial market power, which they could exert through, among other things, aggressive pricing that could adversely affect\nour customer relationships, revenues, margins and profitability. In addition, we expect the internal resources of large, integrated\nOEMs may continue to enter our markets. Increased competition has resulted in price pressure, decreased demand, reduced\nrevenue and profitability, and loss of market share, any of which could in the future materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, revenue, revenue growth rates, if any, and operating results.\nAs our products are integrated into a variety of communications and industrial platforms, our competitors range from\nlarge, international merchant semiconductor companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies\nspecializing in narrow markets, to internal or vertically integrated engineering groups within certain of our customers. Our\nprimary merchant semiconductor competitors include Broadcom Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, Realtek Semiconductor Corp.,\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc., Credo Semiconductor Inc., MediaTek, Inc., Marvell Technology Group Ltd., MACOM Technology\nSolutions Holdings, Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated, Analog Devices, Inc., Renesas Electronics Corporation, Microchip\nTechnology Inc. and Semtech Corporation. It is quite likely that competition in the markets in which we participate will\nincrease in the future as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings. In addition, other companies are in the\nprocess of developing competing products for our current and target markets. Because our products often are building block\nsemiconductors which provide functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits, we also\nface competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits, some of which may be existing customers or platform partners that\ndevelop their own integrated circuit products. If we cannot offer an attractive solution for applications where our competitors\noffer more fully integrated products, we may lose significant market share to our competitors. Some of our targeted customers\nfor our optical interconnect solutions are module makers who are vertically integrated, where we compete with internally\nsupplied components, and we compete with much larger analog and mixed-signal catalog competitors in the multi-market high-\nperformance analog markets.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on factors both within and outside of our control, including industry and\ngeneral economic trends. During past periods of downturns in our industry, competition in the markets in which we operate\nintensified as manufacturers of semiconductors reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory\nlevels. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand similar adverse\neconomic or market conditions in the future. Moreover, the competitive landscape is changing as a result of intense\nconsolidation within our industry as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors, and\nother competitors have begun to collaborate with each other, which could result in significant changes to the competitive\nlandscape. In addition, changes in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could\nlimit our ability to sell our products to certain customers and adversely affect our ability to compete successfully. These\ndevelopments may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully\nin those markets.\n23\nGlobal economic conditions, including factors such as high inflation or a potential recession, could continue to\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInflation and uncertainty in customer demand and the worldwide economy has continued, and we expect to experience\ncontinued decline in our sales and revenues in the first quarter of 2024. In particular, we believe an economic slowdown and\ninventory oversupply will continue to add to volatility in managing the business. In addition, inventory oversupply could\npotentially lead to more inventory write-downs, including charges for any excess or obsolete inventory which could negatively\nimpact our gross margins. Our products are incorporated in numerous consumer devices, and demand for such products is\nultimately driven by consumer demand for products such as televisions, personal computers, automobiles, and cable modems.\nMany of these purchases are discretionary. Global economic volatility and economic volatility in the specific markets in which\nthe devices that incorporate our products are ultimately sold, including the impacts of current high rates of inflation and a\npotential recession, can cause extreme difficulties for our customers and third-party vendors in accurately forecasting and\nplanning future business activities. If banks and financial institutions with whom we have banking relationships enter\nreceivership or become insolvent in the future, we may be unable to access, and we may lose, some or all of our existing cash,\ncash equivalents and investments to the extent those funds are not insured or otherwise protected by the FDIC. This\nunpredictability has and could continue to cause our customers to delay or reduce their capital expenditures and spending on\nour products, which would delay and lengthen sales cycles and negatively affect the overall demand for our products.\nWorsening economic instability could continue to result in a cancellation of such orders or otherwise adversely affect spending\nfor information technology and limit our ability to forecast future demand for our products, which could reduce expected\nrevenues or result in a write-down of any excess or obsolete inventory. Furthermore, during challenging economic times, our\ncustomers may face challenges in gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impact their ability to make timely\npayments to us. These events, together with economic volatility that may face the broader economy and, in particular, the\nsemiconductor and communications industries, may adversely affect, our business, particularly to the extent that consumers\ndecrease their discretionary spending for devices deploying our products. However, the magnitude of such volatility on our\nbusiness and its duration is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nOther areas of our business which could be disrupted or subject to negative impacts of negative global economic\nconditions may include, but may not be limited to, the following:\n• Reduced ability to accurately predict our future revenue and budget future expenses;\n• Inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in design win, product development, production and fulfillment;\n• Accounts receivable collection issues should any of our limited and significant customers experience liquidity\nconcerns;\n• Material impacts to the value of our common stock, which may result in impairment of our goodwill;\n• Material impairment of our assets, if recoverability thereof becomes a concern; and\n• Decreased availability of capital or access thereto in the United States and from other jurisdictions in which we\noperate.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid\nproduct obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply\nand demand. The current downturn, which was aggravated by certain factors such as high interest rates and excess channel\ninventory, has resulted in, or any future downturns may result in, diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high\ninventory levels and accelerated erosion of our average selling prices. Furthermore, any future upturn in the semiconductor\nindustry could result in increased competition for access to third-party foundry and assembly capacity. We are dependent on the\navailability of this capacity to manufacture and assemble all of our products. None of our third-party foundry or assembly\ncontractors has provided assurances that adequate capacity will be available to us in the future. A significant downturn or\nupturn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n24\nA significant variance in our operating results or rates of growth, if any, could continue to lead to substantial volatility\nin our stock price. Our revenue has declined, and we may not sustain our current level of revenue, which has declined, and/or\nmanage future growth effectively. The impact of excess inventory in the channel has continued to influence our customers’\nexpected demand for certain of our products.\nOur net revenue decreased from $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2022 to $693.3 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and the decline in net revenue could continue in future periods. Among other factors, the decrease is as a\nresult of macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand. Prior to 2023, our net revenues grew to $1.1 billion for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. We currently expect that revenue will fluctuate in the future, from period-to-period, consistent\nwith the cyclical nature of our industry, and we expect to experience further decline in revenue in the first quarter of 2024 due\nto current macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand for various products. Further, the impact of excess inventory\nin the channel has continued to influence our customers’ expected demand for some of our products.\nIn addition, in October 2023, we initiated a reduction of our workforce to align our operational needs with the changes in\nmacroeconomic conditions and the demand environment. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings\nand improvements from our reduction of our workforce due to unforeseen difficulties, delays or unexpected costs. If we are\nunable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from our reduction of our workforce, our operating\nresults and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nYou should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future\noperating performance. Please refer to the Risk Factor entitled “Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and\nannual fluctuations and have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors that could\nadversely affect our business and our stock price” for a discussion of factors contributing to variances in our operating results\nor rates of growth, if any. If we are unable to resume adequate revenue growth and manage our operating expenses, our\nfinancial results could suffer and our stock price could decline.\nTo manage any future growth successfully, we believe we must effectively, among other things:\n• successfully develop new products and penetrate new applications and markets;\n• recruit, hire, train and manage additional qualified engineers for our research and development activities, especially\nin the positions of design engineering, product and test engineering and applications engineering;\n• implement and improve our administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls; and\n• enhance our information technology support for enterprise resource planning and design engineering by adapting\nand expanding our systems and tool capabilities, and properly training new hires as to their use.\nIf we are unable to resume and manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market\nopportunities or develop new products and we may fail to satisfy customer requirements, maintain product quality, execute our\nbusiness plan, or respond to competitive pressures.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by military conflicts,\ngeopolitical and economic tensions among countries in which we conduct business, including between the United States and\nChina, among other countries. For example, as more entities are added to restricted export control lists, or as semiconductor\ntechnology exports to other countries are further controlled, our need to seek authorization from the U.S. government may\nimpact our ability to do business.\nWe sell our products throughout the world. Products shipped to Asia accounted for 75% of our net revenue in the year\nended December 31, 2023. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, approximately 78% of our employees are located outside of\nthe United States. The majority of our products are manufactured, assembled and tested in Asia, and our major distributors are\nlocated in Asia. Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include:\n• changes in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions;\n• geopolitical conflicts and tensions, especially as between the United States and China, that could destabilize trading\nrelationships and economic activity;\n25\n• restrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments\nand trade protection measures, including export controls and restrictions, duties and quotas and customs duties and\ntariffs;\n• disruptions of capital and trading markets;\n• changes in import and/or export control restrictions and regulations by governments, such as changes to licensing\nrequirements or other anti-diversion enforcement measures, as a result of ongoing armed conflict and geopolitical\ntensions among the United States, China, Russia, Ukraine and other countries;\n• transportation delays;\n• civil disturbances or political instability;\n• other unpredictable geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups, including the current\nconflict in Israel (and any broadening of the conflict);\n• differing employment practices and labor standards;\n• limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;\n• local business and cultural factors that differ from our customary standards and practices;\n• nationalization and expropriation;\n• changes in tax laws;\n• public health emergencies, such as another outbreak of COVID-19 or other communicable disease;\n• currency fluctuations relating to our international operating activities; and\n• difficulty in obtaining distribution and support.\nIn addition to a significant portion of our wafer supply coming from Taiwan, Singapore, China and South Korea,\nsubstantially all of our products undergo packaging and final testing in Taiwan, Singapore, China, South Korea, Malaysia, and\nThailand. Any conflict or uncertainty in these countries, including due to geopolitical conditions, natural disasters, public health\nor safety concerns, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In\naddition, if the government of any country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards for products\nmanufactured in or imported into their country that are not widely shared, it may lead some of our customers to suspend imports\nof their products into that country, require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical\nstandards and disrupt cross-border manufacturing relationships which, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in trade policies among the United States and other countries, in particular the imposition of new or higher\ntariffs, could place pressure on our average selling prices as our customers seek to offset the impact of increased tariffs on their\nown products. Increased tariffs or the imposition of other barriers to international trade could decrease demand and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.\nThe United States has imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on certain products exported by a number of U.S.\ntrading partners, including China, Europe, Canada, and Mexico. In response, many of those trading partners, including China,\nhave imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on American products. We have experienced weakening demand in China, and\ncontinuing changes in government trade policies create a heightened risk of further increased tariffs that impose barriers to\ninternational trade and could further decrease international demand. Our business and operating results are substantially\ndependent on international trade. Many of our manufacturers sell products incorporating our integrated circuits into\ninternational markets.\nTariffs on our customers’ products may adversely affect our gross profit margins in the future due to the potential for\nincreased pressure on our selling prices by customers seeking to offset the impact of tariffs on their own products. In addition,\ntariffs could make our OEM and ODM customers’ products less attractive relative to products offered by their competitors,\nwhich may not be subject to similar tariffs. Some OEM and ODMs in our industry have already implemented short-term price\nadjustments to offset such tariffs and transitioned their production and supply chain to locations outside of China. We believe\n26\nthat increases in tariffs on imported goods or the failure to resolve current international trade disputes could further decrease\ndemand and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nFurthermore, compliance with export controls and implementation of additional tariffs may increase compliance costs\nand further affect our business and operating results.\nWe will lose sales if we are unable to obtain or retain government authorization to export certain of our products or\ntechnology related to the development or production of our products or if such authorizations are revoked, and we will be\nsubject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations.\nCertain of our products and technologies are subject to export and/or import controls imposed by countries in which we\ndo business, including the United States Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, administered by the U.S. Department of\nCommerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS. Certain of our products and technologies are subject to the EAR, which\nmay require a license authorization from BIS prior to the shipment or sharing of certain products and technologies with certain\nend users or destinations. Such approval may be delayed, denied, or even revoked after initially being granted by BIS,\ndepending on one or more factors including the type of product or technology at issue, the intended end use, the identity of the\nend user, the identity of other companies involved in the production process, and whether a license exception might apply,\namong others. We are subject to similar export controls regulations in other jurisdictions where we operate, including the\nEuropean Union, Singapore, and Taiwan, among others.\nExport control laws, regulations, and orders are complex, change frequently and with limited or no notice, have generally\nbecome more stringent over time and have intensified as U.S.-China geopolitical tensions worsen. Since October 2022, the\nUnited States has announced export control restrictions on a number of entities based in China due to national security and\nhuman rights concerns and additional more severe restrictions may be possible. The addition of new entities to restricted party\nlists can further increase the scope of export restrictions applicable to our business. The United States has also announced\nmeasures intended to further restrict the export of certain advanced semiconductor products and technology, as well as products\nthat incorporate those advanced semiconductor products, to the People’s Republic of China, or China, and/or certain companies\nlocated in China due to national security and human rights concerns, including the imposition of new license requirements for\ncertain semiconductor technologies. Failure to obtain required export licenses for our products or the placement of one or more\nof our customers on any restricted parties lists could significantly reduce our revenue and harm our business.\nObtaining export licenses can be difficult, costly and time-consuming and we may not always be successful in obtaining\nnecessary export licenses. Our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products may adversely affect our\nbusiness, and other limitations imposed on our ability to export or sell our products may also harm our international and\ndomestic revenue. In addition, it is possible that BIS can revoke licenses that have been granted or decline to re-issue such\nlicenses upon their expiration. Although our policies, procedures, and controls are designed to detect and prevent potential\nviolations and maintain ongoing compliance with applicable export controls laws, we cannot assure you that we have been or\nwill be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. For example, our products could be diverted to bad\nactors. In addition, if our customers or business partners fail to comply with applicable regulations and laws, we may be subject\nto liability and may be required to suspend sales or take other action which could damage our reputation and negatively impact\nour results of operations. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines,\nimport/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. The absence of comparable\nrestrictions imposed on competitors based in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position.\nTo the extent that we do business with parties on the Entity List under approved export licenses, our business could be\naffected if the government delays, denies, or otherwise does not grant or renew required licenses. We currently have licenses\nfrom BIS that permit certain of our transactions with two restricted parties, but those licenses may be revoked at any time or\ndenied for renewal when the license expires. One of our third party foundry partners, Semiconductor Manufacturing\nInternational Corporation, or SMIC, was added to the BIS Entity list in December 2020. As a result of that Entity List listing,\nwe must obtain export licenses from BIS for the export or reexport to SMIC of any technology for the development or\nproduction (fabrication) of our products. Although we have obtained export licenses in order to have SMIC manufacture certain\nproducts for us, those export licenses could be revoked at any time. Revocation of any of those export licenses could\nsignificantly disrupt our ability to obtain the products in question and fulfill customer requirements. Moreover, the issuance of\nexport licenses for other technology transfers to SMIC is a matter of discretion with the U.S. government, and it is uncertain\nwhether we will be able to obtain export licenses, in a timely manner, for the transfer of technology required by SMIC to\nproduce semiconductor wafers for us. If we are unable to obtain those export licenses, it may be necessary to have the products\nfabricated by other semiconductor foundries, which may be more costly alternatives to SMIC, and which may have limited\ncapacity to fabricate sufficient products to meet our requirements.\n27\nAdditionally, current and future business with parties subject to significant export restrictions, including those named on\nthe Entity List may be limited in scope or suspended entirely in order to comply with the EAR or other applicable laws or\nregulations and, as a result, our revenue could be adversely impacted until a license is granted or renewed. It is possible that the\nU.S. government may not grant licenses or renew licenses to transact business with entities on the Entity List.\nIn September 2022, we self-identified a potential violation of the EAR related to certain transactions with one of our\nfoundry partners in China on the Entity List in which limited technology was furnished to our Specific Foundry Partner without\nauthorization under the EAR. Upon discovery, we took immediate action to remediate, including by implementing additional\nmeasures to prevent recurrence. Our Audit Committee engaged outside counsel to conduct a privileged investigation. On March\n3, 2023, we submitted a comprehensive voluntary self-disclosure to BIS regarding the potential EAR violation described above\nand other potential export control violations. On June 8, 2023, BIS closed out its review of our voluntary self-disclosure without\nmonetary or other penalties and with the issuance of a “warning letter.”\nWe also are subject to risks associated with international geopolitical and military conflicts.\nOur business has been impacted and may continue to be impacted by geopolitical conditions such as international trade\nwars (including between the United States and China), the military conflict in Israel, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and increased\npolitical tensions in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Currently, significant uncertainty surrounds the future trade\nrelationships among the United States, China, and Russia. The U.S. government continues to make significant changes in U.S.\ntrade policies that could negatively affect our business. Additionally, policies made by other countries, such as China and\nRussia or their allies, could also negatively impact our business. In a number of cases, compliance with these policies has\nrequired us to take actions adverse to our business.\nBeginning in May 2019, we ceased normal business operations with entities affiliated with Huawei Technologies Co.,\nLtd., and certain other entities following an amendment to the EAR which added these entities to the Entity List for acting\ncontrary to the national security or foreign policy of the United States. We obtained export licenses for certain transactions with\nthese entities. As noted above, export licenses can be revoked or BIS could choose not to renew such licenses, which would halt\nthe currently-approved licensed activities.\nIn September 2020, we further restricted business operations with additional entities affiliated with Huawei when the BIS\nagain amended the EAR to add such entities to the Entity List.\nSince October 2022, the United States government has taken steps to restrict the export of certain advanced\nsemiconductor products and technology to the People’s Republic of China and/or certain companies located in China due to\nnational security and human rights concerns. In October 2022, BIS announced additional restrictions on products and/or\ntechnology destined for use in the People’s Republic of China, including additional export controls and/or requirements on (1)\ncertain advanced computing integrated circuits, computer commodities that contain such integrated circuits and certain\nsemiconductor manufacturing items; (2) products and/or technologies that may be destined for facilities capable of producing\ncertain advanced node integrated circuits; and (3) transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor\nmanufacturing end uses. In October 2023, BIS announced additional restrictions on the export of certain advanced\nsemiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing technology to China, primarily focused on integrated circuits with military,\ndata center, or artificial intelligence applications. Pursuant to those October 2023 export control amendments, various\ncategories of integrated circuits are now subject to export licensing and export control restrictions for export or reexport to\nChina and certain other countries. We have confirmed that some of our products are subject to these new controls. BIS also\nannounced restrictions on exports to (1) companies headquartered in China or Macau, and (2) end users in certain countries of\nconcern, in order to prevent diversion of controlled products or technology to China. The United States government has also\ncontinued to add Chinese entities to the Entity List. We regularly monitor changes to applicable export control regulations to\nassess the impact to our business, if any. To date, none of our material customers located in China has been added to the Entity\nList or other restricted party list.\nThe BIS continues to add many new entities to the Entity List and Unverified List. As noted above, our ability to sell or\ndistribute products or technology will be limited if BIS further amends the EAR to add restrictions against parties who are or\nmay be our customers.\nWe are required to obtain special licenses to conduct business with entities on the Entity List and to conduct additional\ndiligence and recordkeeping, including obtaining user statements from entities on the Unverified List. Failure to obtain any\nrequired license would likely result in a loss of business and a corresponding negative impact on our financial position and\nresults of operations.\n28\nWe cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to trade relations between the United States and\nChina or other countries, which products may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by other countries in\nretaliation. In response to the United States tightening export controls on China, China has instituted restrictions of its own that\naffect U.S. companies and may impact us and related entities. We have experienced weakening demand in China, and such\nfuture developments related to U.S.-China relations may also have an impact on our supply chain. Additionally, the geopolitical\ndevelopments in relations between Taiwan and China could affect the supply of our products from Taiwan, including from\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited, or TSMC.\nWe believe direct impacts of the economic sanctions against Russia and the military conflict in Ukraine are currently\nlimited to volatility in the prices of metals used by our outsourced semiconductor assembly and test, or OSAT, supply chain, in\nparticular around the supply of palladium, for which Russia is the top producer in the world, as well as increased fuel costs,\nwhich has global impact on transportation costs, including the shipping and delivery of our products. However, the magnitude\nof such price volatility on our business and its duration is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We\ncurrently do not sell product in Russia, or sell product to distributors for resale in Russia.\nThe ongoing military conflict in Israel has resulted in our employees located in Israel having to perform military service\nand/or being negatively impacted by violence or political instability, which could interrupt business and increase costs\nassociated with relocating employees, engaging with alternative third-party contractors or hiring additional employees outside\nof Israel. As the conflict continues, we cannot provide assurances that our business will not be impacted in the future.\nWe cannot provide assurances that we will not face disruptions of distribution arrangements in the future, including\nthrough the imposition of governmental prohibitions on selling our products to particular customers, further sanctions on Russia\nor other countries, and/or increases in costs of certain raw materials and transportation that will also adversely affect our\nrevenues and operating results. Loss of a key distributor or customer under similar circumstances could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, revenues and operating results.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or a significant\nreduction in orders from, one or more of our major customers has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on\nour revenue and operating results.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, one customer accounted for 10% of our net revenue, and our ten largest customers\ncollectively accounted for 54% of our net revenue, of which distributor customers accounted for 16% of our net revenue. In the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, we have experienced a decrease in customer demand, and consequently a reduction in orders,\nprimarily due to macroeconomic factors and excess inventory in the channel following the industry-wide supply shortage in\n2021 and 2022. We expect that our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue to show a substantial percentage of\nsales dependent on a relatively small number of customers. In the future, these customers may decide, as they have at times\nbefore, not to purchase our products at all, may purchase fewer products than they did in the past, or may defer or cancel\npurchases or otherwise alter their purchasing patterns. Factors that could affect our revenue from these large customers include\nthe following:\n• macroeconomic and business factors influencing such customers’ demand for our products, including excess\ninventory in the channel;\n• substantially all of our sales to date have been made on a purchase order basis, and we do not have long-term\nproduct purchase commitments with our customers;\n• some of our customers have sought or are seeking relationships with current or potential competitors which may\naffect their purchasing decisions;\n• service provider and OEM consolidation across cable, satellite, and fiber markets could result in significant changes\nto our customers’ technology development and deployment priorities and roadmaps, which could affect our ability to\nforecast demand accurately and could lead to increased volatility in our business; and\n• technological changes in our markets could lead to substantial volatility in our revenues based on product\ntransitions, and particularly in our broadband markets, we face risks based on changes in the way consumers are\naccessing and using broadband and cable services, which could affect operator demand for our products.\nIn addition, delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic customers and negatively impact\nsales of the products under development. Moreover, it is possible that our customers may develop their own products or adopt a\n29\ncompetitor’s solution for products that they currently buy from us. When this occurs, our sales have previously and could in the\nfuture decline and/or our market share has previously and may in the future be reduced or smaller than anticipated and our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur relationship with customers has been and could continue to be impaired by our sale of patents. For example, our\ncustomers are and could be subject to patent infringement based on patents we divested to the extent that our customers also\nsource components from our competitors, such as those referenced in Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) of this report.\nOur relationships with some customers may deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from\nbuying our products. To attract new customers or retain existing customers, we sometimes offer customers favorable prices on\nour products which results in a decline in our average selling prices and, if material, a decline in our gross margins. The loss of\na key customer, a reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could seriously\nimpact our revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues are from sales of product to distributors, who then resell our product. Our\nagreements with certain of these distributors provide protection against price reduction on their inventories of our products. The\nloss of certain distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and price reductions\nassociated with their inventories of our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the event of a\ndramatic decline in selling prices for these products.\nIn addition, the current situation relating to trade with China and governmental and regulatory concerns relating to\nspecific Chinese companies continue to remain fluid and unpredictable. Products shipped to mainland China accounted for 11%\nof our net revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 16% during the year ended December 31, 2022. Our\ncurrent and future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by limitations on our ability to sell to one or\nmore Chinese customers, as described in the section “Risks Related to Our Business” under the risk factor “We are also subject\nto risks associated with international geopolitical conflicts involving the U.S. and other governments such as China and\nRussia”, and by tariffs and other trade barriers that may be implemented by governmental authorities.\nAny legal proceedings or claims against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could harm our reputation\nregardless of the outcome.\nIn addition to the legal proceedings referenced in Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings of this report, we are subject to legal\nproceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property, product liability,\nemployment, class action, customer claims, whistleblower and other litigation claims, and governmental and other regulatory\ninvestigations and proceedings and we may not be successful in such proceedings. In addition, we have implemented a\nreduction in force and the attendant layoffs has resulted and could result in the risk of claims being made by or on behalf of\naffected employees. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources, cause us to incur\nsignificant expenses or liability, or require us to change our business practices. In addition, the expense of litigation and the\ntiming of this expense from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change, and could adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations. Because of the potential risks, expenses, and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time\nto time, settle disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. Any of the\nforegoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been and may in the future be subject to information technology failures, including security breaches, cyber-\nattacks, design defects or system failures, that could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and adversely affect our\nbusiness, operations, and financial results.\nWe rely on our information technology systems for the effective operation of our business and for the secure\nmaintenance and storage of confidential data relating to our business and third-party businesses. In June 2020, we announced a\nsecurity incident resulting from a Maze ransomware attack affecting certain but not all operational systems within our\ninformation technology infrastructure. Because we did not satisfy the attacker’s monetary demands, on June 15, 2020, the\nattacker released online certain proprietary information obtained from our network. Since that time, our internal information\ntechnology team, supplemented by a leading cyber defense firm, took steps aimed at containing and assessing this incident,\nincluding implementing enhanced security controls aimed at protecting our information technology systems. Since that event,\nsecurity breaches and incidents, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have continued to become more prevalent and\nsophisticated. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against or implement\nadequate preventive measures. We experience cyber-attacks of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and systems\nand notwithstanding our defensive measures, experienced programmers, hackers, state actors, or others may be able to penetrate\nour security controls through attacks such as phishing, impersonating authorized users, ransomware, viruses, worms and other\nmalicious software programs, software supply chain attacks, exploitation of design flaws, bugs and other security weaknesses\n30\nand vulnerabilities, covert introduction of malware to computers and networks, including those using techniques that change\nfrequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event or that may continue\nundetected for an extended period of time. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create heightened risk of cyber-attacks and\nattackers have used artificial intelligence and machine learning to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks\nagainst targets. Businesses we acquire may increase the scope and complexity of our information technology systems, and this\nmay increase our risk exposure to cyber-attack when there are difficulties integrating diverse legacy systems that support\noperations for the acquired businesses. Our information technology infrastructure also includes products and services provided\nby third parties, and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products, or provide inadequate updates or\nsupport, which can impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information.\nA cybersecurity incident or other compromise of our information technology systems could result in unauthorized\npublication of confidential business or proprietary information belonging to us, a customer, supplier, employee or other third\nparty, including personal data, result in violations of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation, cause us to incur\ndirect losses if attackers initiate wire transfers or access our bank or investment accounts, or damage our reputation. More\ngenerally, any theft, loss, misuse, or other unauthorized processing of any confidential business or proprietary information,\nincluding personal data, collected, used, stored, transferred, or otherwise processed by us or on our behalf could result in\nsignificantly increased costs, expenses, damage to our reputation, and claims, litigation, demands, and regulatory investigations\nor other proceedings. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures either as a\nresponse to specific breaches or incidents or as a result of evolving risks could be significant. In addition, our inability to use or\naccess our information systems at critical points in time could adversely affect the timely and efficient operation of our\nbusiness. Any delayed sales, significant costs or lost customers resulting from these technology failures could adversely affect\nour business, operations and financial results. We also may face difficulties or delays in identifying and remediating and\notherwise responding to any security breach or incident.\nFrom time-to-time, we upgrade software that we use in our business, including our enterprise resource planning, or ERP,\nsystem. Our business may be disrupted if our software does not work as planned or if we experience issues relating to any\nimplementation, or accessing our software as has happened in a previous cybersecurity attack, in which case we may be unable\nto timely or accurately prepare financial reports, make payments to our suppliers and employees, or ship to, invoice and collect\nfrom our customers.\nWe may be subject to supply chain attacks where threat actors attempt to inject malicious code into our products thus\ninfecting our products and the systems of our customers. Any such supply chain attack could have magnified damages to our\nbusiness as a direct result of the attack as well as due to a loss of credibility or reputation with our customers. Such attempts are\nincreasing in number and in technical sophistication, and if successful, expose us and the affected parties to risk of loss or\nmisuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations, including our manufacturing\noperations.\nThird parties with which we conduct business, such as foundries, assembly and test contractors, and distributors, have\naccess to certain portions of our sensitive data, and we rely on third parties to store and otherwise process data for us. We are\ndependent on the information security systems of these third parties and they face substantial security risks similar to those\noutlined above. Any security breaches or incidents or other unauthorized access by third parties to the systems of our suppliers,\nservice providers, or other third parties with access to our sensitive data, or the existence of computer viruses, ransomware or\nother malicious code in their data, software, or hardware, could result in disruptions or failures of systems used in our business,\npayments to fraudulent bank accounts, and expose us to a risk of loss, misappropriation, unavailability and other unauthorized\nprocessing of information. Any of the foregoing, or the perception any of them has occurred, could have a material adverse\nimpact on our business, operations and financial results.\nAdditionally, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate or otherwise protect us with respect to\nclaims, expenses, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, litigation, regulatory actions, or other impacts arising from any of the\nsecurity breaches or incidents outlined above, or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nAny of these results could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results, potentially in a material manner.\nAverage selling prices of our products have and could decrease in the future, which could have a material adverse effect\non our revenue and gross margins.\nWe have and may in the future experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our operating results due to erosion\nof our average selling prices. From time to time, we have reduced the average unit price of our products due to competitive\npricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors, and for other reasons, and we expect that we will have to\n31\ndo so again in the future. In particular, we believe that industry consolidation has provided a number of larger semiconductor\ncompanies with substantial market power, which has had a material adverse impact on selling prices in some of our markets. If\nwe are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or introducing new products\nwith higher margins, our revenue and gross margins will suffer. To support our gross margins, we must develop and introduce\nnew products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our and our customers’ costs. Our inability to\ndo so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline. In addition, under certain of our agreements with key distributors,\nwe provide protection for reductions in selling prices of the distributors’ inventory, which could have a material adverse effect\non our operating results if the selling prices for those products fell dramatically.\nIf we fail to penetrate new applications and markets, our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and financial condition\ncould be materially and adversely affected.\nWe sell a significant portion of our products to manufacturers of cable broadband voice and data modems and gateways,\nsatellite outdoor units or LNB’s, optical modules for long-haul and metro telecommunications markets, and RF transceivers and\nmodem solutions for wireless infrastructure markets. Our product offerings also include broadband data access, power\nmanagement and interface technologies which are ubiquitous functions in new and existing markets such as wireless and\nwireline communications infrastructure, broadband access, industrial, enterprise network, and automotive applications. We have\nfurther expanded our product offerings to include Wi-Fi, ethernet and broadband gateway processor SoCs and intellectual\nproperty that utilizes patented machine learning techniques to improve signal integrity and power efficiency in SoCs, ASICs,\nand field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, used in next-generation communication and artificial intelligence systems. Our\nfuture revenue growth, if any, will depend in part on our ability to further penetrate into, and expand beyond, these markets\nwith analog, digital and mixed-signal solutions targeting the markets for Wi-Fi and broadband, high-speed optical interconnects\nfor data center, metro, and long-haul optical modules, telecommunications wireless infrastructure, and cable DOCSIS 3.1\nnetwork infrastructure products. Each of these markets presents distinct and substantial risks. If any of these markets do not\ndevelop as we currently anticipate, or if we are unable to penetrate them successfully, it could materially and adversely affect\nour revenue and revenue growth rate, if any.\nBroadband data modems and gateways and video gateways continue to represent a significant North American and\nEuropean revenue generator. The North American and European Pay-TV market is dominated by a few OEMs, including\nVantiva SA, Commscope Holding Company, Inc., Hitron Technologies Inc., Compal Broadband Networks, Inc., Humax Co.,\nLtd., and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. These OEMs are large multinational corporations with negotiating power relative to us\nand are undergoing significant consolidation. Securing design wins with any of these companies requires a substantial\ninvestment of our time and resources. Even if we succeed, additional testing and operational certifications will be required by\nthe OEMs’ customers, which include large Pay-TV television companies such as Comcast Corporation, Liberty Global plc,\nCharter Communications, Inc., Sky UK Limited, AT&T Inc. and EchoStar Corporation. In addition, our products will need to\nbe compatible with other components in our customers’ designs, including components produced by our competitors or\npotential competitors. There can be no assurance that these other companies will support or continue to support our products.\nIf we fail to penetrate these or other new markets upon which we target our resources, our revenue and revenue growth\nrate, if any, likely will decrease over time and our financial condition could suffer.\nA significant portion of our revenue is attributable to demand for our products in markets for broadband solutions, and\ndevelopment delays and consolidation trends among cable and satellite Pay-TV and broadband operators could adversely\naffect our future revenues and operating results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, revenue directly attributable to broadband applications accounted for\napproximately 29% and 44% of our net revenue, respectively. We have experienced a decrease in broadband net revenue of\n$289.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, and the decline in\nrevenue could continue in future periods. Delays in the development of, or unexpected developments in, the broadband markets,\nincluding international macroeconomic headwinds, could have an adverse effect on order activity by OEMs in these markets\nand, as a result, on our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition. In addition, consolidation trends among\nPay-TV and broadband operators may continue, which could delay or lead to cancellations of major spending programs and\nhave a material adverse effect on our future operating results and financial condition.\n32\nWe may be unable to make the substantial and productive research and development investments that are required to\nremain competitive in our business.\nThe semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to\nmarket new and enhanced technologies and products. Many of our products originated with our research and development\nefforts, which we believe have provided us with a significant competitive advantage. For year ended December 31, 2023, 2022,\nand 2021, our research and development expense was $269.5 million, $296.4 million, and $278.4 million, respectively. While\nwe are closely monitoring our current research and development expenses, we expect our research and development expenses to\nincrease in future years when we return to expanding our product portfolio and enhancing existing products. We monitor such\nexpenditures as part of our strategy of devoting focused research and development efforts on the development of innovative and\nsustainable product platforms. We are committed to investing in new product development internally in order to stay\ncompetitive in our markets and plan to maintain research and development and design capabilities for new solutions in\nadvanced semiconductor process nodes such as 16nm and 5nm and beyond, as well as to address challenges of capturing and\nprocessing high quality broadband communications and high-speed optical interconnect signals. However, we do not know\nwhether we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development required to remain\ncompetitive as semiconductor process nodes continue to shrink and become increasingly complex. In addition, we cannot assure\nyou that the technologies that are the focus of our research and development expenditures will become commercially\nsuccessful. Furthermore, we currently receive grants from certain non-U.S. governments, but those grants and any future grants\nmay not be available to us in the future.\nThe complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses caused by undetected defects or bugs,\nwhich could reduce the market acceptance of our new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers\nand adversely affect our operating costs.\nHighly complex products like our Wi-Fi and broadband RF receivers and RF receiver SoCs, physical medium devices\nfor optical modules, RF transceiver and modem solutions for wireless infrastructure markets, and high-performance analog\nsolutions may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released. Where any of our\nproducts, including legacy acquired products, contain defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we\nmay not be able to successfully correct these problems. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be\nreluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract\nnew customers, and our financial results. In addition, these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers. If\nany of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product, we may be\nrequired to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs, and our operating costs could be\nadversely affected. These problems may also result in warranty or product liability claims against us by our customers or others\nthat may require us to make significant expenditures to defend these claims or pay damage awards. In the event of a warranty\nclaim, we may also incur costs if we compensate the affected customer. We maintain product liability insurance, but this\ninsurance is limited in amount and subject to significant deductibles. There is no guarantee that our insurance will be available\nor adequate to protect against all claims. We also may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of one of our customers’\nproducts containing one of our devices. The process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely\ndistributed may be lengthy and require significant resources, and we may incur significant replacement costs, contract damage\nclaims from our customers and reputational harm. Costs or payments made in connection with warranty and product liability\nclaims and product recalls could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations, and ability to obtain future\ncoverage. Although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses, any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating\nresults. Although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance, if a\ncatastrophic product liability claim were to occur, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims.\nFurther, our business liability insurance may be inadequate, may not cover the claims, and future coverage may be unavailable\non acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and have fluctuated in the past and\nmay fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors that could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. For example, our\nrevenue declined from $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $693.3 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023 and revenue could continue to decline. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and on an annual basis and are due to\na number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n• seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets;\n33\n• overall demand volatility for semiconductor solutions across a diverse range of communications, industrial and\nmultimarket applications;\n• changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers;\n• the receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers;\n• fluctuations in the levels of component inventories held by our customers;\n• the gain or loss of significant customers;\n• market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products;\n• our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and technologies on a timely basis;\n• the availability and cost of products from our suppliers;\n• the timing and extent of operating expenses, including costs related to product development and personnel\ncompensation and benefits;\n• new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;\n• incurrence of research and development and related new product expenditures;\n• government actions, by the United States, China or other countries, that impose barriers or restrictions that would\nimpact our ability to sell or ship products to customers;\n• currency fluctuations;\n• fluctuations in manufacturing yields of integrated circuits;\n• significant warranty claims, including those not covered by our suppliers;\n• changes in our product mix or customer mix;\n• potential indemnification claims, including those arising as a result of our contractual arrangements or intellectual\nproperty disputes;\n• intellectual property disputes;\n• timing and extent of product development costs;\n• loss of key personnel or inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified skilled workers;\n• impairment of long-lived assets, including masks and production equipment; and\n• the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products.\nFor example, we often experience flat-to declining revenue in the first quarter of each fiscal year and increasing\nrevenue in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Our historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical\nfactors that might have influenced our business to date. If our growth rate continues to slow, seasonal or cyclical variations in\nour operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects. These factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely\naffect our quarterly or annual operating results. We typically are required to incur substantial development costs in advance of a\nprospective sale with no certainty that we will ever recover these costs. A substantial amount of time may pass between a\ndesign win and the generation of revenue related to the expenses previously incurred, which can potentially cause our operating\nresults to fluctuate significantly from period to period. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively\n34\nfixed in nature due to our significant sales, research and development costs. Any failure to adjust spending or our operations\nquickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify its adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain\ncustomers could be impaired and our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and\ntechnological obsolescence. To compete successfully, we must design, develop, market and sell new or enhanced products that\nprovide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability and meet the cost expectations of our customers. The\nintroduction of new products by our competitors, the market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies,\nor the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future products obsolete. Our failure to anticipate or\ntimely develop new or enhanced products or technologies in response to technological shifts has resulted, and could in the\nfuture, result in decreased revenue and our competitors winning more competitive bid processes, known as “design wins.” In\nparticular, we may experience difficulties with product design, manufacturing, marketing or certification that could delay or\nprevent our development, introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products. If we fail or are slow to introduce new or\nenhanced products that meet the needs of our customers or penetrate new markets in a timely fashion, as has happened\npreviously or in the future, we will lose market share and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nIn particular, we believe that we will need to develop new products in part to respond to changing dynamics and trends in\nour end user markets, including (among other trends) consolidation among cable and satellite operators, potential industry shifts\naway from the hardware devices and other technologies that incorporate certain of our products, advances in artificial\nintelligence, and changes in consumer television viewing habits and how consumers access and receive broadcast content and\ndigital broadband services. We cannot predict how these trends will continue to develop or how or to what extent they may\naffect our future revenues and operating results. We believe that we will need to continue to make substantial investments in\nresearch and development in an attempt to ensure a product roadmap that anticipates these types of changes; however, we\ncannot provide any assurances that we will accurately predict the direction in which our markets will evolve or that we will be\nable to develop, market, or sell new products that respond to such changes successfully or in a timely manner, if at all.\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties, and differences between our estimates of customer demand and\nproduct mix and our actual results could continue to negatively affect our inventory levels, sales and operating results.\nOur revenue is generated on the basis of shipments of products under purchase orders with our customers rather than\nlong-term purchase commitments. In addition, our customers can and have requested to cancel purchase orders or defer the\nshipments of our products under certain circumstances. Our products are manufactured using a silicon foundry according to our\nestimates of customer demand, which requires us to make separate demand forecast assumptions for every customer, each of\nwhich may introduce significant variability into our aggregate estimate. We have limited visibility into future customer demand\nand the product mix that our customers will require, which has in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our\nrevenue forecasts and operating margins. Also, as customer lead times continue to improve, we have seen and expect to\ncontinue to see a more normalized demand-planning horizon. While we expect inventory to remain elevated in the near term,\nwe expect that channel inventory will continue to decline thereafter. Moreover, because our target markets are relatively new,\nmany of our customers have difficulty accurately forecasting their product requirements and estimating the timing of their new\nproduct introductions, which ultimately affects their demand for our products. Historically, because of this limited visibility,\nactual results have been different from our forecasts of customer demand. Some of these differences have been material which\nhas led to and could continue to lead to excess inventory or product shortages and revenue and margin forecasts above those we\nwere actually able to achieve. These differences may occur in the future, and the adverse impact of these differences between\nforecasts and actual results could grow if we are not successful in expanding the customer base for our products. In addition, the\nrapid pace of innovation in our industry could render significant portions of our inventory obsolete. Excess or obsolete\ninventory levels could result in unexpected expenses or increases in our reserves that could adversely affect our business,\noperating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we were to underestimate customer demand or if sufficient\nmanufacturing capacity were unavailable, we could forego revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our\ncustomer relationships. In addition, any significant future cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously\nsold products due to manufacturing defects could materially and adversely impact our profit margins, increase our write-offs\ndue to product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.\n35\nWe may have difficulty accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses particularly\nas we seek to enter new markets where we may not have prior experience.\nOur operating history had historically focused on developing integrated circuits for specific applications and more\nrecently, the wired whole-home broadband connectivity market and markets for wireless telecommunications infrastructure and\npower management and interface technologies which are ubiquitous functions in wireless and wireline communications\ninfrastructure, broadband access, industrial, enterprise network, and automotive applications. As part of our growth strategy, we\nseek to expand our addressable market into new product categories. For example, we expanded into the markets for Wi-Fi,\nEthernet and Broadband Gateway Processor SoCs and intellectual property that utilizes patented machine learning techniques to\nimprove signal integrity and power efficiency in SoCs, ASICs, and FPGAs used in next-generation communication and\nartificial intelligence systems. Our limited operating experience in new markets or potential markets we may enter, combined\nwith the rapidly evolving nature of our markets in general, substantial uncertainty concerning how these markets may develop\nand other factors beyond our control reduces our ability to accurately forecast quarterly or annual revenue. If our revenue does\nnot increase as anticipated, we could incur significant losses due to our higher expense levels if we are not able to decrease our\nexpenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall in future revenue.\nOur customers require our products and our third-party contractors to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification\nprocess which does not assure product sales.\nPrior to purchasing our products, our customers require that both our products and our third-party contractors undergo\nextensive qualification processes, which involve testing of the products in the customer’s system and rigorous reliability testing.\nThis qualification process may continue for six months or more. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not\nassure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a\nsubsequent revision to our solutions, or changes in our customer’s manufacturing process or our selection of a new supplier\nmay require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our\nproducts are qualified, it can take six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or\ndevices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design,\nengineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we\nare unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, sales of this product to the customer may be\nprecluded or delayed, which may result in a decrease in our revenue and cause our business to suffer.\nWinning business is subject to lengthy competitive selection processes that require us to incur significant expenditures.\nEven if we begin a product design, customers may decide to cancel or change their product plans, which could cause us to\ngenerate no revenue from a product and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are focused on securing design wins to develop RF receivers and RF receiver SoCs, MoCA and G.hn SoCs, DBS-\nODU SoCs, physical medium devices for optical modules, interface and power management devices, and SoC solutions\ntargeting infrastructure opportunities within the telecommunications, wireless, industrial and multimarket and Wi-Fi and\nbroadband operator markets for use in our customers’ products. These selection processes typically are lengthy and can require\nus to incur significant design and development expenditures and dedicate scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single\ncustomer opportunity. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring\nsignificant design and development expenditures. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that some of our customers’ products\nlikely will have short life cycles. Although this has not occurred to date, failure to obtain a design win could prevent us from\noffering an entire generation of a product. This could cause us to lose revenue and require us to write off obsolete inventory,\nand could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes. After securing a design win, we may experience\ndelays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development cycle typically required. Our customers\ngenerally take a considerable amount of time to evaluate our products. The typical time from early engagement by our sales\nforce to actual product introduction runs from nine to twelve months for the broadband and communications market, and 36\nmonths or longer for industrial, wired and wireless infrastructure markets. The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles\nincrease the risk that a customer will decide to cancel, curtail, reduce or delay its product plans, causing us to lose anticipated\nsales. In addition, any delay or cancellation of a customer’s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as\nwe may have incurred significant expense and generated no revenue. Finally, our customers’ failure to successfully market and\nsell their products could reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition\nand results of operations. If we were unable to generate revenue after incurring substantial expenses to develop any of our\nproducts, our business would suffer.\n36\nOur business is subject to various international and U.S. laws and governmental regulations, and compliance with these\nlaws and regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses. A failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, and we could be subject to civil or\ncriminal penalties.\nOur business is subject to various laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions where we do business,\nincluding but not limited to laws, regulations and other legal requirements related to packaging; product content; labor and\nemployment; import and customs; export controls; anti-corruption; personal and data privacy; cybersecurity; human rights;\nconflict minerals; environment, health and safety; competition and antitrust; and intellectual property ownership and\ninfringement. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and with little or no notice, occasionally are\nconflicting or ambiguous, and have generally become more stringent over time. Complying with these laws and regulations can\nbe costly and we may be required to incur significant costs to remedy any potential gaps or violations that are identified. In\naddition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional\nregulations in marketing our products. Although our policies, procedures, and controls are designed to detect and prevent\npotential violations and maintain ongoing compliance with applicable laws, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be\nat all times in compliance with such laws and regulations. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of\nconsequences could result, including fines, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other\nsanctions. The costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of any investigations, remediation, auditing and\nmonitoring) could adversely affect our current or future business.\nAs indicated elsewhere in this report, we do a substantial portion of our business in Asia and particularly in China. Since\nOctober 2022, the United States has taken steps to restrict the export of certain advanced semiconductor products and\ntechnology to the People’s Republic of China as well as a number of specific Chinese companies, due to national security and\nhuman rights concerns. There has also been a substantial focus by regulators in the United States and Europe on the business\npractices of certain major Chinese technology companies. Complying with changing export control laws may require us to\ndevelop additional policies, procedures, and controls, or incur additional costs, including in connection with the development or\nperformance of additional due diligence in order to prevent diversion of restricted products or technology to China, Russia, or\nother destinations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also result in the loss of revenue. Since October 2022, we\nhave restricted shipments and exports to certain major Chinese technology companies, including a semiconductor foundry and\nOSAT providers. While we intend to continue to conduct our businesses in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws\nrelating to export controls and anti-corruption, it is possible that the nature of our business and customers could result in a\nreview of our relationships and practices by regulatory authorities. At times, we may discover issues that we bring to the\nattention of the relevant government agencies, as we did on March 3, 2023, when we submitted a comprehensive voluntary self-\ndisclosure to BIS regarding the potential EAR violation described above and other potential export control violations. Although\nthe March 2023 voluntary self-disclosure to BIS resulted in a warning letter, we could incur increased administrative and legal\ncosts in order to remediate any potential compliance gaps or violations, to respond to any inquiries, or in connection with the\npreparation and submission of any voluntary self-disclosures to the government agencies, as appropriate. Any failure to comply\nwith applicable laws could adversely affect our business and operating results. We have implemented policies and procedures,\nincluding adoption of an anti-corruption policy and procedures with respect to applicable export control laws, but there can be\nno assurance that our policies and procedures will prove effective.\nOur products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards\nOrganization, as well as regulation by other agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. If we fail to\nadequately address any of these rules or regulations, our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, climate change and new or revised rules and regulations related thereto, including regulations with respect to\ngreenhouse gas emissions and regulations enacted by the SEC and recent legislation enacted in California, which may impact\nour business in numerous ways. Climate change and its effects could lead to further increases in raw material prices or their\nreduced availability due to, for example, increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events and any supply chain\ndisruptions resulting therefrom, and could cause increased incidence of disruption to the production and distribution of our\nproducts and an adverse impact on consumer demand and spending. In recent months, there have been substantial legislative\nand regulatory developments on climate-related issues, including proposed, issued and implemented legislation and\nrulemakings that would require companies to assess and/or disclose climate metrics, risks, opportunities, policies and practices.\nFor example, in 2022, the SEC proposed climate-related disclosure requirements that would require increased climate change-\nrelated disclosure in our periodic reports and other filings with the SEC. The potential impact to us of these legislative and\nregulatory developments is uncertain at this time, although we expect that the emerging legal and regulatory requirements on\nclimate-related issues will result in additional compliance and may require us to spend significant resources and divert\n37\nmanagement attention. We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully adapt our operations in response to any climate-\nrelated changes or comply with any increased reporting obligations in a cost-effective manner, and our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe must also conform the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors to various laws and adapt to regulatory\nrequirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or\ndistribution of our products, we could be required to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be\nprohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain qualified personnel and senior management, our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects could suffer.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified personnel, including our management,\nsales and marketing and finance teams, and especially our design and technical staff. In March and October 2023, we initiated\nreductions of our workforce to align our operational needs with the changes in macroeconomic conditions and the demand\nenvironment. These workforce reductions may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our intended reduction\nin workforce and reduced employee morale, which may cause our employees who were not affected by the reduction in\nworkforce to seek alternate employment. Employees whose positions were eliminated or those who determine to seek alternate\nemployment may seek employment with our competitors. In addition, our reduction in workforce may adversely impact our\nability to implement our business strategy and respond rapidly to any new product, growth or revenue opportunities.\nAdditionally, reductions in workforce may make it more difficult to recruit and retain new employees. If we need to increase\nthe size of our workforce in the future, we may encounter a competitive hiring market due to labor shortages, increased\nemployee turnover, changes in the availability of workers and increased wage costs. Employee litigation related to the reduction\nof our workforce could be costly and time-consuming.\nWe do not know whether we will be able to attract and retain the required and desirable personnel as we continue to\npursue our business strategy. Historically, we have encountered difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified engineers because\nthere is a limited pool of engineers with the expertise required in our field. Competition for these personnel is intense in the\nsemiconductor industry. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our design and technical personnel\nrepresent a significant asset. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the high-technology industry, job\ncandidates often consider the value of the stock-based compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment.\nWe have experienced fluctuations, including declines, in the market price of our stock and reductions in force which could\nadversely affect our ability to attract, motivate or retain key employees. In addition, our future performance also depends on the\ncontinued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and\npursue new opportunities and product innovations. Our employment arrangements with our employees do not generally require\nthat they continue to work for us for any specified period, and therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any\ntime. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees, especially our management and key design and technical\npersonnel, or our inability to retain, attract and motivate qualified design and technical and other personnel, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success also depends on the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel.\nNone of our senior management team or other key personnel is bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a\nspecified period. In addition, we have not entered into non-compete agreements with members of our senior management team\nor other key personnel, except in limited circumstances (e.g., in connection with the acquisition of other companies). We are\nfortunate that many members of our senior management team have long tenures with us, but from time to time we also have\nbeen required to recruit new members of senior management. With respect to recruitment and retention of senior management,\nwe need to ensure that our compensation programs provide sufficient recruitment and retention incentives as well as incentives\nto achieve our long-term strategic business and financial objectives. We expect competition for individuals with our required\nskill sets, particularly technical and engineering skills, to remain intense even in weak global macroeconomic environments.\nThe loss of any member of our senior management team or other key personnel could harm our ability to implement our\nbusiness strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.\n38\nAs of December 31, 2023, our aggregate indebtedness was $125.0 million, and we are subject to a variable amount of\ninterest on the principal balance of our credit agreements and could continue to be adversely impacted by rising interest rates\nin the future. Such indebtedness adversely affects our operating results and cash-flows as we satisfy our underlying interest and\nprincipal payment obligations and contains financial and operational covenants that could adversely affect our operational\nfreedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders,\nincluding obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions. In addition, rising interest rates may make it more\ndifficult for us, our customers, and our distributors to obtain financing and service our respective interest and debt obligations,\nwhich in turn has an impact on customer demand for our products and our distributors’ business.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our aggregate indebtedness was $125.0 million from an initial secured term B loan facility, or\nthe Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement. The June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement also provides for a\nrevolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million, or the Revolving Facility, which remains undrawn as of December 31, 2023.\nThe credit agreement also permits us to request incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the sum of an\namount equal to the greater of (x) $175.0 million and (y) 100% of “Consolidated EBITDA” (as defined in such agreement),\nplus the amount of certain voluntary prepayments, plus an unlimited amount that is subject to pro forma compliance with\ncertain first lien net leverage ratio, secured net leverage ratio and total net leverage ratio tests. The June 23, 2021 Credit\nAgreement was amended on June 29, 2023 to implement a benchmark replacement.\nThe Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement has a seven-year term expiring in June 2028 and bears\ninterest at either an Adjusted Term SOFR plus a fixed applicable margin of 2.25% or an Adjusted Base Rate plus a fixed\napplicable margin of 1.25%, at our option. Commencing on September 30, 2021, the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021\nCredit Agreement amortizes in equal quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount, with the balance\npayable on June 23, 2028. We are subject to commitment fees ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% on the undrawn portion of the\nRevolving Facility, and any outstanding loans under the Revolving Facility will bear interest at either an Adjusted Term SOFR\nplus a margin of 1.00% to 1.75% or an Adjusted Base Rate plus a margin of 0% to 0.75%. Our obligations under the June 23,\n2021 Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set\nforth in the credit agreement. Such obligations, including the guaranties, are secured by substantially all of our assets and those\nof the subsidiary guarantors.\nOur material indebtedness adversely affects our operating expenses through increased interest payment obligations and\nadversely affects our ability to use cash generated from operations as we repay interest at a variable rate, which has been\nincreasing, and principal under the term loans. In addition, the Revolving Facility provisions under the June 23, 2021 Credit\nAgreement include financial covenants such as an initial maximum secured net leverage ratio of 3.5 to 1, which temporarily\nincreases to 3.75 to 1 following the consummation of certain material permitted acquisitions, and operational covenants that\nmay adversely affect our ability to engage in certain activities, including obtaining additional financing, granting liens,\nundergoing certain fundamental changes, or making investments or certain restricted payments, and selling assets, and similar\ntransactions, without obtaining the consent of the lenders, which may or may not be forthcoming. The Initial Term Loan under\nthe June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement is only subject to operational covenants. Lastly, our borrowing costs can be affected by\nperiodic credit ratings from independent rating agencies. Such ratings are largely based on our performance, which may be\nmeasured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. Accordingly, outstanding indebtedness could\nadversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the\nbest interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions.\nSpecifically, our indebtedness and rising interest rates have important consequences to investors in our common stock,\nincluding the following:\n• rising interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers, and our distributors to obtain financing and\nservice our respective interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on customer demand for our\nproducts as well as the business of our distributors;\n• we are subject to variable interest rate risk because our interest rate under the Initial Term Loan under the June 23,\n2021 Credit Agreement varies based on a fixed margin of 2.25% per annum over an adjusted Term SOFR rate or\n1.25% per annum over an adjusted base rate and our interest rate for any outstanding principal under the revolving\ncredit facility varies based a margin of 0% to 0.75% over adjusted base rate or a margin of 1.00% to 1.75% over an\nadjusted Term SOFR rate, and we are also subject to commitment fees ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% on the\nundrawn portion of the Revolving Facility. If interest rates were to continue to increase substantially, it would\nadversely affect our operating results and could affect our ability to service our indebtedness;\n39\n• a portion of our cash flows is dedicated to the payment of interest and when applicable, principal, on our\nindebtedness and other obligations and will not be available for use in our business;\n• our level of indebtedness, combined with rising interest rates, could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting\nto, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate, including limiting our future investments or ability\nto enter into acquisitions and strategic partnerships, and obtain financing for such transactions; and\n• our high degree of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and/or a\ndownturn in our business, thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations.\nIf we fail to make required debt payments, or if we fail to comply with financial or other covenants in our debt service\nagreements, which include a maximum leverage ratio, we would be in default under the terms of these agreements. Subject to\ncustomary cure rights, any default would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate repayment of this debt and could\ncause defaults under other indebtedness that we have, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of\nour common stock.\nWe and our subsidiaries may, subject to any limitations in the terms of our existing loan facilities, incur additional debt,\nsecure existing or future debt, recapitalize our debt or take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of our\nterm loans that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments under the indebtedness when due. If we incur\nany additional debt, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify. Please refer to the Risk Factor entitled “If\nwe are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement\nwith Silicon Motion, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any\nsettlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such damages or payments\ncould be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash resources, which may not\nbe sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,\nand financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional\ncapital for any such payments. Even if we are able to finance such payments through the incurrence of additional indebtedness,\nany material increase in our indebtedness would adversely affect our operating results and cash-flows as we satisfy our\nunderlying interest and principal payment obligations. Issuing additional shares of our common stock, if material, will result in\ndilution of existing shares outstanding. Any loan agreement is also expected to contain financial and operational covenants that\nwould adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to\nbe in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions”.\nWe are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, and\ncybersecurity.\nThe legislative, enforcement policy and regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and cybersecurity issues\nworldwide is rapidly evolving and complex and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We collect and\notherwise process data, including personal data and other regulated or sensitive data, as part of our business processes and\nactivities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including oversight by various\nregulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including China, the European\nUnion and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use\nof personal data, and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are\ncurrently more restrictive than those in the U.S. These laws may require that our overall information technology security\nenvironment meet certain standards and/or be certified. For example, effective May 2018, the European Union adopted the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that imposed stringent data protection requirements and provided for greater\npenalties for noncompliance. The United Kingdom has adopted legislation that substantially implements the GDPR and\nprovides for a similar penalty structure. Similarly, California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or\nCCPA, which took effect in 2020. The CCPA gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt out of certain sharing\nof their information, and imposes penalties for failure to comply. California has adopted a new law, the California Privacy\nRights Act of 2020, or CPRA, that substantially expands the CCPA and was effective as of January 1, 2023. Additionally, other\nU.S. states continue to propose privacy-focused legislation, and such legislation has been passed in over ten states to date. In\n2021, the National People’s Congress passed the Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China, or the Data Security\nLaw. The Data Security Law is the first comprehensive data security legislation in the People’s Republic of China, or China,\nand aims to regulate a wide range of issues in relation to the collection, storage, processing, use, provision, transaction and\npublication of any kind of data. There is significant uncertainty in how regulators will interpret and enforce the law, but it\ncontains provisions that allow substantial government oversight and include fines for failure to obtain required approval from\nChina’s cyber and data protection regulators for cross-border personal data-related data transfers.\n40\nThe laws outlined above are only a sample of the governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to\nprivacy, data protection, and cybersecurity to which we are subject. Various aspects of these laws, including their interpretation\nand enforcement, remain unclear, resulting in further uncertainty and potentially requiring us to modify our data practices and\npolicies and to incur substantial additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Because the interpretation and application\nof many such laws and regulations, remain uncertain and continue to evolve, it is possible that these laws and regulations may\nbe interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products or\nsolutions, and we could face fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and other claims and penalties, and we could be required\nto fundamentally change our products or our business practices, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, or to comply with\napplicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, even if unfounded,\ncould result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted by end users in our markets.\nGenerally, our products comprise only a part or parts of a communications device. All components of these devices must\nuniformly comply with industry standards in order to operate efficiently together. We depend on companies that provide other\ncomponents of the devices to support prevailing industry standards. Many of these companies are significantly larger and more\ninfluential in driving industry standards than we are. Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented\nuniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our customers or end users. If larger companies do\nnot support the same industry standards that we do, or if competing standards emerge, market acceptance of our products could\nbe adversely affected, which would harm our business.\nProducts for communications applications are based on industry standards that are continually evolving. Our ability to\ncompete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards. The\nemergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by other suppliers. As a\nresult, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to\nensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a\nsignificant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins. We may not be successful in developing\nor using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance. Our pursuit\nof necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense.\nWe may, from time to time, make additional business acquisitions or investments, which involve significant risks.\nWe have completed multiple acquisitions in the past eight years. We may also enter into alliances or make investments in\nother businesses to complement our existing product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological\ncapabilities. Any such transactions has resulted and could result in:\n• issuances of equity securities dilutive to our existing stockholders;\n• substantial cash payments;\n• the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities;\n• large one-time write-offs;\n• amortization expenses related to intangible assets;\n• a limitation on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards;\n• the diversion of management’s time and attention from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges;\n• stockholder or other litigation relating to the transaction;\n• adverse tax consequences;\n• costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities; and\n• the potential loss of, or ability to attract, key personnel, customers and suppliers of the acquired businesses.\n41\nTo the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash or through borrowings under our\nRevolving Facility, it would reduce our cash balances and/or result in indebtedness we must service, which may have a material\nadverse effect on our business and financial condition. If the purchase price is paid with our stock, it would be dilutive to our\nstockholders. In addition, we may assume liabilities associated with a business acquisition or investment, including unrecorded\nliabilities that are not discovered at the time of the transaction, and the repayment of those liabilities may have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition.\nIntegrating acquired organizations and their products and services, including the integration of completed acquisitions,\nmay be expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationships with employees, customers, distributors\nand suppliers, and ultimately may not be successful. The benefits or synergies we may expect from the acquisition of\ncomplementary or supplementary businesses may not be realized to the extent or in the time frame we initially anticipate. Some\nof the risks that may affect our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses include those associated with:\n• failure to successfully further develop the acquired products or technology;\n• conforming the acquired company’s standards, policies, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n• coordinating new product and process development, especially with respect to highly complex technologies;\n• loss of key employees or customers of the acquired business;\n• hiring additional management and other key personnel;\n• in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to\naddress the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n• increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n• consolidation of facilities, integration of the acquired businesses’ accounting, human resource and other\nadministrative functions and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions;\n• the geographic distance between the businesses;\n• liability for activities of the acquired businesses before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement\nclaims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n• litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired businesses, including claims for terminated employees,\ncustomers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates, or even if we do identify suitable\ncandidates, they may be difficult to finance, expensive to fund and there is no guarantee that we can obtain any necessary\nantitrust approvals or complete such transactions on terms that are favorable to us.\nWe have in the past been and may in the future be party to ligation related to acquisitions. Any adverse determination in\nlitigation resulting from acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\nWe have settled in the past intellectual property litigation and may in the future face additional claims of intellectual\nproperty infringement. Any current or future litigation could be time-consuming, costly to defend or settle and result in the loss\nof significant rights.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by companies that hold large numbers of patents and other intellectual\nproperty rights and that vigorously pursue, protect and enforce intellectual property rights. Third parties have in the past and\nmay in the future assert against us and our customers and distributors their patent and other intellectual property rights to\ntechnologies that are important to our business. For example, we were recently involved in a litigation with Bell\nSemiconductor, which has since been settled pursuant to a Settlement and Patent License Agreement. In addition, from time to\ntime, we receive correspondence from competitors and other third parties seeking to engage us in discussions concerning\npotential claims against us, and we receive correspondence from customers seeking indemnification for potential claims related\nto infringement claims asserted against down-stream users of our products. We investigate these requests and claims as received\n42\nand could be required to enter license agreements with respect to third party intellectual property rights or indemnify third\nparties, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.\nClaims that our products, processes or technology infringe third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their\nmerit or resolution are costly to defend or settle and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical\npersonnel. In addition, many of our customer and distributor agreements require us to indemnify and defend our customers or\ndistributors from third-party infringement claims and pay damages and attorneys’ fees in the case of adverse rulings. Claims of\nthis sort also could harm our relationships with our customers or distributors and might deter future customers from doing\nbusiness with us. In order to maintain our relationships with existing customers and secure business from new customers, we\nhave been required from time to time to provide additional assurances beyond our standard terms. If any of our current or future\nproceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:\n• cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology;\n• pay substantial damages, indemnification expenses and attorneys’ fees;\n• expend significant resources to develop non-infringing products, processes or technology;\n• license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms, or at all;\n• cross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to\ncompete with that competitor; or\n• pay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue their use of or to replace infringing technology\nsold to them with non-infringing technology.\nAny of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe utilize a significant amount of intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual\nproperty, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a\ncombination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets in the United States and\nin selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Effective patent, copyright, trademark\nand trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in some countries. Some of our products and\ntechnologies are not covered by any patent or patent application. We cannot guarantee that:\n• any of our present or future patents or patent claims will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or\nabandoned;\n• our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us;\n• our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes\nwill not be limited by our agreements with third parties;\n• any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought;\n• our intellectual property rights will be enforced in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal\nprotection may be weak;\n• any of the trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our\nbusiness will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned; or\n• we will not lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against or to license our technology to others and\ncollect royalties or other payments.\nIn addition, our competitors or others may design around our protected patents or technologies. Effective intellectual\nproperty protection may be unavailable or more limited in one or more relevant jurisdictions relative to those protections\navailable in the United States, or may not be applied for in one or more relevant jurisdictions. If we pursue litigation to assert\n43\nour intellectual property rights, an adverse decision in any of these legal actions could limit our ability to assert our intellectual\nproperty rights, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Unauthorized use of our intellectual\nproperty may have occurred or may occur in the future. Although we have taken steps to minimize the risk of this occurring,\nany such failure to identify unauthorized use and otherwise adequately protect our intellectual property would adversely affect\nour business. Moreover, if we are required to commence litigation, whether as a plaintiff or defendant as has occurred in the\npast, not only will this be time-consuming, but we will also be forced to incur significant costs and divert our attention and\nefforts of our employees, which could, in turn, result in lower revenue and higher expenses.\nWe also rely on customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees and\nconsultants, and we implement security measures to protect our trade secrets. We cannot assure you that these contractual\nprotections and security measures will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our\nsuppliers, employees or consultants will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of such contracts. For example, as\ndescribed in Part I, Item 3 — Legal Proceedings – Comcast Litigation, Comcast shared our proprietary designs with our direct\ncompetitor. Comcast then worked with our competitor to develop the FDX-amplifier technology. We have brought claims for\ntrade secret misappropriation, unfair competition, and breach of the parties’ non-disclosure agreement, and sought an\nunspecified amount of compensatory damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, costs, expenses,\nand attorney fees as well as an injunction against Comcast’s use or disclosure of our trade secrets. However, our claims may not\nbe successful.\nIn addition, we have a number of third-party patent and intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license\nagreements require us to make one-time payments or ongoing royalty payments. Also, a few of our license agreements contain\nmost-favored nation clauses or other price restriction clauses which may affect the amount we may charge for our products,\nprocesses or technology. We cannot guarantee that the third-party patents and technology we license will not be licensed to our\ncompetitors or others in the semiconductor industry. In the future, we may need to obtain additional licenses, renew existing\nlicense agreements or otherwise replace existing technology. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be\nobtained or renewed or the technology can be replaced on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWhen we originally settled a trademark dispute with Analog Devices International Unlimited Company (ADIUC) and its\npredecessor, Linear Technology Corporation, we agreed not to register the “MAXLINEAR” mark or any other marks\ncontaining the term “LINEAR”. Pursuant to the original settlement agreement, we agreed not to use the “MAXLINEAR” mark\non our products. We have since entered into another settlement agreement with ADIUC that now allows us to use and register\nthe “MAXLINEAR” mark on our products, in addition to continuing to use “MAXLINEAR” as a corporate identifier, including\nto advertise our products and services. We have filed trademark applications to register the “MAXLINEAR” mark, but prior to\napproval of the applications and registration of the mark in the relevant jurisdictions, our ability to effectively prevent third\nparties from using the “MAXLINEAR” mark in connection with similar products or technology will be based on our common\nlaw rights in the mark, which may make enforcement challenging. If we are unable to protect our trademarks in certain\njurisdictions, we may experience difficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition and customer loyalty in such\njurisdictions.\nWe face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.\nWe regularly are subject to security vulnerabilities with respect to our products as well as intellectual property that we\npurchase or license from third parties for use in our products. Our products are used in application areas that create new or\nincreased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the\ncloud or Internet of Things, and critical infrastructure, payment card applications, and automotive applications. Security\nfeatures in our products cannot make our products entirely secure, and security vulnerabilities identified in our products have\nresulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, attempts by third parties to identify and exploit additional vulnerabilities.\nVulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not\nalways promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if\nany, to which a vulnerability has been exploited.\nMitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other\npreventative measures, are not always available on a timely basis, or at all, and at times do not operate as intended or effectively\nresolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware,\nsoftware, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the\navailability, effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these\n44\nthird parties in determining whether, when, and how to develop and deploy mitigations. We and such third parties make\nprioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of\na mitigation and harm our reputation. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the\nimpact of a security vulnerability, which can cause certain claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as result in\nlitigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.\nSecurity vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system\ninstability or unavailability, loss of functionality, non-compliance with standards, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system\nbehavior, decisions by customers, regulators and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or\nproduct features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties. Security vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse\neffects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships,\nprospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material.\nThe use of open source software in our products, processes and technology may expose us to additional risks and harm\nour intellectual property.\nOur products, processes and technology sometimes utilize and incorporate software that is subject to an open source\nlicense. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses\nrequire a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user’s software to disclose publicly part\nor all of the source code to the user’s software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such\nsoftware to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost. This can\nsubject previously proprietary software to open source license terms.\nWhile we monitor the use of all open source software in our products, processes and technology and try to ensure that no\nopen source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product, processes or\ntechnology when we do not wish to do so, such use could inadvertently occur. Additionally, if a third party software provider\nhas incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our products,\nprocesses or technology, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our products,\nprocesses or technology. This could harm our intellectual property position and have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Reliance on Third-Parties\nWe do not have our own manufacturing facilities and rely on a limited number of third parties to manufacture, assemble,\nand test our products. The failure to manage our relationships with our third-party contractors successfully, or impacts from\nvolatility in global supply, natural disasters, public health crises, or other labor stoppages in the regions where such\ncontractors operate, could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products.\nWe operate an outsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes third-party foundry and assembly and test\ncapabilities. As a result, we rely on third-party foundry wafer fabrication, including sole sourcing for many components or\nproducts. Currently, a large portion of our products are manufactured by Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, or ASE,\nTSMC, and United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, at foundries located in Taiwan, Singapore, and China. We also rely\non Intel Corporation, or Intel, for certain products on a turnkey basis under a supply agreement with an initial term of five\nyears. We also use third-party contractors for all of our assembly and test operations.\nRelying on third party manufacturing, assembly and testing presents significant risks to us, including the following:\n• capacity shortages during periods of high demand or from events beyond our control or inventory oversupply during\nperiods of decreased demand. For example, we have experienced and could continue to experience inventory\noversupply in certain of our products due to changes in customer demand which has added to volatility in managing\nthe business. Inventory oversupply has also led and could continue to lead to inventory write-downs, including\ncharges for any excess or obsolete inventory, which could negatively impact our gross margins;\n• failure by us, our customers, or their end customers to qualify a selected supplier;\n• reduced control over delivery schedules and quality;\n• shortages of materials;\n• misappropriation of our intellectual property;\n45\n• limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us;\n• potential increases in prices; and\n• our use of foundry partners who are currently subject to BIS restrictions, to manufacture certain of our products may\nbe impaired if one or more of the following were to occur: (1) we are unable to obtain U.S. export licenses\nauthorizing its interactions and technology exchanges with these foundry partners, or (2) if BIS increases export\ncontrol restrictions to Chinese foundries without the ability for us to obtain a U.S. export license, or (3) U.S.\nproviders of semiconductor manufacturer equipment are unable to export such equipment or related spare or\nreplacement parts used in the manufacture of our products, or obtain a license to export such equipment and parts, to\ncurrent or future Chinese foundry partners.\nThe ability and willingness of our third-party contractors to perform is largely outside our control. If one or more of our\ncontract manufacturers or other outsourcers fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels,\nour ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, in the event that manufacturing capacity is\nreduced or eliminated at one or more facilities, manufacturing could be disrupted, we could have difficulties fulfilling our\ncustomer orders and our net revenue could decline. In addition, if these third parties fail to deliver quality products and\ncomponents on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders, our net revenue could\ndecline and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our product shipment and manufacturing capacity may be similarly reduced or eliminated at one or more\nfacilities due to the fact that the majority of our fabrication and assembly and test contractors are all located in the Pacific Rim\nregion, principally in China, Taiwan, and Singapore. The risk of earthquakes in these geographies is significant due to the\nproximity of major earthquake fault lines, and Taiwan in particular is also subject to typhoons and other Pacific storms, and\nmore recently, a drought impacting the water supply which chip manufacturers rely upon to fabricate chip products.\nEarthquakes, fire, flooding, drought, or other natural disasters in Taiwan or the Pacific Rim region, or political unrest, war,\nlabor strikes, work stoppages or public health crises, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, in countries where our contractors’\nfacilities are located could result in the disruption of our product shipments, foundry, assembly, or test capacity. If such\ndisruption were to recur over a prolonged period, it could have a material impact on our revenues and our business. Any\ndisruption resulting from similar events on a larger scale or over a prolonged period could cause significant delays in shipments\nof our products until we are able to resume such shipments, or shift our manufacturing, assembly, or test from the affected\ncontractor to another third-party vendor, if needed. If such disruption were to recur over a prolonged period, it could have a\nmaterial impact on our revenue and business. There can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable\nterms, if at all.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our distributors’ product inventories and product sell-through. Should any of our\ndistributors cease or be forced to stop distributing our products, our business would suffer.\nWe currently sell a large portion of our products to customers through our distributors, who maintain their own\ninventories of our products. Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 50%, 46% and 47% of our net revenue in the year\nended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Upon shipment of product to these distributors, title to the inventory\ntransfers to the distributor and the distributor is invoiced, generally with 30 to 60 day terms. Distributor sales are also\nrecognized upon shipment to the distributor and estimates of future pricing credits and/or stock rotation rights reduce revenue\nrecognized to the net amount before the actual amounts are known. If our estimates of such credits and rights are materially\nunderstated it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period.\nIf our distributors are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventories of our products in a given quarter to\nmanufacturers and end users or if they decide to decrease their inventories of our products for any reason, our sales through\nthese distributors and our revenue may decline. In addition, if some distributors decide to purchase more of our products than\nare required to satisfy end customer demand in any particular quarter, inventories at these distributors would grow in that\nquarter. These distributors could then reduce future orders until inventory levels realign with end customer demand, which has\nin the past and could in the future adversely affect our product revenue.\nOur reserve estimates with respect to the products stocked by our distributors are based principally on reports provided to\nus by our distributors, typically on a weekly basis. To the extent that this resale and channel inventory data is inaccurate or not\nreceived in a timely manner, we may not be able to make reserve estimates accurately or at all.\nWe do not have any long-term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers or suppliers, and any disruption in our\nsupply of products or materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and operating results.\n46\nWhile certain products are supplied to us by Intel on a turnkey basis under the terms of a supply agreement with an initial\nterm of five years, currently we do not have long-term supply contracts with any other third-party vendors, including but, not\nlimited to ASE, TSMC, and UMC. We make substantially all of our purchases on a purchase order basis, and our contract\nmanufacturers are not required to supply us products for any specific period or in any specific quantity. Foundry capacity may\nnot be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. Availability of foundry capacity has in the past been reduced from\ntime to time due to strong demand. Foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies’ products and reduce\ndeliveries to us on short notice. It is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are, or that have\nlong-term agreements with our foundry, may induce our foundry to reallocate capacity to them. This reallocation could impair\nour ability to secure the supply of components that we need. We generally place orders for products with some of our suppliers\napproximately four to five months prior to the anticipated delivery date, with order volumes based on our forecasts of demand\nfrom our customers. Accordingly, if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may be unable to obtain adequate\nand cost-effective foundry or assembly capacity from our third-party contractors to meet our customers’ delivery requirements,\nwhich could harm our reputation and customer relationships, or we may accumulate excess inventories. On occasion, we have\nbeen unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer purchase orders and therefore were unable to benefit\nfrom this incremental demand. None of our third-party contractors has provided any assurance to us that adequate capacity will\nbe available to us within the time required to meet additional demand for our products.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services and technology necessary for the operation of our business. Any failure of\none or more of our partners, vendors, suppliers or licensors to provide these services or technology could have a material\nadverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide critical services, including, among other things, services related to accounting,\nbilling, compliance, internal audit, human resources, information technology, network development, network monitoring, in-\nlicensing and intellectual property that we cannot or do not create or provide ourselves. We depend on these vendors to ensure\nthat our corporate infrastructure will consistently meet our business requirements and legal obligations. The ability of these\nthird-party vendors to successfully provide reliable and high quality services is subject to technical and operational uncertainties\nthat are beyond our control. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us,\nour agreements with these vendors limit the amount of damages we may receive. In addition, we do not know whether we will\nbe able to collect on any award of damages or that these damages would be sufficient to cover the actual costs we would incur\nas a result of any vendor’s failure to perform under its agreement with us. Any failure of our corporate infrastructure could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Upon expiration or termination of any of\nour agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on\nterms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us and a transition from one vendor to another\nvendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.\nAdditionally, we incorporate third-party technology into and with some of our products, and we may do so in future\nproducts. The operation of our products could be impaired if errors occur in the third-party technology we use. It may be more\ndifficult for us to correct any errors in a timely manner if at all because the development and maintenance of the technology is\nnot within our control. There can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to make their technology, or\nimprovements to the technology, available to us, or that they will continue to support and maintain their technology. Further,\ndue to the limited number of vendors of some types of technology, it may be difficult to obtain new licenses or replace existing\ntechnology. Any impairment of the technology or our relationship with these third parties could have a material adverse effect\non our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur management team may use our available cash and cash equivalents in ways with which you may not agree or in\nways which may not yield a return.\nWe use our cash and cash equivalents for general corporate purposes, including working capital and for repayment of\noutstanding long-term debt. We may also, in the future, use a portion of our assets to acquire other complementary businesses,\nproducts, services or technologies. Our management has considerable discretion in the application of our cash and cash\nequivalents, and resources, and you will not have the opportunity to assess whether these liquid assets are being used in a\nmanner that you deem best to maximize your return. We may use our available cash and cash equivalents and resources for\ncorporate purposes that do not increase our operating results or market value. In addition, in the future our cash and cash\nequivalents, and resources may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value.\n47\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more\ndifficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our\ncommon stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated, may have the effect of delaying or\npreventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions provide for the following:\n• authorize our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 25,000,000 shares of\nundesignated preferred stock;\n• require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not\nby written consent;\n• specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, our Chairman of the\nBoard of Directors, or our President;\n• establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our\nstockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors;\n• establish that our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class\nserving staggered terms;\n• provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n• provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even\nthough less than a quorum;\n• specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n• require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter\ndocuments.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current\nmanagement by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible\nfor appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the\nprovisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally restricts a Delaware corporation from\nengaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years\nfollowing the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder.\nOur share price may be volatile as a result of various factors.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various\nfactors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2023, the trading price of our\ncommon stock ranged from a low of $13.43 to a high of $43.66. These factors include those discussed in this “Risk Factors”\nsection of this report and others such as:\n• any developments related to our terminated merger with Silicon Motion;\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n• overall conditions in the semiconductor market;\n• addition or loss of significant customers;\n• changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products, including export controls;\n• geopolitical changes impacting our business, including with respect to China and Taiwan;\n• actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n• announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n48\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital\ncommitments;\n• departures of, and inability to attract, qualified key personnel;\n• competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n• issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n• fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n• disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to\nobtain intellectual property protection for our technologies;\n• actions by institutional or activist stockholders;\n• acquisitions may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share;\n• announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n• sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders; and\n• general economic and market conditions, including the impacts from sanctions against Russia and the military\nconflict in Ukraine and Israel, increased inflationary pressures, interest rate changes, and the global COVID-19\npandemic.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market\nprices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating\nperformance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and\nmarket conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the\nmarket price of our common stock.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock are attractive to momentum,\nhedge, day-trading, or activist investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in\neither direction, and have also been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of momentum, hedge, day-\ntrading, or activist investors, and have been and may continue to be the target of securities class action litigation in the future.\nStockholder activism or securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention\nfrom other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. A proxy contest or other activist behaviors could have\nan adverse effect on us.\nEven if a proxy contest or other activist efforts are not successful, the increased costs that we would bear and the\ndistraction of our Board of Directors and senior management could negatively impact our business, although we cannot predict\nwith certainty the extent of such negative impacts.\nWe have adopted a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock; however, any future decisions\nto reduce or discontinue purchasing our common stock, after we resume such purchasing, pursuant to our stock repurchase\nprograms could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nOur share repurchase program has been temporarily suspended since July 2022 due to our previously pending (now\nterminated) merger with Silicon Motion. Although our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program, any\ndetermination to resume our stock repurchase program and execute our stock repurchase program will be subject to, among\nother things, our financial position and results of operations, available cash and cash flow, capital requirements, and other\nfactors, as well as our Board of Director’s continuing determination that the repurchase program are in the best interests of our\nstockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase program. Our stock repurchase\nprogram does not obligate us to acquire any common stock. If we fail to meet any expectations related to stock repurchases, the\nmarket price of our common stock could decline, and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence.\nAdditionally, price volatility of our common stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our\ncommon stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time.\n49\nWe may further increase or decrease the amount of repurchases of our common stock in the future. Any reduction or\ndiscontinuance by us of repurchases of our common stock, after we resume such repurchases, pursuant to our current stock\nrepurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Moreover, in the event repurchases of our\ncommon stock are reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume repurchasing common stock at historical levels\ncould result in a lower market valuation of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about\nour business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts\npublish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us\ndowngrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these\nanalysts cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which\ncould cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales\nmight occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale\nof additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 81.8 million shares of common stock\noutstanding.\nAll shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act\nunless held by our “affiliates,” as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nOur Executive Incentive Bonus Plan permits the settlement of awards under the plan in the form of shares of our\ncommon stock. We have issued shares of our common stock to settle such bonus awards for our employees, including\nexecutives, for the 2014 to 2022 performance periods, and we intend to continue this practice in the foreseeable future. We\nissued 0.9 million shares of our common stock for the 2022 performance period in February 2023. If we issue additional shares\nof our common stock to settle bonus awards in the future, such shares may be freely sold in the public market immediately\nfollowing the issuance of such shares, subject to the applicable conditions of Rule 144 and our insider trading policy, and the\nissuance of such shares may have a material adverse effect on our share price once they are issued.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in\nthe foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and\nfor general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of\nDirectors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as\nthe only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we suffer losses to our facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\nOur facilities and distribution system, and those of our third-party contractors, are subject to risk of catastrophic loss due\nto fire, flood, drought or other natural or man-made disasters. A number of our facilities and those of our contract\nmanufacturers are located in areas with above average seismic activity. The risk of an earthquake in the Pacific Rim region or\nSouthern California is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines, and Taiwan in particular is also subject\nto typhoons and other Pacific storms, and more recently, a drought impacting the water supply which chip manufacturers rely\nupon to fabricate chip products. Any catastrophic loss to any of these facilities would likely disrupt our operations, delay\nproduction, shipments and revenue and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility. The majority of the\nfactories we use for foundry, assembly and test, and warehousing services, are located in Asia, principally in China, Taiwan,\nSouth Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Our corporate headquarters is located in Southern California. Our operations\nand financial condition could be seriously harmed in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flooding, drought, or other natural\ndisasters in Taiwan or the Pacific Rim region, or political unrest, war, labor strikes, work stoppages or public health crises, such\nas the outbreak of COVID-19, or other natural or man-made disaster in countries where our contractors’ facilities are located.\nSuch catastrophes could result in the disruption of our product shipments, foundry, assembly, or test capacity.\n50\nWe have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with business acquisitions. Goodwill and other\nacquired intangible assets could become impaired and adversely affect our future operating results.\nWe account for business acquisitions as business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total\npurchase price is allocated to net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses based on their fair\nvalues as of the date of completion of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as\ngoodwill. Our acquisitions have resulted in the creation of goodwill and recording of a large amount of intangible assets based\nupon the application of the acquisition method of accounting. To the extent the value of goodwill or other intangible assets\nbecome impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment. We conduct our annual goodwill\nand indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis on October 31 each year, or more frequently if we believe indicators of\nimpairment exist. Our reported financial condition and results of operations reflect the balances and results of the acquired\nbusinesses but are not restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of acquired\nbusinesses for periods prior to the acquisitions. As a result, comparisons of future results against prior period results will be\nmore difficult for investors. In addition, there can be no guarantee that acquired intangible assets, particularly in-process\nresearch and development, will generate revenues or profits that we include in our forecast that is the basis for their fair values\nas of the acquisition date. Any such impairment charges relating to goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material\nimpact on our operating results in future periods, and the announcement of a material impairment could have a material adverse\neffect on the trading price and trading volume of our common stock. As of December 31, 2023, our balance sheet reflected\ngoodwill of $318.6 million and other intangible assets of $73.6 million. Consequently, we could recognize material impairment\ncharges in the future.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or unanticipated tax obligations could affect our future results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, Singapore and various other foreign jurisdictions. The amount of\nincome taxes we pay is subject to our interpretation and application of tax laws in jurisdictions in which we file. Changes in\ncurrent or future laws or regulations, the imposition of new or changed tax laws or regulations or new interpretations by taxing\nauthorities or courts could affect our results of operations and lead to volatility with respect to tax expenses and liabilities from\nperiod to period. For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, eliminated the option to deduct\nresearch and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen\nyears pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 174. This has increased our effective tax rate and our cash tax payable since\n2022. If the requirement to capitalize Section 174 expenditures is not modified, it may also impact our effective tax rate and our\ncash tax liability in future years. The application of tax laws and related regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation,\njudgment and uncertainty. We cannot determine whether any legislative proposals may be enacted into law or what, if any,\nchanges may be made to such proposals prior to their being enacted into law. If U.S. or international tax laws change in a\nmanner that increases our tax obligation, it could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and our\nfinancial position. In addition, many countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax\nrules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s, or OECD, Base Erosion and Profit Shifting\nrecommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to\ncross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD is also continuing\ndiscussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business,\nas well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” proposals). Some countries\nhave implemented or intend to implement laws based on Pillar Two proposals, which may adversely impact our provision for\nincome taxes, existing tax incentives, net income and cash flows. As a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax\nauthorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and\nlegislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes\nmay also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.\nOur income tax provision is subject to volatility and our ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable\nincome may be limited since we are subject to tax examinations, which may adversely impact our future effective tax rate and\noperating results.\nExcess tax benefits associated with employee stock-based compensation are included in income tax expense. However,\nsince the amount of such excess tax benefits and deficiencies depend on the fair market value of our common stock, our income\ntax provision is subject to volatility in our stock price and in the future, could unfavorably affect our future effective tax rate.\nOur future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax\nassets and liabilities, and the ultimate use and depletion of these various tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards.\nChanges in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We record a valuation\n51\nallowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In making\nsuch determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence quarterly, including scheduled reversals of\ndeferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. To the extent\nwe believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation\nallowance against the deferred tax asset. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable\nincome in the applicable jurisdiction. On a periodic basis we evaluate our deferred tax assets for realizability. Based upon our\nreview of all positive and negative evidence, as of December 31, 2023, we continue to have a valuation allowance on state\ndeferred tax assets, certain federal deferred tax assets, and certain foreign deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where we have\ncumulative losses or otherwise are not expected to utilize certain tax attributes. The impact of releasing some or all of such\nvaluation allowance in a future period could be material in the period in which such release occurs. Additionally, the amount of\nthe deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted in the subsequent periods if estimates of future taxable\nincome are reduced or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is present. Any future changes in the\ndeferred tax asset realizability assertion may require a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets, which would\nincrease our tax expense in the period the allowance is recognized and affect our results of operations.\nOur corporate income tax liability could materially increase if tax incentives we have negotiated in Singapore cease to\nbe effective or applicable or if we are challenged on our use of such incentives.\nWe operate under certain favorable tax incentives in Singapore which are effective through March 2027, and generally\nare dependent on our meeting certain headcount and investment thresholds. Such incentives allow certain qualifying income\nearned in Singapore to be taxed at reduced rates and are conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment\nthresholds over time. If we fail to satisfy the conditions for receipt of these tax incentives, or to the extent U.S. or other tax\nauthorities challenge our operation under these favorable tax incentive programs or our intercompany transfer pricing\nagreements, our taxable income could be taxed at higher federal or foreign statutory rates and our income tax liability and\nexpense could materially increase beyond our projections. Each of our Singapore tax incentives is separate and distinct from the\nothers, and may be granted, withheld, extended, modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any\neffect on the other incentives. Absent these tax incentives, our corporate income tax rate in Singapore would generally be the\n17% statutory tax rate. We are also subject to operating and other compliance requirements to maintain our favorable tax\nincentives. If we fail to comply with such requirements, we could lose the tax benefits and could possibly be required to refund\npreviously realized material tax benefits. Additionally, in the future, we may fail to qualify for renewal of our favorable tax\nincentives or such incentives may not be available to us, which could also cause our future taxable income to increase and be\ntaxed at higher statutory rates. Loss of one more of our tax incentives could cause us to modify our tax strategies and our\noperational structure, which could cause disruption in our business and have a material adverse impact on our results of\noperations. Further, there can be no guarantee that such modification in our tax strategy will yield tax incentives as favorable as\nthose we have negotiated with Singapore. Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on\nany taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially\nmodified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our\nexpenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows.\nInvestor confidence may be adversely impacted if we are unable to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002, and as a result, our stock price could decline.\nWe are subject to rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-\nOxley Act, which require us to include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K our management’s report on, and assessment of the\neffectiveness of, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, there is a risk that we will not comply with all of the\nrequirements imposed by Section 404. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition,\nare necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. Any of these\npossible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the\nreliability of our consolidated financial statements and could result in investigations or sanctions by the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock\nMarket LLC, or Nasdaq, or other regulatory authorities or in stockholder litigation. Any of these factors ultimately could harm\nour business and could negatively impact the market price of our securities. Ineffective control over financial reporting could\nalso cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading price of\nour common stock.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.\nHowever, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our\n52\ndisclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and\noperated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the\ndesign of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be\nconsidered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have established policies and processes for assessing, identifying, and managing material risk from cybersecurity\nthreats, and have integrated these processes into our overall risk management systems and processes. We routinely assess\nmaterial risks from cybersecurity threats, including any potential unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through our\ninformation systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information\nsystems or any information residing therein.\nWe conduct quarterly risk assessments to identify cybersecurity threats. These risk assessments include identifying\nreasonably foreseeable potential internal and external risks, the likelihood of occurrence and any potential damage that could\nresult from such risks, and the sufficiency of existing policies, procedures, systems, controls, and other safeguards in place to\nmanage such risks. As part of our risk management process, we may engage third party experts to help identify and assess risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats. Our risk management process also encompasses cybersecurity risks associated with our use of third-\nparty service providers.\nFollowing these risk assessments, we design, implement, and maintain reasonable safeguards to minimize the identified\nrisks; reasonably address any identified gaps in existing safeguards; update existing safeguards as necessary; and monitor the\neffectiveness of our safeguards. We have allocated adequate resources and have designated high-level personnel, including our\nChief Information Security Officer, to manage the cybersecurity risk assessment and mitigation process.\nAs part of our overall risk management program, we regularly provide required training to employees at all levels and in\nall departments on cybersecurity.\nThe Company also participates in a cybersecurity risk insurance policy.\nFor additional information regarding whether any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous\ncybersecurity incidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our company, including our\nbusiness strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this annual report on\nForm 10-K , including the risk factors entitled “We have been and may in the future be subject to information technology\nfailures, including security breaches, cyber-attacks, design defects or system failures, that could disrupt our operations,\ndamage our reputation and adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results,” “We are subject to governmental\nlaws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity,” and “We face risks\nrelated to security vulnerabilities in our products.”\nGovernance\nOne of the key functions of our Board of Directors is informed oversight of our risk management process, including risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats. Our Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, and our\nexecutive officers are responsible for the day-to-day management of the material risks we face. Our Board of Directors\nadministers its cybersecurity risk oversight function directly as a whole, as well as through the Cybersecurity Committee of the\nBoard of Directors (the “Cybersecurity Committee”). Members of the Cybersecurity Committee are appointed by, and serve at\nthe discretion of, the Board. The Cybersecurity Committee consists of at least three members of the Board, all of whom are\nindependent. Each member has a working familiarity and/or experience with cybersecurity, IT strategy, IT development and\ndeployment, or IT risk assessment and management, including information security management.\nOur Chief Information Security Officer and the Cybersecurity Committee are primarily responsible to assess and manage\nmaterial risks from cybersecurity threats. Our Chief Information Security Officer has twenty-five years of cybersecurity\nexperience, has completed a Masters in Information Security Engineering, and holds several cybersecurity certifications.\n53\nOur Chief Information Security Officer and the Cybersecurity Committee oversee key cybersecurity policies and\nprocesses, including those described in “Risk Management and Strategy” above. Our Chief Information Security Officer and\nthe Cybersecurity Committee are informed about policies and processes to monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and\nremediation of cybersecurity incidents.\nOur Chief Information Security Officer and representatives from the Cybersecurity Committee provide quarterly\nbriefings to the Audit Committee of the Board regarding our company’s cybersecurity risks and activities, including but not\nlimited to any recent cybersecurity incidents and related responses, and any cybersecurity systems testing. The Audit\nCommittee provides regular updates to the Board on relevant information regarding cybersecurity. In addition, our Chief\nInformation Security Officer and representatives from the Cybersecurity Committee provide annual briefings to the Board on\ncybersecurity risks, related mitigation, and other related responses and activities.\nBreaches\nThe last known cybersecurity breach occurred in 2020. The Company has not experienced any material cybersecurity\nbreach in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The Company also has not incurred any net expenses from\npenalties and/or settlements from any material cybersecurity breaches during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and\n2021.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur corporate headquarters occupy approximately 68,000 square feet in Carlsbad, California under a lease that expires in\nDecember 2029. A full range of business and engineering functions are represented at our corporate headquarters, including a\nlaboratory for research and development and manufacturing operations. In addition to our principal office spaces in Carlsbad,\nwe have active leased facilities in Irvine, California; San Jose, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Burnaby, Canada; Bangalore\nand Chennai, India; Singapore; Taipei and Hsinchu, Taiwan; Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, China; Seoul, South Korea;\nTokyo, Japan; Paterna, Spain; Villach, Austria; Munich, Germany; and in Petah Tikva, Israel.\n54\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nDispute with Silicon Motion\nAs previously disclosed, on July 26, 2023, MaxLinear terminated the Merger Agreement on multiple grounds. On\nAugust 16, 2023, Silicon Motion delivered to MaxLinear a notice, which Silicon Motion publicly disclosed, that it was\npurporting to terminate the Merger Agreement and that Silicon Motion would be commencing an arbitration before the\nSingapore International Arbitration Centre to seek damages from MaxLinear arising from MaxLinear’s alleged breaches of the\nMerger Agreement. Silicon Motion’s position is that MaxLinear’s Willful and Material Breaches (as such term is defined in the\nMerger Agreement) of the Merger Agreement prevented the Merger from being completed by August 7, 2023, and that\nMaxLinear is consequently liable for substantial monetary damages in excess of the termination fee as provided in the Merger\nAgreement.\nOn October 5, 2023, Silicon Motion filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre\nalleging that MaxLinear breached the Merger Agreement. Silicon Motion seeks payment of the termination fee, additional\ndamages, fees, and costs. The arbitration will be confidential.\nMaxLinear believes that it properly terminated the Merger Agreement. MaxLinear remains confident in its decision and\nwill vigorously defend its right to terminate the Silicon Motion transaction without penalty.\nClass Action Complaint\nOn August 31, 2023, a Silicon Motion stockholder filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of California captioned Water Island Event-Driven Fund v. MaxLinear, Inc., No. 23-cv-01607\n(S.D. Cal.), against MaxLinear and certain of its current officers. The complaint includes two claims: (1) an alleged violation of\nSection 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; and (2) an alleged violation of Section 20(a) of the\nExchange Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants made false and misleading statements and/or omitted material facts\nthat MaxLinear had a duty to disclose, concerning the Company’s ability and intention to timely close the merger with Silicon\nMotion, including that: (i) MaxLinear had allegedly decided it would not consummate the merger because the economic\ncircumstances surrounding the merger had materially changed, including a material downturn in the semiconductor industry and\nrising interest rates; (ii) MaxLinear had allegedly determined to unilaterally terminate the merger in the event the merger was\napproved by SAMR; (iii) MaxLinear had allegedly intended to argue that certain conditions in Article 6 of the Merger\nAgreement had not been satisfied as required by May 5, 2023 as a basis to terminate the merger; and (iv) as a result, MaxLinear\nhad allegedly materially misrepresented the viability of the merger, the purported benefits of the merger, and the likelihood that\nthe merger would be consummated. The complaint seeks compensatory damages, including interest, costs and expenses and\nsuch other equitable or injunctive relief that the court deems appropriate. MaxLinear will vigorously defend its position. On\nDecember 20, 2023, the Court appointed the lead plaintiffs, who are expected to file an amended complaint by February 15,\n2024. Defendants expect to answer or move to dismiss by March 29, 2024.\nComcast Litigation\nOn December 1, 2023, MaxLinear filed claims against Comcast Management, LLC and Comcast Cable\nCommunications, LLC (together, “Comcast”) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\nMaxLinear alleges that in 2020, MaxLinear shared its proprietary design and know-how for a full-duplex, or FDX, amplifier\nwith Comcast in the hope of securing future business with Comcast. MaxLinear shared its design and know-how on several\noccasions, all pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement between MaxLinear and Comcast, with the expectation that Comcast\nwould keep the information confidential. Comcast needed this technology in order to effectively compete with fiber-optic\ninternet providers. Instead of engaging MaxLinear to develop the FDX amplifier, Comcast shared MaxLinear’s proprietary\ndesigns with MaxLinear’s direct competitor. Comcast then worked with MaxLinear’s competitor to develop the FDX-amplifier\ntechnology. MaxLinear brought claims for trade secret misappropriation, unfair competition, and breach of the parties’ non-\ndisclosure agreement, and it sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment and\npost-judgment interest, costs, expenses, and attorney fees as well as an injunction against Comcast’s use or disclosure of\nMaxLinear’s trade secrets.\n55\nDish Litigation\nOn February 10, 2023, Entropic Communications, LLC, or Entropic filed claims for patent infringement against Dish\nNetwork Corporation, Dish Network LLC, Dish Network Service, LLC, and Dish Network California Service Corporation\n(together, “Dish”). At that time, MaxLinear was not a party to the action. On September 21, 2023, Dish Network California\nService Corporation (“Dish California”) filed four counterclaims against MaxLinear in the United States District Court for the\nCentral District of California. The four claims are declaratory judgment, breach of contract, fraud and negligent\nmisrepresentation, and civil conspiracy. Dish California alleges that when MaxLinear assigned certain patents to Entropic,\nMaxLinear violated its obligations owed to the Multimedia over Coax Alliance, or MoCA under MoCA’s Intellectual Property\nRights (“IPR”) Policy. Dish California alleges that MaxLinear also allegedly violated the MoCA IPR Policy by failing to offer\nDish California a fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, or FRAND, license for these patents. Dish California seeks an\nunspecified amount of compensatory damages, disgorgement, attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, and costs.\nCox Litigations\nOn October 6, 2023, Cox Communications, Inc., CoxCom, LLC, and Cox Communications California, LLC (together,\n“Cox”) filed claims in two separate actions against MaxLinear in the United States District Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia.\nIn the first action, in response to Entropic suing Cox for patent infringement, Cox filed counterclaims alleging that when\nMaxLinear assigned certain patents to Entropic, MaxLinear violated its obligations under MoCA’s IPR Policy by assigning\nthese patents and by failing to offer Cox a FRAND license for these patents. Cox amended its counterclaims on January 9, 2024\nand is asserting claims of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and declaratory judgment against MaxLinear. Cox seeks an\nunspecified amount of compensatory damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs.\nIn the second action, in response to Entropic suing Cox for patent infringement, Cox filed counterclaims against\nMaxLinear. Cox alleges that MaxLinear granted CableLabs a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to all patents essential for\ncompliance with DOCSIS specifications. It further alleges that MaxLinear breached this agreement when MaxLinear assigned\ncertain patents to Entropic. Cox amended its counterclaims on January 9, 2024 and is asserting claims for breach of contract,\nunjust enrichment, and declaratory judgment. Cox seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, equitable relief,\nattorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs.\nThe Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the\namount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, no material loss contingencies have been accrued for\nlitigation and other legal claims in our consolidated financial statements, since our management currently does not believe that\nthe ultimate outcome of any of the matters described above is probable. An unfavorable outcome of these matters may be\nreasonably possible in excess of recorded amounts; however, a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of such loss cannot\nbe made at this time.\nOther Matters\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to threats of litigation or actual litigation in the ordinary course of business as\ndescribed in “Item 3 — Legal Proceedings,” some of which may be material. Results of litigation and claims are inherently\nunpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and claims can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense\nand settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nITEM 4.

[RESERVED]\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion\ncontains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause our actual\nresults to differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but\nare not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the sections titled “Business” and “Risk Factors” included\nelsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a provider of communications SoCs used in broadband, mobile and wireline infrastructure, data center, and\nindustrial and multi-market applications. We are a fabless integrated circuit design company whose products integrate all or\nsubstantial portions of a high-speed communication system, including RF, high-performance analog, mixed-signal, digital\nsignal processing, security engines, data compression and networking layers, and power management. In most cases, these\nproducts are designed on a single silicon-die, using standard digital CMOS manufacturing processes and conventional\npackaging technologies. Importantly, our ability to design analog and mixed-signal circuits in CMOS allows us to efficiently\ncombine analog functionality and complex digital signal processing logic in the same integrated circuit. As a result, we believe\nour solutions have exceptional levels of functional integration and performance, low manufacturing cost, and reduced power\nconsumption versus competition. These solutions also enable shorter design cycles, significant design flexibility and low\nsystem-level cost across a range of markets.\nOur customers include electronics distributors, module makers, OEMs and ODMs, which incorporate our products in a\nwide range of electronic devices. Examples of such devices include radio transceivers and modems for 4G/5G base-station and\nbackhaul infrastructure; optical transceivers targeting hyperscale data centers; Wi-Fi and wireline routers for home networking;\nbroadband modems compliant with DOCSIS, PON, and DSL; as well as power management and interface products used in\nthese and many other markets.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, net revenue was $693.3 million, which was derived in part from sales of RF\nreceivers and RF receiver SoC and connectivity solutions into broadband operator voice and data modems and gateways and\nconnectivity adapters, global analog and digital RF receiver products, radio and modem solutions into wireless carrier access\nand backhaul infrastructure platforms, high-speed optical interconnect solutions sold into optical modules for data-center, metro\nand long-haul networks, and high-performance interface and power management solutions into a broad range of\ncommunications, industrial, automotive and multi-market applications. Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will\ndepend, among other factors, on our ability to further penetrate existing markets; our ability to expand our target addressable\nmarkets by developing new and innovative products; changes in government trade policies; and our ability to obtain design\nwins with device manufacturers, in particular manufacturers of data modems, and gateways for the broadband service provider,\nstorage networking market, cable infrastructure market, industrial and automotive markets, and optical module and\ntelecommunications infrastructure markets.\n58\nProducts shipped to Asia accounted for 75%, 82% and 83% of net revenue during the years ended 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively, including 37%, 43% and 40%, respectively, from products shipped to Hong Kong and 11%, 16% and 12%,\nrespectively, from products shipped to mainland China and 13% from products shipped to Vietnam in 2021. Although a large\npercentage of our products is shipped to Asia, we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers\nand incorporating our semiconductor products are then sold outside Asia. For example, revenue generated from sales of our\nproducts during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 related principally to sales to Asian ODMs and contract\nmanufacturers delivering products into European and North American markets. To date, all of our sales have been denominated\nin United States dollars.\nA significant portion of our net revenue has historically been generated by a limited number of customers. Sales to\ncustomers comprise both direct sales to customers and indirect sales through distributors. In the year ended December 31, 2023,\none customer accounted for 10% of our net revenue, and our ten largest customers collectively accounted for 54% of our net\nrevenue, of which distributor customers accounted for 16% of our net revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2022, two of\nour customers accounted for 31% of our net revenue, and our ten largest customers collectively accounted for 65% of our net\nrevenue, of which distributor customers comprised 18% of our net revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2021, two of our\ndirect customers accounted for 26% of our net revenue, and our ten largest customers collectively accounted for 69% of our net\nrevenue, of which distributor customers comprised 27% of our net revenue. For certain customers, we sell multiple products\ninto disparate end user applications such as cable modems and broadband gateways.\nOur business depends on winning competitive bid selection processes, known as design wins, to develop integrated\ncircuits for use in our customers’ products. These selection processes are typically lengthy, and as a result, our sales cycles will\nvary based on the specific market served, whether the design win is with an existing or a new customer and whether our product\nbeing designed in our customer’s device is a first generation or subsequent generation product. Our customers’ products can be\ncomplex and, if our engagement results in a design win, can require significant time to define, design and result in volume\nproduction. Because the sales cycle for our products is long, we can incur significant design and development expenditures in\ncircumstances where we do not ultimately recognize any revenue. We do not have any long-term purchase commitments with\nany of our customers, all of whom purchase our products on a purchase order basis. Once one of our products is incorporated\ninto a customer’s design, however, we believe that our product is likely to remain a component of the customer’s product for its\nlife cycle because of the time and expense associated with redesigning the product or substituting an alternative chip. Product\nlife cycles in our target markets will vary by application. For example, in the broadband data modem and gateway sectors, a\ndesign-in can have a product life cycle of 24 to 60 months. In the industrial and wired and wireless infrastructure markets, a\ndesign-in can have a product life cycle of 24 to 84 months and beyond.\nImpact of Global Economic Uncertainty and Inventory Build\nInflation and uncertainty in customer demand and the worldwide economy has continued, and we expect to experience\ncontinued decline in our sales and revenues in the first quarter of 2024. In particular, we believe an economic slowdown and\ninventory oversupply in the channel could continue to add to volatility in managing the business. In addition, inventory\noversupply could potentially lead to more inventory write-downs, including charges for any excess or obsolete inventory which\ncould negatively impact our gross margins. However, the magnitude of such volatility on our business and its duration is\nuncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. As supplier lead times continue to stabilize, we have seen and expect\nto continue to see a more normalized demand-planning horizon. While we expect inventory to remain elevated in the near term,\nwe expect channel inventory will continue to decline thereafter.\nTerminated Silicon Motion Merger\nOn May 5, 2022, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Silicon Motion\nTechnology Corporation, or Silicon Motion, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the Law of the\nCayman Islands, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire Silicon Motion pursuant\nto a statutory merger of Shark Merger Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MaxLinear, with and into Silicon Motion, with\nSilicon Motion surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of MaxLinear. Silicon Motion is a provider of NAND flash\ncontrollers for solid state drives and other solid state storage devices.\n59\nOn July 26, 2023, we terminated the Merger Agreement and notified Silicon Motion that we were relieved of our\nobligations to close because, among other reasons, (i) certain conditions to closing set forth in the Merger Agreement were not\nsatisfied and were incapable of being satisfied, (ii) Silicon Motion had suffered a Material Adverse Effect that was continuing,\n(iii) Silicon Motion was in material breach of representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in the Merger Agreement\nthat gave rise to the right of the Company to terminate, and (iv) in any event, the First Extended Outside Date had passed and\nwas not automatically extended because certain conditions in Article 6 of the Merger Agreement were not satisfied or waived as\nof May 5, 2023. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, MaxLinear was not required to pay a break-up fee or other fee as a\nresult of the termination of the Merger Agreement on these grounds. On August 16, 2023, Silicon Motion delivered a notice to\nus, which Silicon Motion publicly disclosed, that it was purporting to terminate the Merger Agreement and that Silicon Motion\nwould be commencing an arbitration to seek damages from us arising from our alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement.\nUndefined capitalized terms in this paragraph have the same meaning as in the Merger Agreement.\nOn October 5, 2023, Silicon Motion filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre\nalleging that we breached the Merger Agreement. See Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) of this report for more information on\nlegal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement.\nThe second amended and restated commitment letter dated October 24, 2022 with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., or Wells\nFargo Bank, and other lenders, and related financing commitments for the previously pending (now terminated) merger were\nalso terminated upon termination of the Merger Agreement. As a result of the termination of the financing, the Company was\nrequired to pay to Wells Fargo Bank a ticking fee of $18.3 million, which is included in other income (expense), net in the year\nended December 31, 2023.\nAcquisition of Company Y\nOn January 17, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of a business, or Company Y, pursuant to a Purchase and\nSale Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement. The transaction consideration included $9.8 million in cash. In addition, Company\nY stockholders may receive up to an additional $2.6 million in potential contingent consideration, subject to the acquired\nbusiness satisfying certain personnel objectives by June 17, 2024.\nCompany Y is headquartered in Bangalore, India and operates as a provider of engineering design services.\nWorkforce Reductions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we entered into two plans of restructuring to reduce our workforce, or the\nWorkforce Reductions. The Workforce Reductions are intended to align our operational needs with the changes in\nmacroeconomic conditions and the demand environment while continuing to support the long-term business strategy by\nreducing our operating expenses.\nAs a result of the Workforce Reductions, in the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred $19.8 million in\nrestructuring costs primarily related to severance costs and related expenses, and estimate that we will incur approximately $30\nmillion to $40 million in restructuring costs in 2024 upon notice to the remaining affected employees of the Workforce\nReductions. Approximately two-thirds of the cost is estimated to be statutory severance benefits in the jurisdictions in which the\nterminated employees were employed and a significant amount of the remaining one-third of the cost represents non-cash\ncharges related to exiting facilities and writing off of related assets. The estimate of costs that we expect to incur, and the timing\nthereof, are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results may differ. We may also incur other charges or cash\nexpenditures not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, the Workforce\nReductions. We expect to complete informing affected employees of the Workforce Reductions by the end of the first quarter of\n2024.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated\nfinancial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United\nStates. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We continually evaluate\nour estimates and judgments, the most critical of which are those related to business combinations, revenue recognition,\ninventory valuation, production masks, goodwill and other intangible assets valuation, and income taxes. We base our estimates\nand judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Materially\n60\ndifferent results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.\nWe believe that the following accounting estimates we have identified as critical involve a greater degree of judgment\nand complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the estimates we believe are the most critical to\nunderstanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Note 1 to our consolidated\nfinancial statements included elsewhere in this report for a summary of each of the related accounting policies.\nBusiness Combinations\nEstimates in our business combination accounting that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty include the\nvaluation of identifiable intangible and tangible assets such as inventory, property and equipment, and intangible assets\nincluding in-process research and development, or IPR&D, and contingent consideration, which involve the use of forecasted\nfinancial information available at the acquisition date, including application of revenue growth rates and margin percentages,\nand use of a discount rate and various other assumptions as described in more detail in Notes 1 and 3 to our consolidated\nfinancial statements. When reported amounts are material, they may be sensitive to changes to certain assumptions used in the\nvaluation. If the discount rate used in our valuations increased by 1%, it would result in a decrease to the valuation of intangible\nassets of an immaterial amount for our 2023 and 2021 acquisitions. The amortization and depreciation of such assets, and\nchange in fair value of contingent consideration, impact our consolidated financial results in periods subsequent to the\nacquisition, and such amounts are disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022, we recorded impairment of intangible assets of $2.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, associated with certain\nacquired licensed technology. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not record any material adjustments to the\nvaluation of such assets, goodwill, or subsequent period adjustments to the consolidated statements of operations associated\nwith our other business combinations.\nRevenue Recognition\nEstimates in our revenue recognition that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty include the estimates of\nprice adjustments and returns under contractual stock rotation rights based on our analysis of expected value of actual price\nadjustment claims by distributors and product historical return rates. Any changes to such estimates, for example differences in\nactual sell-through activity versus our estimate of sell-through activity in our price adjustments, or actual vs. historical return\nrates, may impact our consolidated financial results in periods subsequent to recording those estimates, and such amounts are\ndisclosed in our consolidated financial statements. Other than our estimates of sell-through activity and customer return rates,\nthere are no assumptions inherent in our estimates in the valuation of price adjustments and returns that would result in\nsensitivity of reported amounts to such assumptions. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 we have not\nrecorded any material adjustments to such estimates.\nInventory Valuation\nEstimates in the valuation of inventory that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty include our estimates of\nexcess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of future demand for our products in inventory. Any changes to such\nestimates, for example differences in actual sales versus our estimates of demand, or conversely, the ultimate sell-through of\nfully reserved inventory for which we did not anticipate any future demand, impact our consolidated financial results in periods\nsubsequent to recording those estimates. Other than our forecasts of future demand, there are no assumptions inherent in our\nestimates in the valuation of inventory that would result in sensitivity of reported amounts to such assumptions. During the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we have not recorded any material net adjustments for such changes in\nestimates.\n61\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nEstimates in our assessment of impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets that involve a significant level of estimation\nuncertainty and management judgment include the comparison of our market capitalization as of the annual impairment\nassessment date to the carrying value of goodwill, use of forecasted financial information for our projects remaining in IPR&D,\nif any, including growth rates and margin percentages, and a discount rate as of the annual IPR&D impairment assessment date,\nand our quarterly assessment of whether indicators of impairment exist with respect to all of our goodwill and long-lived assets.\nFor example, a decision to abandon a project involving the technology underlying developed technology and IPR&D, if any,\nmay result in immediate impairment of such assets in the quarter such decision is made. As of the October 31 assessment date,\nwe did not have any remaining IPR&D. Impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets impact our consolidated financial results\nin periods subsequent to their acquisition, and such amounts are disclosed in our consolidated financial statements. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded impairment of intangible assets of $2.4 million and $2.8 million,\nrespectively, associated with certain acquired licensed technology. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not\nrecord any material adjustments to the valuation of such assets.\nIncome Taxes\nEstimates in our assessment of realizability of deferred tax assets that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty\nand management judgment include projected future taxable income. For example, we continue to have a valuation allowance\nagainst state deferred tax assets, certain federal deferred tax assets, and certain foreign deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where\nwe have cumulative losses or otherwise are not expected to utilize certain tax attributes. If projected future taxable income in\nthe U.S., for example, were to increase from what we assumed in our estimates, in periods subsequent to recording valuation\nallowances, it may be more likely than not that a proportional amount of the valuation against deferred tax assets will be\nreleased, resulting in an impact to our tax provision (benefit).\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently\nadopted accounting pronouncements as of the date of this report, if any.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for recently\nissued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this report, if any.\nResults of Operations\nThe following describes the line items set forth in our consolidated statements of operations.\nNet Revenue. Net revenue is generated from sales of radio-frequency, analog, digital, and mixed-signal integrated circuits\nfor access and connectivity, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multi-market applications. A significant\nportion of our sales are to distributors, who then resell our products.\nCost of Net Revenue. Cost of net revenue includes the cost of finished silicon wafers processed by third-party foundries;\ncosts associated with our outsourced packaging and assembly, test and shipping; costs of personnel, including salaries, benefits\nand stock-based compensation; equipment associated with manufacturing support, logistics and quality assurance; amortization\nof acquired developed technology and purchased licensed technology intangible assets; inventory fair value adjustments, if any;\namortization of certain production mask costs and computer-aided design software license costs; cost of production load boards\nand sockets; and an allocated portion of our occupancy costs.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense includes personnel-related expenses, including stock-\nbased compensation, new product engineering mask costs, prototype integrated circuit packaging and test costs, computer-aided\ndesign software license costs, intellectual property license costs, reference design development costs, development testing and\nevaluation costs, depreciation expense, and allocated occupancy costs. Research and development activities include the design\nof new products, refinement of existing products and design of test methodologies to ensure compliance with required\nspecifications. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\n62\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative expense includes personnel-related expenses,\nincluding salaries and benefits and stock-based compensation, amortization of certain acquired intangible assets, merger,\nacquisition and integration costs, third-party sales commissions, field application engineering support, travel costs, professional\nand consulting fees, legal fees, depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs.\nImpairment Losses. Impairment losses consist of charges resulting from the impairment of intangible assets.\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges consist of severance, lease and leasehold impairment charges, and other\ncharges related to restructuring plans.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt consists of the charge-off of remaining unamortized\ndebt discount and issuance cost on debt we repaid early with a majority of the proceeds from a new term loan.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income (expense), net includes interest income, interest\nexpense and other income (expense). Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and restricted\ncash balances. Interest expense consists of interest accrued on debt and amortization of discounts on debt and other liabilities.\nOther income (expense) generally consists of income (expense) generated from non-operating transactions, including a ticking\nfee paid to lenders following the termination of the Silicon Motion merger, net gains (losses) from sales of investments, and\nunrealized holding gains (losses) from certain investments required to be marked to market value.\nIncome tax provision. We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income taxes for financial statement\npurposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from\ndifferences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes and the realizability of\nassets in future years.\n63\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods\nindicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet revenue 100% 100% 100%\nCost of net revenue 44 42 44\nGross profit 56 58 56\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 39 26 31\nSelling, general and administrative 19 15 17\nImpairment losses — — —\nRestructuring charges 3 — —\nTotal operating expenses 61 42 48\nIncome (loss) from operations (6) 16 7\nInterest income 1 — —\nInterest expense (2) (1) (1)\nOther income (expense), net (3) — —\nTotal other income (expense), net (4) (1) (2)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes (9) 16 5\nIncome tax provision 1 4 1\nNet income (loss) (11) % 11 % 5 %\nNet Revenue\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nBroadband $ 203,519 $ 493,232 $ 492,482 $ (289,713) $ 750 (59) % — %\n% of net revenue 29 % 44 % 55 %\nConnectivity 138,228 303,925 149,285 (165,697) 154,640 (55) % 104 %\n% of net revenue 20 % 27 % 17 %\nInfrastructure 177,083 136,274 119,421 40,809 16,853 30 % 14 %\n% of net revenue 26 % 12 % 13 %\nIndustrial and multi-market 174,433 186,821 131,210 (12,388) 55,611 (7) % 42 %\n% of net revenue 25 % 17 % 15 %\nTotal net revenue $ 693,263 $ 1,120,252 $ 892,398 $ (426,989) $ 227,854 (38) % 26 %\nNet revenue decreased$427.0 million to $693.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $1.1\nbillion for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand,\nincluding excess inventory in the channel built up following the supply shortages in the prior year. As supply shortages eased,\nthe upward pricing pressure eased and was a modest component of revenue growth in the year. Broadband net revenue\ndecreased by $289.7 million, driven by decreases in the volume of broadband SOC shipments in this category. Connectivity\nrevenue decreased $165.7 million due to decreased volume of shipments of certain products primarily associated with\nresidential broadband market decline. The increase in infrastructure revenues of $40.8 million was primarily driven by an\nincrease in the volume of wireless backhaul shipments. Industrial and multi-market revenue decreased $12.4 million due to a\n$22.3 million decrease driven by decreased volume of shipments of high-performance analog products, partially offset by a\n$9.9 million increase driven by increased volume of shipments of component products.\n64\nNet revenue increased$227.9 million to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $892.4\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Broadband net revenue increased$0.8 million, substantially driven by price\nincreases on our broadband SOC products within this category, which was partially offset by modest decreases in the volume of\nshipments in this category. Connectivity revenue increased$154.6 million due to an increased volume of shipments of products\ntoward the latter part of 2022 as our supply improved opening up new opportunities to address the third party router market and\nwas supplemented by some price increases on connectivity products. More than 50% of the revenue increase was driven by\nincreased revenue from the introduction of our new Wi-Fi 6 product late in 2021.The increase in infrastructure revenues of\n$16.9 million was driven by an increase in shipments in the wireless infrastructure market. Industrial and multi-market revenue\nincreased$55.6 million due to increased demand for our power and interface products and increased prices on products within\nthis category. This end market also had some modest declines from products that entered end-of-life categorization.\nWe currently expect that revenue will fluctuate in the future, from period-to-period, consistent with the cyclical nature of\nour industry.\nCost of Net Revenue and Gross Profit\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nCost of net revenue $ 307,600 $ 470,483 $ 396,566 $ (162,883) $ 73,917 (35) % 19 %\n% of net revenue 44 % 42 % 44 %\nGross profit $ 385,663 $ 649,769 $ 495,832 $ (264,106) $ 153,937 (41) % 31 %\n% of net revenue 56 % 58 % 56 %\nCost of net revenue decreased$162.9 million to $307.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to\n$470.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was driven by a decreased volume of shipments of\nbroadband SOC and certain connectivity products as a result of macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand for\nsuch products. Gross profit percentage decreased for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, due to reduced absorption of intangible amortization, partially offset by improvement from product mix.\nProduct mix included higher margin backhaul product contributions relative to total revenues in 2023 as compared to 2022.\nCost of net revenue increased$73.9 million to $470.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to\n$396.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was driven by an increased volume of shipments of certain\nconnectivity products toward the latter part of 2022 as our supply improved and increased costs on inventory purchased from\nsuppliers as a result of supply chain constraints, and was partially offset by decreases in the volume of shipments of broadband\nproducts. Gross profit percentage improved for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the year ended December\n31, 2021, driven by improved mix of higher margin new products, higher margin infrastructure and industrial and multi-market\nproduct contributions, and improved margins from price increases that were passed along on certain products within our\nbroadband, connectivity, and industrial and multi-market categories during the year, and improved absorption of amortization\nof intangible assets.\nWe currently expect that gross profit percentage will fluctuate in the future, from period-to-period, based on changes in\nproduct mix, average selling prices, and average manufacturing costs.\nResearch and Development\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nResearch and development $ 269,504 $ 296,442 $ 278,440 $ (26,938) $ 18,002 (9) % 6 %\n% of net revenue 39 % 26 % 31 %\nResearch and development, or R&D, expense decreased$26.9 million to $269.5 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023 from $296.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was driven by decreases in bonuses of $21.9\nmillion, payroll and benefits expense of $9.4 million, and consulting expense of $9.2 million, partially offset by the impact of\ndecrease in income from joint R&D projects and governmental R&D grants offsetting our R&D expense of $11.3 million and\nan increase stock based compensation expense of $3.6 million. The decrease in bonuses is attributable to a decrease in financial\n65\nperformance and decreased headcount from the workforce reductions during 2023. The decrease in payroll and benefits expense\nis also due to the workforce reductions. The amount of income from joint R&D projects and governmental R&D grants varies\nfrom year to year depending on demand for such projects and availability of governmental R&D programs.\nR&D expense increased$18.0 million to $296.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $278.4 million in\nthe year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was driven by increases in payroll and employee benefit expenses of $21.8\nmillion, stock-based compensation and bonus expenses of $11.2 million, CAD design tools and other software license expenses\nof $5.8 million, consulting expenses of $3.1 million, and various other expenses of $6.1 million. This increase was partially\noffset by an increase in income from joint R&D projects and governmental R&D grants of $25.6 million and decrease in\nprototype expenses of $4.6 million. The increased expenses were due primarily to increased headcount in 2022. The amount of\nincome from joint R&D projects and governmental grants varies from year to year depending on demand for such projects and\navailability of governmental R&D programs.\nWe are closely managing our R&D expenses to meet evolving demand and are in the process of completing a workforce\nreduction which is anticipated to reduce R&D expense in the first quarter of 2024; however, we expect our research and\ndevelopment expenses to increase in future years as we develop products to drive future growth.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nSelling, general and administrative $ 132,156 $ 168,008 $ 149,943 $ (35,852) $ 18,065 (21) % 12 %\n% of net revenue 19 % 15 % 17 %\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased$35.9 million to $132.2 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023, as compared to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was a result of decreases in stock-\nbased compensation expenses of $30.1 million, amortization of intangibles of $9.0 million, bonuses of $7.8 million, and\nsupplies and small tools of $1.6 million, partially offset by increases in payroll and other benefits expense of $7.4 million and\nlegal fees of $4.9 million. The decrease in stock based compensation expense and bonuses is attributable to the payouts for the\n2022 period including additional grants to certain employees and a decrease in financial performance impacting the amounts of\nstock based compensation recognized for performance-based restricted stock units and amounts of bonuses. The decrease in\nintangible amortization expense is from acquired assets becoming fully amortized as they reach the end of their useful lives.\nThe increase in payroll and other benefits is from increase in headcount in certain administrative functions. The increase in\nlegal fees is due to various legal proceedings including those following the termination of our merger with Silicon Motion, the\nComcast litigation, and in settlement of the Bell Semiconductor litigation earlier in the year.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased$18.1 million to $168.0 million for the year ended December 31,\n2022, as compared to $149.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was a result of increases in stock-\nbased compensation expenses of $11.3 million, professional fees of $7.6 million, other expenses of $3.5 million, payroll and\nbenefits of $3.3 million, and various other expenses of $3.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in intangible amortization\nexpense of $11.7 million. The increase in professional fees was due to an increase in acquisition and integration costs of $6.8\nmillion related to our previously pending (now terminated) merger with Silicon Motion. The increase in stock-based\ncompensation expenses and payroll employee benefits expenses and the remaining other expenses were mainly due to increased\nheadcount and spending due to higher product demands from customers. Improved financial performance in 2022 and\nadditional grants to employees of stock-based awards also contributed to the increase in stock-based compensation expense.\nWe are closely managing our selling, general and administrative expenses; however, we expect selling, general and\nadministrative expenses to increase in future years when we return to growing our sales and marketing organization to expand\ninto existing and new markets.\n66\nImpairment Losses\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nImpairment losses $ 2,438 $ 2,811 $ — $ (373) $ 2,811 (13)% N/A\n% of net revenue — % — % — %\nImpairment losses in the year ended December 31, 2023 related to abandonment of certain acquired licensing\nagreements. Impairment losses in the year ended December 31, 2022 also related to abandonment of certain acquired licensing\nagreements.\nRestructuring Charges\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nRestructuring charges $ 19,786 $ 2,265 $ 2,204 $ 17,521 $ 61 774% 3%\n% of net revenue 3 % — % — %\nRestructuring charges increased$17.5 million to $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.3\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2022. Restructuring charges increased$0.1 million to $2.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, compared to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRestructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2023 included $17.9 million in employee severance-related\ncharges related to reductions in our workforce and $1.8 million in other charges driven by the abandonment of certain\ncomputer-assisted design software licenses used by the terminated workforce. Approximately two-thirds of the employee\nseverance-related charges are estimated statutory severance benefits payable in the jurisdictions in which the terminated\nemployees were employed, with the remainder representing standard severance benefits.\nRestructuring charges in the year ended December 31, 2022 included $1.8 million in employee severance-related charges\nand $0.5 million of lease-related charges, which is comprised of impairment of leased right-of-use assets from partial\nabandonment of a facility.\nRestructuring charges in the year ended December 31, 2021 included $1.3 million in employee severance-related charges\nand $0.6 million of lease-related charges, which consisted of impairment of leased right-of-use assets and leasehold\nimprovements.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nInterest and other income (expense), net $ (25,589) $ (6,045) $ (12,154) $ (19,544) $ 6,109 323 % (50) %\n% of net revenue (4) % (1) % (1) %\nInterest and other income (expense), net changed by $19.5 million to a net expense of $25.6 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 from a net expense of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change in interest and other\nincome (expense), net was primarily due to a $24.4 million change in other income (expense), net, from income of $3.5 million\nin the 2022 period to expense of $20.9 million in the 2023 period plus an increase in interest expense of $0.9 million, partially\noffset by the impact of a $5.8 millionincrease in interest income.\nThe $24.4 million change in other income (expense), net primarily related to a loan ticking fee of approximately\n$18.3 million paid to lenders following the termination of the Silicon Motion merger, $4.3 million impact from foreign\ncurrency fluctuations, $2.8 million impact of realized and unrealized holding losses recognized on equity securities that were\nsold at the end of 2023 that were previously marked to market value in other income (expense), net, and partially offset by a\ngain of $1.0 million related to partial curtailment of defined benefit pension obligations. The $0.9 millionincrease in interest\n67\nexpense is due to higher interest rates on our outstanding debt in 2023. The $5.8 millionincrease in interest income is due to\nhigher interest rates on our interest-bearing cash equivalents.\nInterest and other income (expense), net changed by $6.1 million to a net expense of $6.0 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 from a net expense of $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in interest and\nother income (expense), net was due to the positive impact of a non-recurring gain on sale of privately held investments of $3.4\nmillion and a decrease in interest expense of $3.2 million associated with a lower outstanding principal balance of debt,\npartially offset by unrealized losses on investments and impacts from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021 $ Change % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nIncome tax provision $ 9,337 $ 49,158 $ 5,901 $ (39,821) $ 43,257 (81) % 733 %\n% of pre-tax income (loss) (15) % 28 % 11 %\nThe income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $9.3 million compared to an income tax provision\nof $49.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and an income tax provision of $5.9 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\nThe difference between our effective tax rate and the 21.0% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31,\n2023 resulted primarily from the mix of pre-tax income among jurisdictions, permanent tax items including tax credits and a tax\non global intangible low-taxed income, stock based compensation, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and\nrelease of uncertain tax positions under ASC 740-10. The permanent tax item related to global intangible low-taxed income, or\nGILTI, also reflects recent legislative changes requiring the capitalization of research and experimentation costs, as well as\nlimitations on the creditability of certain foreign income taxes.\nThe difference between our effective tax rate and the 21.0% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31,\n2022 resulted primarily from the mix of pre-tax income among jurisdictions, permanent tax items including a tax on global\nintangible low-taxed income, stock based compensation, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, release of\nuncertain tax positions under ASC 740-10, and release of the valuation allowance on certain federal research and development\ncredits. The permanent tax item related to global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, also reflects recent legislative changes\nrequiring the capitalization of research and experimentation costs, as well as limitations on the creditability of certain foreign\nincome taxes.\nThe difference between our effective tax rate and the 21.0% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31,\n2021 resulted primarily from a tax on GILTI, and non-deductible foreign stock-based compensation, offset by a benefit related\nto research and development tax credits, foreign earnings taxed at rates other than the federal statutory rate and the effect of a\nrelease of valuation allowance against certain Singapore deferred tax assets pertaining to usage of net operating losses.\nWe continue to maintain a valuation allowance to offset state and certain federal and foreign deferred tax assets, as\nrealization of such assets does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold required under accounting guidelines. In making\nsuch determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence quarterly, including scheduled reversals of\ndeferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Based upon\nour review of all positive and negative evidence, we continue to have a valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets, certain\nfederal deferred tax assets, and certain foreign deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where we have cumulative losses or otherwise\nare not expected to utilize certain tax attributes. We do not incur income tax expense or benefit in certain tax-free jurisdictions\nin which we operate.\nOur subsidiary in Singapore operates under certain tax incentives in Singapore, which are effective through March 2027.\nUnder these incentives, qualifying income derived from certain sales of our integrated circuits is taxed at a concessionary rate\nover the incentive period. We also receive a reduced withholding tax rate on certain intercompany royalty payments made by\nour Singapore subsidiary during the incentive period. We recorded a tax provision in the year ended December 31, 2023 and\nyear ended December 31, 2022 at the incentive rate. In the year ended December 31, 2021, due to our Singapore net operating\nlosses and a full valuation allowance in Singapore, the incentives did not have a material impact on our income tax provision.\nThe incentives are conditional upon our meeting certain minimum employment and investment thresholds within Singapore\n68\nover time, and we may be required to return certain tax benefits in the event we do not achieve compliance related to that\nincentive period. We currently believe that we will be able to satisfy these conditions without material risk.\nWe will continue to monitor updates to our business along with guidance issued with respect to both Acts to determine\nwhether any adjustments are needed to our consolidated tax provision in future periods.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $187.3 million, restricted cash of $1.1 million and net\naccounts receivable of $170.6 million. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, our working capital, which we define as current\nassets less current liabilities, was $265.9 million. Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit\nrisk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Collateral is generally not required for customer\nreceivables. We limit our exposure to credit loss by placing our cash with high credit quality financial institutions. At times,\nsuch deposits may be in excess of insured limits. We have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash\nequivalents.\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses and purchases of inventory, property and equipment, and from\ntime to time, the acquisition of businesses. In May 2022, we entered into the Merger Agreement to acquire Silicon Motion.\nHowever, on July 26, 2023, we terminated the Merger Agreement and were relieved of our obligations to close.\nWe also use cash to pay down outstanding debt, repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase plan, and from\ntime to time, make investments. As of December 31, 2023, $125.0 million of principal was outstanding under a senior secured\nterm B loan facility, or the “Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement.” The Company also has available a\nsenior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100.0 million, which remained undrawn as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The proceeds of the revolving facility may be used to finance the working capital needs and other general\ncorporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nCommencing on September 30, 2021, the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement has amortized in\nequal quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021\nCredit Agreement, with the balance payable on June 23, 2028. We could be subject to substantial variable interest rate risk\nbecause our interest rate under term loans typically vary based on a fixed margin over an indexed rate or an adjusted base rate.\nWhile we had been mitigating the impact of rising interest rates with large amounts of prepayments on our outstanding debt, if\ninterest rates were to further increase substantially, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and affect our\nability to service the indebtedness. Please refer to the Risk Factor entitled “As of September 30, 2023, our aggregate\nindebtedness was $125.0 million, and we are subject to a variable amount of interest on the principal balance of our credit\nagreements and could continue to be adversely impacted by rising interest rates in the future. Such indebtedness adversely\naffects our operating results and cash-flows as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations and\ncontains financial and operational covenants that could adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic\ntransactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interest of stockholders, including obtaining additional\nindebtedness to finance such transactions. In addition, rising interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers,\nand our distributors to obtain financing and service their interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on\ncustomer demand for our products and our distributors' business” for a discussion of how our indebtedness could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including changes in revenue, the expansion of our\nengineering, sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of our expansion into new territories, the timing of\nintroductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, the continuing market acceptance of our products, any\ndamages from legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement with Silicon Motion or any alleged\nbreaches of the Merger Agreement that we are required to pay, or any amounts we agree to pay in any settlement and any other\npotential material investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies. Additional funds may\nnot be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may not be able to\nsustain our operations or execute our strategic plans.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are impacted by the timing of when we pay expenses as reflected in the change in our\noutstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. Cash used to fund operating expenses in our consolidated statements of\ncash flows excludes the impact of non-cash items such as amortization and depreciation of acquired intangible assets and leased\nright-of-use assets and property and equipment, stock-based compensation, impairment of intangible assets, impairment of\nleased right-of-use assets and related leasehold improvements and unrealized holding or realized gains or losses on marketable\n69\nequity securities. Cash used to fund capital purchases and acquisitions of businesses and investments are included in investing\nactivities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash proceeds from issuance of common stock and debt and cash used\nto pay down outstanding debt or repurchase common stock are included in financing activities in our consolidated statements of\ncash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our material cash requirements include long-term debt, non-cancelable operating leases,\ninventory purchase obligations and other obligations, which primarily consist of contractual payments due for computer-aided\ndesign software, as follows:\nPayments due\nMore than 5\nTotal Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years years\n(in thousands)\nLong term debt obligations $ 125,000 $ — $ — $ 125,000 $ —\nOperating lease obligations 39,440 10,769 18,830 8,245 1,596\nPurchase obligations 38,985 28,754 10,231 — —\nOther obligations 84,208 32,563 47,972 3,673 —\nTotal $ 287,633 $ 72,086 $ 77,033 $ 136,918 $ 1,596\nOur planned capital expenditures as of December 31, 2023 were not material. Our consolidated balance sheet at\nDecember 31, 2023 included in other long-term liabilities $5.4 million for uncertain tax positions, some of which may result in\ncash payment and $15.0 million received from other parties for jointly funded research and development projects which will be\nrecognized into income when the contingencies associated with the repayment conditions have been resolved. The future\npayments related to uncertain tax positions recorded as other long-term liabilities have not been presented in the table above due\nto the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities.\nOur primary sources of cash are cash receipts on accounts receivable from our shipment of products to distributors and\ndirect customers. Aside from the amounts billed to our customers, net cash collections of accounts receivable are impacted by\nthe efficiency of our cash collections process, which can vary from period to period depending on the payment cycles of our\nmajor distributor customers, and relative linearity of shipments period-to-period. The June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement, under\nwhich we entered into a senior secured term B loan facility and a revolving credit facility, permits us to request incremental\nloans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the sum of an amount equal to the greater of (x) $175.0 million and (y)\n100% of “Consolidated EBITDA” (as defined in such agreement), plus the amount of certain voluntary prepayments, plus an\nunlimited amount that is subject to pro forma compliance with certain first lien net leverage ratio, secured net leverage ratio and\ntotal net leverage ratio tests.\n70\nThe following is a summary of our working capital, cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the periods\nindicated:\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nWorking capital $ 265,896 $ 222,038\nCash and cash equivalents $ 187,288 $ 187,353\nShort-term restricted cash 1,051 982\nLong-term restricted cash 17 22\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 188,356 $ 188,357\nWe believe that our $187.3 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 will be sufficient to fund our\nprojected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2023, our indebtedness totaled $125.0\nmillion, which consists of outstanding principal under the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement. The\nJune 23, 2021 Credit Agreement also provides the Company with the Revolving Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up\nto $100.0 million, which remained undrawn as of December 31, 2023. The Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit\nAgreement has a seven-year term expiring in June 2028 and bears interest, at the Company’s option, at a per annum rate equal\nto either (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (x) the federal funds rate, plus 0.50%, (y) the prime rate then in effect and (z) an\nadjusted LIBOR rate determined on the basis of a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, in each case, plus an applicable margin\nof 1.25% or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate, subject to a floor of 0.50%, plus an applicable margin of 2.25%. Loans under the\nRevolving Facility initially bear interest, at a per annum rate equal to either (i) a base rate (as calculated above) plus an\napplicable margin of 0.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate (as calculated above) plus an applicable margin of 1.00%.\nFollowing delivery of financial statements for the Company’s fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2021, the applicable margin for\nloans under the Revolving Facility will range from 0.00% to 0.75% in the case of base rate loans and 1.00% to 1.75% in the\ncase of LIBOR rate loans, in each case, depending on the Company’s secured net leverage ratio as of the most recently ended\nfiscal quarter. The Company is required to pay commitment fees ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum on the daily\nundrawn commitments under the Revolving Facility, depending on the Company’s secured net leverage ratio as of the most\nrecently ended fiscal quarter. Commencing on September 30, 2021, the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit\nAgreement amortizes in equal quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount, with the balance payable\nat maturity on June 23, 2028. The June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement was amended on June 29, 2023 to implement a benchmark\nreplacement.\nThe following is a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and\nfinancing activities for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 43,372 $ 388,726 $ 168,233\nNet cash used in investing activities (15,935) (91,762) (91,757)\nNet cash used in financing activities (26,356) (240,401) (91,903)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash (1,082) 56 (2,869)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (1) $ 56,619 $ (18,296)\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nIn the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was $43.4 million, compared to net cash\nprovided by operating activities of $388.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decline in operating cash flows\nwas driven by a decline in revenue from decreased volume of shipments of broadband SOC and certain connectivity products as\na result of macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand for such products (as discussed under the heading, “Results\nof Operations,” above). Operating cash flows were also impacted by changes in our working capital, which decreased $101.4\nmillion, in particular, in 2023 we made $104.2 million in payments against our price protection liability and $11.8 million in\nseverance and related payments from our workforce reductions.\n71\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $388.7 million, compared to net cash\nflow provided by operating activities of $168.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in operating cash\nflows was driven by an increase in revenue from various factors as discussed under the heading, “Results of Operations,”\nabove). Operating cash flows were also impacted by changes in working capital, which increased $110.3 million, in particular\nin 2022, the price protection liability increased by $113.3 million in 2022, due to a significant increase in revenues from\ncustomers with price protection rights and a delay in the timing of payments and certain price protection claims submitted by\ncustomers since certain claims are not made until after a customer has utilized a complete bundle of products. Such delay was\ncaused by the supply chain shortages in the industry over an 18-month period beginning in 2021 and extending into 2022.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur use of cash in investing activities declined, as we moved from heavier investing in infrastructure, securities and\nprivate companies in 2022 to lighter investment activity in 2023. Net cash used in investing activities was $15.9 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 and included purchases of property and equipment of $13.5 million, payments to acquire\nCompany Y of $9.8 million, purchases of intangible assets of $6.4 million, and payments of contingent consideration related to\nour acquisition of Company X of $3.0 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $91.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and consisted of purchases\nof property and equipment of $41.3 million, purchases of investments of $29.3 million, purchases of intangible assets of $11.2\nmillion and proceeds loaned to a supplier under notes receivable of $10.0 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur use of cash in financing activities declined, as we moved from early paydown of debt to mitigate rising interest rates\nin 2022 to cash conservation in 2023 following the general slowdown in the market environment. Net cash used in financing\nactivities was $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net cash used in financing activities consisted of payment\nof a ticking fee to lenders of $18.3 million associated with the termination of our debt commitment associated with the\nterminated Silicon Motion merger and repayments of minimum tax withholding paid on behalf of employees for restricted stock\nunits of $12.6 million, partially offset by cash inflows from net proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of\nstock options of $4.6 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $240.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net cash used in\nfinancing activities consisted of repayments of debt of $185.0 million, common stock repurchases of $31.5 million, and\nminimum tax withholding paid on behalf of employees for restricted stock units of $28.9 million, partially offset by cash\ninflows from net proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options of $5.0 million.\nWarranties and Indemnifications\nIn connection with the sale of products in the ordinary course of business, we often make representations affirming,\namong other things, that our products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, and agree to indemnify\ncustomers against third-party claims for such infringement. Further, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws require us to\nindemnify our officers and directors against any action that may arise out of their services in that capacity, and we have also\nentered into indemnification agreements with respect to all of our directors and certain controlling persons.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market\nprices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest\nrates.\nForeign Currency Risk\nTo date, our international customer and vendor agreements have been denominated mostly in United States dollars.\nAccordingly, we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and do not enter into foreign currency hedging\ntransactions. The functional currency of certain foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Accordingly, the effects of exchange\nrate fluctuations on the net assets of these foreign subsidiaries’ operations are accounted for as translation gains or losses in\naccumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity. A hypothetical change of 100 basis points in such\nforeign currency exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2023 would result in a change to translation gain in\naccumulated other comprehensive income of approximately $1.0 million.\n72\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to a variable amount of interest on the principal balance of our credit agreements described above and\ncould be adversely impacted by rising interest rates in the future. If LIBOR interest rates had increased by 10% during the\nperiods presented, the rate increase would have resulted in an immaterial increase to interest expense. We currently believe our\noperating cash held primarily for working capital purpose is sufficient to cover our interest obligations, but we are monitoring\nthe impact of rising interest rates on our ability to service our interest and debt obligations, obtain financing, and on our\nbusiness in general.\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements and supplementary data required by this item are included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Report.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in\nour periodic reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the\nrules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and\nprocedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control\nobjectives, and no evaluation of controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of\nfraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit\nrelationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, prior to filing\nthis Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including\nour principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered\nby this Form 10-K. Based on their evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing\nand maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the\nExchange Act. Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based upon\nthat evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,\n2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Grant\nThornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and Grant Thornton LLP has issued a report on our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which is included herein.\n73\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAn evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, to determine whether any change in our internal control over financial\nreporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Exchange\nAct, as amended, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n74\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nMaxLinear, Inc.\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MaxLinear, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, and our\nreport dated January 31, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s\nAnnual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (“Management’s Report”). Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\nthat a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Grant Thornton LLP\nNewport Beach, California\nJanuary 31, 2024\n75\nITEM 9B.

(a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries\n(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income\n(loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related\nnotes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our\nopinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nthe 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (“COSO”), and our report dated January 31, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and\nwe are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRealizability of deferred tax assets\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, management records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when\na judgment is made, that is considered more likely than not, that a tax benefit will not be realized. The ultimate realization of\ndeferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary\ndifferences will become deductible. The Company assesses the need for a valuation allowance by evaluating both positive and\nnegative evidence that may exist.\nWe identified the realizability of deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our determination\nthat the realizability of deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter is that the forecast of future taxable income is an accounting\nestimate subject to a high level of estimation. There is inherent uncertainty and subjectivity related to management’s judgments\nand assumptions regarding the Company’s international tax structure and transfer pricing agreements, determination of the\ntaxable income by jurisdiction and the impacts of the Tax Act on future taxable income, which are complex in nature and\nrequire significant auditor judgment.\n85\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. With the assistance of engagement team members possessing specialized skill\nin income tax matters, our audit procedures related to the realizability of deferred tax assets included the following, among\nothers:\n• Reviewing management’s application of the rules under the Tax Act with a focus on Global Intangible Low-Taxed\nIncome and the ordering rules and its expected impact on estimated future taxable income;\n• Comparing the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities to the underlying financial and tax accounting records;\n• Comparing the forecast of future taxable income to the following:\n◦ Prior year actual results by jurisdiction to evaluate the reasonableness of significant changes contemplated for\nthe following year;\n◦ Forecasts of future information used in other areas, to evaluate completeness and consistency\n• Reviewing the Company’s transfer pricing assumptions, including royalty rates and cost-plus markups, applied by the\nCompany and its non-US subsidiaries; and\n• Testing the design and operating effectiveness of management’s internal controls over the completeness and accuracy\nof the forecast of future taxable income and the proper application of relevant tax law to support the realizability of\ndeferred tax assets.\n/s/ Grant Thornton LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.\nNewport Beach, California\nJanuary

incorporated in Delaware in September 2003. MaxLinear, Inc., together with its directly and\nindirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries, collectively referred to as MaxLinear, or the Company, is a provider of communications\nsystems-on-chip, or SoC, solutions used in broadband, mobile and wireline infrastructure, data center, and industrial and multi-\nmarket applications. MaxLinear is a fabless integrated circuit design company whose products integrate all or substantial\nportions of a high-speed communication system, including radio frequency, or RF, high-performance analog, mixed-signal,\ndigital signal processing, security engines, data compression and networking layers, and power management. MaxLinear’s\ncustomers include electronics distributors, module makers, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and original design\nmanufacturers, or ODMs, who incorporate the Company’s products in a wide range of electronic devices. Examples of such\ndevices include broadband modems compliant with Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications, or DOCSIS, Passive\nOptical Network, or PON, and DSL; Wi-Fi and wireline routers for home networking; radio transceivers and modems for\n4G/5G base-station and backhaul infrastructure; optical transceivers targeting hyperscale data centers; as well as power\nmanagement and interface products used in these and many other markets.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MaxLinear, Inc. and its directly and indirectly wholly-\nowned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica, or GAAP. All intercompany transactions and investments have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe functional currency of certain foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these\nforeign subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date and historical rates for equity. Revenue\nand expense components are translated at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses\nresulting from foreign currency translation are included as a component of stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction\ngains and losses are included in the results of operations, and to date, have not been material.\nUse of Estimates and Significant Risks and Uncertainties\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for its acquisitions. It requires\nthe Company to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, at the acquisition date fair\nvalues. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the acquisition date fair\nvalues of the net assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to\naccurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where\napplicable, its estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which\nmay be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nwith the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values\nof assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nCosts to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or the Company’s internal operations are accounted\nfor as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from\nthe business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair\nvalue in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred.\nFor a given acquisition, the Company may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and\nmay extend its review, evaluation, and adjustment of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in\norder to obtain sufficient information to assess whether the Company includes these contingencies as a part of the fair value\nestimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. A pre-acquisition\n92\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncontingency (non-income tax related) is only recognized as an asset or a liability if: (i) it is probable that an asset existed or a\nliability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (ii) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated.\nSubsequent to the measurement period, changes in estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a\nmaterial effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed, if any, in connection with a business\ncombination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. The Company re-evaluates these items quarterly based upon facts\nand circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to the preliminary estimates being recorded to\ngoodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the end of the measurement period or final determination\nof the estimated value of the tax allowance or contingency, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and\ntax related valuation allowances will affect the income tax provision (benefit) in the consolidated statements of operations and\ncould have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash\nequivalents. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates market value.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and assesses each customer’s credit worthiness. The\nCompany monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is\nbased upon applying an expected credit loss rate to receivables based on the historical loss rate from similar high risk customers\nadjusted for current conditions, including any specific customer collection issues identified, and forecasts of economic\nconditions. Delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is\nremote. The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the activity in this account, including the\ncurrent-period provision for expected credit losses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, were not material.\nInventory\nThe Company assesses the recoverability of its inventory based on assumptions about demand and market conditions.\nForecasted demand is determined based on historical sales and expected future sales. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or\nnet realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis and net\nrealizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion,\ndisposal and transportation. The Company reduces its inventory to the lower of its cost or net realizable value on a part-by-part\nbasis to account for obsolescence or lack of marketability. Reductions are calculated as the difference between the cost of\ninventory and its net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand, market conditions and costs. Once\nestablished, these adjustments are considered permanent and are not revised until the related inventory is sold or disposed of.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued\nexpenses and compensation are considered to be representative of their respective fair values because of the short-term nature\nof these accounts.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from two\nto five years, using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized over the shorter of the\nestimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term.\nProduction Masks\nProduction masks with alternative future uses or discernible future benefits are capitalized and amortized over their\nestimated useful lives of two to five years. To determine if a production mask has alternative future uses or benefits, the\nCompany evaluates risks associated with developing new technologies and capabilities, and the related risks associated with\nentering new markets. Production masks that do not meet the criteria for capitalization are expensed as research and\ndevelopment costs.\n93\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business\ncombinations accounted for under the acquisition method. Intangible assets represent purchased intangible assets including\ndeveloped technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&D, technologies acquired or licensed from other\ncompanies, customer relationships, non-compete covenants, backlog, and trademarks and tradenames. Purchased finite-lived\nintangible assets are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives. Technologies acquired or licensed from other\ncompanies, customer relationships, non-compete covenants, backlog, and trademarks and tradenames are capitalized and\namortized over the lesser of the terms of the agreement, or estimated useful life. The Company capitalizes IPR&D projects\nacquired as part of a business combination. On completion of each project, IPR&D assets are reclassified to developed\ntechnology and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment using either a qualitative assessment, and/or quantitative\nassessment, which is based on comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recorded. The Company tests by reporting unit, goodwill and\nother indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of October 31 each year or more frequently if it believes indicators of\nimpairment exist.\nDuring development, IPR&D is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company reviews indefinite-lived intangible\nassets for impairment using a qualitative assessment, followed by a quantitative assessment, as needed, each year as of\nOctober 31, the date of its annual goodwill impairment review, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the\ncarrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the\ncarrying amount of the asset to its fair value. In certain cases, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method when\nappropriate, and a fair value will be obtained based on analysis over the costs saved by owning the right instead of leasing it.\nOnce an IPR&D project is complete, it becomes a finite-lived intangible asset and is evaluated for impairment both\nimmediately prior to its change in classification and thereafter in accordance with the Company’s policy for long-lived assets.\nThe Company regularly reviews the carrying amount of its long-lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization, as\nwell as the useful lives, to determine whether indicators of impairment may exist which warrant adjustments to carrying values\nor estimated useful lives. An impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash\nflows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Should impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on\nthe excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset’s fair value.\nDuring the years 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company recorded impairment of intangible assets of $2.4 million, $2.8\nmillion and $0, respectively. Refer to Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Note 5 for more information.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenue is primarily generated from sales of the Company’s integrated circuits to electronics\ndistributors, module makers, OEMs, and ODMs under individual customer purchase orders, some of which have underlying\nmaster sales agreements that specify terms governing the product sales. The Company recognizes such revenue at the point in\ntime when control of the products is transferred to the customer at the estimated net consideration for which collection is\nprobable, taking into account the customer’s rights to price protection, other pricing credits, unit rebates, and rights to return\nunsold product. Transfer of control occurs either when products are shipped to or received by the distributor or direct customer,\nbased on the terms of the specific agreement with the customer, if the Company has a present right to payment and transfer of\nlegal title and the risks and rewards of ownership to the customer has occurred. For most of the Company's product sales,\ntransfer of control occurs upon shipment to the distributor or direct customer. In assessing whether collection of consideration\nfrom a customer is probable, the Company considers the customer’s ability and intention to pay that amount of consideration\nwhen it is due. Payment of invoices is due as specified in the underlying customer agreement, typically 30 days from the\ninvoice date, which occurs on the date of transfer of control of the products to the customer. Since payment terms are less than a\nyear, the Company has elected the practical expedient and does not assess whether a customer contract has a significant\nfinancing component.\nA five-step approach is applied in the recognition of revenue: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the\nperformance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance\n94\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nobligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Customer purchase\norders plus the underlying master sales agreements are considered to be contracts with the customer for purposes of applying\nthe five-step approach.\nPricing adjustments and estimates of returns under contractual stock rotation rights are treated as variable consideration\nfor purposes of determining the transaction price, and are estimated at the time control transfers using the expected value\nmethod based on the Company’s analysis of actual price adjustment claims by distributors and historical product return rates,\nand then reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company also considers whether any variable consideration is\nconstrained, since such amounts for which it is probable that a significant reversal will occur when the contingency is\nsubsequently resolved are required to be excluded from revenues. Price adjustments are finalized at the time the products are\nsold through to the end customer and the distributor or end customer submits a claim to reduce the sale price to a pre-approved\nnet price. Stock rotation allowances are capped at a fixed percentage of the Company’s sales to a distributor for a period of\ntime, up to six months, as specified in the individual distributor contract. If the Company’s current estimates of such credits and\nrights are materially inaccurate, it may result in adjustments that affect future revenues and gross profits. Returns under the\nCompany’s general assurance warranty of products for a period of one to three years have not been material and warranty-\nrelated services are not considered a separate performance obligation under the customer contracts. Most of the Company’s\ncustomers resell the Company’s product as part of their product and thus are tax-exempt; however, to the extent the Company\ncollects and remits taxes on product sales from customers, it has elected to exclude from the measurement of transaction price\nsuch taxes.\nEach distinct promise to transfer products is considered to be an identified performance obligation for which revenue is\nrecognized upon transfer of control of the products to the customer. Although customers may place orders for products to be\ndelivered on multiple dates that may be in different quarterly reporting periods, all of the orders are scheduled within one year\nfrom the order date. The Company has opted to not disclose the portion of revenues allocated to partially unsatisfied\nperformance obligations, which represent products to be shipped within 12 months under open customer purchase orders, at the\nend of the current reporting period. The Company has also elected to record sales commissions when incurred, as the period\nover which the sales commission asset that would have been recognized is less than one year.\nCustomer contract liabilities consist primarily of obligations to deliver rebates to customers in the form of units of\nproducts which are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Other\nobligations to customers, which are included in accrued price protection liability in the consolidated balance sheets, consist of\nestimates of price protection rights offered to the Company’s end customer on products sold by the Company to the end\ncustomer’s contract manufacturer at a standard price that are later incorporated into the end customers’ product. The\nCompany’s price adjustments included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities are discounts and rebates expected to be\nclaimed by the Company’s distributors upon sell-through of the products to their customers, which are initially sold by the\nCompany to the distributors at a standard price. Also included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities are amounts\nexpected to be returned by distributors under stock rotation rights. The Company also records a right of return asset, consisting\nof amounts representing the products the Company expects to receive from customers in returns, which is included in inventory\nin the consolidated balance sheets, and is typically settled within six months of transfer of control to the customer, or the period\nover which stock rotation rights are based. Upon lapse of the time period for stock rotations, or the contractual end to price\nprotection and rebate programs, which is approximately one to two years, and when the Company believes unclaimed amounts\nare no longer subject to payment and will not be paid, any remaining asset or liability is derecognized by an offsetting entry to\ncost of net revenue and net revenue. For additional disclosures regarding contract liabilities and other obligations to customers,\nsee Note 12.\nThe Company assesses customer accounts receivable and contract assets for impairment in accordance with\nASC 310-10-35.\nWarranty\nThe Company generally provides a warranty on its products for a period of one to three years. The Company makes\nestimates of product return rates and expected costs to replace the products under warranty at the time revenue is recognized\nbased on historical warranty experience and any known product warranty issues. If actual return rates and/or replacement costs\ndiffer significantly from these estimates, adjustments to recognize additional warranty expenses in cost of net revenue may be\nrequired in future periods. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has warranty reserves of $0.3 million and\n$0.5 million, respectively, based on the Company’s estimates.\n95\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSegment Information\nThe Company operates under one segment as it has developed, marketed and sold primarily only one class of similar\nproducts, radio-frequency, high-performance analog and mixed-signal communications system-on-chip solutions for the\nconnected home, wired and wireless infrastructure markets and industrial and multi-market applications.\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available\nthat is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate\nresources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer. The\nCompany’s Chief Executive Officer reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating\nresources and evaluating financial performance. The Company has one business activity and there are no segment managers\nwho are held accountable for operations, operating results and plans for products or components below the consolidated unit\nlevel. Accordingly, the Company reports under a single operating segment.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity incentive awards, including\nrestricted stock units, employee stock purchase rights and stock options based on the grant date fair value of the award. The\nCompany calculates the fair value of restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units based on the fair market\nvalue of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense is then determined based on the\nnumber of restricted stock units that are expected to vest; for performance-based restricted stock units, this is the number of\nunits that are expected to vest during the performance period if it is probable that the Company will achieve the performance\nmetrics specified in the underlying award agreement. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the fair\nvalue of stock options and employee stock purchase rights granted to employees. Stock-based compensation expense is\nrecognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, which is\nusually the vesting period. The Company recognizes compensation expense over the vesting period using the straight-line\nmethod and classifies these amounts in the consolidated statements of operations based on the department to which the related\nemployee reports.\nResearch and Development\nCosts incurred in connection with the development of the Company’s technology and future products are charged to\nresearch and development expense as incurred. From time to time, the Company enters into contracts for jointly funded\nresearch and development projects to develop technology that may be commercialized into a product in the future. The\nCompany also obtains research and development funding grants from governments in certain jurisdictions in which it operates.\nBoth of these types of income are reflected as a credit to research and development expense when such income has been earned\nand any contingencies associated with retaining such income have been resolved. During the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, the Company recognized income from jointly funded research and development projects of $0, $23.3 million,\nand $0, respectively. While the Company retains ownership and rights to the underlying technology developed under the joint\ndevelopment projects, the Company may be required to repay all or a portion of the funds provided by the other parties under\ncertain conditions, and defers such funds as liabilities until the repayment conditions have been resolved (Note 15).\nLeases\nThe Company’s leases primarily consist of facility leases which are classified as operating leases. The Company assesses\nwhether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. The Company recognizes a lease liability to make contractual payments\nunder all leases with terms greater than twelve months and a corresponding right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the\nunderlying asset for the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments over the\nlease term using the collateralized incremental borrowing rate when the implicit rate is unknown. Options to extend or terminate\na lease are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such an option. The right-of-\nuse asset is initially measured as the contractual lease liability plus any initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments made,\nless any lease incentives. Upon adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the carrying value of lease-related restructuring\nliabilities for certain restructured leases existing at that date was offset against the related right-of-use assets. Lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nUpon adoption of ASC 842, the Company elected certain practical expedients and accordingly has (1) carried forward its\nprior assessments of (a) whether existing contracts on the January 1, 2019 adoption date contain leases, (b) classification of\nleases as operating or financing and (c) initial direct costs for existing leases and (2) considered hindsight in determining the\n96\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nlease term and assessing impairment of the right-of-use-asset. In addition, the Company used a portfolio approach for its facility\nleases when making judgments and estimates, such as the discount rate.\nLeased right-of-use assets are subject to impairment testing as a long-lived asset at the asset-group level. The Company\nmonitors its long-lived assets for indicators of impairment. As the Company’s leased right-of-use assets primarily relate to\nfacility leases, early abandonment of all or part of a facility as part of a restructuring plan is typically an indicator of\nimpairment. If impairment indicators are present, the Company tests whether the carrying amount of the leased right-of-use\nasset is recoverable including consideration of sublease income, and if not recoverable, measures impairment loss for the right-\nof-use asset or asset group.\nPension and Other Defined Benefit Retirement Obligations\nThe costs of pension and certain other defined benefit employee retirement benefits are required to be recognized based\nupon actuarial valuations. The related net retirement benefit obligation is recognized as the excess of the projected benefit\nobligation over the fair value of the plan assets. In measuring the retirement benefit obligation, the discount rate, expected long-\nterm rate of return on plan assets, and long-term rate of salary increase are the most significant assumptions. Retirement benefit\ncosts primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the retirement benefit obligation.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company provides for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under\nthis approach, deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes are presented net as noncurrent. The provision for income taxes generally\nrepresents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes\nresult from the differences between the financial and tax bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for\nchanges in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets\nwhen a judgment is made that is considered more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. A decision to record a\nvaluation allowance results in an increase in income tax expense or a decrease in income tax benefit. If the valuation allowance\nis released in a future period, income tax expense will be reduced accordingly.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations.\nThe impact of an uncertain income tax position is recognized at the largest amount that is “more likely than not” to be sustained\nupon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50%\nlikelihood of being sustained. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to\nexpense would result.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some\nportion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the\ngeneration of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company\ncontinually assesses the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative\nevidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated\nstatement of operations for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was enacted into U.S. tax law. In 2018, the Company\nmade an accounting policy election to treat Global Intangible Low Taxed Income in accordance with the Tax Act as a period\ncost.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business entity during a period from\ntransactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes certain\nchanges in equity that are excluded from net income (loss), net of tax, such as foreign currency translation gains and losses and\nchanges in fair value of projected benefit obligations for defined benefit plans.\nLitigation and Settlement Costs\nLegal costs are expensed as incurred. The Company is involved in disputes, litigation and other legal actions in the\nordinary course of business. The Company continually evaluates uncertainties associated with litigation and records a charge\nequal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met: (i)\n97\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ninformation available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or\na liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract\nAssets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, to provide specific guidance to eliminate diversity in practice\non how to recognize and measure acquired contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts from customers in a\nbusiness combination consistent with revenue contracts with customers not acquired in an acquisition. The amendments in this\nupdate provide that the acquirer should consider the terms of the acquired contracts, such as timing of payment, identify each\nperformance obligation in the contracts, and allocate the total transaction price to each identified performance obligation on a\nrelative standalone selling price basis as of contract inception (that is, the date the acquiree entered into the contracts) or\ncontract modification to determine what should be recorded at the acquisition date. These amendments were effective for the\nCompany in 2023. The impact of the adoption of the amendments in this update was not material to the Company’s\nconsolidated financial position and results of operations, since there were no customer contracts assumed in a business\ncombination in 2023.\nRecently Issued Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures, to require enhanced income tax disclosures to provide information to assess how an entity’s operations and related\ntax risks, tax planning, and operational opportunities affect its tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. The amendments in\nthis update provide that a business entity disclose (1) a tabular income tax rate reconciliation, using both percentages and\namounts, (2) separate disclosure of any individual reconciling items that are equal to or greater than 5% of the amount\ncomputed by multiplying the income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes by the applicable statutory income\ntax rate, and disaggregation of certain items that are significant and (3) amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received)\ndisaggregated by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, including separate disclosure of any individual jurisdictions greater\nthan 5% of total income taxes paid. These amendments are effective for the Company for annual periods in 2025, applied\nprospectively, with early adoption and retrospective application permitted. The Company intends to adopt the amendments in\nthis update prospectively in 2025. The impact of the adoption of the amendments in this update is not expected to be material to\nthe Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations, since the amendments require only enhancement of\nexisting income tax disclosures in the footnotes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures, to require enhanced disclosures that include reportable segment expenses. The amendments in this update\nprovide that a business entity disclose significant segment expenses, segment profit or loss (after significant segment expenses),\nand allows reporting of additional measures of a segments profit or loss if used in assessing segment performance. Such\ndisclosures apply to entities with a single reportable segment. These amendments are effective for the Company for annual\nperiods in 2024 and interim periods in 2025, retrospectively to all prior periods using the significant segment expense\ncategories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The impact of the adoption of the amendments in this update is not\nexpected to be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations, since the requirements\nimpact only segment reporting disclosures in the footnotes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n2. Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic earnings per share, or EPS, is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of\ncommon shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted EPS is computed by\ndividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period and the weighted-\naverage number of dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock method.\nFor purposes of this calculation, common stock options and restricted stock units are considered to be common stock\nequivalents and are only included in the calculation of diluted EPS when their effect is dilutive. In periods in which the\nCompany has a net loss, dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.\n98\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe table below presents the computation of basic and diluted EPS:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) $ (73,147) $ 125,040 $ 41,969\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding—basic 80,719 78,039 76,037\nDilutive common stock equivalents — 2,813 3,642\nWeighted average common shares outstanding—diluted 80,719 80,852 79,679\nNet income (loss) per share:\nBasic $ (0.91) $ 1.60 $ 0.55\nDiluted $ (0.91) $ 1.55 $ 0.53\nFor each of the years ended December 31,2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company excluded common stock equivalents for\noutstanding stock-based awards, which represented potentially dilutive securities of 4.9 million for 2023, 1.8 million for 2022,\nand 0.07 million for 2021 from the calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share due to their anti-dilutive nature.\n3. Business Combinations\nTerminated Silicon Motion Merger\nOn May 5, 2022, MaxLinear entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Silicon\nMotion Technology Corporation, or Silicon Motion, an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of\nthe Cayman Islands, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, MaxLinear agreed\nto acquire Silicon Motion pursuant to a statutory merger, under the laws of the Cayman Islands, of Shark Merger Sub, a wholly-\nowned subsidiary of MaxLinear, with and into Silicon Motion, with Silicon Motion surviving the merger as a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of MaxLinear. Silicon Motion is a provider of NAND flash controllers for solid state drives, or SSDs, and other solid\nstate storage devices.\nOn July 26, 2023,MaxLinear terminated the Merger Agreement and notified Silicon Motion that MaxLinear was\nrelieved of its obligations to close because, among other reasons, (i) certain conditions to closing set forth in the Merger\nAgreement were not satisfied and were incapable of being satisfied, (ii) Silicon Motion had suffered a Material Adverse Effect\nthat was continuing, (iii) Silicon Motion was in material breach of representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in the\nMerger Agreement that gave rise to the right of the Company to terminate, and (iv) in any event, the First Extended Outside\nDate had passed and was not automatically extended because certain conditions in Article 6 of the Merger Agreement were not\nsatisfied or waived as of May 5, 2023. For these same reasons, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, MaxLinear was not\nrequired to pay a break-up fee or other fee to Silicon Motion as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement. Undefined\ncapitalized terms in this paragraph have the same meaning as in the Merger Agreement. On August 16, 2023, Silicon Motion\ndelivered to MaxLinear a notice, which Silicon Motion publicly disclosed, that it was purporting to terminate the Merger\nAgreement and that Silicon Motion would be commencing an arbitration to seek damages from MaxLinear arising from\nMaxLinear's alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement.\nOn October 5, 2023, Silicon Motion filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre\nalleging that MaxLinear breached the Merger Agreement. See Note 15 for more information on legal matters related to the\ntermination of the Merger Agreement.\nThe second amended and restated commitment letter dated October 24, 2022 with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., or Wells\nFargo Bank, and other lenders, and related financing commitments for the previously pending (now terminated) merger were\nalso terminated upon termination of the Merger Agreement. As a result of the termination of the financing, the Company was\nrequired to pay to Wells Fargo Bank a ticking fee of $18.3 million, which is included in other income (expense), net in the year\nended December 31, 2023.\n99\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAcquisition of Company Y\nOn January 17, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of a business, or Company Y, pursuant to a Purchase and\nSale Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement. The transaction consideration included $9.8 million in cash. In addition, Company\nY stockholders may receive up to an additional $2.6 million in potential contingent consideration, subject to the acquired\nbusiness satisfying certain personnel objectives by June 17, 2024.\nCompany Y is headquartered in Bangalore, India and operates as a provider of engineering design services.\nAcquisition Consideration\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of purchase price consideration to acquire Company Y (in thousands):\nDescription Amount\nFair value of purchase consideration:\nCash $ 9,824\nContingent consideration(1) 2,600\nTotal purchase price $ 12,424\n_________________\n(1) The fair value of contingent consideration is based on applying the Monte Carlo simulation method to forecast achievement\nunder various contingent consideration events which may result in up to $2.6 million in payments subject to the acquired\nbusiness’s satisfying certain financial and personnel objectives by June 17, 2024 under the Purchase Agreement. Key inputs in\nthe valuation include forecasted revenue, revenue volatility and discount rate. Underlying forecast mathematics were based on\nGeometric Brownian Motion in a risk-neutral framework and discounted back to the applicable period in which the\naccumulative thresholds were achieved at discount rates commensurate with the risk and expected payout term of the contingent\nconsideration.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nAn allocation of purchase price as of the January 17, 2023 acquisition closing date based upon an estimate of the fair\nvalue of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed by the Company in the acquisition primarily includes $2.0 million in net\noperating liabilities, with $11.8 million in goodwill.\nAssumptions in the Allocations of Purchase Price\nManagement prepared the purchase price allocations for Company Y and in doing so considered or relied in part upon\nreports of a third party valuation expert to calculate the fair value of certain acquired assets, which primarily included an\nacquired workforce and contingent consideration. Certain stockholders that are employees of Company Y were not required to\nremain employed in order to receive the contingent consideration; accordingly, the fair value of the contingent consideration\nwas accounted for as a portion of the purchase consideration.\nEstimates of fair value require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The goodwill recognized is\nattributable primarily to the acquired workforce. Certain liabilities included in the purchase price allocations are based on\nmanagement’s best estimates of the amounts to be paid or settled and based on information available at the time the purchase\nprice allocations were prepared.\nGoodwill recorded in connection with Company Y was $11.8 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company does not\nexpect to deduct any of the acquired goodwill for tax purposes.\n4. Restructuring Activity\nFrom time to time, the Company approves and implements restructuring plans as a result of internal resource alignment\nand cost saving measures. Such restructuring plans may include terminating employees, vacating certain leased facilities, and\ncancellation of contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into plans of restructuring to reduce\nits workforce.\n100\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the activity related to the restructuring plans, which is included in restructuring charges in\nthe consolidated statements of operations:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nEmployee separation expenses $ 17,897 $ 1,795 $ 1,273\nLease related charges 42 462 608\nOther 1,847 8 323\n$ 19,786 $ 2,265 $ 2,204\nRestructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2023 included $17.9 million in employee severance-related\ncharges associated with reductions in the workforce and $1.8 million in other charges related to abandonment of contracts used\nby the terminated employees.\nLease related charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 included the impairment of leased right-of-use assets of\n$0.5 million related to exiting a redundant facility.\nLease related charges for the year ended December 31, 2021 included the impairment of leased right-of-use assets and\nleasehold improvements of $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nThe following table presents a roll-forward of the Company’s restructuring liability for the years endedDecember 31,\n2023 and 2022.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill arises from the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and represents the excess of the\npurchase price over the fair value of the net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired. The fair values of net\ntangible assets and intangible assets acquired are based upon preliminary valuations and the Company’s estimates and\nassumptions are subject to change within the measurement period (potentially up to one year from the acquisition date).\n101\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nBeginning balance $ 306,739 $ 306,668\nAcquisitions (Note 3) 11,849 71\nEnding balance $ 318,588 $ 306,739\nThe Company performs an annual goodwill impairment assessment on October 31st each year, using a quantitative\nassessment comparing the fair value of each reporting unit, which the Company has determined to be the entity itself, with its\ncarrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is\nrecorded. As a result of the Company’s impairment assessment, no goodwill impairment was recognized as of October 31,\n2023.\nIn addition to its annual review, the Company performs a test of impairment when indicators of impairment are present.\nDuring the years ended December 31,2023, 2022, and 2021, there were no indications of impairment of the Company’s\ngoodwill balances.\nAcquired Intangibles\nFinite-lived Intangible Assets\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s finite-lived intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions and other\npurchases, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nWeighted\nAverage Gross Gross\nUseful Life Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying\n(in Years) Amount Amortization Amount Value Amortization Amount\n(in thousands)\nLicensed technology 7.0 $ 20,133 $ (1,431) $ 18,702 $ 21,764 $ (580) $ 21,184\nDeveloped technology 7.0 311,261 (263,635) 47,626 311,261 (228,532) 82,729\nTrademarks and trade names 6.2 14,800 (14,276) 524 14,800 (13,461) 1,339\nCustomer relationships 5.0 128,800 (126,347) 2,453 128,800 (124,807) 3,993\nBacklog 5.3 500 (500) — 500 (429) 71\nPatents 7.0 4,780 (455) 4,325 — — —\n6.1 $ 480,274 $ (406,644) $ 73,630 $ 477,125 $ (367,809) $ 109,316\nThe following table sets forth amortization expense associated with finite-lived intangible assets, which is included in the\nconsolidated statements of operations as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nCost of net revenue $ 35,952 $ 39,638 $ 43,078\nResearch and development 2 4 4\nSelling, general and administrative 2,881 11,955 23,625\n$ 38,835 $ 51,597 $ 66,707\nAmortization of finite-lived intangible assets in cost of net revenue in the consolidated statements of operations results\nprimarily from acquired developed technology.\n102\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table sets forth the activity related to finite-lived intangible assets:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nBeginning balance $ 109,316 $ 149,940\nAdditions 6,355 11,184\nTransfers to developed technology from IPR&D — 2,600\nAmortization (38,835) (51,597)\nImpairment losses (2,438) (2,811)\nEnding balance $ 73,630 $ 109,316\nThe Company regularly reviews the carrying amount of its long-lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization, as\nwell as the related useful lives, to determine whether indicators of impairment may exist that warrant adjustments to carrying\nvalues or estimated useful lives. An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash\nflows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Should impairment exist, the impairment loss is measured based on the\nexcess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset’s fair value.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized impairment losses related to finite-lived\nintangible assets of$2.4 million and $2.8 million respectively, which was attributable to certain acquired licensed technology.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, no impairment losses related to finite-lived intangible assets were recognized.\nThe following table presents future amortization of the Company’s finite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2023:\nAmount\n(in thousands)\n2024 $ 24,120\n2025 14,862\n2026 13,753\n2027 9,905\n2028 4,567\nThereafter 6,423\nTotal $ 73,630\n6.Financial Instruments\nThe composition of financial instruments is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2022\nNet Unrealized\nCost Gains Losses Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nAssets\nMarketable equity investments $ 20,005 $ — $ (1,476) $ 18,529\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(in thousands)\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration (Note 3) $ 2,462 $ 2,941\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company did not hold any marketable equity investments.

Prior to the sale, unrealized gains and losses on such investments representing stock\n103\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nprice fluctuations in the underlying securities held were recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of\noperations.\nThe Company evaluated securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Impairment was evaluated\nconsidering numerous factors, and their relative significance varied depending on the situation. Factors considered include the\nlength of time and extent to which fair value was less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the\nissuer; including changes in the financial condition of any underlying collateral of the security; any downgrades of the security\nby analysts or rating agencies; nonpayment of any scheduled interest, or the reduction or elimination of dividends; as well as\nour intent and ability to hold the security in order to allow for an anticipated recovery in fair value.\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial instruments is the amount that would be received in an asset sale or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between unaffiliated market participants and is recorded using a hierarchical\ndisclosure framework based upon the level of subjectivity of the inputs used in measuring assets and liabilities. The levels are\ndescribed below:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available.\nThe Company classifies its financial instruments within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy on the basis of\nvaluations using quoted market prices or alternate pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs, respectively.\nThe marketable equity investments held by the Company were valued on the basis of quoted market prices and are therefore\nclassified as Level 1.\nThe contingent consideration liability as of December 31, 2023 is associated with the Company’s acquisition of\nCompany Y in January 2023 (Note 3) and the contingent consideration liability as of December 31, 2022 is associated with the\nCompany’s acquisition of Company X. The contingent consideration liability is classified as a Level 3 financial instrument. The\ncontingent consideration as it relates to Company X was subject to the acquired business’s satisfaction of certain financial and\npersonnel objectives by March 31, 2023, while the contingent consideration as it relates to Company Y is subject to the\nacquired business’s satisfaction of certain personnel objectives by June 17, 2024. The financial and personnel objectives of\nCompany X were achieved by March 31, 2023 and contingent consideration for Company X of $3.0 million was paid during\nthe year ended December 2023. The fair value of the contingent consideration is based on (1) applying the Monte Carlo\nsimulation method, with underlying forecast mathematics based on Geometric Brownian motion in a risk-neutral framework, to\nforecast achievement of the acquired business’ financial objectives under various possible contingent consideration events and\n(2) a probability based methodology using management’s inputs and assumptions to forecast achievement of the acquired\nbusiness’ personnel objectives which included an assumption of total payments up to $3.0 million to Company X and an\nassumption of total payments up to $2.6 million to Company Y. Key inputs in the valuation include forecasted revenue, revenue\nvolatility, discount rate and discount term as it relates to the financial objectives and probability of achievement, discount term\nand discount rate as it relates to the personnel objectives.\nThe following summarizes the level in the fair value hierarchy for each financial instrument:\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2023\nQuoted Prices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nBalance at Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\nDecember 31, 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\n(in thousands)\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration $ 2,462 $ — $ — $ 2,462\n104\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair Value Measurements at December 31, 2022\nQuoted Prices Significant\nin Active Other Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nBalance at Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\nDecember 31, 2022 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\n(in thousands)\nAssets\nMarketable equity securities $ 18,529 $ 18,529 $ — $ —\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration $ 2,941 $ — $ — $ 2,941\nThe following summarizes the activity in Level 3 financial instruments:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nContingent consideration\nBeginning balance $ 2,941 $ 2,700\nAcquisitions(1)(Note 3) 2,200 —\nPayments (3,000) —\nAccretion of discount(1) 321 241\nEnding balance $ 2,462 $ 2,941\n____________________\n(1) These changes to the balance associated with the estimated fair value of contingent consideration for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 were due to the addition of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of Company Y and\naccretion of discounts on contingent consideration.\nThere were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 fair value hierarchy categories of financial instruments in\nthe years ended December 31,2023, 2022 and 2021.\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nSome of the Company’s financial instruments are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or\nshort-term nature or by election on investments in privately-held entities as described below. Such financial assets and financial\nliabilities include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, net receivables, investments in privately-held entities, certain other\nassets, accounts payable, accrued price protection liability, accrued expenses, accrued compensation costs, and other current\nliabilities.\nThe Company’s long-term debt is not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, but is measured at fair value for\ndisclosure purposes (Note 8).\nIncluded in other long-term assets are investments in privately held entities of $11.8 million and $11.8 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Company does not have the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence or control over such entity and has accounted for the investments as financial instruments. Given that fair values for\nsuch investments are not readily determinable, the Company is electing to measure these investments at cost, less any\nimpairment, and adjust the carrying value to fair value if any observable price changes for similar investments in the same\nentity are identified.\n105\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n7.

The federal and state tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire\nin 2025 and 2030, and foreign tax loss will not expire, unless previously utilized.\n114\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had federal, state and foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $29.6\nmillion, $106.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively. The federal, state and foreign tax credit carryforwards will begin to\nexpire in 2024, 2030 and 2026, respectively, unless previously utilized. The Company also has foreign incentive deductions of\napproximately $7.2 million that do not expire.\nThe Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred taxes are\ndetermined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates\nexpected to be in effect during the years in which the temporary differences reverse. The Company records a valuation\nallowance to reduce its deferred taxes to the amount it believes is more likely than not to be realized. In making such\ndetermination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence quarterly, including scheduled reversals of\ndeferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Forming a\nconclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in\nrecent years. Based upon the Company’s review of all positive and negative evidence, the Company continues to have a\nvaluation allowance on its state deferred tax assets, certain of its federal deferred tax assets, and certain foreign deferred tax\nassets in jurisdictions where the Company has cumulative losses or otherwise is not expected to utilize certain tax attributes.\nThe Company does not incur expense or benefit in certain tax-free jurisdictions in which it operates.\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision of $9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, an income tax\nprovision of $49.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, and an income tax provision of $5.9 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\nThe difference between the Company’s effective tax rate and the 21.0% United States federal statutory rate for the year\nended December 31, 2023 primarily related to the mix of pre-tax income among jurisdictions, permanent tax items including\ntax credits and a tax on global intangible low-taxed income, stock based compensation, excess tax benefits related to stock-\nbased compensation, and release of uncertain tax positions under ASC 740-10. The permanent tax item related to global\nintangible low-taxed income also reflects recent legislative changes requiring the capitalization of research and experimentation\ncosts, as well as limitations on the creditability of certain foreign income taxes.\nThe difference between our effective tax rate and the 21.0% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31,\n2022 primarily related to the mix of pre-tax income among jurisdictions, permanent tax items including a tax on global\nintangible low-taxed income, stock based compensation, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, release of\nuncertain tax positions under ASC 740-10, and release of the valuation allowance on certain federal research and development\ncredits. The permanent tax item related to global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI, also reflects recent legislative changes\nrequiring the capitalization of research and experimentation costs, as well as limitations on the creditability of certain foreign\nincome taxes.\nThe difference between our effective tax rate and the 21.0% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 resulted primarily from a tax on GILTI, and non-deductible foreign stock-based compensation, offset by a\nbenefit related to research and development tax credits, foreign earnings taxed at rates other than the federal statutory rate and\nthe effect of a release of valuation allowance against certain Singapore deferred tax assets pertaining to usage of net operating\nlosses.\nIncome tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously\nfailed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that\nthreshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are de-recognized\nin the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. The Company records potential penalties and\ninterest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within the consolidated statements of operations as income tax expense.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits totaled $68.6 million, $58.5 million of which, if\nrecognized at a time when the valuation allowance no longer exists, would affect the effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax\nbenefits are not expected to materially change in next 12 months. At December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued\napproximately $0.3 million of interest and penalties. The total amounts of interest and penalties recognized for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were not material.\n115\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the changes to the unrecognized tax benefits during 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n(in thousands)\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 $ 63,765\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 3,366\nAdditions related to acquisitions 241\nDecreases based on tax positions of prior year (1,688)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 65,684\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 3,431\nDecreases based on tax positions of prior year (1,981)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 67,134\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 3,032\nDecreases based on tax positions of prior year (1,528)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 68,638\nThe Company is subject to federal and state income tax in the United States and is also subject to income tax in certain\nother foreign tax jurisdictions. At December 31, 2023, the statutes of limitations for the assessment of federal, state, and foreign\nincome taxes are closed for the years before 2020, 2019, and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company’s subsidiary in Singapore operates under certain tax incentives in Singapore, which are generally effective\nthrough March 2027, and are conditional upon meeting certain employment and investment thresholds in Singapore. Under the\nincentives, qualifying income derived from certain sales of the Company’s integrated circuits is taxed at a concessionary rate\nover the incentive period, and there are reduced Singapore withholding taxes on certain intercompany royalties during the\nincentive period. The Company recorded a tax provision in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 at the incentive rate.\nDue to the valuation allowance release in 2021 and the Company’s use of loss carryforwards, the Company recorded a tax\nbenefit in the year ended December 31, 2021 at the incentive rate, net of any expected tax payable. Without the incentive rate,\ndeferred taxes and the valuation allowance release would have provided an overall tax benefit, net of any current period\npayable.\n11. Concentration of Credit Risk, Significant Customers and Geographic Information\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash\nand cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Collateral is generally not required for customer receivables. The Company limits\nits exposure to credit loss by placing its cash with high credit quality financial institutions. At times, such deposits may be in\nexcess of insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents.\nSignificant Customers\nThe Company markets its products and services to manufacturers of a wide range of electronic devices (Note 1). The\nCompany sells its products both directly to end-customers and through third-party distributors, both of which are referred to as\nthe Company’s customers (Note 12). The Company makes periodic evaluations of the credit worthiness of its customers.\nCustomers comprising 10% or greater of net revenues for each of the periods presented are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nPercentage of total net revenue\nCustomer A * 21 % 15 %\nCustomer B 10 % 10 % 11 %\n____________________________\n* Represents less than 10% of the net revenues for the period presented.\n116\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents balances that are 10% or greater of accounts receivable, based on the Company’s billings to\nits customers.\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nPercentage of gross accounts receivable\nCustomer C 33 % 12 %\nCustomer D 24 % 28 %\nCustomer E * 11 %\n____________________________\n* Represents less than 10% of the gross accounts receivable as of the respective period end.\nSignificant Suppliers\nSuppliers comprising greater than 10% or greater of total inventory purchases are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nVendor A 23 % 25 % 38 %\nVendor B 23 % 26 % 22 %\nVendor C 10 % 12 % 12 %\nGeographic Information\nThe Company’s consolidated net revenues by geographic area based on ship-to location are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n% of total % of total % of total\nnet net net\nAmount revenue Amount revenue Amount revenue\nAsia $ 521,433 75 % $ 915,024 82 % $ 736,808 83 %\nEurope 124,556 18 % 142,494 13 % 106,428 12 %\nUnited States 36,955 5 % 40,077 4 % 35,978 4 %\nRest of world 10,319 2 % 22,657 2 % 13,184 1 %\nTotal $ 693,263 100 % $ 1,120,252 100 % $ 892,398 100 %\nThe products shipped to individual countries or territories representing greater than 10% of net revenue for each of the\nperiods presented are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nPercentage of total net revenue\nHong Kong 37 % 43 % 40 %\nChina 11 % 16 % 12 %\nVietnam * * 13 %\n____________________________\n* Represents less than 10% of total net revenue for the respective period.\nThe determination of which country a particular sale is allocated to is based on the destination of the product shipment.\nNo other individual country accounted for more than 10% of net revenue during these periods.

Revenue recognized in each of the years ended December 31,2023, 2022, and 2021 that was included in the\ncontract liability balance as of the beginning of each of those respective periods was immaterial.\nThere were no material changes in the contract liabilities balance during the years ended December 31,2023, 2022, and\n2021, respectively.\nObligations to Customers for Price Adjustments and Returns and Assets for Right-of-Returns\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, obligations to customers consisting of estimates of price protection\nrights offered to the Company’s end customers totaled $71.7 million and $113.3 million, respectively, and are included in\naccrued price protection liability in the consolidated balance sheets. For activity in this account, including amounts included in\nnet revenue, refer to Note 7. Other obligations to customers representing estimates of price adjustments to be claimed by\ndistributors upon sell-through of their inventory to their end customer and estimates of stock rotation returns to be claimed by\ndistributors on products sold as of December 31, 2023 were $54.8 million and $0.3 million, respectively, and as of\nDecember 31, 2022 were $52.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (Note 7).

Right of return assets are included in inventory in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no impairment losses recorded on customer accounts\nreceivable.\n13. Leases\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease arrangements primarily consist of office leases expiring in various years through 2029. These leases have\noriginal terms of approximately 2 to 8 years and some contain options to extend the lease up to 5 years or terminate the lease,\nwhich are included in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when the Company is reasonably certain it will renew the\nunderlying leases. Since the implicit rate of such leases is unknown and the Company is not reasonably certain to renew its\nleases, the Company has elected to apply a collateralized incremental borrowing rate to facility leases on the original lease term\nin calculating the present value of future lease payments. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the weighted\naverage discount rate for operating leases was 4.6% and 3.4%, respectively, and the weighted average remaining lease term for\noperating leases was 3.9 years and 3.9 years, respectively, as of the end of each of these periods.\nThe table below presents aggregate future minimum payments due under leases, reconciled to total lease liabilities\nincluded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023:\nOperating Leases\n(in thousands)\n2024 $ 10,769\n2025 10,726\n2026 8,104\n2027 5,766\n2028 2,479\nThereafter 1,596\nTotal minimum payments 39,440\nLess: imputed interest (4,065)\nTotal lease liabilities 35,375\nLess: short-term lease liabilities (9,132)\nLong-term lease liabilities $ 26,243\nOperating lease cost was $10.8 million, $10.4 million, and $9.4 million for the years ended December 31,2023, 2022,\nand 2021, respectively.\nShort-term lease costs for each of the years ended December 31,2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, were not material.\nThere were $12.3 million, $12.0 million, and $13.2 million of right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities\nfor theyears ended December 31,2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n14. Employee Retirement Plans\nDefined Contribution Plan\nThe Company has a 401(k) defined contribution retirement plan (the 401(k) Plan) covering all eligible employees.\nParticipants may voluntarily contribute on a pre-tax basis an amount not to exceed a maximum contribution amount pursuant to\nSection 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company is not required to contribute, nor has it contributed, to the 401(k)\nPlan for any of the periods presented.\n119\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPension and Other Defined Benefit Retirement Obligations\nThe Company maintains certain defined benefit retirement plans, including a pension plan, in foreign jurisdictions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company paid approximately $3.2 million to a third party life insurance and\npension provider to fund and administer future benefit payments for substantially all of the employees in one of the Company’s\ndefined benefit retirement plans and recorded a gain on partial settlement of such pension plan of approximately $1.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the defined benefit obligation was $1.4 million and $1.7 million,\nrespectively. The benefit is based on a formula applied to eligible employee earnings. Net periodic benefit costs were $0.5\nmillion, $0.3 million, and $0.5 million respectively for the years ended December 31,2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively, and\nwere recorded to research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nBenefit Obligation and Plan Assets for Pension Benefit Plans\nThe vested benefit obligation for a defined-benefit pension or other retirement plan is the actuarial present value of the\nvested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled based on the employee’s expected date of separation or retirement.\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(in thousands)\nChanges in projected benefit obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation, beginning of period $ 6,573 $ 9,733\nService cost 233 289\nInterest cost 247 79\nActuarial (gain) loss 284 (2,817)\nBenefits paid and settlements (6,060) (124)\nCurrency exchange rate changes 106 (587)\nProjected benefit obligation, end of period 1,383 6,573\nChanges in fair value of plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets, beginning of period 4,895 5,198\nActual return on plan assets (194) (24)\nEmployer contributions 3,245 —\nPlan settlements (8,162) —\nCurrency exchange rate changes 216 (279)\nFair value of plan assets, end of period — 4,895\nNet unfunded status $ 1,383 $ 1,678\nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nOther long-term liabilities $ 1,383 $ 1,678\nAccumulated other comprehensive (income) loss, before tax $ 4,083 $ (2,837)\nChanges in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligation are primarily driven by discount rate movement.\nThe Company uses the corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net actuarial gains or\nlosses in excess of 10% of the larger of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized on a\nstraight-line basis.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, all plans had accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit\nobligations in excess of plan assets. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the accumulated benefit obligations\nwere $1.1 million and $6.3 million for the pension plans.\n120\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(in thousands)\nPlans with accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 1,145 $ 6,258\nPlan assets $ — $ 4,895\nPlans with projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets\nProjected benefit obligation $ 1,383 $ 6,573\nPlan assets $ — $ 4,895\nAssumptions for Pension Benefit Plans\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(in thousands)\nWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations\nDiscount rate 3.5% - 3.9% 3.5% - 3.9%\nRate of compensation increase 3.0% - 3.8% 3.0% - 3.8%\nWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs\nDiscount rate 3.5% - 3.9% 3.5%- 3.9%\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets — % — %\nRate of compensation increase 3.0% - 3.8% 3.0% - 3.8%\nThe Company establishes the discount rate for each pension plan by analyzing current market long-term bond rates and\nmatching the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities. The Company establishes the long-term\nexpected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking\ninto account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return\nis then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for\neach asset class.\nPension Plan Assets\nThe plan assets were $0 as of December 31, 2023, since all assets were transferred to the third party life insurance and\npension provider that is funding and administering future benefit payments for substantially all of the employees in the plan.\nPrior to the transfer, pension assets were held in liquid cash and cash equivalents.\n121\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments for Pension Benefit Plans\nAt December 31, 2023, the estimated benefit payments over the next five years and beyond are as follows:\nEstimated Future\nBenefit Payments\n(in thousands)\n2024 $ 59\n2025 60\n2026 46\n2027 46\n2028 32\nThereafter 63\n$ 306\n15.

As the Company may be required to repay all or a portion\nof the funds provided by the other parties under certain conditions, funds of $15.0 million received from the other parties as of\nDecember 31, 2023 have been deferred in other long-term liabilities. Additional amounts under the contracts are tied to certain\nmilestones and will also be recorded as a long-term liability as payment due under such milestones are received. The Company\nde-recognizes the liabilities when the contingencies associated with the repayment conditions have been resolved.\nDuring the years ended December 31,2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $0 and $3.8 million, respectively, in\npreviously deferred amounts from other parties due to resolution of such repayment conditions.\nDispute with Silicon Motion\nAs disclosed in Note 3, on July 26, 2023, MaxLinear terminated the Merger Agreement on multiple grounds. On\nAugust 16, 2023, Silicon Motion delivered to MaxLinear a notice, which Silicon Motion publicly disclosed, that it was\npurporting to terminate the Merger Agreement and that Silicon Motion would be commencing an arbitration before the\nSingapore International Arbitration Centre to seek damages from MaxLinear arising from MaxLinear’s alleged breaches of the\nMerger Agreement. Silicon Motion’s position is that MaxLinear’s Willful and Material Breaches (as such term is defined in the\nMerger Agreement) of the Merger Agreement prevented the Merger from being completed by August 7, 2023 and that\nMaxLinear is consequently liable for substantial monetary damages in excess of the termination fee as provided in the Merger\nAgreement.\nOn October 5, 2023, Silicon Motion filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre\nalleging that MaxLinear breached the Merger Agreement. Silicon Motion seeks payment of the termination fee, additional\ndamages, fees, and costs. The arbitration will be confidential.\n122\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMaxLinear believes that it properly terminated the Merger Agreement. MaxLinear remains confident in its decision and\nwill vigorously defend its right to terminate the Silicon Motion transaction without penalty.\nClass Action Complaint\nOn August 31, 2023, a Silicon Motion stockholder filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of California captioned Water Island Event-Driven Fund v. MaxLinear, Inc., No. 23-cv-01607\n(S.D. Cal.), against MaxLinear and certain of its current officers. The complaint includes two claims: (1) an alleged violation of\nSection 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the “Exchange Act”, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder; and (2)\nan alleged violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants made false and misleading\nstatements and/or omitted material facts that MaxLinear had a duty to disclose, concerning the Company’s ability and intention\nto timely close the merger with Silicon Motion, including that: (i) MaxLinear had allegedly decided it would not consummate\nthe merger because the economic circumstances surrounding the merger had materially changed, including a material downturn\nin the semiconductor industry and rising interest rates; (ii) MaxLinear had allegedly determined to unilaterally terminate the\nmerger in the event the merger was approved by SAMR; (iii) MaxLinear had allegedly intended to argue that certain conditions\nin Article 6 of the Merger Agreement had not been satisfied as required by May 5, 2023 as a basis to terminate the merger; and\n(iv) as a result, MaxLinear had allegedly materially misrepresented the viability of the merger, the purported benefits of the\nmerger, and the likelihood that the merger would be consummated. The complaint seeks compensatory damages, including\ninterest, costs and expenses and such other equitable or injunctive relief that the court deems appropriate. MaxLinear will\nvigorously defend its position. On December 20, 2023, the Court appointed the lead plaintiffs, who are expected to file an\namended complaint by February 15, 2024. Defendants expect to answer or move to dismiss by March 29, 2024.\nComcast Litigation\nOn December 1, 2023, MaxLinear filed claims against Comcast Management, LLC and Comcast Cable\nCommunications, LLC, or together, Comcast, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\nMaxLinear alleges that in 2020, MaxLinear shared its proprietary design and know-how for a full-duplex, or FDX, amplifier\nwith Comcast in the hope of securing future business with Comcast. MaxLinear shared its design and know-how on several\noccasions, all pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement between MaxLinear and Comcast, with the expectation that Comcast\nwould keep the information confidential. Comcast needed this technology in order to effectively compete with fiber-optic\ninternet providers. Instead of engaging MaxLinear to develop the FDX amplifier, Comcast shared MaxLinear’s proprietary\ndesigns with MaxLinear’s direct competitor. Comcast then worked with MaxLinear’s competitor to develop the FDX-amplifier\ntechnology. MaxLinear brought claims for trade secret misappropriation, unfair competition, and breach of the parties’ non-\ndisclosure agreement, and it sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment and\npost-judgment interest, costs, expenses, and attorney fees as well as an injunction against Comcast’s use or disclosure of\nMaxLinear’s trade secrets.\nDish Litigation\nOn February 10, 2023, Entropic Communications, LLC, or Entropic, filed claims for patent infringement against Dish\nNetwork Corporation, Dish Network LLC, Dish Network Service, LLC, and Dish Network California Service Corporation, or\ntogether, Dish,. At that time, MaxLinear was not a party to the action. On September 21, 2023, Dish Network California\nService Corporation, or Dish California, filed four counterclaims against MaxLinear in the United States District Court for the\nCentral District of California. The four claims are declaratory judgment, breach of contract, fraud and negligent\nmisrepresentation, and civil conspiracy. Dish California alleges that when MaxLinear assigned certain patents to Entropic,\nMaxLinear violated its obligations owed to the Multimedia over Coax Alliance, or MoCA, under MoCA’s Intellectual Property\nRights, or IPR, Policy. Dish California alleges that MaxLinear also allegedly violated the MoCA IPR Policy by failing to offer\nDish California a fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, or FRAND, license for these patents. Dish California seeks an\nunspecified amount of compensatory damages, disgorgement, attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, and costs.\nCox Litigations\nOn October 6, 2023, Cox Communications, Inc., CoxCom, LLC, and Cox Communications California, LLC, or together,\nCox, filed claims in two separate actions against MaxLinear in the United States District Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia.\nIn the first action, in response to Entropic suing Cox for patent infringement, Cox filed counterclaims alleging that when\nMaxLinear assigned certain patents to Entropic, MaxLinear violated its obligations under MoCA’s IPR Policy by assigning\nthese patents and by failing to offer Cox a FRAND license for these patents. Cox amended its counterclaims on January 9, 2024\nand is asserting claims of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and declaratory judgment against MaxLinear. Cox seeks an\nunspecified amount of compensatory damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs.\n123\nMAXLINEAR, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn the second action, in response to Entropic suing Cox for patent infringement, Cox filed counterclaims against\nMaxLinear. Cox alleges that MaxLinear granted CableLabs a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to all patents essential for\ncompliance with DOCSIS specifications. It further alleges that MaxLinear breached this agreement when MaxLinear assigned\ncertain patents to Entropic. Cox amended its counterclaims on January 9, 2024 and is asserting claims for breach of contract,\nunjust enrichment, and declaratory judgment. Cox seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, equitable relief,\nattorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs.\nThe Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the\namount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, no material loss contingencies have been accrued for\nlitigation and other legal claims in the consolidated financial statements, since the Company’s management currently does not\nbelieve that the ultimate outcome of any of the matters described above is probable. An unfavorable outcome of these matters\nmay be reasonably possible in excess of recorded amounts; however, a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of such loss\ncannot be made at this time.\nOther Matters\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to threats of litigation or actual litigation in the ordinary course of business as\ndescribed in “Item 3 — Legal Proceedings,” some of which may be material. Results of litigation and claims are inherently\nunpredictable. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and claims can have an adverse impact on the Company because of defense\nand settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\n16. Stock Repurchases\nOn February 23, 2021, the Company’s board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to $100 million of the\nCompany’s common stock over a period ending February 16, 2024. The amount and timing of repurchases are subject to a\nvariety of factors including liquidity, share price, market conditions, and legal requirements. Any purchases will be funded from\navailable working capital and may be effected through open market purchases, block transactions, and privately negotiated\ntransactions. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases and may be modified,\nsuspended, or terminated by the Company at any time without prior notice. The share repurchase program has been temporarily\nsuspended since July 2022 due to the Company’s previously pending (now terminated) merger with Silicon Motion (Note 3).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock under the\nrepurchase program.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 564,449 shares of its common stock at a weighted\naverage price of $55.7972 per share at an aggregate value of approximately $31.5 million under the repurchase program.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 454,372 shares of its common stock at a weighted\naverage price of $51.7998 per share at an aggregate value of approximately $23.5 million under the repurchase program.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the aggregate value of common stock repurchased under the program was approximately\n$55.0 million and approximately $45.0 million remained available for repurchase under the program.\n124\n(This page has been left blank intentionally.)\n(This page has been left blank intentionally.)\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS AND Special Note Regarding Forward-\nMANAGEMENT Annual Meeting Looking Statements (continued)\nMaxLinear’s 2024 annual meeting of\nDirectors stockholders will take place on Thursday, Given these uncertainties, you should not place\nMay 23, 2024 at 8:30 a.m., Pacific time at undue reliance on any forward- looking\nKishore Seendripu, Ph.D.—Chairman, our offices located at 5966 La Place statements.
