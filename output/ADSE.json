Forward-looking statements are\nbased on our current expectations, estimates, projections, targets, opinions and/or beliefs or, when applicable, of one or more third-party sources. No representation or warranty is made with respect to the reasonableness of any estimates, forecasts, illustrations,\nprospects or returns, which should be regarded as illustrative only. Such forward-looking statements, which include estimated financial information, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. These forward looking statements include,but are not limited to,\nexpress or implied statements regarding our future financial performance, revenues and capital expenditures, our expectation of acceleration in our business due to factors including a re-opening economy and increased EV adoption and expectations related tothe effective\ndeployment of chargers. A number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation: changes or developments in the broader general market; ongoing impact\nfrom COVID-19 on our business, customers, and suppliers; macro political, economic, and business conditions; our limited operating history as a public company; our dependence on widespread adoption of EVs and increased installation of charging stations;mechanisms\nsurrounding energy and non-energy costs for our charging products; the impact of governmental support and mandates that could reduce, modify, or eliminate financial incentives, rebates, and tax credits; our current dependence on sales to a limited number of customers; supply\nchain interruptions; impediments to our expansion plans; the need to attract additional customers; the effects of competition; and risks that our technology could have undetected defects or errors.\nFurther information on these and other factors that could affect the forward-looking statements we make in this presentation canbe found in the documents that we file with or furnish to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 20-F filedwith the SEC on April\n30, 2024 and proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on December 7, 2021, which are available on our website at https://adste-energy.com/investor-relations-corporate-governance/ and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

We believe our non-IFRS financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We usethe following non-IFRS financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\nWe believe that non-IFRS financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors, because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP\nfinancial information to supplement their IFRS or US-GAAP results. The non-IFRS financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance withIFRS, and may be\ndifferent from similarly titled non-IFRS measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each historical non-IFRS financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with IFRS is provided above. Reconciliationsofforward-looking\nnon-IFRS financial measures are not provided because we are unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, certain items, such as stock-based compensation expense and othercosts and expenses\nthat may be incurred in the future. Investors are encouraged to review the related IFRS financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS financial measures.\nOur non-IFRS financial measures include adjusted EBITDA defined as result for the period before net finance result, income tax benefits (expenses), net, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other (expense) income, net, and special items. Our management\nteam ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the ongoing operations. Special items are comprised of (1) provisions for onerous contracts, (2) significant asset impairments and write-offs, and (3) other items that we do not necessarily consider to be\nindicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities.\nUse of Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property\nAll registered or unregistered service marks, trademarks and trade names referred to in this presentation are the property oftheir respective owners, and the use herein does not imply an affiliation with, or endorsement by, the owners of these service marks, trademarks and\ntrade names.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “would,” “could,”\n“should,” “forecast,” “intend,” “seek,” “target,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” “plan,” “outlook” and “project”and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. Forward-looking statements are\nbased on our current expectations, estimates, projections, targets, opinions and/or beliefs or, when applicable, of one or more third-party sources. No representation or warranty is made with respect to the reasonableness of any estimates, forecasts, illustrations,\nprospects or returns, which should be regarded as illustrative only. Such forward-looking statements, which include estimated financial information, involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. These forward looking statements include,but are not limited to,\nexpress or implied statements regarding our future financial performance, revenues and capital expenditures, our expectation of acceleration in our business due to factors including a re-opening economy and increased EV adoption and expectations related tothe effective\ndeployment of chargers. A number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation: changes or developments in the broader general market; ongoing impact\nfrom COVID-19 on our business, customers, and suppliers; macro political, economic, and business conditions; our limited operating history as a public company; our dependence on widespread adoption of EVs and increased installation of charging stations;mechanisms\nsurrounding energy and non-energy costs for our charging products; the impact of governmental support and mandates that could reduce, modify, or eliminate financial incentives, rebates, and tax credits; our current dependence on sales to a limited number of customers; supply\nchain interruptions; impediments to our expansion plans; the need to attract additional customers; the effects of competition; and risks that our technology could have undetected defects or errors.\nFurther information on these and other factors that could affect the forward-looking statements we make in this presentation canbe found in the documents that we file with or furnish to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 20-F filedwith the SEC on April\n30, 2024 and proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on December 7, 2021, which are available on our website at https://adste-energy.com/investor-relations-corporate-governance/ and on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in\nother filings that we make with the SEC from time to time. All forward-looking statements in this presentation are based on our current beliefs and on information available to us as of the date hereof, and we do not assume any obligation to update the forward-looking\nstatements provided to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made or to updatethe reasons why actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes\navailable in the future.\nIndustry and Market Data\nAlthough all information and opinions expressed in this presentation, including market data and other statistical information, were obtained from sources believed to be reliable and are included in good faith, the company has not independently verified theinformation and makes\nno representation or warranty, express or implied, as to its accuracy or completeness. for the correctness of any such information.

We believe our non-IFRS financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We usethe following non-IFRS financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes.\nWe believe that non-IFRS financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors, because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP\nfinancial information to supplement their IFRS or US-GAAP results. The non-IFRS financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance withIFRS, and may be\ndifferent from similarly titled non-IFRS measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of each historical non-IFRS financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with IFRS is provided above. Reconciliationsofforward-looking\nnon-IFRS financial measures are not provided because we are unable to provide such reconciliations without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and potential variability of, certain items, such as stock-based compensation expense and othercosts and expenses\nthat may be incurred in the future. Investors are encouraged to review the related IFRS financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-IFRS financial measures to their most directly comparable IFRS financial measures.\nOur non-IFRS financial measures include adjusted EBITDA defined as result for the period before net finance result, income tax benefits (expenses), net, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other (expense) income, net, and special items. Our management\nteam ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the ongoing operations. Special items are comprised of (1) provisions for onerous contracts, (2) significant asset impairments and write-offs, and (3) other items that we do not necessarily consider to be\nindicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities.\nUse of Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property\nAll registered or unregistered service marks, trademarks and trade names referred to in this presentation are the property oftheir respective owners, and the use herein does not imply an affiliation with, or endorsement by, the owners of these service marks, trademarks and\ntrade names.

Research Limited\nExpansion of EV charging infrastructure critical for\nachieving net zero\nAccording to the IEA, road transport accounts for 16% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, so\na widespread adoption of EVs is essential if governments are to achieve their net zero ambitions.\nThe IEA calculates that to achieve its Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, the global EV car fleet\nneeds to expand to over 300m by 2030, with electric cars accounting for 60% of all new car sales.\nThis compares with global EV sales of 10.5m in 2022 (source: EV-volumes), which was a 55%\nyear-on-year increase and represented 13% of global light vehicle sales. EV-volumes predicts sales\nof 14.3m EVs in 2023 (ie year-on-year growth of 36%), taking the number of EVs in operation\nglobally to 40m.\nGovernment targets for EV adoption\nGovernments across the globe have set targets for EV adoption. For example, in August 2021, US\nPresident Joe Biden signed an executive order setting an ambitious target to make 50% of all new\nvehicles sold in 2030 zero-emissions vehicles (ie battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric or fuel cell\nelectric vehicles). Achieving this target would facilitate reaching the president’s goal of cutting net\ngreenhouse gas emissions nationally by 50–52% compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and getting to\nnet zero by 2050. As part of the European Union’s ‘Fit for 55’ package, which is intended to enable\nthe region to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990\nlevels and to achieve climate neutrality in 2050, the EU announced regulations in March 2023\nspecifically for major automotive manufacturers. The new regulations require a 55% reduction in\nCO2 emissions for new cars from 2030 to 2034 compared to 2021 levels and a 100% reduction in\nCO2 emissions for new cars from 2035, which in effect bans the sale of conventionally powered\ncars from that point.\nThe long and winding road | 4 September 2023 2\nExhibit 1: Electric car registrations and sales share in selected countries, 2017–22\nThe long and winding road | 4 September 2023 3\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n,0\n,0\n,0\n,0\n,0\n,0\n,0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n,0\n,0\n,0\n,0\n,0\n,0\n,0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n-\n2 0 1 7 2 0 1 8 2 0 1\nC\n9\nh\n2\nin\n0\na\n2 0 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 7 2 0 1 8\nU\n2\nn\n0 1\nite\n9\nd\n2\nS\n0 2 0\nta te s\n2 0 2 1 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 7 2 0 1 8 2 0 1 9 2 0 2\nE u ro p e\n0 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 2 2 0 1 7 2 0 1 8 2 0 1 9 2 0 2\nO th e r\n0 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 2\n3\n2\n2\n1\n1\n5\n0\n0 .0\n5 .0\n0 .0\n5 .0\n0 .0\n.0\n.0\n%\nselas\nrac\ncirtcelE\nB E V P H E V C a r s a le s s h a re (% )\nSource: IEA. Licence: CC BY 4.0 and Edison Investment Research\nGreater adoption of EVs has also been promoted by governments as a way of reducing reliance on\noil imports from Russia, which many Western governments consider desirable both as a short-term\nresponse to the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and as a longer-term strategic move. The\nIEA’s 10-point plan for advanced economies to cut oil usage by 2.7bn barrels per day over a four-\nmonth period shortly after the invasion included reinforcing the adoption of electric and more\nefficient vehicles as a way of saving around 100,000 barrels per day.\nDespite these government initiatives, adoption of EVs has been held back by the higher purchase\ncost and the availability of charging infrastructure.\nFast-charging infrastructure a prerequisite for EV adoption\nAt present, most EV owners charge their vehicles at home or at their place of work. But for EV\nadoption to accelerate at the rate required for governments to meet their net zero targets, access to\npublic charging networks will need to improve. The ubiquitous availability of public charging points\nwill encourage a switch to EVs by consumers who sometimes need to make long journeys by car,\nor who are not able to charge a vehicle at home because they have to park on the street.\nThe top-selling battery EV in 2022 was the Tesla Model Y. It is equipped with a CATL LFP60 battery\nwith 60kWh nominal capacity, having an estimated range of 150 to 310 miles, depending on the\nexternal temperature and whether the vehicle is being driven in a city or at a constant speed on an\nopen highway. The battery takes nine hours and 15 minutes to charge fully at home, unless the\nproperty has a three-phase grid connection, in which case the charge time reduces to six hours and\n15 minutes. The battery capacity means that a driver cannot travel from London to Edinburgh, a\ndistance of 400 miles, or from Munich to Berlin, a distance of 365 miles, without stopping at a fast-\ncharging point during the journey. The time taken to charge at a fast-charging point is around 25\nminutes.\nGovernment support for fast-charging network roll-out\nThe US administration’s 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act allocates $7.5bn funding to\nsupport the buildout of a national public EV charging network. In February 2023, the US\nDepartment of Transportation announced the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI)\nprogramme, a $5bn initiative to create a coast-to-coast network of EV chargers focused on major\nhighways. The initiative supports the president’s public commitment to build a convenient, reliable\nand user-friendly national network of 500k EV chargers by 2030. Concurrently in February 2023,\nthe Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) unveiled new national standards for federally funded\nEV chargers, including NEVI-funded chargers, which cover connector types, payment methods,\ndata privacy, speed and power of chargers and reliability (97% uptime required) so that charging is\npredictable and dependable on whatever EV is being driven. The FHWA also announced that all EV\nchargers funded through the 2021 Infrastructure Act must be built in the United States. Tesla is to\nopen a portion of its US Supercharger and Destination Charger network to non-Tesla EVs in\nsupport of the NEVI programme. This action will make at least 7,500 chargers available for all EVs\nby the end of 2024. Tesla’s accessible chargers will include at least 3,500 new and existing 250kW\nSuperchargers along highway corridors as well as Destination Chargers at locations such as hotels\nand restaurants in urban and rural locations. All EV drivers will be able to access these stations\nusing the Tesla app or website.\nIn October 2022, the European Parliament adopted minimum requirements for EV charging\ninfrastructure that require member states to build EV charging points at least every 60km on main\nroads. Under this Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation, member states have until the end of\n2025 to install the charging points required for passenger cars and the end of 2030 to install\ncharging points for trucks. In October 2021, the European Investment Bank and European\nCommission signed an agreement making over €1.5bn in EU grants available by the end of 2023\nfor alternative fuels infrastructure, including electric fast-charging stations.\nIn March 2022, the UK government announced plans intended to increase the number of public EV\ncharge points in the UK market to 300k by 2030, which is roughly five times the number of fuel\npumps in operation at present. £500m will be invested in public charge points for communities\nacross the UK, of which £450m is allocated to the Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure fund, which\nwill boost projects such as EV hubs and on-street charging to give charge point access to drivers\nwithout their own driveways and therefore no potential for installing a charge point. This is in\naddition to the existing £950m Rapid Charging Fund, intended to support the roll-out of at least\n6,000 high-powered super-fast charge points across England’s motorways by 2035.\nThe long and winding road | 4 September 2023 4\nExhibit 2: ChargeBox fast-charging point at Aral site in Exhibit 3: ChargePost fast-charging point in Limburg,\nGermany Germany\nSource: ADS-TEC Energy Source: ADS-TEC Energy\nEV charging infrastructure market growth\nEU\nAn analysis published by McKinsey in November 2022, conducted for the European Automobile\nManufacturers’ Association, noted that there were around 375k charging stations in the EU in 2021\nand suggested that, even in the most conservative scenario, the EU-27 would need at least 3.4m\noperational public charge points by 2030. This figure excluded the estimated 29m private charging\nstations that homeowners, apartment building managers and workplace parking operators would\nhave to install. This scenario would require an acceleration from about 1,600 installations of public\ncharge points a week in 2021 to 6,000 a week by 2025 and more than 10,500 a week in 2030. The\nreport calculated that the infrastructure required to support EV roll-out would cost a cumulative total\nof €240bn for hardware and installation by 2030. This includes installing new public charge points (c\n20% of the total), installing new private charge points (c 40%), upgrading the grid (c 15%) and\nincreasing renewable-energy generation capacity (c 25%).\nUS\nA report from PWC published in September 2022 predicted that the number of charge points in the\nUS would grow from about 4m at that time to an estimated 35m in 2030, of which single-unit and\nmulti-unit residential segments would account for 22m and 6m charge points, respectively. It also\npredicted that the US EV equipment supply market would grow from $7–8bn in 2022, of which 46%\nrelated to hardware and a negligible proportion to software, to $16–19bn in 2025, of which 35%\nrelated to hardware and a negligible proportion to software, and to $88–107bn in 2040, of which\n20% related to hardware and 5% to software.\nEnhancements required to infrastructure\nAdditional electricity demand linked to EVs modest\nAccording to the IEA’s Global EV Outlook, electricity demand from EVs currently accounts for less\nthan half a percent of total final electricity consumption worldwide. The organisation predicts that by\n2030, electricity demand for EVs will account for at least 2% of final electricity consumption globally.\nElectricity demand is also likely to increase as consumers switch from gas to electric heating or\nstart to use air-conditioning to combat the effect of climate change. Assuming that governments are\nserious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, this additional demand will be met from\nThe long and winding road | 4 September 2023 5\nrenewable sources. This means that in addition to dealing with a potential increase in demand\noverall, utilities will need to cope with the challenges of balancing supply and demand as an\nincreasing proportion of generation is attributable to renewable sources, which are by their nature\nintermittent (see our report on battery energy storage systems). Achieving this balance will be even\nmore difficult when the sudden spikes in demand when fast-chargers are activated are taken into\nconsideration.\nDemand spikes from fast charging more problematic\nThe IEA concludes that fast charging will have to be carefully managed to avoid exceeding peak\nload capacity. The organisation recommends that time-sensitive consumer tariffs should be used to\nincentivise drivers to charge their EV when it does not stress the network or when output from\nrenewables is high. Similarly, the McKinsey analysis cited above notes that EVs will put less strain\non the grid in residential neighbourhoods because while many vehicles could be charging\nsimultaneously, for example in preparation for morning commutes, these neighbourhoods would be\nable to rely mainly on relatively slow AC chargers drawing as little as 3–11kW. In contrast, if a driver\nwants to charge their EV within minutes, the charging point needs to be able to deliver a high\ncharging power of around 300kW. This means that motorway rest stops with public fast-charging\npoints could experience extreme peak loads at busy times. Since the distribution infrastructure in\nrural areas is typically sized for low loads and slow predicted load growth, it may only be able to\nprovide around 60kW and thus not have the capacity required to support a motorway service\nstation with multiple fast-charging points.\nGrid limitations favour battery-buffered solutions\nOne solution for a potential charge-point owner, for example a supermarket or someone operating a\nfleet of electric delivery vehicles, is to apply for the local grid to be upgraded. This could take at\nleast a year and cost between $0.1–2m per megawatt, depending on how far the location is from a\nmedium-voltage sub-station (see below). The alternative is to deploy a battery-buffered charging\npoint. Here an integrated battery storage system charges slowly from the grid power available, even\nif it is low, and stores the energy. When an EV is being charged, the power available from the local\ngrid is supplemented with power from the energy storage system to achieve the maximum charging\npower needed to fully charge the EV in a few minutes. Ideally the charging point should have\nenergy management software linking it to the grid, providing information to help determine whether\nadditional generation capacity needs to be brought on stream, and allowing the integrated energy\nstorage system to export energy to the network if not required for charging purposes. The IEA\nenvisages smart networks where parked EVs can export surplus energy to the grid at times of peak\ndemand to reduce the amount of energy-generation capacity required.\nRolls-Royce subsidiary mtu provides a cost analysis for a charging hub in rural Germany with two\nfast chargers (150kW) and six slow chargers (22kW), which is intended to service approximately 40\ncars per day, requiring on average 30kWh per car. The low-voltage grid at the charging station\ncannot provide the high-charging power of 22kW required and the site is 5km away from the\nnearest medium-voltage (1,000V) substation. mtu estimates that reinforcing the local grid by\ninstalling a transformer and cables to connect to the medium-voltage substation would cost\n€321,050, of which €275k is attributable to the cabling. This compares with €160k upfront costs to\ninstall one of its 250kW/267kWh battery energy storage systems. The operating costs for both\noptions are similar, €25,700 per year for grid reinforcement, €23,300 for the battery energy storage\nsystem. The operating costs for the battery energy storage system option are 10% lower because\nmany grid operators apply demand charges based on their highest peak load over a billing period.\nHaving a battery energy storage system means that the charging hub operator may reduce the\namount of energy purchased during periods of peak demand (peak shaving), cutting the total\nenergy cost.\nThe long and winding road | 4 September 2023 6\nSince non-battery buffered ultra-fast chargers are less expensive than battery-buffered ones (Pod\nPoint notes average revenues of £1,609/unit), they are typically deployed at locations where the\nlocal grid can provide sufficient power. According to charge-point operator Fastned, supermarkets,\nhigh-rise office buildings and large warehouses are routinely connected to the medium-voltage grid\nwith connections of 1MW or 2MW. Non-battery buffered ultra-fast chargers may also be more\neconomic at locations such as central charge parks or motorway service stations if the number of\ndrivers paying for fast charges throughout the day is sufficient to cover the cost of a grid upgrade.\nADS-TEC believes there is a significant opportunity for providing ultra-fast charge points in\nlocations such as commercial and industrial premises, delivery fleet depots, car dealerships and\napartment blocks where high charge rates are not required continuously (see Exhibits 4 and 5).\nInvesting in EV charging infrastructure\nThere are investment opportunities at every level of the supply chain:\n◼ Critical materials (see our March 2023 report on the critical materials market).\n◼ Components for power electronics: Infineon Technologies (IFX:DE), Rohm (6963:JP),\nWolfspeed (WOLF:US).\n◼ Charge-point providers: ABB (ABBN:SW), ADS-TEC (ADSE:US), Blink Charging (BLNK:US),\nEngie (ENGI:FP), Lincoln Electric (LECO:US), Luceco Group (LUCE:LN), Pod Point\n(PODP:LN), Tritium (DCFC:US), Wallbox (WBX:US).\n◼ Charge-point operators: Allego (ALLG:US), Blink Charging, ChargePoint (CHPT:US), EVGo\n(EVGO:US), Fastned (FAST:AS), Pod Point (PODP:LN).\n◼ Investment trusts: Triple Point Energy Transition (TENT:LSE)\nThis report focuses on companies supplying charging systems. As discussed above, these systems\ncan be split into DC-based fast-charging systems, which may potentially be battery-buffered, and\nAC wallboxes for residential use. In our opinion, fast-charging systems provide more opportunity to\ncreate differentiated high-margin product than consumer wallboxes. We note that the complexity of\nthe supply chain (see above) means that deployment of charging systems will be affected by the\navailability of critical metals such as copper and, in the case of battery-buffered systems, lithium, as\nwell as the availability of power electronics chips and other electronic components.\nBattery-buffered ultra-fast charging on power-limited grids\nADS-TEC has sold over 450 units of ChargeBox, its flagship product. A ChargeBox unit can\ndispense 320kW of power from a single dispenser, or 160kW from two dispensers, and is certified\nfor use in mainland Europe and the US. It can dispense sufficient charge for a typical EV to travel\nmore than 100km (60 miles) in the time it takes to fill the petrol tank of a conventional car.\nChargeBox is designed for installation with limited space, as the footprint of the storage unit is only\n1.3 × 1.3 metres and the charge dispensers have a footprint of 0.4 × 0.4 metres. Importantly the\ncharge dispensers, one or two per storage unit, can be located up to 100m from the charge storage\nunit, giving additional flexibility for small spaces. The product is almost silent, making it suitable for\ninstallations in residential areas and therefore attractive to facilities managers of apartment blocks.\nChargeBox is targeted at service stations, operators of vehicle fleets, logistics companies and\npublic transport operators. ADS-TEC’s newer ChargePost product deploys an energy management\nsystem, which means that the unit not only stores energy that may have been generated on-site\nfrom renewable sources, but can also feed energy back into the grid, thus supporting grid services\nsuch as frequency management. The ability to return stored energy bidirectionally to the grid opens\nup entirely new business models for charging-point operators. ADS-TEC has an established\nThe long and winding road | 4 September 2023 7\nmanufacturing site in Germany and is constructing one in the US, enabling its customers there to\ntake advantage of funding delivered under the 2021 Infrastructure Act.\nOther companies providing battery-buffered fast-charging systems are e.on, FreeWire (based in\nCalifornia), mtu and Powerstar (headquartered in Sheffield, UK). mtu is the only one of ADS-TEC’s\ncompetitors that offers dispensers that can be sited a distance from the charge storage unit. mtu’s\nsmallest product has a larger footprint (3.3m × 2.2m) than either of ADS-TEC’s products.\nExhibit 4: US TAM for battery-buffered systems Exhibit 5: EU market for battery-buffered systems\nSource: ADS-TEC Source: ADS-TEC\nADS-TEC calculates that the total available market opportunity (TAM) for battery-buffered fast-\ncharging units in the US is $43bn, which represents over 210k fast-charging units. It also calculates\nthat the market opportunity in the EU is $40bn, which represents over 200k units.\nNon-battery buffered grid-connected ultra-fast chargers\nCompanies offering non-battery buffered options include ABB, Blink, EVBox (part of Engie),\nEvercharge, Lincoln Electric, Pod Point, Schneider Electric, SK Signet (part of SK Corp), Tesla and\nTritium. Tritium has sold over 10,000 DC fast chargers globally. Tritium states that its fast chargers\nare the only fully liquid-cooled fast DC chargers commercially available. The modular, liquid cooling\nsystem allows its chargers to be fully sealed, which the company notes results in up to 37% total\ncost of ownership reduction over 10 years compared to air-cooled systems.\nAC wallboxes\nAs the number of EVs on the road increases, the number of AC wallboxes sold for home charging is\nlikely to increase as well. While home charging in principle reduces the usage of public charging\npoints, in practice the two address different customer requirements and could be considered to be\ncomplementing each other rather than competing. Companies offering EV charging points for\nresidential use include Blink, Enel, EVBox, Evercharge, Pod Point and SyncEV (acquired by\nLuceco Group in March 2022). As well as offering AC charging points for residential use, Wallbox\noffers AC charging points for businesses that require employees to access the charger with a radio\nfrequency identification (RFID) card. EVBox offers a hardware accessory for its home charging\nstation that monitors power consumption elsewhere in the house and reduces the charge rate if\nrequired to ensure that total power consumption remains within pre-set limits, thus avoiding\nblackouts or circuit overload.\nThe long and winding road | 4 September 2023 8\nGeneral disclaimer and copyright\nThis report has been commissioned by ADS-TEC Energy and prepared and issued by Edison, in consideration of a fee payable by ADS-TEC Energy.
