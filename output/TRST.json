Under the SEC’s rules, companies making disclosures\ncontaining non-GAAP financial measures must also disclose, along with each non-GAAP financial measure, certain\nadditional information, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the closest comparable GAAP\nfinancial measure and a statement of the company’s reasons for utilizing the non-GAAP financial measure as part of its\nTangible Equity to Tangible Assets (Non-GAAP) 10.72%\nfinancial disclosures. Certain of the financial measures used in this proxy statement, such as efficiency ratio, are\ndetermined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP.\nEquity to Assets (GAAP) 10.73%\nTangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end is a non-GAAP financial measure derived from GAAP-\n(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) (Unaudited)\nbased amounts. We calculate tangible equity and tangible assets by excluding the balance of intangible assets from total\nshareholders’ equity and total assets, respectively. We calculate tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at\nperiod end by dividing tangible equity by tangible assets at period end. We believe that this is consistent with the treatment Twelve months ended Six months ended June\nEfficiency Ratio December 31, 2023 30, 2024\nby bank regulatory agencies, which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios. Additionally,\nwe believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in relative changes from\nNet Interest Income (Taxable Equivalent)(Non-GAAP) $171,845 $74,366\nperiod to period in equity and total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets.\nTaxable equivalent adjustment — —\nThe Efficiency Ratio: Financial institutions often use an “efficiency ratio” as a measure of expense control. The efficiency\nratio typically is defined as noninterest expense divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and\nNet interest income (fully taxable equivalent)(Non-GAAP) $171,845 $74,366\nnoninterest income. As in the case of net interest income, generally, net interest income as utilized in calculating the\nefficiency ratio is typically expressed on a taxable equivalent basis. Moreover, many financial institutions, in calculating the\nNon-interest income (GAAP) 18,315 10,494\nefficiency ratio, also adjust both noninterest expense and noninterest income to exclude from these items (as calculated\nunder GAAP) certain component elements, such as other real estate expense (deducted from noninterest expense) and Less: Unrealized gains recognized on equity securities 1,360\nsecurities transactions (excluded from noninterest income). We calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing total noninterest\nexpenses as determined under GAAP, excluding other real estate expense, net, by net interest income (fully taxable Add: Non-recurring loss 101 —\nequivalent) and total noninterest income as determined under GAAP, excluding unrealized gains recognized on equity\nRevenue used for efficiency ratio (Non-GAAP) $190,261 $83,500\nsecurities. We believe that this provides a reasonable measure of primary banking expenses relative to primary banking\nrevenue. Additionally, we believe this measure is important to investors looking for a measure of efficiency in our\nTotal Noninterest expense (GAAP) $111,297 $51,362\nproductivity measured by the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent.\nLess: Non-recurring expenses 2,864 —\nWe believe that the non-GAAP financial measure provides information that is important to investors and that is useful in\nunderstanding the Company’s financial position, results and ratios.

However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a\nsubstitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures.

2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \n\nTrustCo Bank Corp NY (**TrustCo, NASDAQ: TRST**) today announced third quarter 2024 net income of $12.9 million or $0.68 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $14.7 million or $0.77 diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2023; and net income of $37.6 million or $1.97 diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $48.9 million or $2.57 diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Average loans increased $127.0 million or 2.6% for the third quarter 2024 over the same period in 2023. TrustCo was able to increase the balances of home equity lines of credit (HECLs) outstanding through an aggressive campaign to encourage existing customers to utilize their HECLs in place of the higher rates on other products. The objective was to meet customer needs and encourage increased utilization through existing HECLs.\n\n**Overview**\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Robert J. McCormick said “Hard, consistent work on the fundamentals of banking once again have served the Trustco Bank team well and enabled us to post strong results under challenging circumstances. Our bankers posted one modest success after another – which accumulated into solid performance. We continued to hold the line on demand accounts and capitalized on strong customer relationships which enabled us to direct the flow into competitively-priced CDs, rather than to non-bank investment products. Not having to purchase expensive deposits or pay excessive rates, helped keep interest expense down, contributing to increased net interest income. We have continued to sell home equity products at favorable rates where origination of purchase mortgages lagged due to lack of sales volume. We booked these new loans at higher interest rates, also boosting net interest margin. Once again, loans reached a new all-time high. All of these efforts by our team resulted in net income of $12.9 million for the quarter.”\n\n**Details**\n\nAverage loans were up $127.0 million or 2.6% in the third quarter 2024 over the same period in 2023. Average residential loans and home equity lines of credit, our primary lending focus, were up $50.4 million, or 1.2%, and $60.0 million, or 18.7%, respectively, in the third quarter 2024 over the same period in 2023. Average commercial loans also increased $18.1 million, or 6.9%, in the third quarter 2024 over the same period in 2023. Average deposits were up $15.3 million, or 0.3% for the third quarter 2024 over the same period in 2023. We believe the increase in time deposits compared to the prior year continues to reflect the desire of customers to have additional funds in the safety and security offered by TrustCo’s long history of conservative banking, while earning a competitive interest rate. As we move forward, the objective is to encourage customers to retain these additional funds in the expanded product offerings of Trustco Bank (the “Bank”) through aggressive marketing and product differentiation.\n\nNet interest income was $38.7 million for the third quarter 2024, an increase of $883 thousand, or 2.3%, compared to the prior quarter, driven by loan growth at higher interest rates and lower cost of deposits, partially offset by lower investment earnings and a decrease in interest on federal funds sold and other short-term investments. The net interest margin for the third quarter 2024 was 2.61%, up 8 basis points from 2.53% in the second quarter of 2024. The yield on interest earnings assets increased to 4.11%, up 5 basis points from 4.06% in the second quarter of 2024. The cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to 1.94% in the third quarter 2024 from 1.97% in the second quarter 2024. The Bank has seen success in retaining deposits while lowering the rates on time deposits, and still being competitive in the markets it serves. The Federal Reserve’s decision regarding whether to cut or hold rates in upcoming meetings will have an effect on the Bank’s ability to continue to manage deposit costs. Further reductions should help margin expansion in future quarters. Non-interest expense decreased $259 thousand over the prior quarter as a result of the Bank’s ongoing efforts to control expenses.\n\nAsset quality remains strong and has been consistent over the past twelve months. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $500 thousand in the third quarter of 2024, which is the result of a provision for credit losses on loans of $400 thousand, and provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of $100 thousand. The ratio of allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was 0.99% and 0.95% as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on loans was $50.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $47.2 million at September 30, 2023. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) were $19.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $17.9 million at September 30, 2023. NPLs were 0.38% and 0.36% of total loans at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The coverage ratio, or allowance for credit losses on loans to NPLs, was 256.9% at September 30, 2024, compared to 264.2% at September 30, 2023. Nonperforming assets (NPAs) were $21.9 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $19.1 million at September 30, 2023. \n\nAt September 30, 2024, our equity to asset ratio was 10.95%, compared to 10.31% at September 30, 2023. Book value per share at September 30, 2024 was $35.19, up 7.3% compared to $32.80 a year earlier.\n\n_A conference call to discuss third quarter 2024_ _results will be held at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on October 22, 2024._ Those wishing to participate in the call may dial toll-free for the United States at 1-833-470-1428, and for Canada at 1-833-950-0062, Access code 034120.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation.  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation**\n\nTangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure derived from GAAP-based amounts. We calculate tangible book value by excluding the balance of intangible assets from total shareholders’ equity divided by shares outstanding. We believe that this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies, which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios. Additionally, we believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in relative changes from period to period in equity exclusive of changes in intangible assets.\n\nTangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end is a non-GAAP financial measure derived from GAAP-based amounts. We calculate tangible equity and tangible assets by excluding the balance of intangible assets from total shareholders’ equity and total assets, respectively. We calculate tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end by dividing tangible equity by tangible assets at period end. We believe that this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies, which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios. Additionally, we believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in relative changes from period to period in equity and total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets.\n\nNet interest income is commonly presented on a taxable equivalent basis. That is, to the extent that some component of the institution’s net interest income will be exempt from taxation (e.g., was received by the institution as a result of its holdings of state or municipal obligations), an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from that component is added back to the net interest income total. Management considers this adjustment helpful to investors in comparing one financial institution’s net interest income (pre- tax) to that of another institution, as each will have a different proportion of tax-exempt items in their portfolios. Moreover, net interest income is itself a component of another financial measure commonly used by financial institutions, net interest margin, which is the ratio of net interest income to average interest earning assets. Additionally, management and many financial institutions also present net interest spread, which is the average yield on interest earning assets minus the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. For purposes of these measures as well, taxable equivalent net interest income is generally used by financial institutions, again to provide investors with a better basis of comparison from institution to institution. We calculate taxable equivalent net interest margin by dividing net interest income, adjusted to include the benefit of non-taxable interest income, by average interest earning assets. We calculate taxable equivalent net interest spread as the difference between average yield on interest earning assets, adjusted to include the benefit of non-taxable interest income, and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities.\n\nThe efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure of expense control relative to revenue from net interest income and non-interest fee income. We calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing total noninterest expenses as determined under GAAP, excluding other real estate expense, net, by net interest income (fully taxable equivalent) and total noninterest income as determined under GAAP, excluding net gains on equity securities. We believe that this provides a reasonable measure of primary banking expenses relative to primary banking revenue. Additionally, we believe this measure is important to investors looking for a measure of efficiency in our productivity measured by the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent.\n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is important to investors and that is useful in understanding our financial results. Our management internally assesses our performance based, in part, on these measures. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for these measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures of tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets, and efficiency ratio to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is set forth below. We have not presented a reconciliation of taxable equivalent net interest income, taxable equivalent net interest margin or taxable equivalent net interest spread to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, as there was no difference between the taxable equivalent measure and comparable GAAP measure for any period presented in this release.\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES RECONCILIATION**  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)  \n(Unaudited)  \n**9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \n**Tangible Book Value Per Share**  \nEquity (GAAP)| $| 669,021| $| 655,168| $| 623,926  \nLess: Intangible assets| 553| 553| 553  \nTangible equity (Non-GAAP)| $| 668,468| $| 654,615| $| 623,373  \nShares outstanding| 19,010| 19,010| 19,024  \nTangible book value per share| 35.16| 34.44| 32.77  \nBook value per share| 35.19| 34.46| 32.80  \n**Tangible Equity to Tangible Assets**  \nTotal Assets (GAAP)| $| 6,109,680| $| 6,106,644| $| 6,054,298  \nLess: Intangible assets| 553| 553| 553  \nTangible assets (Non-GAAP)| $| 6,109,127| $| 6,106,091| $| 6,053,745  \nTangible Equity to Tangible Assets (Non-GAAP)| 10.94| %| 10.72| %| 10.30| %  \nEquity to Assets (GAAP)| 10.95| %| 10.73| %| 10.31| %  \n**Three months ended**| **Nine Months Ended**  \n**Efficiency Ratio**| **9/30/2024**| **6/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**| **9/30/2024**| **9/30/2023**  \nNet interest income (GAAP)| $| 38,671| $| 37,788| $| 42,221| $| 113,037| $| 133,238  \nTaxable equivalent adjustment| -| -| -| -| -  \nNet interest income (fully taxable equivalent) (Non-GAAP)| 38,671| 37,788| 42,221| 113,037| 133,238  \nNon-interest income (GAAP)| 4,931| 5,651| 4,574| 15,425| 13,841  \nLess: Net gains on equity securities| 23| 1,360| -| 1,383| -  \nRevenue used for efficiency ratio (Non-GAAP)| $| 43,579| $| 42,079| $| 46,795| $| 127,079| $| 147,079  \nTotal noninterest expense (GAAP)| $| 26,200| $| 26,459| $| 27,460| $| 77,562| $| 82,466  \nLess: Other real estate expense, net| 204| 16| 163| 294| 536  \nExpense used for efficiency ratio (Non-GAAP)| $| 25,996| $| 26,443| $| 27,297| $| 77,268| $| 81,930  \nEfficiency Ratio| 59.65| %| 62.84| %| 58.33| %| 60.80| %| 55.70| %  \n  \n**Subsidiary:**| **Trustco Bank**  \n---|---  \nContact:| Robert LeonardExecutive Vice President(518) 381-3693  \n  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI1OTQwMSM2NTQxNjcyIzIwMTY4MDk=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YTY5NzlkMzEtNDViZS00NTViLThmYmMtZjVkZDk2MDdiMWE1LTEwMjgzODI=/tiny/TrustCo-Bank-Corp-NY.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/7b8fe8d6-f016-40cd-86a2-53de114d9819/small/trustco-bank-corp-ny-logo.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/7b8fe8d6-f016-40cd-86a2-53de114d9819)\n\nSource: TrustCo Bank Corp NY \n\n##### Contact Information\n\nTrustCo Bank Corp NY 5 Sarnowski Drive Glenville, NY 12302 \n\n_Transfer Agent:_ Computershare P.O.

$12.6 million or $0.66 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $16.4 million or $0.86 diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2023; and net income of $24.7 million or $1.30 diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of $34.1 million or $1.79 diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Average loan growth increased $182.2 million or 3.8% for the second quarter 2024 over the same period in 2023.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, Visa Inc. accepted the Company’s tender of its 6,528 shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock in exchange for a combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock and Visa Class C common stock. As a result of the exchange, the Company marked its Visa Class C common stock to fair value and recorded a gain of $1.4 million based on the conversion privilege of the Visa Class C common stock and the closing price of Visa Class A common stock on June 28, 2024 of $262.47 per share. The Company’s Visa Class C shares are expected to continue to be marked to fair value on a recurring basis using the Visa Class A shares as evidence of orderly transactions between market participants for similar securities issued by Visa. The Company originally obtained the shares in 2008. The strategic decision to retain those shares and not sell them sooner, allowed the Company to avoid commissions and other expenses thus recognizing the full market value. Further, it is anticipated that there could be future opportunities to exchange Class B-2 shares.\n\n**Overview**\n\nChairman, President, and CEO, Robert J. McCormick said “Our success this quarter arises directly from our commitment to the core principles of Trustco Bank: competitive pricing and exceptional customer service. This clear mission focus enabled us to reach yet another milestone in our loan portfolio, as our residential, home equity, and commercial offerings all grew significantly over this time last year, reaching an all-time high for total loans. With all revenue streams producing, we realized a 4% increase in net income. By employing a sharp focus on loan pricing and resisting upward pressure on deposit rates, we realized a 3.7% increase in net interest margin. All this was accomplished as we not only maintained, but grew capital. In true Trustco fashion, credit quality remains stellar. We believe that this momentum positions us well for the remainder of the year.”\n\n**Details**\n\nAverage loans were up $182.2 million or 3.8% in the second quarter 2024 over the same period in 2023. Average residential loans and home equity lines of credit, our primary lending focus, were up $89.9 million, or 2.1%, and $61.1 million, or 20.1%, respectively, in the second quarter 2024 over the same period in 2023. Average commercial loans also increased $31.5 million, or 12.7%, in the second quarter 2024 over the same period in 2023. Average deposits were up $77.4 million, or 1.5% for the second quarter 2024 over the same period in 2023. We believe the increase in time deposits compared to the prior year continues to reflect the desire of customers to have additional funds in the safety and security offered by TrustCo’s long history of conservative banking. As we move forward, the objective is to encourage customers to retain these additional funds in the expanded product offerings of the Bank through aggressive marketing and product differentiation.\n\nNet interest income was $37.8 million for the second quarter 2024, an increase of $1.2 million, or 3.3%, compared to the prior quarter, driven by loan growth at higher interest rates, an increase in interest on federal funds sold and other short-term investments, and lower cost of deposits, partially offset by lower investment earnings. The net interest margin for the second quarter 2024 was 2.53%, up 9 basis points from 2.44% in the first quarter of 2024. The yield on interest earnings assets increased to 4.06%, up 7 basis points from 3.99% in the first quarter of 2024. The cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased to 1.97% in the second quarter 2024 from 1.99% in the first quarter 2024. The Bank has seen success in managing deposits by lowering the rates on time deposits and retaining deposit balances, while still being competitive in the markets we serve. The Federal Reserve’s decision regarding whether to cut or hold rates in the upcoming meetings will have an effect on our ability to continue to decrease deposit costs which should help margin in future quarters, and consequently, should bring down the cost of deposits over time. Non-interest expense increased $1.6 million over the prior quarter primarily as a result of higher salaries and employee benefits costs.\n\nAsset quality remains strong and has been consistent over the past twelve months. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $500 thousand in the second quarter of 2024, which is the result of a provision for credit losses on loans of $500 thousand, and there was no change in unfunded commitments. The ratio of allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans was 0.99% and 0.96% as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses on loans was $49.8 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $46.9 million at June 30, 2023. NPLs were $19.2 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $19.4 million at June 30, 2023. NPLs were 0.38% and 0.40% of total loans at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The coverage ratio, or allowance for credit losses on loans to NPLs, was 259.4% at June 30, 2024, compared to 241.6% at June 30, 2023. NPAs were $21.5 million at June 30, 2024, compared to $20.8 million at June 30, 2023. \n\nAt June 30, 2024, our equity to asset ratio was 10.73%, compared to 10.23% at June 30, 2023. Book value per share at June 30, 2024 was $34.46, up 5.5% compared to $32.66 a year earlier.\n\n_A conference call to discuss second quarter 2024_ _results will be held at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on July 23, 2024._ Those wishing to participate in the call may dial toll-free for the United States at 1-833-470-1428, and for Canada at 1-833-950-0062, Access code 332275.

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation.  \n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation**\n\nTangible book value per share is a non-GAAP financial measure derived from GAAP-based amounts. We calculate tangible book value by excluding the balance of intangible assets from total shareholders’ equity divided by shares outstanding. We believe that this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies, which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios. Additionally, we believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in relative changes from period to period in equity exclusive of changes in intangible assets.\n\nTangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end is a non-GAAP financial measure derived from GAAP-based amounts. We calculate tangible equity and tangible assets by excluding the balance of intangible assets from total shareholders’ equity and total assets, respectively. We calculate tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end by dividing tangible equity by tangible assets at period end. We believe that this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies, which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios. Additionally, we believe that this measure is important to many investors in the marketplace who are interested in relative changes from period to period in equity and total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets.\n\nNet interest income is commonly presented on a taxable equivalent basis. That is, to the extent that some component of the institution’s net interest income will be exempt from taxation (e.g., was received by the institution as a result of its holdings of state or municipal obligations), an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from that component is added back to the net interest income total. Management considers this adjustment helpful to investors in comparing one financial institution’s net interest income (pre- tax) to that of another institution, as each will have a different proportion of tax-exempt items in their portfolios. Moreover, net interest income is itself a component of another financial measure commonly used by financial institutions, net interest margin, which is the ratio of net interest income to average interest earning assets. Additionally, management and many financial institutions also present net interest spread, which is the average yield on interest earning assets minus the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities. For purposes of these measures as well, taxable equivalent net interest income is generally used by financial institutions, again to provide investors with a better basis of comparison from institution to institution. We calculate taxable equivalent net interest margin by dividing net interest income, adjusted to include the benefit of non-taxable interest income, by average interest earning assets. We calculate taxable equivalent net interest spread as the difference between average yield on interest earning assets, adjusted to include the benefit of non-taxable interest income, and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities.\n\nThe efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure of expense control relative to revenue from net interest income and non-interest fee income. We calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing total noninterest expenses as determined under GAAP, excluding other real estate expense, net, by net interest income (fully taxable equivalent) and total noninterest income as determined under GAAP, excluding unrealized gains recognized on equity securities. We believe that this provides a reasonable measure of primary banking expenses relative to primary banking revenue. Additionally, we believe this measure is important to investors looking for a measure of efficiency in our productivity measured by the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent.\n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is important to investors and that is useful in understanding our financial results. Our management internally assesses our performance based, in part, on these measures. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for these measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures of tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets, and efficiency ratio to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is set forth below. We have not presented a reconciliation of taxable equivalent net interest income, taxable equivalent net interest margin or taxable equivalent net interest spread to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, as there was no difference between the taxable equivalent measure and comparable GAAP measure for any period presented in this release.\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES RECONCILIATION**  \n---  \n(dollars in thousands)  \n(Unaudited)  \n**6/30/2024**| **3/31/2024**| **6/30/2023**  \n**Tangible Book Value Per Share**  \nEquity (GAAP)| $| 655,168| $| 649,190| $| 621,389  \nLess: Intangible assets| 553| 553| 553  \nTangible equity (Non-GAAP)| $| 654,615| $| 648,637| $| 620,836  \nShares outstanding| 19,010| 19,024| 19,024  \nTangible book value per share| 34.44| 34.10| 32.63  \nBook value per share| 34.46| 34.12| 32.66  \n**Tangible Equity to Tangible Assets**  \nTotal Assets (GAAP)| $| 6,106,644| $| 6,179,570| $| 6,075,625  \nLess: Intangible assets| 553| 553| 553  \nTangible assets (Non-GAAP)| $| 6,106,091| $| 6,179,017| $| 6,075,072  \nTangible Equity to Tangible Assets (Non-GAAP)| 10.72| %| 10.50| %| 10.22| %  \nEquity to Assets (GAAP)| 10.73| %| 10.51| %| 10.23| %  \n**Three months ended**| **Six Months Ended**  \n**Efficiency Ratio**| **6/30/2024**| **3/31/2024**| **6/30/2023**| **6/30/2024**| **6/30/2023**  \nNet interest income (GAAP)| $| 37,788| $| 36,578| $| 44,052| $| 74,366| $| 91,017  \nTaxable equivalent adjustment| -| -| -| -| -  \nNet interest income (fully taxable equivalent) (Non-GAAP)| 37,788| 36,578| 44,052| 74,366| 91,017  \nNon-interest income (GAAP)| 5,651| 4,843| 4,598| 10,494| 9,267  \nLess: Unrealized gains recognized on equity securities| 1,360| -| -| 1,360| -  \nRevenue used for efficiency ratio (Non-GAAP)| $| 42,079| $| 41,421| $| 48,650| $| 83,500| $| 100,284  \nTotal noninterest expense (GAAP)| $| 26,459| $| 24,903| $| 27,327| $| 51,362| $| 55,006  \nLess: Other real estate expense, net| 16| 74| 148| 90| 373  \nExpense used for efficiency ratio (Non-GAAP)| $| 26,443| $| 24,829| $| 27,179| $| 51,272| $| 54,633  \nEfficiency Ratio| 62.84| %| 59.94| %| 55.87| %| 61.40| %| 54.48| %  \n  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTE5MTUyMiM2Mzc0OTY3IzIwMTY4MDk=) ![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MGYyYzg1ZjAtZmZlMS00YzExLTgwZDAtYWM0ZTY1ODllNGJkLTEwMjgzODI=/tiny/TrustCo-Bank-Corp-NY.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/7b8fe8d6-f016-40cd-86a2-53de114d9819/small/trustco-bank-corp-ny-logo.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/7b8fe8d6-f016-40cd-86a2-53de114d9819)\n\nSource: TrustCo Bank Corp NY \n\n##### Contact Information\n\nTrustCo Bank Corp NY 5 Sarnowski Drive Glenville, NY 12302 \n\n_Transfer Agent:_ Computershare P.O.
