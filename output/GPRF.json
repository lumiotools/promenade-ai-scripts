The Stress Test Results do not represent the\nfirm’s forecasts of actual expected gains, losses, pre-provision net revenue, net income before taxes, capital, capital actions, risk-\nweighted assets or capital ratios\n▪ The estimated results contained herein may not align with those produced by the FRB, even where the same hypothetical stress\nscenario is used, due to differences in methodologies and assumptions used to produce those estimates. In addition, the results\ncontained herein may not be comparable to results of prior stress tests conducted by the firm or the FRB due to, among other factors,\nchanges in applicable hypothetical stress scenarios, methodological changes, changes in applicable assumptions and changes in the\nfirm's business and exposures\n▪ For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm’s future business, results and financial condition,\nsee “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. You should also read the cautionary\nnotes on forward-looking statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024\n▪ The statements in the presentation are current only as of the date the presentation was posted to the firm’s website and the firm does\nnot undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of subsequent events or circumstances\n1\n2024 Annual Dodd-Frank Act Company-Run Stress Test Disclosure\nTable of Contents\nOverview & Requirements ...............................................................................................................................3\nMaterial Risks Captured ...................................................................................................................................5\nProjection Methodologies ................................................................................................................................6\nSupervisory Scenario Overview ......................................................................................................................9\nSummary of Results .......................................................................................................................................11\n2\n2024 Annual Dodd-Frank Act Company-Run Stress Test Disclosure\nOverview & Requirements\nDFAST Requirements\n▪ The company-run U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) Stress Tests (DFAST) are\nconducted annually and completed in April of each year. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (we, us, or our) and Goldman Sachs Bank\nUSA are currently required to conduct stress tests using a set of macroeconomic scenarios (Supervisory Baseline and Supervisory\nSeverely Adverse) developed by the FRB\n▪ In addition, as part of our capital plan submitted to the FRB in connection with its annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(CCAR), we are also required to assess our capital adequacy under internally developed Baseline and Severely Adverse scenarios\n▪ We are required to calculate our 2024 DFAST in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). These regulations are\nlargely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III)\nand also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital and leverage\nratios that compare measures of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets and off-balance sheet exposures\n▪ We are required to calculate the following results, excluding the impact of material business plan changes, for all quarters of the\nplanning horizon:\n▪ Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with the Standardized approach and\nmarket risk rules set out in the Capital Framework (together, the Standardized Capital Rules)\n▪ Tier 1 leverage ratio, using the Capital Framework definition of Tier 1 capital in the numerator and average adjusted total assets\n(which includes adjustments for certain capital deductions) in the denominator\n▪ Supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), which includes the Capital Framework definition of Tier 1 capital in the numerator and a\nmeasure of leverage exposure consisting of average adjusted total assets and certain off-balance sheet and other exposures in the\ndenominator (which include a measure of derivatives, securities financing transactions, commitments and guarantees) less certain\nbalance sheet deductions\n▪ The planning horizon for the 2024 DFAST is the first quarter of 2024 through the first quarter of 2026\n3\n2024 Annual Dodd-Frank Act Company-Run Stress Test Disclosure\nOverview & Requirements\nGlobal Market Shock & Large Counterparty Default\n▪ Firms with significant trading activity, such as us, must include in their DFAST Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario a Global Market\nShock (GMS) that assesses potential losses associated with trading positions, private equity positions and counterparty exposures.\nAdditionally, firms subject to the GMS must apply the shock as of a specified point in time, which results in an instantaneous loss and a\nreduction in capital at the start of the planning horizon\n▪ Firms with substantial trading or processing and custodian operations, such as us, are also required to incorporate a counterparty\ndefault scenario component into their Supervisory Severely Adverse stress scenario. Firms subject to the counterparty default scenario\ncomponent are required to estimate and report the potential losses and related effects on capital associated with the instantaneous and\nunexpected default of the counterparty that would generate the largest losses across its derivatives and securities financing\ntransactions, including securities lending and repurchase agreement activities\nCapital Actions\n▪ Results incorporate capital action assumptions as prescribed by the FRB’s DFAST rules, which assume no dividends on instruments\nthat qualify as CET1 capital, no redemptions or repurchases of any capital instrument that is eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a\nregulatory capital ratio, and no issuances of common stock or preferred stock\n▪ The FRB's DFAST rules also assume payments are made on instruments that qualify as additional Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital equal to\nthe stated dividend, interest, or principal due on such instrument\nStress Capital Buffer (SCB)\n▪ SCB is measured as the difference between the starting and lowest projected CET1 capital ratio in the Supervisory Severely Adverse\nscenario, as calculated by the FRB, plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of RWAs, subject to a 2.5%\nfloor. This disclosure does not include detail on the SCB, which will be released by the FRB by the end of August\n4\n2024 Annual Dodd-Frank Act Company-Run Stress Test Disclosure\nMaterial Risks Captured\nRisk Type Explanation Incorporation into Supervisory Scenarios\nAdverse impact to our earnings due to changes ▪ In the first quarter, we apply the GMS to certain fair value positions\nin market conditions.

Each of the three segments below has a unique combination of\nbusiness activities that respond differently under various macroeconomic scenarios\n▪ We also incorporate the impact of industry performance during historical stressed periods to help guide management’s judgment\nSegment Description\nGBM provides a broad range of advisory and underwriting services to a diverse group of clients. Services include strategic\nadvisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and\nspin-offs, and equity and debt underwriting of public offerings and private placements. GBM also facilitates client transactions\nGlobal Banking &\nand makes markets in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. In addition, GBM makes markets in, and clears\nMarkets\nclient transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide and provides prime financing, portfolio financing\n(GBM)\nand other type of equity financing. GBM also lends to corporate clients, provides commodity financing through structured\ntransactions, financing through securities purchases under agreements to resell, and makes equity and debt investments\nrelated to GBM activities\nAWM manages assets and offers investment products across all major asset classes to a diverse set of institutional and\nindividual clients. AWM provides investing and wealth advisory solutions, including financial planning and counseling, and\nAsset & Wealth\nexecuting brokerage transactions for wealth management clients. AWM issues loans to wealth management clients and\nManagement\naccepts deposits through its consumer banking digital platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, and through its private bank. AWM\n(AWM)\nalso makes equity investments, invests in debt instruments, engages in lending activities and provides financing for real estate\nand other assets\nPS issues credit cards through partnership arrangements, accepts deposits from Apple Card customers and provides\nPlatform Solutions\ntransaction banking and other services, including cash management services, such as deposit-taking and payment solutions\n(PS)\nfor corporate and institutional clients\n6\n2024 Annual Dodd-Frank Act Company-Run Stress Test Disclosure\nProjection Methodologies\nPPNR - Operating Expenses\n▪ Operating expense projections include:\n▪ Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards\nand other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net\nrevenues, net of provisions for credit losses, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of\nour share-based compensation programs and the external environment\n▪ Expenses that vary based on the overall operating environment, such as transaction based expenses, which reflect changes in\nlevels of business activity, market development costs and professional fees\n▪ Expenses that relate to our global footprint and overall headcount levels, such as depreciation and amortization, occupancy, and\ncommunication and technology costs\n▪ Operational risk losses, including litigation reserves (and corresponding legal fees), as well as any projected impairments of non-\nfinancial assets\nProvisions for Loan Losses\n▪ Provisions for loan losses are projected over the planning horizon using a comprehensive model-based approach for both wholesale and\nconsumer lending activities. The wholesale model estimates losses based on projections of the probability of default, loss given default\nand exposure at default, which is segmented by industry classification and region for loans and lending commitments accounted for at\namortized cost. The consumer lending model estimates losses based on projected growth and changes in borrower credit quality\n▪ As required by FRB instruction, our calculation of provisions incorporates our implementation of the Current Expected Credit Loss\n(CECL) standard. The FRB's calculations will not incorporate this methodology or its impact on provisions in 2024 DFAST\n7\n2024 Annual Dodd-Frank Act Company-Run Stress Test Disclosure\nProjection Methodologies\nTrading & Counterparty Losses\n▪ Trading & Counterparty Losses include mark-to-market losses, trading incremental default risk losses on positions held at fair value and\nchanges in CVA and other counterparty credit losses as a result of the GMS, as well as the impact of the counterparty default scenario.\nSubsequent trading incremental default risk losses over the course of the macroeconomic scenario are also included. We use our\nexisting stress testing and risk management infrastructure to calculate the impact of the GMS and to quantify the impact of the\ncounterparty default scenario\nOther Losses\n▪ Other Losses primarily include projected changes over the course of the macroeconomic scenario in the fair value of non-trading loans\nand lending commitments, which are held for sale or accounted for under the fair value option, as well as their associated hedges, which\nare not subject to the GMS\nBalance Sheet\n▪ Balance sheet projections are based on the macroeconomic environment and incorporate input from businesses on growth\nassumptions, planned activity, changes to carrying values as a result of marking our inventory to market, and management’s judgment\nas to how we manage our balance sheet, funding and liquidity over the course of the macroeconomic scenario\nCapital and RWAs\n▪ Capital projections incorporate projected net earnings, capital deductions and other changes in equity, and capital actions required by\nthe DFAST rules. Projected RWAs reflect the impact of the macroeconomic environment, such as changes in volatilities and credit\nspreads. Additionally, projected RWAs and capital deductions are also impacted by the projected size and composition of our balance\nsheet over the course of the macroeconomic scenario\n8\n2024 Annual Dodd-Frank Act Company-Run Stress Test Disclosure\nSupervisory Severely Adverse Scenario Overview\n▪ The Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario is characterized by a severe global recession accompanied by a period of heightened stress\nin commercial real estate and corporate debt markets\n▪ This is a hypothetical scenario designed to assess the strength of banking organizations and their resilience to unfavorable economic\nconditions and does not represent a forecast of the FRB\n▪ Further information about the Supervisory Severely Adverse scenario is available on the FRB's website http://www.federalreserve.gov\nOverview of Supervisory Severely Adverse Scenario\n▪ The U.S. unemployment rate climbs to a peak of 10% in 3Q25\nUnemployment, ▪ Real GDP declines 8.5% from the 4Q23 to its trough in 1Q25\nGDP and CPI\n▪ The decline in activity is accompanied by a lower Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation, which quickly falls to an annual rate of\nabout 1.3% in 3Q24 and gradually increases above 1.6% by the end of the scenario\n• Interest rates decline across regions, short-term rates fall significantly to near zero by 3Q24 and remain there for the remainder of\nInterest\nthe scenario.
