Historically, we began as a hardware peripheral company but have transitioned into a comprehensive data capture organization. Our evolution has enabled us to generate revenue through software solutions, as well as hardware solutions like barcode scanners and NFC/RFID readers. Initially building our foundation on hardware, we later expanded into software, creating a robust, integrated offering that covers all aspects of data capture for our customers.\n\nOur solutions are incorporated into mobile applications used in point of sale (POS), commercial services (field workers), asset tracking, manufacturing, and quality control processes, transportation and logistics (goods tracking and movement), event management (ticketing, entry, access control, and identification), medical and education. All products work with applications running on smartphones, mobile computers, and tablets using operating systems from Apple® (iOS), GoogleTM (AndroidTM), and Microsoft® (Windows®). We offer an easy-to-use software developer kit (CaptureSDK) to application developers, enabling them to provide their users with our advanced barcode scanning and NFC/RFID reader features.\n\nSocket Mobile is headquartered in Fremont, CA, and can be reached at [+1-510-933-3000](tel:+1 510 933 3000) or [www.socketmobile.com](/home).
