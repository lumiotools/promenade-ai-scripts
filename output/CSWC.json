Capital Southwest also granted the underwriters of the notes an option to purchase up to an additional $30,000,000 principal amount of notes, solely to cover over-allotments. The sale of the notes is expected to close on November 8, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nThe notes will be senior unsecured obligations of Capital Southwest and will accrue interest payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2025 at a rate of 5.125%. The notes will mature on November 15, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.\n\nNoteholders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date.\n\nUpon conversion, Capital Southwest will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Capital Southwest’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Capital Southwest’s common stock, at Capital Southwest’s election. The conversion rate will initially be 40.0000 shares of Capital Southwest’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of $25.00 per share of Capital Southwest’s common stock). The initial conversion price of the notes represents a premium of approximately 12% over the last reported sale price of Capital Southwest’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 4, 2024. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if Capital Southwest delivers a notice of redemption, Capital Southwest will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a noteholder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event or notice of redemption, as the case may be.\n\nCapital Southwest may not redeem the notes prior to November 20, 2027. Capital Southwest may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes (subject to certain limitations), at Capital Southwest’s option, on a redemption date on or after November 20, 2027 and on or before the 45th scheduled trading day immediately prior to the maturity date if the last reported sale price of Capital Southwest’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which Capital Southwest provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, _plus_ accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the notes.\n\nIf Capital Southwest undergoes a fundamental change, then, subject to certain conditions, noteholders may require Capital Southwest to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, _plus_ accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\n\nCapital Southwest estimates that the proceeds from the offering will be approximately $193.6 million (or approximately $222.7 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional notes in full), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable by Capital Southwest. Capital Southwest expects to use the net proceeds from the offering to redeem in full its 4.50% Notes due 2026, to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under its senior secured revolving credit facility with ING Capital LLC, and for general corporate purposes.\n\nOppenheimer & Co. is acting as sole book-running manager for the offering.\n\nThe proposed offering is being conducted pursuant to Capital Southwest’s automatic shelf registration statement on Form N-2, including a base prospectus, that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 29, 2024 and became effective upon filing. A preliminary prospectus and accompanying prospectus relating to the proposed offering were filed with the SEC and are available for free on the SEC’s website located at http://www.sec.gov.

Our portfolio continued to perform well, producing $0.64 of pre-tax net investment income per share for the quarter, which earned both our $0.58 per share regular dividend and our $0.06 per share supplemental dividend paid for the quarter. Originations for the quarter were $90 million, offset by $45 million in prepayments. Due to delayed deal closings past the end of the September quarter, as well as an exceptionally strong current backlog of deals in diligence, we expect very robust net portfolio growth for the quarter ending December 31, 2024. In consideration of the strong performance of our portfolio, the Board of Directors has again declared a regular dividend of $0.58 per share for the quarter ending December 31, 2024. Our Board of Directors has also declared a supplemental dividend of $0.05 per share for the quarter ending December 31, 2024, resulting in total dividends for the quarter ending December 31, 2024 of $0.63 per share. While future dividend declarations are at the discretion of our Board of Directors, it is our intent to continue to distribute quarterly supplemental dividends for the foreseeable future. Finally, we continued our capital raising track record during the quarter raising over $20 million on our Equity ATM Program and adding $25 million in new commitments to our Corporate Credit Facility.”\n\n**_Second Quarter Fiscal Year Investment Activities_**\n\n**_Originations_**\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company originated $89.8 million in new commitments, consisting of investments in four new portfolio companies totaling $73.0 million and add-on commitments in 11 portfolio companies totaling $16.8 million. New portfolio company investment transactions that closed during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 are summarized as follows:\n\n**_InSure Home Corporation_****, $25.0 million 1****st****Lien Senior Secured Debt:** The company is an insurance holding company owning vertically integrated, diversified specialty insurance service entities and risk bearing insurance carriers.\n\n**_Campany Roof Maintenance, LLC_****, $12.9 million 1****st****Lien Senior Secured Debt, $1.1 million Revolving Loan, $6.0 million Delayed Draw Term Loan, $0.3 million Preferred Equity:** The company is a commercial and residential reroofing and roof maintenance company.\n\n**_LEHR Upfitters, LLC_****, $10.0 million 1****st****Lien Senior Secured Debt, $1.7 million Revolving Loan, $5.2 million Delayed Draw Term Loan, $0.7 million Preferred Equity:** The company provides regional vehicular upfitting services and wholesale parts to law enforcement, departments of transit and fire/EMS departments across the West and Pacific Northwest regions.\n\n**_UPS Intermediate, LLC_****, $10.0 million Split Lien Term Loan:** The company provides maintenance, repair and overhaul services for a comprehensive range of industrial rotating equipment.\n\n**_Prepayments and Exits_**\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company received full prepayments on four debt investments totaling $45.2 million.\n\n**Acceleration, LLC:** Proceeds of $26.6 million, generating an IRR of 16.1%.\n\n**South Coast Terminals, LLC:** Proceeds of $14.4 million, generating an IRR of 11.3%.\n\n**Retail Services WIS Corporation:** Proceeds of $2.6 million, generating an IRR of 17.2%.\n\n**ADS Tactical, Inc.:** Proceeds of $1.6 million, generating an IRR of 15.6%.\n\n**_Second Fiscal Quarter 2025 Operating Results_**\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Capital Southwest reported total investment income of $48.7 million, compared to $51.4 million in the prior quarter. The decrease in investment income was primarily attributable to a decrease in distributions received from our equity investments, as well as a decrease in amendment and prepayment fees received during the quarter.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, total operating expenses (excluding interest expense) were $6.1 million, compared to $7.6 million in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in accrued bonus compensation in the current quarter and a decrease in professional fees primarily due to non-recurring fees incurred in the previous quarter in connection with the compensation consultant engaged by the Compensation Committee.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, interest expense was $12.6 million, compared to $12.4 million in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average debt outstanding.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, total pre-tax net investment income was $30.0 million, compared to $31.3 million in the prior quarter.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there was a tax benefit of $1.2 million, compared to a tax provision of $2.4 million in the prior quarter. The benefit includes a $1.5 million deferred tax benefit, which is primarily attributable to an increase in the tax basis of investments held at the Taxable Subsidiary due to pass-through income, resulting in a decrease in tax appreciation.\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Capital Southwest recorded total net realized and unrealized losses on investments of $8.5 million, compared to $14.8 million of total net realized and unrealized losses in the prior quarter. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the total net realized and unrealized losses on investments reflected net realized and unrealized losses on debt investments of $7.2 million and net realized and unrealized losses on equity investments of $1.3 million. The net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $22.7 million for the quarter, compared to $14.0 million in the prior quarter.\n\nThe Company’s NAV at September 30, 2024 was $16.59 per share, as compared to $16.60 the prior quarter. The decrease in NAV per share from the prior quarter is primarily due to net realized and unrealized losses on investments, partially offset by the issuance of common stock at a premium to NAV per share through the Equity ATM Program (as described below).\n\n**_Liquidity and Capital Resources_**\n\nAt September 30, 2024, Capital Southwest had approximately $47.2 million in unrestricted cash and money market balances and $406.2 million of unused capacity under the Corporate Credit Facility (as defined below) and the SPV Credit Facility (as defined below). The regulatory debt to equity ratio at the end of the quarter was 0.80 to 1.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Capital Southwest had the following borrowings outstanding:\n\n  * $200.0 million of total debt outstanding on the Corporate Credit Facility\n  * $78.0 million of total debt outstanding on the SPV Credit Facility\n  * $139.6 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of the 4.50% Notes due January 2026\n  * $148.5 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of the 3.375% Notes due October 2026\n  * $69.9 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of the 7.75% Notes due August 2028\n  * $149.1 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of SBA Debentures (as defined below)\n\n\n\nIn August 2016, CSWC entered into a senior secured credit facility (the “Corporate Credit Facility”) to provide additional liquidity to support its investment and operational activities. Borrowings under the Corporate Credit Facility accrue interest on a per annum basis at a rate equal to the applicable SOFR rate plus 2.15%. On August 2, 2023, CSWC entered into the Third Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") that (1) increased commitments under the Corporate Credit Facility from $400 million to $435 million; (2) added an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the maximum commitments up to $750 million; (3) extended the end of the Corporate Credit Facility's revolving period from August 9, 2025 to August 2, 2027 and extended the final maturity from August 9, 2026 to August 2, 2028; and (4) amended several financial covenants. On December 7, 2023, the Company entered into an Incremental Commitment and Assumption Agreement that increased the total commitments under the accordion feature of the Credit Agreement by $25 million, which increased total commitments from $435 million to $460 million. The $25 million increase was provided by one new lender, bringing the total bank syndicate to ten participants.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement (the \"Amendment\"). The Amendment amended the Credit Agreement and other related loan documents to, among other things, permit the Company to enter into special purpose vehicle financings and exclude assets held by any such special purpose vehicle from the assets pledged as collateral securing the Corporate Credit Facility.\n\nOn September 12, 2024, the Company entered into an Incremental Commitment and Assumption Agreement that increased the total commitments under the accordion feature of the Credit Agreement by $25 million, which increased total commitments from $460 million to $485 million. The $25 million increase was provided by one new lender, bringing the total bank syndicate to 11 participants.\n\nOn February 2, 2024, the Company formed Capital Southwest SPV LLC (\"SPV\"). SPV is a wholly owned special purpose vehicle that was formed to hold investments for the SPV Credit Facility (as defined below) to support our investment and operating activities. On March 20, 2024, SPV entered into a special purpose vehicle financing credit facility (the \"SPV Credit Facility\"). The SPV Credit Facility included an initial commitment of $150 million. Pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, on June 20, 2024, total commitments automatically increased from $150 million to $200 million. The SPV Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature that allows increases up to $400 million of total commitments from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments. Borrowings under the SPV Credit Facility bear interest at three-month Term SOFR plus 2.50% per annum during the revolving period ending on March 20, 2027 and three-month Term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.85% thereafter. SPV (i) paid unused commitment fees of 0.10% through April 20, 2024 and (ii) pays unused commitment fees of 0.35% thereafter, on the unused lender commitments under the SPV Credit Facility, in addition to other customary fees. Under the SPV Credit Facility, SPV also pays a utilization fee based on the amount of borrowings utilized. The SPV Credit Facility matures on March 20, 2029.\n\nThe Company has an \"at-the-market\" offering (the \"Equity ATM Program\"), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through sales agents, shares of its common stock. On May 21, 2024, the Company increased the maximum amount of shares of its common stock to be sold through the Equity ATM Program from $650 million to $1 billion. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 839,099 shares of its common stock under the Equity ATM Program at a weighted-average price of $24.49 per share, raising $20.6 million of gross proceeds. Net proceeds were $20.2 million after commissions to the sales agents on shares sold. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has $412.2 million available under the Equity ATM Program.\n\nOn April 20, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, Capital Southwest SBIC I, LP (“SBIC I”), received a license from the Small Business Administration (the \"SBA\") to operate as a Small Business Investment Company (\"SBIC\") under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. The SBIC license allows SBIC I to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures (\"SBA Debentures\"), subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA. SBA debentures are loans issued to an SBIC that have interest payable semi-annually and a ten-year maturity. The interest rate is fixed shortly after issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten-year maturities. On December 20, 2023, SBIC I received an additional leverage commitment in the amount of $45.0 million to be issued on or prior to September 30, 2028. As of September 30, 2024, SBIC I had a total leverage commitment from the SBA in the amount of $175.0 million, of which $22.0 million remains unused.\n\n**_Share Repurchase Program_**\n\nOn July 28, 2021, the Company's board of directors (the \"Board\") approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $20 million of its outstanding shares of common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below its NAV per share, in accordance with guidelines specified in Rules 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B) and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Our portfolio continued to perform well, producing $0.69 of pre-tax net investment income per share for the quarter, which more than earned both our $0.57 per share regular dividend and our $0.06 per share supplemental dividend paid for the quarter. In consideration of the strong performance of our portfolio, the Board of Directors has increased the regular quarterly dividend to $0.58 per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2024. Given the continued excess earnings being generated by our portfolio, our Board of Directors has also declared a supplemental dividend of $0.06 per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2024, resulting in total dividends for the quarter ending September 30, 2024 of $0.64 per share. While future dividend declarations are at the discretion of our Board of Directors, it is our intent to continue to distribute quarterly supplemental dividends for the foreseeable future while base rates remain materially above long-term historical averages and we have a meaningful UTI balance. Finally, we continued our capital raising track record during the quarter raising over $38 million on our Equity ATM Program and adding $50 million in new commitments to our SPV Credit Facility, all resulting in Capital Southwest's balance sheet liquidity being at an all time high of $485 million.”\n\n**First Quarter Fiscal Year Investment Activities**\n\n**Originations**\n\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company originated $108.1 million in new commitments, consisting of investments in three new portfolio companies totaling $49.3 million and add-on commitments in 11 portfolio companies totaling $58.8 million. New portfolio company investment transactions that closed during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 are summarized as follows:\n\n**SureKap, LLC****, $16.2 million 1****st****Lien Senior Secured Debt, $5.0 million Revolving Loan, $8.8 million Delayed Draw Term Loan, $0.5 million Common Equity: **The company is a manufacturer of high quality packaging equipment.\n\n**Brandner Design LLC****, $8.8 million 1****st****Lien Senior Secured Debt, $1.0 million Revolving Loan, Co****mmon Equity****:** The company designs, manufactures and installs luxury-class architectural elements in residential and commercial settings.\n\n**TalkNY Management Holdings, LLC****, $7.5 million 1****st****Lien Senior Secured Debt, $1.5 million Preferred Equity: **The company is a provider of mental health teletherapy services to patients in the New York City metro area.\n\n**Prepayments and Exits**\n\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company received full prepayments on eight debt investments totaling $77.2 million.\n\n**The Producto Group : **Proceeds of $16.4 million, generating an IRR of 14.9%.\n\n**Outerbox, LLC : **Proceeds of $14.6 million, generating an IRR of 13.6%.\n\n**USA Debusk, LLC : **Proceeds of $13.0 million, generating an IRR of 9.9%.\n\n**Opco Borrower, LLC : **Proceeds of $11.7 million, generating an IRR of 14.2%.\n\n**Infolinks Media, LP : **Proceeds of $8.2 million, generating an IRR of 11.1%.\n\n**RTIC Subsidiary Holdings, LLC : **Proceeds of $5.7 million, generating an IRR of 11.8%.\n\n**Intermedia Holdings, Inc. : **Proceeds of $5.2 million, generating an IRR of 9.2%.\n\n**Vida Capital, Inc. : **Proceeds of $2.4 million, generating an IRR of 8.8%.\n\n**First Fiscal Quarter 2025 Operating Results**\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024, Capital Southwest reported total investment income of $51.4 million, compared to $46.4 million in the prior quarter. The increase in investment income was primarily attributable to an increase in the average monthly cost basis of investments held, an increase in amendment fees received during the quarter, and an increase in distributions received from our equity investments.\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024, total operating expenses (excluding interest expense) were $7.6 million, compared to $5.2 million in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in accrued bonus compensation in the current quarter, an increase in audit fees and an increase in professional fees incurred in connection with the compensation consultant engaged by the Compensation Committee.\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024, interest expense was $12.4 million, compared to $11.5 million in the prior quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average debt outstanding and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on total debt.\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024, total pre-tax net investment income was $31.3 million, compared to $29.8 million in the prior quarter.\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024, there was a tax provision of $2.4 million, compared to $0.4 million in the prior quarter. The provision includes a $2.2 million deferred tax expense, which is primarily attributable to a decrease in the tax basis of investments held at the Taxable Subsidiary, resulting in an increase in tax appreciation.\n\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2024, Capital Southwest recorded total net realized and unrealized losses on investments of $14.8 million, compared to $15.9 million of total net realized and unrealized losses in the prior quarter. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the total net realized and unrealized losses on investments reflected net realized and unrealized losses on debt investments of $10.1 million and net realized and unrealized losses on equity investments of $4.7 million. The net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $14.0 million for the quarter, compared to $13.5 million in the prior quarter.\n\nThe Company’s NAV at June 30, 2024 was $16.60 per share, as compared to $16.77 the prior quarter. The decrease in NAV per share from the prior quarter is primarily due to net realized and unrealized losses on investments, partially offset by pre-tax net investment income in excess of dividends paid, as well as the issuance of common stock at a premium to NAV per share through the Equity ATM Program (as described below).\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAt June 30, 2024, Capital Southwest had approximately $33.3 million in unrestricted cash and money market balances and $430.2 million of unused capacity under the Corporate Credit Facility (as defined below) and the SPV Credit Facility (as defined below). The regulatory debt to equity ratio at the end of the quarter was 0.75 to 1.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Capital Southwest had the following borrowings outstanding:\n\n  * $165.0 million of total debt outstanding on the Corporate Credit Facility\n  * $64.0 million of total debt outstanding on the SPV Credit Facility\n  * $139.5 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of the 4.50% Notes due January 2026\n  * $148.3 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of the 3.375% Notes due October 2026\n  * $69.8 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of the 7.75% Notes due August 2028\n  * $148.9 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of SBA Debentures (as defined below)\n\n\n\nIn August 2016, CSWC entered into a senior secured credit facility (the “Corporate Credit Facility”) to provide additional liquidity to support its investment and operational activities. Borrowings under the Corporate Credit Facility accrue interest on a per annum basis at a rate equal to the applicable SOFR rate plus 2.15%. On August 2, 2023, CSWC entered into the Third Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") that (1) increased commitments under the Corporate Credit Facility from $400 million to $435 million; (2) added an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the maximum commitments up to $750 million; (3) extended the end of the Corporate Credit Facility's revolving period from August 9, 2025 to August 2, 2027 and extended the final maturity from August 9, 2026 to August 2, 2028; and (4) amended several financial covenants. On December 7, 2023, the Company entered into an Incremental Commitment and Assumption Agreement that increased the total commitments under the accordion feature of the Credit Agreement by $25 million, which increased total commitments from $435 million to $460 million. The $25 million increase was provided by one new lender, bringing the total bank syndicate to ten participants.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement (the \"Amendment\"). The Amendment amended the Credit Agreement and other related loan documents to, among other things, permit the Company to enter into special purpose vehicle financings and exclude assets held by any such special purpose vehicle from the assets pledged as collateral securing the Corporate Credit Facility.\n\nOn February 2, 2024, the Company formed Capital Southwest SPV LLC (\"SPV\"). SPV is a wholly owned special purpose vehicle that was formed to hold investments for the SPV Credit Facility (as defined below) to support our investment and operating activities. On March 20, 2024, SPV entered into a special purpose vehicle financing credit facility (the \"SPV Credit Facility\"). The SPV Credit Facility included an initial commitment of $150 million. Pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement, on June 20, 2024, total commitments automatically increased from $150 million to $200 million. The SPV Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature that allows increases up to $400 million of total commitments from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments. Borrowings under the SPV Credit Facility bear interest at three-month Term SOFR plus 2.50% per annum during the revolving period ending on March 20, 2027 and three-month Term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.85% thereafter. SPV (i) paid unused commitment fees of 0.10% through April 20, 2024 and (ii) pays unused commitment fees of 0.35% thereafter, on the unused lender commitments under the SPV Credit Facility, in addition to other customary fees. The SPV Credit Facility matures on March 20, 2029.\n\nThe Company has an \"at-the-market\" offering (the \"Equity ATM Program\"), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through sales agents, shares of its common stock. On May 21, 2024, the Company increased the maximum amount of shares of its common stock to be sold through the Equity ATM Program from $650 million to $1 billion. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company sold 1,498,981 shares of its common stock under the Equity ATM Program at a weighted-average price of $25.60 per share, raising $38.4 million of gross proceeds. Net proceeds were $37.8 million after commissions to the sales agents on shares sold. As of June 30, 2024, the Company has $432.7 million available under the Equity ATM Program.\n\nOn April 20, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, Capital Southwest SBIC I, LP (“SBIC I”), received a license from the Small Business Administration (the \"SBA\") to operate as a Small Business Investment Company (\"SBIC\") under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. The SBIC license allows SBIC I to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures (\"SBA Debentures\"), subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA. SBA debentures are loans issued to an SBIC that have interest payable semi-annually and a ten-year maturity. The interest rate is fixed shortly after issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten-year maturities. On December 20, 2023, SBIC I received an additional leverage commitment in the amount of $45.0 million to be issued on or prior to September 30, 2028. As of June 30, 2024, SBIC I had a total leverage commitment from the SBA in the amount of $175.0 million, of which $22.0 million remains unused.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program**\n\nOn July 28, 2021, the Company's board of directors (the \"Board\") approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $20 million of its outstanding shares of common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below its NAV per share, in accordance with guidelines specified in Rules 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B) and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On August 31, 2021, the Company entered into a share repurchase agreement, which became effective immediately, and the Company will cease purchasing its common stock under the share repurchase program upon the earlier of, among other things: (1) the date on which the aggregate purchase price for all shares equals $20 million including, without limitation, all applicable fees, costs and expenses; or (2) upon written notice by the Company to the broker that the share repurchase agreement is terminated. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of the Company’s common stock under the share repurchase program.\n\n**Regular Dividend of $0.58 Per Share and Supplemental Dividend of $0.06 Per Share for Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nOn July 30, 2024, the Board declared a total dividend of $0.64 per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2024, comprised of a Regular Dividend of $0.58 per share and a Supplemental Dividend of $0.06 per share.\n\nThe Company's dividend will be payable as follows:\n\nRegular Dividend  \n---  \nAmount Per Share: | $0.58  \nEx-Dividend Date: | September 13, 2024  \nRecord Date: | September 13, 2024  \nPayment Date: | September 30, 2024  \nSupplemental Dividend  \nAmount Per Share: | $0.06  \nEx-Dividend Date: | September 13, 2024  \nRecord Date: | September 13, 2024  \nPayment Date: | September 30, 2024  \n  \nWhen declaring dividends, the Board reviews estimates of taxable income available for distribution, which may differ from net investment income under generally accepted accounting principles. The final determination of taxable income for each year, as well as the tax attributes for dividends in such year, will be made after the close of the tax year.\n\nCapital Southwest maintains a dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\") that provides for the reinvestment of dividends on behalf of its registered stockholders who hold their shares with Capital Southwest’s transfer agent and registrar, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company. Under the DRIP, if the Company declares a dividend, registered stockholders who have opted into the DRIP by the dividend record date will have their dividend automatically reinvested into additional shares of Capital Southwest common stock. \n\n**First Quarter 2025 Earnings Results Conference Call and Webcast**\n\nCapital Southwest has scheduled a conference call on Tuesday, August 6, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the first quarter 2025 financial results.

Our portfolio continued to perform well, producing $0.68 of pre-tax net investment income for the quarter, which more than earned both our $0.57 per share regular dividend and our $0.06 per share supplemental dividend paid for the quarter. On the capitalization front, we further diversified our funding sources by closing on a new $150 million SPV financing credit facility during the quarter. We believe this new SPV credit facility will provide us with significant funding flexibility as we continue to thoughtfully grow our balance sheet. In consideration of the strong performance of our portfolio, the Board of Directors has again declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share for the June 30, 2024 quarter. Given the continued excess earnings being generated by our floating rate debt portfolio, our Board of Directors has also declared a supplemental dividend of $0.06 per share for the June 30, 2024 quarter, resulting in total dividends for the June 30, 2024 quarter of $0.63 per share. While future dividend declarations are at the discretion of our Board of Directors, it is our intent to continue to distribute quarterly supplemental dividends for the foreseeable future while base rates remain materially above long-term historical averages and we have a meaningful UTI balance.”\n\n**Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year Investment Activities**\n\n**Originations**\n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company originated $157.5 million in new commitments, consisting of investments in six new portfolio companies totaling $126.3 million and add-on commitments in five portfolio companies totaling $31.2 million.

The decrease in investment income was primarily attributable to a decrease in dividend income due to less distributions received from equity investments.\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2024, total operating expenses (excluding interest expense) were $5.2 million, compared to $7.3 million in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in accrued bonus compensation in the current quarter.\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2024, interest expense remained flat at $11.5 million as compared to the prior quarter.\n\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2024, total pre-tax net investment income remained flat at $29.8 million as compared to the prior quarter.\n\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2024, Capital Southwest recorded total net realized and unrealized losses on investments of $15.9 million, compared to $5.4 million of total net realized and unrealized losses in the prior quarter. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the total net realized and unrealized losses on investments reflected net realized and unrealized losses on equity investments of $1.0 million and net realized and unrealized losses on debt investments of $15.6 million, offset by net realized and unrealized gains on I-45 SLF of $0.7 million. The net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $13.5 million for the quarter, compared to $23.5 million in the prior quarter.\n\nThe Company’s NAV at March 31, 2024 remained flat at $16.77 per share as compared to the prior quarter.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Operating Results**\n\nFor the year ended March 31, 2024, Capital Southwest reported total investment income of $178.1 million, compared to $119.3 million in the prior year. The increase in investment income was primarily attributable to an increase in average debt investments outstanding and an increase in the weighted average yield of debt investments.\n\nFor the year ended March 31, 2024, total operating expenses (excluding interest expense) were $24.1 million, compared to $21.4 million in the prior year. The increase in operating expenses (excluding interest expense) during the current year was primarily attributable to an increase in employee compensation, an increase in costs related to the Company's office space and costs incurred for a special meeting of shareholders.\n\nFor the year ended March 31, 2024, interest expense was $43.1 million, compared to $28.9 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average debt outstanding and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on total debt.\n\nFor the year ended March 31, 2024, total pre-tax net investment income was $110.9 million, compared to $69.0 million in the prior year.\n\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, Capital Southwest recorded total net realized and unrealized losses on investments of $26.3 million, compared to $35.6 million in the prior year. For the year ended March 31, 2024, the total net realized and unrealized losses on investments reflects net realized and unrealized losses on equity of $5.3 million and net realized and unrealized losses on debt of $24.7 million, partially offset by net realized and unrealized gains on I-45 SLF of $3.7 million. The net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $83.4 million, compared to $33.1 million in the prior year.\n\nThe Company's NAV at March 31, 2024 was $16.77, as compared to $16.37 at March 31, 2023. The increase in NAV per share from the prior year is primarily due to pre-tax net investment income in excess of dividends paid, as well as the issuance of common stock at a premium to NAV per share through the Equity ATM Program (as described below), partially offset by net realized and unrealized losses on investments.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAt March 31, 2024, Capital Southwest had approximately $32.3 million in unrestricted cash and money market balances, $265.0 million of total debt outstanding on the Corporate Credit Facility (as defined below), $139.4 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of the 4.50% Notes due January 2026 outstanding, $148.1 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of the 3.375% Notes due October 2026, $69.7 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of the 7.75% Notes due August 2028 and $148.7 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, of SBA Debentures (as defined below) outstanding.

The regulatory debt to equity ratio at the end of the quarter was 0.82 to 1.\n\nIn August 2016, CSWC entered into a senior secured credit facility (the “Corporate Credit Facility”) to provide additional liquidity to support its investment and operational activities. Borrowings under the Corporate Credit Facility accrue interest on a per annum basis at a rate equal to the applicable SOFR rate plus 2.15%. On August 2, 2023, CSWC entered into the Third Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") that (1) increased commitments under the Corporate Credit Facility from $400 million to $435 million; (2) added an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the maximum commitments up to $750 million; (3) extended the end of the Corporate Credit Facility's revolving period from August 9, 2025 to August 2, 2027 and extended the final maturity from August 9, 2026 to August 2, 2028; and (4) amended several financial covenants. On December 7, 2023, the Company entered into an Incremental Commitment and Assumption Agreement that increased the total commitments under the accordion feature of the Credit Agreement by $25 million, which increased total commitments from $435 million to $460 million. The $25 million increase was provided by one new lender, bringing the total bank syndicate to ten participants.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement (the \"Amendment\"). The Amendment amended the Credit Agreement and other related loan documents to, among other things, permit the Company to enter into special purpose vehicle financings and exclude assets held by any such special purpose vehicle from the assets pledged as collateral securing the Corporate Credit Facility.\n\nOn February 2, 2024, the Company formed Capital Southwest SPV LLC (\"SPV\"). SPV is a special purpose vehicle that was formed to hold investments for the SPV Credit Facility (as defined below) to support our investment and operating activities. On March 20, 2024, SPV entered into a special purpose vehicle financing credit facility (the \"SPV Credit Facility\"). The SPV Credit Facility includes total commitments of $150 million of initial commitments with (i) an increase to $200 million of total commitments on the earlier of (a) June 20, 2024 or (b) the date requested by the Company, in its sole discretion, and (ii) an accordion feature that allows increases up to $400 million of total commitments from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments. Borrowings under the SPV Credit Facility bear interest at three-month Term SOFR plus 2.50% per annum during the revolving period ending on March 20, 2027 and three-month Term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.85% thereafter. SPV pays unused commitment fees of (i) 0.10% through April 20, 2024 and (ii) 0.35% thereafter, on the unused lender commitments under the SPV Credit Facility, in addition to other customary fees. The SPV Credit Facility matures on March 20, 2029.\n\nIn June 2023, the Company issued approximately $71.9 million in aggregate principal amount, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase an additional $9.4 million in aggregate principal amount to cover over-allotments, of 7.75% notes due 2028 (the \"August 2028 Notes\"). The August 2028 Notes mature on August 1, 2028 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time, or from time to time, at the Company’s option on or after August 1, 2025. The August 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.75% per year, payable quarterly on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year. The August 2028 Notes are the direct unsecured obligations of the Company, rank pari passu with the Company's other outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and are effectively or structurally subordinated to all of the Company's existing and future secured indebtedness, including borrowings under the Corporate Credit Facility, the SPV Credit Facility and the SBA Debentures. The August 2028 Notes are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol \"CSWCZ.\"\n\nThe Company has an \"at-the-market\" offering (the \"Equity ATM Program\"), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time through sales agents, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $650 million. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold 2,069,620 shares of its common stock under the Equity ATM Program at a weighted-average price of $23.80 per share, raising $49.3 million of gross proceeds.

Net proceeds were $181.5 million after commissions to the sales agents on shares sold. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has $121.1 million available under the Equity ATM Program.\n\nOn April 20, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, Capital Southwest SBIC I, LP (“SBIC I”), received a license from the Small Business Administration (the \"SBA\") to operate as a Small Business Investment Company (\"SBIC\") under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended. The SBIC license allows SBIC I to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures (\"SBA Debentures\"), subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA. SBA debentures are loans issued to an SBIC that have interest payable semi-annually and a ten-year maturity. The interest rate is fixed shortly after issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten-year maturities. On December 20, 2023, SBIC I received an additional leverage commitment in the amount of $45.0 million to be issued on or prior to September 30, 2028. As of March 31, 2024, SBIC I had a total leverage commitment from the SBA in the amount of $175.0 million, of which $22.0 million remains unused.\n\n**Share Repurchase Program**\n\nOn July 28, 2021, the Company's board of directors (the \"Board\") approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $20 million of its outstanding shares of common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below its NAV per share, in accordance with guidelines specified in Rules 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B) and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On August 31, 2021, the Company entered into a share repurchase agreement, which became effective immediately, and the Company will cease purchasing its common stock under the share repurchase program upon the earlier of, among other things: (1) the date on which the aggregate purchase price for all shares equals $20 million including, without limitation, all applicable fees, costs and expenses; or (2) upon written notice by the Company to the broker that the share repurchase agreement is terminated. During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of the Company’s common stock under the share repurchase program.\n\n**Regular Dividend of $0.57 Per Share and Supplemental Dividend of $0.06 Per Share for Quarter Ended June 30, 2024**\n\nOn April 24, 2024, the Board declared a total dividend of $0.63 per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, comprised of a Regular Dividend of $0.57 per share and a Supplemental Dividend of $0.06 per share.\n\nThe Company's dividend will be payable as follows:\n\nRegular Dividend\n\nAmount Per Share: $0.57Ex-Dividend Date: June 14, 2024Record Date: June 14, 2024Payment Date: June 28, 2024\n\nSupplemental Dividend\n\nAmount Per Share: $0.06Ex-Dividend Date: June 14, 2024Record Date: June 14, 2024Payment Date: June 28, 2024\n\nWhen declaring dividends, the Board reviews estimates of taxable income available for distribution, which may differ from net investment income under generally accepted accounting principles. The final determination of taxable income for each year, as well as the tax attributes for dividends in such year, will be made after the close of the tax year.\n\nCapital Southwest maintains a dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\") that provides for the reinvestment of dividends on behalf of its registered stockholders who hold their shares with Capital Southwest’s transfer agent and registrar, American Stock Transfer and Trust Company.
