Prior to fiscal 2024, “Other Revenues, net” included sales of consumer products.(3) See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” attached to this release for further detail on the Company’s previously disclosed 2024, 2023, and 2022 restructuring plans, and the reversal of certain of the charges associated therewith. (4) “Digital” refers to providing subscriptions to the Company’s digital product offerings.(5) “Workshops + Digital” refers to providing subscriptions for unlimited access to the Company’s workshops combined with the Company’s digital subscription product offerings.(6) “Clinical” refers to providing subscriptions to the Company’s clinical product offerings provided by WeightWatchers Clinic (formerly referred to as Sequence) combined with the Company’s digital subscription product offerings.(7) “Subscribers” refers to Digital subscribers, Workshops + Digital subscribers, and Clinical subscribers who participate in recurring bill programs in Company-owned operations.  \n  \n**Q3 2024 Business and Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **End of Period Subscribers** in Q3 2024 were down 8.8% versus the prior year period, driven by declines in the Digital and Workshops + Digital businesses reflecting year to date recruitment declines. Q3 2024 End of Period Clinical Subscribers of 78 thousand increased 71.5% versus the prior year period.\n  * **Total Paid Weeks** in Q3 2024 were down 7.4% versus the prior year period driven by declines in the Digital and Workshops + Digital businesses. Total Paid Weeks benefited from growth in Clinical Paid Weeks. \n  * **Revenues** in Q3 2024 were $192.9 million. On a constant currency basis, Q3 2024 revenues decreased 10.6% versus the prior year period. \n    * **S****ubscription****Revenues** in Q3 2024 were $191.2 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues decreased 6.4% versus the prior year period primarily driven by lower recruitments and non-Clinical Incoming Subscribers. Additionally, Subscription Revenues were negatively impacted by the continued mix shift from the Workshops + Digital business to the Digital business and a higher mix of Digital Subscribers within their initial, lower-priced commitment periods. Subscription Revenues benefited from $19.1 million of Clinical Subscription Revenues, which increased 90.7% versus the prior year period. \n    * **Other Revenues** in Q3 2024 were $1.6 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues decreased 85.7% versus the prior year period driven by the discontinuation of the consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023. \n  * **Gross Profit** in Q3 2024 was $129.5 million, compared to $141.8 million in the prior year period. **Adjusted gross profit** , which excluded the net impact of $3.8 million of restructuring charges, was $133.3 million. Adjusted gross profit in Q3 2023, which excluded the net impact of $0.4 million of restructuring charges, was $142.2 million. \n    * **Gross Margin** in Q3 2024 was 67.1%, as compared to 66.0% in the prior year period. **Adjusted gross margin** in Q3 2024 was 69.1%, up from an adjusted gross margin of 66.2% in the prior year period, driven primarily by actions to reduce the fixed cost base within our business and the discontinuation of our lower margin consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023.\n  * **Non-Cash Intangible Impairment Charges:** During Q3 2024, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of franchise rights acquired totaling $57.0 million. These impairments were primarily driven by an increase in the Company’s weighted average cost of capital reflecting market factors.\n  * **Operating****Loss** in Q3 2024 was $39.0 million, compared to operating income of $30.6 million in the prior year period. **Adjusted operating income** , which excluded $57.0 million of non-cash intangible impairment charges, the net impact of $13.8 million of restructuring charges, and $3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses, was $35.7 million. Adjusted operating income in Q3 2023, which excluded the net impact of $6.0 million of restructuring charges, was $36.6 million.\n  * **Income Tax Benefit** in Q3 2024 was $27.3 million, which reflected the impact of an unusually high negative annual effective tax rate driven by a valuation allowance and small pretax loss reflected in the Company’s full year fiscal 2024 guidance. In the prior year period, income tax benefit was $38.4 million.\n  * **Net Loss** in Q3 2024 was $46.2 million compared to net income of $43.7 million in the prior year period. \n  * **Diluted Net Loss per share** in Q3 2024 was $0.58 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.54 in the prior year period. Q3 2024**adjusted earnings per share** , which excluded $0.65 of non-cash intangible impairment charges, $0.13 of net impact of restructuring charges, and $0.04 of former CEO separation expenses, was $0.24. In the prior year period, adjusted earnings per share, which excluded $0.06 of net impact of restructuring charges, was $0.60. \n    * Additionally, certain other items affected year-over-year comparability: \n      * In Q3 2024, $0.33 per diluted share positive tax impact arising from an unusually high negative annual effective tax rate as a result of a valuation allowance and small pretax loss reflected in the Company’s full year fiscal 2024 guidance.\n      * In Q3 2023, $0.54 per diluted share positive tax impact arising from an unusually high negative annual effective tax rate as a result of a valuation allowance and small pretax loss reflected in the Company’s full year fiscal 2023 guidance.\n\n\n\n**Other Items**\n\n  * **Cash** balance as of September 28, 2024 was $57.2 million. On that same date, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\n\n\n\n**Full Year Fiscal 2024 Guidance**\n\nThe Company is reiterating its following full year fiscal 2024 guidance:\n\n  * Year end total subscribers of at least 3.1 million;\n  * Revenue of at least $770.0 million; and\n  * Excluding non-cash intangible impairment charges and the net impact of restructuring charges (both of which include Q3 2024 charges), and the Q3 2024 former CEO separation expenses, \n    * Adjusted operating income of at least $100.0 million; and\n    * Adjusted EBITDAS of at least $150.0 million.\n\n\n\nReflecting the Q3 2024 charges and expenses referred to above, the Company is updating its full year fiscal 2024 operating loss guidance to not exceed $240.4 million.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call and Webcast** The Company has scheduled a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET. During the conference call, Tara Comonte, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, Heather Stark, Chief Financial Officer, and Donna Boyer, Chief Product Officer, will discuss the third quarter of fiscal 2024 results and answer questions from the investment community.\n\nThe live webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company’s corporate website, [corporate.ww.com](http://corporate.ww.com), under Events and Presentations. Supplemental investor materials will also be available in the same location prior to the start of the webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available on this site for approximately 90 days.\n\n**Statement regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures** The following provides information regarding non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release and today’s scheduled conference call:\n\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the Company has disclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. Gross profit, gross margin, operating (loss) income, operating (loss) income margin, diluted (net loss) earnings per share, and selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and as adjusted (on a non-GAAP basis), as applicable, with respect to (i) the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to exclude (x) the impact of impairment charges for the Company’s franchise rights acquired related to its United States and United Kingdom units of account, (y) the net impact of (a) charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2024 restructuring plan (the “2024 plan”), (b) charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2023 restructuring plan (the “2023 plan”) or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2023 plan, as applicable and (c) the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2022 restructuring plan (the “2022 plan”), and (z) the impact of certain non-recurring expenses in connection with the separation from the Company of its former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”); (ii) the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to exclude (x) the impact of impairment charges for the Company's franchise rights acquired related to its United States, Australia, United Kingdom and New Zealand units of account, (y) the net impact of charges associated with the 2024 plan, the 2023 plan and the 2022 plan, and (z) the impact of certain non-recurring expenses in connection with the separation of the Company's former CEO; (iii) the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to exclude the net impact of charges associated with the 2023 plan and the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2022 plan; and (iv) the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to exclude (x) the net impact of (a) charges associated with the 2023 plan, (b) charges associated with the 2022 plan or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2022 plan, as applicable, (c) charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2021 organizational restructuring plan (the “2021 plan”) or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2021 plan, as applicable, and (d) the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2020 organizational restructuring plan (the “2020 plan”), and (y) the impact of certain non-recurring transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of Sequence. The Company generally refers to such non-GAAP measures as excluding or adjusting for the impact of franchise rights acquired impairments, the net impact of restructuring charges, the impact of acquisition transaction costs, and the impact of former CEO separation expenses, as applicable. The Company also presents in the attachments to this release the non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (“EBITDAS”); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, franchise rights acquired and goodwill impairments, net restructuring charges, acquisition transaction costs and former CEO separation expenses (“Adjusted EBITDAS”); total debt less unamortized deferred financing costs, unamortized debt discount and cash on hand (i.e., net debt); and a net debt/Adjusted EBITDAS ratio. In addition, the Company presents certain of its financial results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company calculates constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. A reconciliation of the forward-looking full year EBITDAS outlook to net income cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company's control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a material impact on its future GAAP financial results.\n\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information for its and investors' evaluation of the Company's business performance and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of the Company's business. While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" attached to this release and reconciliations, if any, included elsewhere in this release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**About WW International, Inc.** WeightWatchers is a human-centric technology company powered by our proven, science-based, clinically effective weight loss and weight management programs.

Q3 2024 End of Period Clinical Subscribers of 78 thousand increased 71.5% versus the prior year period.\n  * **Total Paid Weeks** in Q3 2024 were down 7.4% versus the prior year period driven by declines in the Digital and Workshops + Digital businesses. Total Paid Weeks benefited from growth in Clinical Paid Weeks. \n  * **Revenues** in Q3 2024 were $192.9 million. On a constant currency basis, Q3 2024 revenues decreased 10.6% versus the prior year period. \n    * **S****ubscription****Revenues** in Q3 2024 were $191.2 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues decreased 6.4% versus the prior year period primarily driven by lower recruitments and non-Clinical Incoming Subscribers. Additionally, Subscription Revenues were negatively impacted by the continued mix shift from the Workshops + Digital business to the Digital business and a higher mix of Digital Subscribers within their initial, lower-priced commitment periods. Subscription Revenues benefited from $19.1 million of Clinical Subscription Revenues, which increased 90.7% versus the prior year period. \n    * **Other Revenues** in Q3 2024 were $1.6 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues decreased 85.7% versus the prior year period driven by the discontinuation of the consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023. \n  * **Gross Profit** in Q3 2024 was $129.5 million, compared to $141.8 million in the prior year period. **Adjusted gross profit** , which excluded the net impact of $3.8 million of restructuring charges, was $133.3 million. Adjusted gross profit in Q3 2023, which excluded the net impact of $0.4 million of restructuring charges, was $142.2 million. \n    * **Gross Margin** in Q3 2024 was 67.1%, as compared to 66.0% in the prior year period. **Adjusted gross margin** in Q3 2024 was 69.1%, up from an adjusted gross margin of 66.2% in the prior year period, driven primarily by actions to reduce the fixed cost base within our business and the discontinuation of our lower margin consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023.\n  * **Non-Cash Intangible Impairment Charges:** During Q3 2024, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of franchise rights acquired totaling $57.0 million. These impairments were primarily driven by an increase in the Company’s weighted average cost of capital reflecting market factors.\n  * **Operating****Loss** in Q3 2024 was $39.0 million, compared to operating income of $30.6 million in the prior year period. **Adjusted operating income** , which excluded $57.0 million of non-cash intangible impairment charges, the net impact of $13.8 million of restructuring charges, and $3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses, was $35.7 million. Adjusted operating income in Q3 2023, which excluded the net impact of $6.0 million of restructuring charges, was $36.6 million.\n  * **Income Tax Benefit** in Q3 2024 was $27.3 million, which reflected the impact of an unusually high negative annual effective tax rate driven by a valuation allowance and small pretax loss reflected in the Company’s full year fiscal 2024 guidance. In the prior year period, income tax benefit was $38.4 million.\n  * **Net Loss** in Q3 2024 was $46.2 million compared to net income of $43.7 million in the prior year period. \n  * **Diluted Net Loss per share** in Q3 2024 was $0.58 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.54 in the prior year period. Q3 2024**adjusted earnings per share** , which excluded $0.65 of non-cash intangible impairment charges, $0.13 of net impact of restructuring charges, and $0.04 of former CEO separation expenses, was $0.24. In the prior year period, adjusted earnings per share, which excluded $0.06 of net impact of restructuring charges, was $0.60. \n    * Additionally, certain other items affected year-over-year comparability: \n      * In Q3 2024, $0.33 per diluted share positive tax impact arising from an unusually high negative annual effective tax rate as a result of a valuation allowance and small pretax loss reflected in the Company’s full year fiscal 2024 guidance.\n      * In Q3 2023, $0.54 per diluted share positive tax impact arising from an unusually high negative annual effective tax rate as a result of a valuation allowance and small pretax loss reflected in the Company’s full year fiscal 2023 guidance.\n\n\n\n**Other Items**\n\n  * **Cash** balance as of September 28, 2024 was $57.2 million. On that same date, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\n\n\n\n**Full Year Fiscal 2024 Guidance**\n\nThe Company is reiterating its following full year fiscal 2024 guidance:\n\n  * Year end total subscribers of at least 3.1 million;\n  * Revenue of at least $770.0 million; and\n  * Excluding non-cash intangible impairment charges and the net impact of restructuring charges (both of which include Q3 2024 charges), and the Q3 2024 former CEO separation expenses, \n    * Adjusted operating income of at least $100.0 million; and\n    * Adjusted EBITDAS of at least $150.0 million.\n\n\n\nReflecting the Q3 2024 charges and expenses referred to above, the Company is updating its full year fiscal 2024 operating loss guidance to not exceed $240.4 million.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call and Webcast** The Company has scheduled a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET. During the conference call, Tara Comonte, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, Heather Stark, Chief Financial Officer, and Donna Boyer, Chief Product Officer, will discuss the third quarter of fiscal 2024 results and answer questions from the investment community.\n\nThe live webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company’s corporate website, [corporate.ww.com](http://corporate.ww.com), under Events and Presentations.

Gross profit, gross margin, operating (loss) income, operating (loss) income margin, diluted (net loss) earnings per share, and selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and as adjusted (on a non-GAAP basis), as applicable, with respect to (i) the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to exclude (x) the impact of impairment charges for the Company’s franchise rights acquired related to its United States and United Kingdom units of account, (y) the net impact of (a) charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2024 restructuring plan (the “2024 plan”), (b) charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2023 restructuring plan (the “2023 plan”) or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2023 plan, as applicable and (c) the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2022 restructuring plan (the “2022 plan”), and (z) the impact of certain non-recurring expenses in connection with the separation from the Company of its former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”); (ii) the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to exclude (x) the impact of impairment charges for the Company's franchise rights acquired related to its United States, Australia, United Kingdom and New Zealand units of account, (y) the net impact of charges associated with the 2024 plan, the 2023 plan and the 2022 plan, and (z) the impact of certain non-recurring expenses in connection with the separation of the Company's former CEO; (iii) the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to exclude the net impact of charges associated with the 2023 plan and the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2022 plan; and (iv) the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to exclude (x) the net impact of (a) charges associated with the 2023 plan, (b) charges associated with the 2022 plan or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2022 plan, as applicable, (c) charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2021 organizational restructuring plan (the “2021 plan”) or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2021 plan, as applicable, and (d) the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2020 organizational restructuring plan (the “2020 plan”), and (y) the impact of certain non-recurring transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of Sequence. The Company generally refers to such non-GAAP measures as excluding or adjusting for the impact of franchise rights acquired impairments, the net impact of restructuring charges, the impact of acquisition transaction costs, and the impact of former CEO separation expenses, as applicable. The Company also presents in the attachments to this release the non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (“EBITDAS”); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, franchise rights acquired and goodwill impairments, net restructuring charges, acquisition transaction costs and former CEO separation expenses (“Adjusted EBITDAS”); total debt less unamortized deferred financing costs, unamortized debt discount and cash on hand (i.e., net debt); and a net debt/Adjusted EBITDAS ratio. In addition, the Company presents certain of its financial results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company calculates constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. A reconciliation of the forward-looking full year EBITDAS outlook to net income cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company's control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a material impact on its future GAAP financial results.\n\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information for its and investors' evaluation of the Company's business performance and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of the Company's business. While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" attached to this release and reconciliations, if any, included elsewhere in this release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**About WW International, Inc.** WeightWatchers is a human-centric technology company powered by our proven, science-based, clinically effective weight loss and weight management programs.

          "content": "Supplemental\nInvestor\nMaterials\nNovember 6, 2024\nForward-looking Statements\nThis presentation includes “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including, in\nparticular, any guidance and any statements about the Company’s plans, strategies, objectives, initiatives, roadmap and prospects. The Company generally uses the words “may,” “will,” “could,” “expect,” “anticipate,”\n“believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “aim” and similar expressions in this presentation to identify forward-looking statements. The Company bases these forward-looking statements on its current views with respect to\nfuture events and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and\nassumptions, including, among other things: competition from other weight management and health and wellness industry participants or the development of more effective or more favorably perceived weight\nmanagement methods; the Company's failure to continue to retain and grow its subscriber base; the Company’s ability to be a leader in the rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive clinical weight management and\nweight loss market; the Company's ability to continue to develop new, innovative services and products and enhance its existing services and products or the failure of its services, products or brands to continue to\nappeal to the market, or its ability to successfully expand into new channels of distribution or respond to consumer trends or sentiment; regulatory, reputational and other risks associated with the Company’s new\ncompounded GLP-1 offering; the ability to successfully implement strategic initiatives; the Company’s ability to evolve its community offerings to meet the evolving tastes and preferences of its members; the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the Company's advertising and marketing programs, including the strength of the Company's social media presence; the impact on the Company's reputation of actions taken by its\nfranchisees, licensees, suppliers, affiliated provider entities, PCs’ healthcare professionals, and other partners, including as a result of its acquisition of Weekend Health, Inc., doing business as Sequence (“Sequence”)\n(the “Acquisition”); the recognition of asset impairment charges; the loss of key personnel, strategic partners or consultants or failure to effectively manage and motivate the Company's workforce; the Company’s chief\nexecutive officer transition, and its ability to appoint a permanent chief executive officer with the required level of experience and expertise; the Company’s ability to successfully make acquisitions or enter into\ncollaborations or joint ventures, including its ability to successfully integrate, operate or realize the anticipated benefits of such businesses, including with respect to Sequence; uncertainties related to a downturn in\ngeneral economic conditions or consumer confidence, including as a result of the existing inflationary environment, rising interest rates, the potential impact of political and social unrest and increased volatility in the\ncredit and capital markets; the seasonal nature of the Company's business; the Company's failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; the impact of events that impede accessing resources or\ndiscourage or impede people from gathering with others; the early termination by the Company of leases; the inability to renew certain of the Company's licenses, or the inability to do so on terms that are favorable to\nthe Company; the impact of the Company's substantial amount of debt, debt service obligations and debt covenants, and its exposure to variable rate indebtedness; the ability to generate sufficient cash to service the\nCompany's debt and satisfy its other liquidity requirements; uncertainties regarding the satisfactory operation of the Company's technology or systems; the impact of data security breaches and other malicious acts or\nprivacy concerns, including the costs of compliance with evolving privacy laws and regulations; the Company’s ability to successfully integrate and use artificial intelligence in its business; the Company's ability to\nenforce its intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally, as well as the impact of its involvement in any claims related to intellectual property rights; risks and uncertainties associated with the\nCompany's international operations, including regulatory, economic, political, social, intellectual property, and foreign currency risks, which risks may be exacerbated as a result of war and terrorism; the outcomes of\nlitigation or regulatory actions; the impact of existing and future laws and regulations, including federal and state regulations relating to compounded medications; risks related to the Acquisition, including risks that\nthe Acquisition may not achieve its intended results; risks related to the Company's exposure to extensive and complex healthcare laws and regulations as a result of the Acquisition; and other risks and uncertainties,\nincluding those detailed from time to time in the Company's periodic reports filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) (which are available on the SEC’s EDGAR database at\nwww.sec.gov and via the Company’s website at corporate.ww.com). You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should understand that many important factors, including those discussed\nherein, could cause the Company’s results to differ materially from those expressed or suggested in any forward-looking statement. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake any obligation to update or\nrevise these forward-looking statements to reflect new information or events or circumstances that occur after the date of this presentation or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or otherwise. Readers are\nadvised to review the Company’s filings with the SEC (which are available on the SEC’s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov and via the Company’s website at corporate.ww.com).\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis presentation includes certain financial results not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) including, but not limited to, gross profit, gross margin,\noperating (loss) income, operating (loss) income margin, diluted (net loss) earnings per share, and selling, general and administrative expenses, all as adjusted. In addition, it includes certain financial results on a\nconstant currency basis in addition to GAAP results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. In this presentation, the Company\ncalculates constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. See Financial Detail section for reconciliations. Management believes these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures provide useful supplemental information for its and investors' evaluation of the Company's business performance and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of the Company's\nbusiness. While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should not be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures\nreported by other companies.A reconciliation of the forward-looking full year EBITDAS outlook to net income cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting\nthe occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company's control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons,\nthe Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a material impact on its future GAAP financial results.\nTrademarks\nThe following terms used in this presentation are our trademarks: Weight WatchersⓇ and the Weight Watchers logo. 2\nQ3 2024 SUMMARY\nAdjusted\nEnd of Period Subscription Adjusted Gross\nPaid Weeks Revenues Operating\nSubscribers Revenues Margin(1)\nIncome(1)\n3.7 million\n$36 million\n48.6 million $193 million $191 million 69.1%\n-8.8% YoY\n18.5% of Revenues\n71.5% YoY growth in\n-7.4% YoY -10.2% YoY -6.0% YoY Up 296 basis points YoY\nUp 146 basis points YoY\nClinical Subscribers\n● Subscription Revenues of $191 million declined 6% YoY, ● Adjusted Gross Margin - Up 296 basis points YoY\nwith declines in Digital Revenues and Workshops + driven primarily by actions to reduce the fixed cost\nDigital Revenues.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER UNIT AMOUNTS)\n1. Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of WW International, Inc., all of its subsidiaries and the variable interest\nentities of which WW International, Inc. is the primary beneficiary. The terms “Company” and “WW” as used throughout these notes are used to indicate WW\nInternational, Inc. and all of its operations consolidated for purposes of its financial statements. The Company’s “Digital” business refers to providing\nsubscriptions to the Company’s digital product offerings. The Company’s “Workshops + Digital” business refers to providing subscriptions for unlimited access\nto the Company’s workshops combined with the Company’s digital subscription product offerings. The Company’s “Clinical” business refers to providing\nsubscriptions to the Company’s clinical product offerings provided by WeightWatchers Clinic (formerly referred to as Sequence) combined with the Company’s\ndigital subscription product offerings.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for\ninterim financial information and include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and assumptions. While all available information has been\nconsidered, actual amounts could differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions may change as new events occur and additional information is\nobtained, and such future changes may have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position and liquidity. The consolidated\nfinancial statements include all of the Company’s majority-owned subsidiaries. All entities acquired, and any entity of which a majority interest was acquired,\nare included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation. The Company’s operating results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of future or annual results. The consolidated financial\nstatements are unaudited and, accordingly, they do not include all of the information necessary for a comprehensive presentation of results of operations,\nfinancial position and cash flow activity required by GAAP for complete financial statements but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments\nincluding those of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the interim results presented.\nAs previously disclosed, effective the first day of fiscal 2024 (i.e., December 31, 2023), as a result of the continued evolution of the Company’s\ncentralized organizational structure in fiscal 2023, and management’s 2024 strategic planning process, the Company’s reportable segments changed to one\nsegment for the purpose of making operational and resource decisions and assessing financial performance. Since the Company operates in one operating\nsegment and reportable segment, all required financial segment information can be found in the consolidated financial statements.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company identified and recorded an out-of-period adjustment related to an income tax error. The impact of\ncorrecting this error, which was immaterial to all current and prior period financial statements and corrected in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, resulted in an\nincome tax expense of approximately $2,748, with a corresponding decrease to net income, for the nine months ended September 28, 2024.\nThese consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 filed on February\n28, 2024, which includes additional information about the Company, its results of operations, its financial position and its cash flows.\n2. Accounting Standards Adopted in Current Year\nThere were no new accounting standards adopted during the nine months ended September 28, 2024.\n7\nWW INTERNATIONAL, INC.

Any amounts collected in advance of services being\nprovided are recorded in deferred revenue.

This revenue is amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable agreement.\n5.

The Acquisition resulted in goodwill related to, among other things,\nexpected synergies in operations. The goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes. The results of operations of Sequence (now operating as WeightWatchers\nClinic) have been included in the consolidated operating results of the Company from the Closing Date.\nThe Company incurred transaction-related costs of $0 and $8,605 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. These costs\nwere associated with legal and professional services and were recognized as operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\n6. Franchise Rights Acquired, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nFranchise rights acquired are due to acquisitions of the Company’s franchised territories as well as the acquisition of franchise promotion agreements and\nother factors associated with the acquired franchise territories. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the change in the carrying value of franchise\nrights acquired was due to the impairments of the United States, Australia, United Kingdom and New Zealand units of account as discussed below and the effect\nof exchange rate changes.\n11\nWW INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER UNIT AMOUNTS)\nGoodwill primarily relates to the acquisition of the Company by The Kraft Heinz Company (successor to H.J. Heinz Company) in 1978, and the\nCompany’s acquisitions of WW.com, LLC (formerly known as WW.com, Inc. and WeightWatchers.com, Inc.) in 2005, Sequence in 2023 and the Company’s\nfranchised territories. See Note 5 for additional information on the Company’s acquisitions. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the change in the\ncarrying value of goodwill was due to the effect of exchange rate changes as follows:\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ 155,998\nGoodwill acquired during the period 89,742\nGoodwill impairment (3,586)\nEffect of exchange rate changes 1,287\nBalance as of December 30, 2023 $ 243,441\nEffect of exchange rate changes (687)\nBalance as of September 28, 2024 $ 242,754\nChange in Goodwill Reporting Units\nAs discussed in Note 1, effective the first day of fiscal 2024 (i.e., December 31, 2023), as a result of the continued evolution of the Company’s\ncentralized organizational structure in fiscal 2023, and management’s 2024 strategic planning process, the Company’s reportable segments changed to one\nsegment for the purpose of making operational and resource decisions and assessing financial performance. In connection with the Company’s change to one\nreportable segment, the Company’s operating segments also changed to one segment. As a result of this change to the Company’s operating segments, the\nCompany reassessed its reporting units for the evaluation of goodwill during the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”),\nthe Company determines its reporting units based upon whether discrete financial information is available, if management regularly reviews the operating results\nof the component, the nature of the products offered to customers and the market characteristics of each reporting unit. A reporting unit is considered to be an\noperating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component. Prior to the change in operating segments, the Company’s reporting\nunits for the evaluation of goodwill were determined by country. Component level financial information is reviewed by management across two business lines:\nBehavioral and Clinical. The Company’s “Behavioral” business line consists of the Company’s Workshops + Digital business and Digital business. Accordingly,\nthese were determined to be the Company's new reporting units as of the first day of fiscal 2024.\nThis change in reporting units qualified as a triggering event and required goodwill to be tested for impairment. As required by ASC 350, the Company\ntested goodwill for impairment immediately before and after the change in reporting units. As a result of these impairment analyses, it was determined that\ngoodwill was not impaired before or after the change in reporting units.\nFranchise Rights Acquired\nFinite-lived franchise rights acquired are amortized over the remaining contractual period, which is generally less than one year. Indefinite-lived franchise\nrights acquired are tested for potential impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events so require.\nIn performing the impairment analysis for indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired, the fair value for franchise rights acquired is estimated using a\ndiscounted cash flow approach referred to as the hypothetical start-up approach for franchise rights related to the Company’s Workshops + Digital business and a\nrelief from royalty methodology for franchise rights related to the Company’s Digital business. The aggregate estimated fair value for these franchise rights is\nthen compared to the carrying value of the unit of account for these rights. The Company has determined the appropriate unit of account for purposes of\nassessing impairment to be the combination of the rights in both the Workshops + Digital business and the Digital business in the country in which the applicable\nacquisition occurred. The net book value of franchise rights acquired for the United States unit of account as of the September 28, 2024 balance sheet date was\n$68,627.\nIn its hypothetical start-up approach analysis for fiscal 2024, the Company assumed that the year of maturity was reached after 7 years. Subsequent to the\nyear of maturity, the Company estimated future cash flows for the Workshops + Digital business in each country based on assumptions regarding revenue growth\nand operating income margins. In the Company’s relief from royalty approach analysis for fiscal 2024, the cash flows associated with the Digital business in\neach country were based on the expected Digital revenue for such country and the application of a royalty rate based on current market terms. The cash flows for\nthe Workshops + Digital and the Digital businesses were discounted utilizing rates which were calculated using the weighted average cost of capital, which\nincluded the cost of equity and the cost of debt.\n12\nWW INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER UNIT AMOUNTS)\nGoodwill\nIn performing the impairment analysis for goodwill, the fair value for the Company’s reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach.\nThis approach involves projecting future cash flows attributable to the reporting unit and discounting those estimated cash flows using an appropriate discount\nrate. The estimated fair value is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The Company has determined the appropriate reporting units for\npurposes of assessing goodwill impairment to be the Behavioral and Clinical business lines. The net book values of goodwill for the Behavioral and Clinical\nreporting units as of the September 28, 2024 balance sheet date were $153,012 and $89,742, respectively.\nIn performing the impairment analysis for goodwill, for all of the Company’s reporting units, the Company estimated future cash flows by utilizing the\nhistorical debt-free cash flows (cash flows provided by operations less capital expenditures) attributable to each of the Behavioral and Clinical reporting units\nand then applied expected future operating income growth rates for the respective reporting unit. The Company utilized operating income as the basis for\nmeasuring its potential growth because it believes it is the best indicator of the performance of its business. The Company then discounted the estimated future\ncash flows utilizing a discount rate which was calculated using the weighted average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2024 Indefinite-Lived Franchise Rights Acquired and Goodwill Interim Impairment Tests\nDuring the quarter ended September 28, 2024, the Company identified various qualitative and quantitative factors which collectively indicated a\ntriggering event had occurred. These factors included the continued decline in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization, and actual business\nperformance. As a result of this triggering event, the Company performed interim impairment tests for all of its franchise rights acquired units of account and\ngoodwill reporting units in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nIn performing the interim franchise rights acquired impairment test as of September 28, 2024, the Company determined that the carrying values of its\nUnited States and United Kingdom franchise rights acquired with indefinite-lived units of account exceeded their respective fair values. Accordingly, the\nCompany recorded impairment charges for its United States and United Kingdom units of account of $54,295 and $2,750 (which comprised the remaining\nbalance of franchise rights acquired for the United Kingdom unit of account), respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. These impairments were driven\nprimarily by the weighted average cost of capital used in this interim impairment test, reflecting market factors, including higher interest rates and the trading\nvalues of the Company’s equity and debt, and, to a lesser extent, business performance.\nBased on the results of the interim franchise rights acquired impairment test as of September 28, 2024 performed for the Company’s United States unit of\naccount, which held 100.0% of the Company’s indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired as of the September 28, 2024 balance sheet date, the estimated fair value\nof this unit of account was equal to its respective carrying value. Accordingly, a change in the underlying assumptions for the United States unit of account may\nchange the results of the impairment assessment and, as such, could result in further impairment of the franchise rights acquired related to the United States, for\nwhich the net book value was $68,627 as of September 28, 2024.\nBased on the results of the interim goodwill impairment test as of September 28, 2024 performed for the Company’s Behavioral reporting unit, which\nheld 63.0% of the Company’s goodwill as of the September 28, 2024 balance sheet date, there was significant headroom in the goodwill impairment test for this\nunit with the difference between the fair value and the carrying value exceeding 100% and, therefore, no impairment existed. Based on the results of the interim\ngoodwill impairment test as of September 28, 2024 performed for the Company’s Clinical reporting unit, which held 37.0% of the Company’s goodwill as of the\nSeptember 28, 2024 balance sheet date, the estimated fair value of this reporting unit was at least 20% higher than the respective unit's carrying value and,\ntherefore, no impairment existed.\nIndefinite-Lived Franchise Rights Acquired and Goodwill Annual Impairment Tests\nThe Company reviews indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired and goodwill for potential impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events\nso require. The Company performed its annual fair value impairment testing as of May 5, 2024 and May 7, 2023, each the first day of fiscal May, on its\nindefinite-lived franchise rights acquired and goodwill.\nIn performing the annual impairment analyses as of May 5, 2024 and May 7, 2023, the Company determined that the carrying values of its franchise\nrights acquired with indefinite-lived units of account and goodwill reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values and, therefore, no impairment\nexisted.\nBased on the results of the Company’s May 5, 2024 annual franchise rights acquired impairment test performed for its United States and United Kingdom\nunits of account, each unit of account had an estimated fair value at least 5% higher than the respective unit's carrying value and, therefore, no impairment\nexisted.\n13\nWW INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER UNIT AMOUNTS)\nBased on the results of the Company’s May 5, 2024 annual goodwill impairment test performed for all of its reporting units, each unit had an estimated\nfair value at least 30% higher than the respective unit’s carrying value and, therefore, no impairment existed.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2024 Indefinite-Lived Franchise Rights Acquired and Goodwill Interim Impairment Tests\nDuring the quarter ended March 30, 2024, the Company identified various qualitative and quantitative factors which collectively indicated a triggering\nevent had occurred. These factors included the continued decline in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization, and actual business performance. As a\nresult of this triggering event, the Company performed interim impairment tests for all of its franchise rights acquired units of account and goodwill reporting\nunits in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nIn performing the interim franchise rights acquired impairment test as of March 30, 2024, the Company determined that the carrying values of its United\nStates, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom franchise rights acquired with indefinite-lived units of account exceeded their respective fair values.\nAccordingly, the Company recorded impairment charges for its United States, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom units of account of $251,431, $4,074\n(which comprised the remaining balance of franchise rights acquired for the Australia unit of account), $2,328 (which comprised the remaining balance of\nfranchise rights acquired for the New Zealand unit of account) and $155, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. These impairments were driven\nprimarily by the weighted average cost of capital used in this interim impairment test, reflecting market factors, including higher interest rates and the trading\nvalues of the Company’s equity and debt, and, to a lesser extent, business performance.\nBased on the results of the interim goodwill impairment test as of March 30, 2024 performed for all of the Company’s reporting units, each unit had an\nestimated fair value at least 25% higher than the respective unit’s carrying value and, therefore, no impairment existed.\nFinite-lived Intangible Assets\nThe carrying values of finite-lived intangible assets as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 28, 2024 December 30, 2023\nGross Gross\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying Accumulated\nAmount Amortization Amount Amortization\nCapitalized software and website development costs $ 253,653 $ 211,387 $ 251,410 $ 195,696\nTrademarks 12,192 12,088 12,188 12,024\nOther 14,002 7,053 13,991 6,661\nTrademarks and other intangible assets $ 279,847 $ 230,528 $ 277,589 $ 214,381\nFranchise rights acquired 7,926 5,369 8,029 5,314\nTotal finite-lived intangible assets $ 287,773 $ 235,897 $ 285,618 $ 219,695\nAggregate amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was recorded in the amounts of $8,124 and $25,886 for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 28, 2024, respectively.

The Credit\nFacilities consist of (1) $1,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of senior secured tranche B term loans due in 2028 (the “Term Loan Facility”) and (2)\n$175,000 in an aggregate principal amount of commitments under a senior secured revolving credit facility (which includes borrowing capacity available for\nletters of credit) due in 2026 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company had $945,000 in an aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities, with $173,841\nof availability and $1,159 in issued but undrawn letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility subject to its terms and conditions as discussed\nbelow. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 28, 2024.\nAll obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by, subject to certain exceptions, each of the Company’s current and future wholly-owned\nmaterial domestic restricted subsidiaries. All obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of\nthe assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to customary exceptions, including:\n• a pledge of 100% of the equity interests directly held by the Company and each guarantor in any wholly-owned material subsidiary of the\nCompany or any guarantor (which pledge, in the case of any non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. subsidiary, will not include more than 65% of the\nvoting stock of such first-tier non-U.S. subsidiary), subject to certain exceptions; and\n• a security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Credit Facilities require the Company to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:\n• 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0% if the Company attains certain first lien secured net leverage ratios) of the Company’s\nannual excess cash flow;\n• 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales by the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (including casualty and\ncondemnation events, subject to de minimis thresholds), and subject to the right to reinvest 100% of such proceeds, subject to certain\nqualifications; and\n15\nWW INTERNATIONAL, INC.

The Company may voluntarily\nrepay outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities at any time without penalty, except for customary “breakage” costs with respect to Term SOFR loans under\nthe Credit Facilities.\nIn June 2023, in connection with the planned phase-out of LIBOR, the Company amended its Credit Facilities to replace LIBOR with Term SOFR as the\nbenchmark rate under the Credit Agreement, which is calculated to include a credit spread adjustment of 0.11448%, 0.26161%, 0.42826%, or 0.71513% for 1, 3,\n6, or 12 months period, respectively, in addition to the Term SOFR Screen Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and the margin (which was not amended).\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, either (1) an applicable margin plus a base\nrate determined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50% per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New\nYork, (b) the prime rate of Bank of America and (c) the Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest\nperiod of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00%; provided that such rate is not lower than a floor of 1.50% or (2) an applicable margin plus\na Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain\nadditional costs, provided that Term SOFR is not lower than a floor of 0.50%. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum\nequal to an applicable margin based upon a leverage-based pricing grid, plus, at the Company’s option, either (1) a base rate determined by reference to the\nhighest of (a) 0.50% per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, (b) the prime rate of Bank of\nAmerica and (c) the Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain\nadditional costs, plus 1.00%; provided that such rate is not lower than a floor of 1.00% or (2) a Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for\nU.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, provided such rate is not lower than a floor of zero. As\nof September 28, 2024, the applicable margins for the Term SOFR rate borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility were 3.50%\nand 2.75%, respectively.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company pays a commitment fee to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of unutilized commitments\nthereunder, which commitment fee fluctuates depending upon the Company’s Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement).\nThe Credit Agreement contains other customary terms, including (1) representations, warranties and affirmative covenants, (2) negative covenants,\nincluding limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, investments, distributions, prepayments of subordinated debt, amendments of\nmaterial agreements governing subordinated indebtedness, changes to lines of business and transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to baskets, thresholds\nand other exceptions, and (3) customary events of default.\nThe availability of certain baskets and the ability to enter into certain transactions are also subject to compliance with certain financial ratios. In addition,\nif the aggregate principal amount of extensions of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of any fiscal quarter end exceeds 35% of the amount\nof the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in effect on such date, the Company must be in compliance with a Consolidated First Lien\nLeverage Ratio of 5.25:1.00 for the period ending after the first fiscal quarter of 2024 through and including the first fiscal quarter of 2025, with a step down to\n5.00:1.00 for the period following the first fiscal quarter of 2025. As of September 28, 2024, the Company’s actual Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio was\n8.88:1.00 and there were no borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility and total letters of credit issued were $1,159. The Company was not in compliance\nwith the Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio as of September 28, 2024, and as a result, the Company is limited to borrowing no more than 35%, or $61,250,\nof the amount of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility as of each fiscal quarter end until the Company complies with the applicable\nratio.\nSenior Secured Notes\nThe Senior Secured Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of April 13, 2021 (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the\n“Indenture”), among the Company, the guarantors named therein and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee and notes collateral agent.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is\npayable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. Commencing April 15, 2024, the Company may on any one or more occasions redeem some or\nall of the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 102.250% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if\nany, to, but not including, the redemption date, such optional redemption price decreasing to 101.125% on or after April 15, 2025 and to 100.000% on or after\nApril 15, 2026. If a change of control occurs, the Company must offer to purchase for cash the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the\nprincipal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the purchase date. Following the sale of certain\nassets and subject to certain conditions, the Company must offer to purchase for cash the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal\namount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the purchase date.\nThe Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Company’s subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facilities. The Senior Secured\nNotes and the note guarantees are secured by a first-priority lien on all the collateral that secures the Credit Facilities, subject to a shared lien of equal priority\nwith the Company’s and each guarantor’s obligations under the Credit Facilities and subject to certain thresholds, exceptions and permitted liens.\nOutstanding Debt\nAt September 28, 2024, the Company had $1,445,000 outstanding under the Credit Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes, consisting of borrowings\nunder the Term Loan Facility of $945,000, $0 drawn down on the Revolving Credit Facility and $500,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured\nNotes issued and outstanding.\nAt September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company’s debt consisted of both fixed and variable-rate instruments. The Company has historically\nentered into interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the cash flow exposure associated with the Company’s variable-rate borrowings. At September 28, 2024,\nthe Company did not have any interest rate swaps in effect. See Note 11 for further information on the Company’s use of interest rate swaps. The weighted\naverage interest rate (which includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount) on the Company’s outstanding debt, exclusive of the impact of\nany applicable interest rate swaps, was approximately 7.77% and 7.64% per annum at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, based on\ninterest rates on these dates. The weighted average interest rate (which includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount) on the Company’s\noutstanding debt, including the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, was approximately 7.39% and 6.53% per annum at September 28, 2024 and\nDecember 30, 2023, respectively, based on interest rates on these dates.\nLiquidity\nThe Company’s sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and availability under its Revolving Credit Facility. The\nCompany’s primary cash needs are funding its operations and global strategic initiatives, meeting debt service requirements and engaging in selective\nacquisitions.\nThe Company’s recent financial results have been, and its future financial results may be, negatively impacted by financial, business, economic,\ndemographic and other factors, such as the increased popularity and acceptance of weight management medications, attitudes towards weight management and\nwellness programs and competition. The Company’s ability to continue to meet its obligations is dependent on its ability to generate positive cash flow. In the\nevent that the Company is unable to generate and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations, the Company may need to refinance all or a portion of its\nindebtedness before maturity, seek waivers of or amendments to contractual obligations for payment, reduce or delay strategic investments and capital\nexpenditures, sell material assets or seek other financing opportunities. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient liquidity, it could have a material adverse\nimpact on the Company’s business, results of operation and financial condition.\n8. Per Share Data\nBasic (net loss) earnings per share is calculated utilizing the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented.\nDiluted (net loss) earnings per share is calculated utilizing the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented adjusted for\nthe effect of dilutive common stock equivalents.\n17\nWW INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER UNIT AMOUNTS)\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted (net loss) earnings per share:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, September 28, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet (loss) income $ (46,192) $ 43,731 $ (370,824) $ (24,120)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares of common stock outstanding 79,732 78,979 79,474 75,861\nEffect of dilutive common stock equivalents — 1,659 — —\nWeighted average diluted common shares outstanding 79,732 80,638 79,474 75,861\n(Net loss) earnings per share\nBasic $ (0.58) $ 0.55 $ (4.67) $ (0.32)\nDiluted $ (0.58) $ 0.54 $ (4.67) $ (0.32)\nThe number of anti-dilutive common stock equivalents excluded from the calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for diluted (net\nloss) earnings per share was 9,966 and 6,770 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The number of anti-dilutive\ncommon stock equivalents excluded from the calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for diluted net loss per share was 9,490 and 9,341\nfor the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n9. Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company’s effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 were 37.2% and (3.4%), respectively, compared to (727.7%)\nand 44.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate for interim periods is determined using an annual\neffective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. The forecasted full-year fiscal 2024 tax expense, which included an increase in valuation allowance against U.S.\ndeferred tax assets, in relation to the Company’s forecasted full-year pretax loss (albeit minimal), drove the unusually high negative annual effective tax rate.\nApplying this negative annual effective tax rate to pretax loss for the three months ended September 28, 2024 resulted in an income tax benefit and applying this\nnegative annual effective tax rate to the pretax loss for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 resulted in an income tax expense. In addition, for the nine\nmonths ended September 28, 2024, the effective tax rate was impacted by approximately $2,748 of tax expense recorded for an out-of-period income tax\nadjustment and $2,181 of tax expense from a valuation allowance established to offset certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing\nfuture tax benefits. The adoption of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s global tax reform initiative, which introduces a global\nminimum tax of 15% applicable to large multinational corporations, did not have an impact on the Company’s effective tax rates for the three and nine months\nended September 28, 2024.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and the Company’s consolidated effective tax\nrate was primarily due to the valuation allowance noted above. In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by tax expense from income earned in foreign\njurisdictions, partially offset by a tax benefit related to foreign-derived intangible income.\nNon-Income Tax Matters\nThe Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) notified the Company of certain penalties assessed related to the annual disclosure and reporting requirements\nof the Affordable Care Act. The Company appealed this determination, and in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the penalties were fully abated and the federal tax\nlien maintained by the IRS during the appeals process was lifted.\n18\nWW INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER UNIT AMOUNTS)\n10. Legal\nDue to the nature of the Company’s activities, it is, at times, subject to pending and threatened legal actions that arise out of the ordinary course of\nbusiness. In the opinion of management, the disposition of any such matters is not expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on\nthe Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the results of legal actions cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, it is\npossible that the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected in any particular period by the\nunfavorable resolution of one or more legal actions.\n11. Derivative Instruments and Hedging\nIn June 2023, the Company amended the terms of its then-effective interest rate swap agreements to implement a forward-looking interest rate based on\nTerm SOFR in place of LIBOR. Since the interest rate swap agreements were affected by reference rate reform, the Company applied the expedients and\nexceptions provided to preserve the past presentation of its derivatives without de-designating the existing hedging relationships. All amendments to interest rate\nswap agreements were executed with the existing counterparties and did not change the notional amounts, maturity dates, or other critical terms of the hedging\nrelationships.\nAs of September 28, 2024, due to the termination of the interest rate swaps on March 31, 2024 as discussed below, the Company did not have any interest\nrate swaps in effect. As of December 30, 2023, the Company had in effect interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount totaling $500,000.\nOn June 11, 2018, in order to hedge a portion of its variable rate debt, the Company entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap (the “2018 swap”)\nwith an effective date of April 2, 2020 and a termination date of March 31, 2024. The initial notional amount of this swap was $500,000. During the term of this\nswap, the notional amount decreased from $500,000 effective April 2, 2020 to $250,000 on March 31, 2021. Following the transition from LIBOR to Term\nSOFR, this interest rate swap effectively fixed the variable interest rate on the notional amount of this swap at 3.1513%. On June 7, 2019, in order to hedge a\nportion of its variable rate debt, the Company entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap (the “2019 swap”, and together with the 2018 swap, the “interest\nrate swaps”) with an effective date of April 2, 2020 and a termination date of March 31, 2024. The notional amount of this swap was $250,000. Following the\ntransition from LIBOR to Term SOFR, this interest rate swap effectively fixed the variable interest rate on the notional amount of this swap at 1.9645%. The\ninterest rate swaps qualified for hedge accounting and, therefore, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss.\nAs of September 28, 2024, there was no cumulative unrealized gain for qualifying hedges reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive\nloss. As of December 30, 2023, the cumulative unrealized gain for qualifying hedges was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in\nthe amount of $2,716 ($3,474 before taxes).\nThe following table presents the aggregate fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments by balance sheet classification and location:\nFair Value\nBalance Sheet Balance Sheet\nClassification Location September 28, 2024 December 30, 2023\nAssets:\nInterest rate swaps Current asset Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ — $ 3,555\nTotal assets $ — $ 3,555\n12. Fair Value Measurements\nAccounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be\nclassified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n• Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or\nliabilities.\n• Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n19\nWW INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AND PER UNIT AMOUNTS)\nWhen measuring fair value, the Company is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s significant financial instruments include long-term debt agreements as of September 28, 2024. The Company’s significant financial\ninstruments included long-term debt and interest rate swap agreements as of December 30, 2023. Since there were no outstanding borrowings under the\nRevolving Credit Facility as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the fair value approximated a carrying value of $0 at both September 28, 2024 and\nDecember 30, 2023.\nThe fair value of the Company’s Credit Facilities is determined by utilizing average bid prices on or near the end of each fiscal quarter (Level 2 input). As\nof September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt was approximately $382,628 and $996,429, respectively, as\ncompared to the carrying value (net of deferred financing costs and debt discount) of $1,429,598 and $1,426,464, respectively.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe fair values for the Company’s derivative financial instruments were determined using observable current market information such as the prevailing\nTerm SOFR interest rate and Term SOFR yield curve rates and included consideration of counterparty credit risk. See Note 11 for disclosures related to the\nCompany’s use of derivative financial instruments.\nThe following table presents the aggregate fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments:\nFair Value Measurements Using:\nQuoted Prices in Significant\nTotal Active Markets Significant Other Unobservable\nFair for Identical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nInterest rate swaps current asset at September 28, 2024 $ — $ — $ — $ —\nInterest rate swaps current asset at December 30, 2023 $ 3,555 $ — $ 3,555 $ —\nThe Company did not have any transfers into or out of Levels 1 and 2 and did not maintain any assets or liabilities classified as Level 3 during the nine\nmonths ended September 28, 2024 and the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.\n13.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWW International, Inc. is a Virginia corporation with its principal executive offices in New York, New York. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nunless the context indicates otherwise, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” “Weight Watchers” and “WW” refer to WW International, Inc. and all of its operations\nconsolidated for purposes of its financial statements. Effective the first day of fiscal 2024 (i.e., December 31, 2023), as a result of the continued evolution of our\ncentralized organizational structure in fiscal 2023, and management’s 2024 strategic planning process, our reportable segments changed to one segment for the\npurpose of making operational and resource decisions and assessing financial performance. Our “Digital” business refers to providing subscriptions to our digital\nproduct offerings. Our “Workshops + Digital” business refers to providing subscriptions for unlimited access to our workshops combined with our digital\nsubscription product offerings. Our “Clinical” business refers to providing subscriptions to our clinical product offerings provided by WeightWatchers Clinic\n(formerly referred to as Sequence) combined with our digital subscription product offerings.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31st and consists of either 52- or 53-week periods. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q:\n• “fiscal 2020” refers to our fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 (included a 53rd week);\n• “fiscal 2021” refers to our fiscal year ended January 1, 2022;\n• “fiscal 2022” refers to our fiscal year ended December 31, 2022;\n• “fiscal 2023” refers to our fiscal year ended December 30, 2023;\n• “fiscal 2024” refers to our fiscal year ended December 28, 2024;\n• “fiscal 2025” refers to our fiscal year ended January 3, 2026 (includes a 53rd week);\n• “fiscal 2026” refers to our fiscal year ended January 2, 2027;\n• “fiscal 2027” refers to our fiscal year ended January 1, 2028;\n• “fiscal 2028” refers to our fiscal year ended December 30, 2028; and\n• “fiscal 2029” refers to our fiscal year ended December 29, 2029.\nThe following terms used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are our trademarks: Weekend HealthTM, Weight Watchers®, and the Weight Watchers\nlogo.\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 that includes additional information about\nus, our results of operations, our financial position and our cash flows, and with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in\nItem 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (collectively referred to as the “Consolidated Financial Statements”).\n29\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTo supplement our consolidated results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), we have\ndisclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. Gross profit, gross margin, operating (loss) income, operating\n(loss) income margin and components thereof are discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and as adjusted (on a\nnon-GAAP basis), as applicable, with respect to (i) the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to exclude (x) the impact of impairment charges for our franchise rights\nacquired related to our United States and United Kingdom units of account, (y) the net impact of (a) charges associated with our previously disclosed 2024\nrestructuring plan (the “2024 plan”), (b) charges associated with our previously disclosed 2023 restructuring plan (the “2023 plan”) or the reversal of certain of\nthe charges associated with the 2023 plan, as applicable and (c) the reversal of certain of the charges associated with our previously disclosed 2022 restructuring\nplan (the “2022 plan”), and (z) the impact of certain non-recurring expenses in connection with the separation from the Company of our former Chief Executive\nOfficer (“CEO”); (ii) the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to exclude (x) the impact of impairment charges for our franchise rights acquired related to our United\nStates, Australia, United Kingdom and New Zealand units of account, (y) the net impact of charges associated with the 2024 plan, the 2023 plan and the 2022\nplan, and (z) the impact of certain non-recurring expenses in connection with the separation from the Company of our former CEO; (iii) the third quarter of fiscal\n2023 to exclude the net impact of charges associated with the 2023 plan and the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2022 plan; and (iv) the first\nnine months of fiscal 2023 to exclude (x) the net impact of (a) charges associated with the 2023 plan, (b) charges associated with the 2022 plan or the reversal of\ncertain of the charges associated with the 2022 plan, as applicable, (c) charges associated with our previously disclosed 2021 organizational restructuring plan\n(the “2021 plan”) or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2021 plan, as applicable, and (d) the reversal of certain of the charges associated\nwith our previously disclosed 2020 organizational restructuring plan (the “2020 plan”), and (y) the impact of certain non-recurring transaction costs in\nconnection with the acquisition of Sequence. We generally refer to such non-GAAP measures as excluding or adjusting for the impact of franchise rights\nacquired impairments, the net impact of restructuring charges, the impact of acquisition transaction costs, and the impact of former CEO separation expenses, as\napplicable. We also present within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,\namortization and stock-based compensation (“EBITDAS”); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, franchise\nrights acquired and goodwill impairments, net restructuring charges, acquisition transaction costs, and former CEO separation expenses (“Adjusted EBITDAS”);\ntotal debt less unamortized deferred financing costs, unamortized debt discount and cash on hand (i.e., net debt); and a net debt/Adjusted EBITDAS ratio. See\n“—Liquidity and Capital Resources—EBITDAS, Adjusted EBITDAS and Net Debt” for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most\ncomparable GAAP financial measure in each case. Our management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to\ninvestors regarding the performance of our business and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of our business. While we believe that\nthese non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nUSE OF CONSTANT CURRENCY\nAs exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe in certain cases the presentation of results on a\nconstant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in\ncomparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We\nuse results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we calculate constant currency by\ncalculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as\nexcluding or adjusting for the impact of foreign currency or being on a constant currency basis. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a\nsubstitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP and are not meant to be considered in isolation. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present\nthem, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nFranchise Rights Acquired\nFinite-lived franchise rights acquired are amortized over the remaining contractual period, which is generally less than one year. Indefinite-lived franchise\nrights acquired are tested for potential impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events so require.\n30\nIn performing the impairment analysis for indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired, the fair value for franchise rights acquired is estimated using a\ndiscounted cash flow approach referred to as the hypothetical start-up approach for franchise rights related to our Workshops + Digital business and a relief from\nroyalty methodology for franchise rights related to our Digital business. The aggregate estimated fair value for these franchise rights is then compared to the\ncarrying value of the unit of account for these rights. We have determined the appropriate unit of account for purposes of assessing impairment to be the\ncombination of the rights in both the Workshops + Digital business and the Digital business in the country in which the applicable acquisition occurred. The net\nbook value of franchise rights acquired for the United States unit of account as of the September 28, 2024 balance sheet date was $68.6 million.\nIn our hypothetical start-up approach analysis for fiscal 2024, we assumed that the year of maturity was reached after 7 years. Subsequent to the year of\nmaturity, we estimated future cash flows for the Workshops + Digital business in each country based on assumptions regarding revenue growth and operating\nincome margins. In our relief from royalty approach analysis for fiscal 2024, the cash flows associated with the Digital business in each country were based on\nthe expected Digital revenue for such country and the application of a royalty rate based on current market terms. The cash flows for the Workshops + Digital\nand the Digital businesses were discounted utilizing rates which were calculated using the weighted average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity\nand the cost of debt.\nGoodwill\nIn performing the impairment analysis for goodwill, the fair value for our reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. This\napproach involves projecting future cash flows attributable to the reporting unit and discounting those estimated cash flows using an appropriate discount rate.\nThe estimated fair value is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. We have determined the appropriate reporting units for purposes of\nassessing goodwill impairment to be the Behavioral and Clinical business lines. Our “Behavioral” business line consists of our Workshops + Digital business and\nDigital business. The net book values of goodwill for the Behavioral and Clinical reporting units as of the September 28, 2024 balance sheet date were $153.0\nmillion and $89.7 million, respectively.\nIn performing the impairment analysis for goodwill, for all of our reporting units, we estimated future cash flows by utilizing the historical debt-free cash\nflows (cash flows provided by operations less capital expenditures) attributable to each of the Behavioral and Clinical reporting units and then applied expected\nfuture operating income growth rates for the respective reporting unit. We utilized operating income as the basis for measuring our potential growth because we\nbelieve it is the best indicator of the performance of our business. We then discounted the estimated future cash flows utilizing a discount rate which was\ncalculated using the weighted average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt.\nIndefinite-Lived Franchise Rights Acquired and Goodwill Impairment Tests\nWe review indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired and goodwill for potential impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events so require.\nWe performed our annual fair value impairment testing as of May 5, 2024 and May 7, 2023, each the first day of fiscal May, on our indefinite-lived franchise\nrights acquired and goodwill. In addition, based on triggering events, we performed interim impairment tests as of March 30, 2024 and September 28, 2024 on\nour indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired and goodwill for the first and third quarters of fiscal 2024, respectively.\nWhen determining fair value, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows, revenue growth rates, operating income margins\nand discount rates. A change in these underlying assumptions could cause a change in the results of the impairment assessments and, as such, could cause fair\nvalue to be less than the carrying values and result in an impairment of those assets. In the event such a result occurred, we would be required to record a\ncorresponding charge, which would impact earnings. We would also be required to reduce the carrying values of the related assets on our balance sheet. We\ncontinue to evaluate these assumptions and believe that these assumptions are appropriate.\nIn performing our impairment analyses, we also considered the trading value of both our equity and debt. If the trading values of both our equity and debt\nwere to significantly decline from their levels at the time of testing, we may have to take an impairment charge at the appropriate time, which could be material.\nFor additional information on risks associated with our recognizing asset impairment charges, see the risk factor titled “We have in the past and may in the future\nbe required to recognize asset impairment charges for indefinite- and definite-lived assets” found in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor fiscal 2023.\nFurther information regarding the results of our franchise rights acquired and goodwill annual impairment tests and our franchise rights acquired and\ngoodwill interim impairment tests for the first and third quarters of fiscal 2024 can be found in Note 6 “Franchise Rights Acquired, Goodwill and Other\nIntangible Assets” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n31\nCritical Accounting Policies\nInformation concerning our critical accounting policies is set forth in “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023. Our critical accounting policies have not changed since the end of fiscal\n2023.\nPERFORMANCE INDICATORS\nOur management team regularly reviews and analyzes a number of financial and operating metrics, including the key performance indicators listed\nbelow, in order to manage our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, determine the allocation of resources, make decisions\nregarding corporate strategies and assess the quality and potential variability of our cash flows and earnings. We also believe that these key performance\nindicators are useful to both management and investors for forecasting purposes and to facilitate comparisons to our historical operating results. These metrics\nare supplemental to our GAAP results and include operational measures.\n• Revenues—Our “Subscription Revenues” consist of “Digital Subscription Revenues”, “Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues” and\n“Clinical Subscription Revenues”. “Digital Subscription Revenues” consist of the fees associated with subscriptions for our Digital offerings.\n“Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues” consist of the fees associated with subscriptions for combined workshops and Digital offerings.\n“Clinical Subscription Revenues” consist of the fees associated with subscriptions for combined Clinical and Digital offerings. In addition, “Other\nRevenues” (formerly known as “product sales and other”) consist of revenues from licensing and publishing, franchise fees with respect to\ncommitment plans and royalties, and other revenues. Prior to fiscal 2024, “Other Revenues” included sales of consumer products.\n• Paid Weeks—The “Paid Weeks” metric reports paid weeks by WW customers in Company-owned operations for a given period as follows: (i)\n“Digital Paid Weeks” is the total paid subscription weeks for our Digital offerings; (ii) “Workshops + Digital Paid Weeks” is the total paid\nsubscription weeks for combined workshops and Digital offerings; (iii) “Clinical Paid Weeks” is the total paid subscription weeks for combined\nClinical and Digital offerings; and (iv) “Total Paid Weeks” is the sum of Digital Paid Weeks, Workshops + Digital Paid Weeks and Clinical Paid\nWeeks.\n• Incoming Subscribers—“Subscribers” refer to Digital subscribers, Workshops + Digital subscribers and Clinical subscribers who participate in\nrecurring bill programs in Company-owned operations. The “Incoming Subscribers” metric reports Subscribers in Company-owned operations at\na given period start as follows: (i) “Incoming Digital Subscribers” is the total number of Digital subscribers; (ii) “Incoming Workshops + Digital\nSubscribers” is the total number of subscribers that have access to combined workshops and Digital offerings; (iii) “Incoming Clinical\nSubscribers” is the total number of subscribers that have access to combined Clinical and Digital offerings; and (iv) “Incoming Subscribers” is the\nsum of Incoming Digital Subscribers, Incoming Workshops + Digital Subscribers and Incoming Clinical Subscribers, as applicable. Given we\ncompleted our acquisition of Sequence in April 2023 after the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we have incoming subscribers with\nrespect to our Clinical business for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2024 and for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, but not for the first\nnine months of fiscal 2023. Recruitment and retention are key drivers for this metric.\n• End of Period Subscribers—The “End of Period Subscribers” metric reports Subscribers in Company-owned operations at a given period end as\nfollows: (i) “End of Period Digital Subscribers” is the total number of Digital subscribers; (ii) “End of Period Workshops + Digital Subscribers” is\nthe total number of subscribers that have access to combined workshops and Digital offerings; (iii) “End of Period Clinical Subscribers” is the\ntotal number of subscribers that have access to combined Clinical and Digital offerings; and (iv) “End of Period Subscribers” is the sum of End of\nPeriod Digital Subscribers, End of Period Workshops + Digital Subscribers and End of Period Clinical Subscribers. Recruitment and retention are\nkey drivers for this metric.\n• Gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\n32\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2024 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023\nThe table below sets forth selected financial information for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from our consolidated statements of operations for the three\nmonths ended September 28, 2024 versus selected financial information for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 from our consolidated statements of operations for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023.\nSummary of Selected Financial Data\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nFor The Three Months Ended\n% Change\nIncrease/ % Constant\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 (Decrease) Change Currency\nRevenues, net $ 192.9 $ 214.9 $ (22.0) (10.2%) (10.6% )\nCost of revenues 63.4 73.1 (9.7) (13.3%) (13.5% )\nGross profit 129.5 141.8 (12.3) (8.6%) (9.1% )\nGross Margin % 67.1% 66.0%\nMarketing expenses 44.4 48.1 (3.7) (7.7% ) (7.5% )\nSelling, general & administrative expenses 67.1 63.0 4.1 6.4% 6.3%\nFranchise rights acquired impairments 57.0 — 57.0 100.0% 100.0%\nOperating (loss) income (39.0) 30.6 69.7 100.0%* 100.0%*\nOperating (Loss) Income Margin % (20.2% ) 14.2%\nInterest expense 28.6 24.5 4.1 16.8% 16.8%\nOther expense, net 5.9 0.8 5.1 100.0%* 100.0%*\n(Loss) income before income taxes (73.5) 5.3 78.8 100.0%* 100.0%*\nBenefit from income taxes (27.3) (38.4) (11.1) (28.9% ) (28.6% )\nNet (loss) income $ (46.2) $ 43.7 $ 89.9 100.0%* 100.0%*\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding 79.7 80.6 (0.9) (1.1% ) (1.1% )\nDiluted (net loss) earnings per share $ (0.58) $ 0.54 $ 1.12 100.0%* 100.0%*\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n* Note: Percentage in excess of 100.0% and not meaningful.\n33\nCertain results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 are adjusted to exclude the impact of franchise rights acquired impairments, the net impact of\nrestructuring charges and the impact of former CEO separation expenses.

See “Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures” above for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nConsolidated Results\nRevenues\nRevenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $192.9 million, a decrease of $22.0 million, or 10.2%, versus the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\nExcluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted our revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by $0.7 million, revenues for the third\nquarter of fiscal 2024 would have decreased 10.6% versus the prior year period. This decrease was driven by both the decline in Subscription Revenues and the\ndecline in Other Revenues. The decline in Subscription Revenues was primarily due to recruitment declines during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the\nprior year period and the lower number of non-Clinical Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the beginning of the third\nquarter of fiscal 2023. Additionally, Subscription Revenues were negatively impacted by the continued mix shift from our Workshops + Digital business to our\nDigital business and a higher mix of Digital subscribers within their initial, lower-priced commitment periods. Subscription Revenues benefited from an increase\nin Clinical Subscription Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period. The decline in Other Revenues was primarily due to the\ndiscontinuation of our consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023. See “—Operating Results” for additional details on revenues.\n34\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased $9.7 million, or 13.3%, versus the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of\nforeign currency, which increased cost of revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by $0.1 million, cost of revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would\nhave decreased 13.5% versus the prior year period. Excluding the net impact of the $3.8 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and\nthe net impact of the $0.4 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, cost of revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have\ndecreased by 18.1%, or 18.2% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased $12.3 million, or 8.6%, versus the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign\ncurrency, which positively impacted gross profit in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by $0.6 million, gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have\ndecreased 9.1% versus the prior year period. Excluding the net impact of the $3.8 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the net\nimpact of the $0.4 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, gross profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have decreased by\n6.2%, or 6.6% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased to 67.1%, both as reported\nand on a constant currency basis, versus 66.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the net impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal\n2024 and the net impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have increased to\n69.1%, both as adjusted and as adjusted on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. This gross margin increase was driven primarily by actions to\nreduce the fixed cost base within our business and the discontinuation of our lower margin consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023.\nMarketing\nMarketing expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased $3.7 million, or 7.7%, versus the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of\nforeign currency, which decreased marketing expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by $0.1 million, marketing expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024\nwould have decreased 7.5% versus the prior year period. This decrease in marketing expenses was primarily due to the strategic decision to reduce investment in\nthe quarter given the rise in customer acquisition costs. Marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased to 23.0%\nfrom 22.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased $4.1 million, or 6.4%, versus the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\nExcluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 by $0.1 million, selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 would have increased 6.3% versus the prior year period. Excluding the net impact of the\n$10.0 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the impact of the $3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses in the third quarter of\nfiscal 2024 and the net impact of the $5.6 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses for the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2024 would have decreased by 7.3%, or 7.4% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. This decrease in selling, general\nand administrative expenses was primarily due to a decline in employee compensation and related costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a\npercentage of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased to 34.8% from 29.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Excluding the net impact of\nrestructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the impact of former CEO separation expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of\nrestructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal\n2024 would have increased by 0.9%, both as adjusted and as adjusted on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period.\nImpairments\nIn performing our interim impairment analysis as of September 28, 2024, we determined that the carrying values of our United States and United\nKingdom franchise rights acquired with indefinite-lived units of account exceeded their respective fair values and, as a result, we recorded impairment charges\nfor our United States and United Kingdom units of account of $54.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n35\nOperating (Loss) Income\nOperating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $39.0 million compared to operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 of $30.6 million.\nOperating loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was positively impacted by $0.5 million of foreign currency. Excluding the impact of the $57.0 million of\nfranchise rights acquired impairments in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the net impact of the $13.8 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal\n2024, the impact of the $3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of the $6.0 million of restructuring\ncharges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, operating income would have been $35.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus operating income of $36.6\nmillion for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, a decrease of 2.5%, or 4.2% on a constant currency basis. Operating loss margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2024\nwas 20.2% compared to operating income margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 of 14.2%. Excluding the impact of franchise rights acquired impairments in\nthe third quarter of fiscal 2024, the net impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the impact of former CEO separation expenses in the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of restructuring charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, operating income margin would have been 18.5%, or\n18.2% on a constant currency basis, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus operating income margin of 17.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This\nincrease in operating income margin was driven primarily by an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses as a percentage of revenue and an increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue, versus the prior year period.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased $4.1 million, or 16.8%, versus the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in interest\nexpense was driven primarily by an increase in the base rate of our Term Loan Facility (as defined below). The effective interest rate on our debt, based on\ninterest incurred (which includes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during the third quarter of fiscal\n2024 and the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and excluding the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, increased to 7.75% per annum for the third quarter of\nfiscal 2024 from 7.73% per annum for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Interest expense was impacted by the termination of our interest rate swaps on March 31,\n2024. Including the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, the effective interest rate on our debt, based on interest incurred (which includes amortization of\nour deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the third quarter of fiscal 2023, increased\nto 7.75% per annum for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 from 6.75% per annum for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—\nLong-Term Debt” for additional details regarding our debt, including interest rates and payments thereon. Further information regarding our use of interest rate\nswaps can be found in Note 11 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net, which consists primarily of the negative impact of foreign currency on intercompany transactions, increased by $5.1 million for the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2024 to $5.9 million of expense as compared to $0.8 million of expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\nTax\nOur effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 37.2% compared to (727.7%) for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The effective tax rate for\ninterim periods is determined using an annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. The forecasted full-year fiscal 2024 tax expense, which included an\nincrease in valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets, in relation to our forecasted full-year pretax loss (albeit minimal), drove the unusually high\nnegative annual effective tax rate. Applying this negative annual effective tax rate to pretax loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 resulted in an income tax\nbenefit. The adoption of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s global tax reform initiative, which introduces a global minimum tax of\n15% applicable to large multinational corporations, did not have an impact on our effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and our consolidated effective tax rate was primarily due to\nthe valuation allowance noted above. In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by tax expense from income earned in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset\nby a tax benefit related to foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”).\nNet (Loss) Income and Diluted (Net Loss) Earnings Per Share\nNet loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $46.2 million compared to net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 of $43.7 million. Net loss for the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2024 was positively impacted by $0.3 million of foreign currency. Net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 included a $51.8 million\nimpact from franchise rights acquired impairments, a $10.4 million net impact from restructuring charges and a $2.9 million impact from former CEO separation\nexpenses. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 included a $4.5 million net impact from restructuring charges.\n36\nDiluted net loss per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $0.58 compared to earnings per fully diluted share (“EPS”) for the third quarter of fiscal\n2023 of $0.54. Diluted net loss per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 included a $0.65 impact from franchise rights acquired impairments, a $0.13 net\nimpact from restructuring charges and a $0.04 impact from former CEO separation expenses. EPS for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 included a $0.06 net impact\nfrom restructuring charges.\nOperating Results\nAs previously disclosed, effective the first day of fiscal 2024 (i.e., December 31, 2023), as a result of the continued evolution of our centralized\norganizational structure in fiscal 2023, and management’s 2024 strategic planning process, our reportable segments changed to one segment for the purpose of\nmaking operational and resource decisions and assessing financial performance.\nMetrics and Business Trends\nThe following tables set forth key metrics for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the percentage change in those metrics versus the prior year period:\n(in millions except percentages and as noted)\nQ3 2024\nGAAP Constant Currency\nTotal\nSubscription Other Total Subscription Other Total Paid Incoming EOP\nRevenues Revenues Revenues Revenues Revenues Revenues Weeks Subscribers Subscribers\n(in thousands)\n$ 191.2 $ 1.6 $ 192.9 $ 190.6 $ 1.6 $ 192.2 48.6 3,836.5 3,666.7\n% Change Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023\n(6.0%) (85.6%) (10.2%) (6.4%) (85.7%) (10.6%) (7.4%) (6.1%) (8.8%)\n(in millions except percentages and as noted)\nQ3 2024\nWorkshops + Digital Subscription\nDigital Subscription Revenues Revenues\nWorkshops Incoming EOP\nDigital Incoming EOP + Digital Workshops Workshops\nConstant Paid Digital Digital Constant Paid + Digital + Digital\nGAAP Currency Weeks Subscribers Subscribers GAAP Currency Weeks Subscribers Subscribers\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\n$ 127.2 $ 126.6 40.4 3,189.6 3,042.9 $ 45.0 $ 44.9 7.2 566.0 546.1\n% Change Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023\n(9.7%) (10.1%) (5.6%) (4.2%) (7.3%) (14.4%) (14.7%) (21.2%) (21.4%) (21.2%)\n(in millions except percentages and as noted)\nQ3 2024\nClinical Subscription Revenues\nClinical Incoming EOP\nPaid Clinical Clinical\nGAAP Weeks Subscribers Subscribers\n(in thousands)\n$ 19.1 1.0 81.0 77.8\n% Change Q3 2024 vs. Q3 2023\n90.7% 91.3% 100.0% * 71.5%\n* Note: Percentage in excess of 100.0% and not meaningful.\n37\nOperating Performance\nThe decrease in revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven by both a decrease in Subscription Revenues and a\ndecrease in Other Revenues. The decrease in Subscription Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven by a decrease in\nDigital Subscription Revenues and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues primarily due to recruitment declines during the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period and the lower number of Incoming Digital Subscribers and Incoming Workshops + Digital\nSubscribers at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. In addition, the continued mix shift from\nour Workshops + Digital business to our Digital business and a higher mix of Digital subscribers within their initial, lower-priced commitment periods\ncontributed to the decrease in Digital and Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues in the quarter. Subscription Revenues benefited from an increase in\nClinical Subscription Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period, despite the recruitment challenges in the third quarter of fiscal\n2024 arising from the increasingly competitive environment.\nThe decrease in Other Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven primarily by the discontinuation of our\nconsumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023.\nThe decrease in Total Paid Weeks for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven primarily by recruitment declines during the\nthird quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period and the lower number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal\n2024 versus the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n38\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2024 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023\nThe table below sets forth selected financial information for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from our consolidated statements of operations for the\nnine months ended September 28, 2024 versus selected financial information for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 from our consolidated statements of\noperations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nSummary of Selected Financial Data\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nFor The Nine Months Ended\n% Change\nIncrease/ % Constant\nSeptember 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 (Decrease) Change Currency\nRevenues, net $ 601.5 $ 683.6 $ (82.1) (12.0%) (12.1% )\nCost of revenues 196.9 279.1 (82.2) (29.5%) (29.5% )\nGross profit 404.6 404.4 0.1 0.0% (0.1% )\nGross Margin % 67.3% 59.2%\nMarketing expenses 188.3 187.5 0.8 0.4% 0.4%\nSelling, general & administrative expenses 173.7 188.6 (14.9) (7.9% ) (8.0% )\nFranchise rights acquired impairments 315.0 — 315.0 100.0% 100.0%\nOperating (loss) income (272.4) 28.3 300.8 100.0%* 100.0%*\nOperating (Loss) Income Margin % (45.3% ) 4.1%\nInterest expense 81.9 71.4 10.5 14.7% 14.7%\nOther expense (income), net 4.2 (0.0) 4.2 100.0%* 100.0%*\nLoss before income taxes (358.6) (43.1) 315.5 100.0%* 100.0%*\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes 12.3 (18.9) 31.2 100.0%* 100.0%*\nNet loss $ (370.8) $ (24.1) $ 346.7 100.0%* 100.0%*\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding 79.5 75.9 3.6 4.8% 4.8%\nDiluted net loss per share $ (4.67) $ (0.32) $ 4.35 100.0%* 100.0%*\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n* Note: Percentage in excess of 100.0% and not meaningful.\n39\nCertain results for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 are adjusted to exclude the impact of franchise rights acquired impairments, the net impact of\nrestructuring charges and the impact of former CEO separation expenses.

This decrease was driven primarily by the decline in Other Revenues from\nthe discontinuation of our consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023. Lower Subscription Revenues, primarily due to a higher mix of Digital\nsubscribers within their initial, lower-priced commitment periods and non-Clinical recruitment declines during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the\nprior year period, also contributed to the decrease in revenues in the period. Additionally, Subscription Revenues were negatively impacted by the continued mix\nshift from our Workshops + Digital business to our Digital business. Subscription Revenues included $57.5 million of Clinical Subscription Revenues for the\nfirst nine months of fiscal 2024 versus $17.6 million of Clinical Subscription Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 as a result of our acquisition of\nSequence closing during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. See “—Operating Results” for additional details on revenues.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 decreased $82.2 million, or 29.5%, versus the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Excluding the\nimpact of foreign currency, which increased cost of revenues in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 by $0.2 million, cost of revenues for the first nine months of\nfiscal 2024 would have decreased 29.5% versus the prior year period. Excluding the net impact of the $6.2 million of restructuring charges in the first nine\nmonths of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of the $19.7 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, cost of revenues for the first nine\nmonths of fiscal 2024 would have decreased by 26.5%, or 26.6% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased $0.1 million, or 0.0%, versus the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of\nforeign currency, which positively impacted gross profit in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 by $0.7 million, gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal\n2024 would have decreased 0.1% versus the prior year period. Excluding the net impact of the $6.2 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of\nfiscal 2024 and the net impact of the $19.7 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal\n2024 would have decreased by 3.1%, or 3.3% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. Gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2024\nincreased to 67.3%, or 67.2% on a constant currency basis, versus 59.2% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Excluding the net impact of restructuring\ncharges in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and the net impact of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, gross margin for the first nine\nmonths of fiscal 2024 would have increased 6.2% to 68.3%, both as adjusted and as adjusted on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. This\ngross margin increase was driven primarily by actions to reduce the fixed cost base within our business and the discontinuation of our lower margin consumer\nproducts business at the end of fiscal 2023.\nMarketing\nMarketing expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased $0.8 million, or 0.4%, versus the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Foreign currency\nhad a de minimis impact on marketing expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. This increase in marketing expenses was primarily due to higher spend\non online advertising, partially offset by lower spend on TV advertising and production fees and agency fees. Marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue for\nthe first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased to 31.3% from 27.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023.\n41\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 decreased $14.9 million, or 7.9%, versus the first nine months of\nfiscal 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 by\n$0.1 million, selling, general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 would have decreased 8.0% versus the prior year period.\nExcluding the net impact of the $15.3 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the $3.9 million of former CEO separation\nexpenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the net impact of the $11.6 million of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and the impact\nof the $8.6 million of acquisition transaction costs in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of\nfiscal 2024 would have decreased by 8.2%, or 8.3% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period. This decrease in selling, general and\nadministrative expenses was primarily due to a decline in employee compensation and related costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage\nof revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased to 28.9% from 27.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Excluding the net impact of\nrestructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the impact of former CEO separation expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the net impact\nof restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and the impact of acquisition transaction costs in the first nine months of fiscal 2023, selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 would have increased by 1.1%, both as adjusted and as\nadjusted on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year period.\nImpairments\nIn performing our interim impairment analysis as of September 28, 2024, we determined that the carrying values of our United States and United\nKingdom franchise rights acquired with indefinite-lived units of account exceeded their respective fair values and, as a result, we recorded impairment charges\nfor our United States and United Kingdom units of account of $54.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nIn performing our interim impairment analysis as of March 30, 2024, we determined that the carrying values of our United States, Australia, New\nZealand and United Kingdom franchise rights acquired with indefinite-lived units of account exceeded their respective fair values and, as a result, we recorded\nimpairment charges for our United States, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom units of account of $251.4 million, $4.1 million, $2.3 million and $0.2\nmillion, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nOperating (Loss) Income\nOperating loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $272.4 million compared to operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 of $28.3\nmillion. Operating loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was positively impacted by $0.4 million of foreign currency. Excluding the impact of the $315.0\nmillion of franchise rights acquired impairments in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the net impact of the $21.5 million of restructuring charges in the first\nnine months of fiscal 2024, the impact of the $3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the net impact of the $31.3\nmillion of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and the impact of the $8.6 million of acquisition transaction costs in the first nine months\nof fiscal 2023, operating income would have been $68.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus operating income of $68.2 million for the first\nnine months of fiscal 2023, a decrease of 0.4%, or 1.1% on a constant currency basis. Operating loss margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was 45.3%\ncompared to operating income margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 of 4.1%. Excluding the impact of franchise rights acquired impairments in the first\nnine months of fiscal 2024, the net impact of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the impact of former CEO separation expenses in the\nfirst nine months of fiscal 2024, the net impact of restructuring charges in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and the impact of acquisition transaction costs in\nthe first nine months of fiscal 2023, operating income margin would have been 11.3%, or 11.2% on a constant currency basis, for the first nine months of fiscal\n2024 versus operating income margin of 10.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. This increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by an\nincrease in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue and an increase in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses as a percentage of revenue, versus the prior year period.\n42\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased $10.5 million, or 14.7%, versus the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The increase in\ninterest expense was driven primarily by an increase in the base rate of our Term Loan Facility (as defined below). The effective interest rate on our debt, based\non interest incurred (which includes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during the first nine months of\nfiscal 2024 and the first nine months of fiscal 2023 and excluding the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, increased to 7.76% per annum for the first\nnine months of fiscal 2024 from 7.48% per annum for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Interest expense was impacted by the termination of our interest rate\nswaps on March 31, 2024. Including the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, the effective interest rate on our debt, based on interest incurred (which\nincludes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and the first nine\nmonths of fiscal 2023, increased to 7.44% per annum for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 from 6.62% per annum for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. See\n“—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Long-Term Debt” for additional details regarding our debt, including interest rates and payments thereon. Further\ninformation regarding our use of interest rate swaps can be found in Note 11 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging” in the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net, which consists primarily of the negative impact of foreign currency on intercompany transactions, changed by $4.2 million\nfor the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to $4.2 million of expense as compared to $36 thousand of income for the first nine months of fiscal 2023.\nTax\nOur effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was (3.4%) compared to 44.0% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The effective tax\nrate for interim periods is determined using an annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. The forecasted full-year fiscal 2024 tax expense, which\nincluded an increase in valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets, in relation to our forecasted full-year pretax loss (albeit minimal), drove the\nunusually high negative annual effective tax rate. Applying this negative annual effective tax rate to the pretax loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024\nresulted in an income tax expense. In addition, for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the effective tax rate was impacted by tax expense recorded for an out-of-\nperiod income tax adjustment and tax expense from a valuation allowance established to offset certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of\nrealizing future tax benefits. The adoption of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s global tax reform initiative, which introduces a\nglobal minimum tax of 15% applicable to large multinational corporations, did not have an impact on our effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal\n2024.\nFor the first nine months of fiscal 2023, the difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and our consolidated effective tax rate was primarily\ndue to the valuation allowance noted above. In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by tax expense from income earned in foreign jurisdictions, partially\noffset by a tax benefit related to FDII.\nNet Loss and Diluted Net Loss Per Share\nNet loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $370.8 million compared to the net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 of $24.1 million. Net\nloss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was positively impacted by $0.3 million of foreign currency. Net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 included\na $293.2 million impact from franchise rights acquired impairments, a $16.1 million net impact from restructuring charges and a $2.9 million impact from\nformer CEO separation expenses. Net loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2023 included a $23.5 million net impact from restructuring charges and a $7.5\nmillion impact from acquisition transaction costs.\nDiluted net loss per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $4.67 compared to diluted net loss per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2023\nof $0.32. Diluted net loss per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 included a $3.69 impact from franchise rights acquired impairments, a $0.20 net\nimpact from restructuring charges and a $0.04 impact from former CEO separation expenses. Diluted net loss per share for the first nine months of fiscal 2023\nincluded a $0.31 net impact from restructuring charges and a $0.10 impact from acquisition transaction costs.\nOperating Results\nAs previously disclosed, effective the first day of fiscal 2024 (i.e., December 31, 2023), as a result of the continued evolution of our centralized\norganizational structure in fiscal 2023, and management’s 2024 strategic planning process, our reportable segments changed to one segment for the purpose of\nmaking operational and resource decisions and assessing financial performance.\n43\nMetrics and Business Trends\nThe following tables set forth key metrics for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and the percentage change in those metrics versus the prior year period,\nas applicable:\n(in millions except percentages and as noted)\nFirst Nine Months of Fiscal 2024\nGAAP Constant Currency\nTotal\nSubscription Other Total Subscription Other Total Paid Incoming EOP\nRevenues Revenues Revenues Revenues Revenues Revenues Weeks Subscribers Subscribers\n(in thousands)\n$ 595.3 $ 6.2 $ 601.5 $ 594.4 $ 6.2 $ 600.7 151.1 3,797.5 3,666.7\n% Change First Nine Months of Fiscal 2024 vs. First Nine Months of Fiscal 2023\n(5.0%) (89.0%) (12.0%) (5.1%) (89.1%) (12.1%) (3.6%) 7.1% (8.8%)\n(in millions except percentages and as noted)\nFirst Nine Months of Fiscal 2024\nWorkshops + Digital Subscription\nDigital Subscription Revenues Revenues\nWorkshops Incoming EOP\nDigital Incoming EOP + Digital Workshops Workshops\nConstant Paid Digital Digital Constant Paid + Digital + Digital\nGAAP Currency Weeks Subscribers Subscribers GAAP Currency Weeks Subscribers Subscribers\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\n$ 399.4 $ 398.8 124.7 3,079.4 3,042.9 $ 138.4 $ 138.2 23.3 651.5 546.1\n% Change First Nine Months of Fiscal 2024 vs. First Nine Months of Fiscal 2023\n(8.7%) (8.9%) (1.7%) 8.6% (7.3%) (19.3%) (19.4%) (19.7%) (8.3%) (21.2%)\n(in millions except percentages and as noted)\nFirst Nine Months of Fiscal 2024\nClinical Subscription Revenues\nClinical Incoming EOP\nPaid Clinical Clinical\nGAAP Weeks Subscribers Subscribers\n(in thousands)\n$ 57.5 3.1 66.6 77.8\n% Change First Nine Months of Fiscal 2024 vs. First Nine Months of Fiscal 2023\n100.0% * 100.0% * N/A ** 71.5%\n* Note: Percentage in excess of 100.0% and not meaningful.\n** N/A - There were no Incoming Clinical Subscribers in the prior year period since our acquisition of Sequence closed during the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nOperating Performance\nThe decrease in revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven by a decrease in Other Revenues and, to a lesser\nextent, a decrease in Subscription Revenues. The decrease in Other Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven\nprimarily by the discontinuation of our consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023.\nThe decrease in Subscription Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven primarily by both a decrease in\nDigital Subscription Revenues and a decrease in Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues due to a higher mix of Digital subscribers within their initial,\nlower-priced commitment periods and recruitment declines during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period. Digital Subscription\nRevenues and Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues were also negatively impacted by the continued mix shift from our Workshops + Digital business to\nour Digital business. In addition, the lower number of Incoming Workshops + Digital Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2024 versus the beginning of fiscal\n2023 contributed to the decrease in Workshops + Digital Subscription Revenues in the period. Subscription Revenues for the first nine months of fiscal 2024\nbenefited from Clinical Subscription Revenues following our acquisition of Sequence during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, despite the recruitment\nchallenges in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2024 arising from the increasingly competitive environment.\n44\nThe decrease in Total Paid Weeks for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 versus the prior year period was driven primarily by non-Clinical recruitment\ndeclines during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with our primary source of liquidity. We have used these cash flows,\nsupplemented with long-term debt and short-term borrowings, to fund our operations and global strategic initiatives, pay down debt and engage in selective\nacquisitions. Upon the completion of our acquisition of Sequence (the “Acquisition”), in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we had a net cash outlay of $40.3\nmillion on April 10, 2023 with respect to the payment of the purchase price and certain transaction costs. For additional details on the purchase price\nconsideration for the Acquisition and related terms, including with respect to the first anniversary payment, see Note 5 “Acquisitions” in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These cash outlays have reduced the liquidity available to us\nin the future. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Acquisition of Weekend Health, Inc. (d/b/a Sequence)—The Acquisition may not achieve its intended\nresults.” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Liquidity—We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and satisfy our other\nliquidity requirements.” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 for additional details. We currently believe that cash generated by\noperations, our cash on hand of approximately $57.2 million at September 28, 2024, our availability under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined and\ndescribed below) at September 28, 2024 and our continued cost focus will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for the short- and long-\nterm. See Note 7 “Long-Term Debt—Liquidity” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q for additional details on our liquidity. In addition, if necessary, we have the flexibility to delay investments or reduce marketing spend.\nWe continue to proactively manage our liquidity so we can maintain flexibility to fund investments in our business, honor our long-term debt obligations,\nand respond to evolving business and consumer conditions. To increase our flexibility and reduce our cash interest payments, we refinanced our then-existing\ncredit facilities and then-existing senior notes in April 2021. Additionally, we instituted a number of measures throughout our operations to mitigate expenses\nand reduce costs as well as ensure liquidity. For example, restructuring plans instituted in recent fiscal years, and most recently in July 2024, have resulted in\naggregate cash outlays of approximately $24.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and are expected to result in an additional $3.3 million for the\nremainder of fiscal 2024. For additional details, see Note 15 “Restructuring” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The evolving nature, and uncertain economic impact, of the current demand environment may impact our liquidity going\nforward. To the extent that we do not successfully manage our costs, our liquidity and financial results, as well as our ability to fully access our Revolving Credit\nFacility, may be adversely affected. Pursuant to their respective terms, our interest rate swaps were terminated on March 31, 2024. Given subsequent market\nconditions, management determined to not enter into any new swap arrangement since March 31, 2024. Management continues to evaluate its exposure to\ninterest rates and, from time to time, may opportunistically hedge any interest rate exposure by entering into new swap arrangements.\nAs market conditions warrant, we may, from time to time, seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Senior Secured Notes\nand borrowings under the Credit Facilities (each as defined below). Such transactions could be privately negotiated or open market transactions, pursuant to\ntender offers or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing, or terms of, our indebtedness, any such purchases made\nby us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet, the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, the issuance of our equity or the sale of assets.\nThe amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may equate to a substantial\namount of a particular class or series of debt, which may reduce the trading liquidity of such class or series.\nBalance Sheet Working Capital\nThe following table sets forth certain relevant measures of our balance sheet working capital deficit, excluding cash and cash equivalents at:\nSeptember 28, December 30, Increase/\n2024 2023 (Decrease)\n(in millions)\nTotal current assets $ 101.2 $ 179.5 $ (78.2)\nTotal current liabilities 189.5 205.5 (16.0)\nWorking capital deficit (88.2) (26.0) 62.2\nCash and cash equivalents 57.2 109.4 (52.2)\nWorking capital deficit, excluding cash and cash equivalents $ (145.4) $ (135.4) $ 10.1\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n45\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the primary factors contributing to the $10.1 million increase in our working capital deficit, excluding cash\nand cash equivalents:\nImpact to\nSeptember 28, December 30, Increase/ Working\n2024 2023 (Decrease) Capital Deficit\n(in millions)\nOperational liabilities and other, net of assets $ 92.0 $ 113.7 $ (21.7) $ (21.7)\nDeferred revenue $ 31.4 $ 34.0 $ (2.5) $ (2.5)\nPortion of operating lease liabilities due within one year $ 9.0 $ 9.6 $ (0.6) $ (0.6)\nDerivative receivable $ — $ 3.6 $ (3.6) $ 3.6\nIncome taxes payable $ 6.7 $ 1.6 $ 5.1 $ 5.1\nAccrued interest $ 17.5 $ 5.3 $ 12.1 $ 12.1\nPrepaid income taxes $ 11.2 $ 25.4 $ (14.1) $ 14.1\nWorking capital deficit change, excluding cash and cash\nequivalents $ 10.1\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\nThe decrease in operational liabilities and other, net of assets, which includes accrued salaries and wages, was driven primarily by a decrease in accrued\nliabilities due to a decline in employee compensation and related costs and a decline in accrued marketing costs. The increase in accrued interest was due to the\ntiming of payments. The decrease in prepaid income taxes was primarily due to the outsized impact of a significant, largely non-cash, income tax expense\nresulting from the valuation allowance recorded to reflect the uncertainty of the realization of U.S. deferred tax assets.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended:\nSeptember 28, September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in millions)\nNet cash used for operating activities $ (21.4) $ (1.2)\nNet cash used for investing activities $ (13.2) $ (66.7)\nNet cash used for financing activities $ (17.1) $ (1.9)\nOperating Activities\nCash flows used for operating activities of $21.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 reflected an increase of $20.3 million from $1.2 million\nof cash flows used for operating activities for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. This increase in cash flows used for operating activities was primarily\nattributable to an increase in net loss, partially offset by an increase in non-cash add-back adjustments driven by the franchise rights acquired impairments and an\nincrease in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities totaled $13.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, a decrease of $53.5 million as compared to the first\nnine months of fiscal 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and a decrease in capitalized\nsoftware and website development expenditures in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the prior year period.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used for financing activities totaled $17.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, an increase of $15.2 million as compared to the first\nnine months of fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as\ncompared to the prior year period.\n46\nLong-Term Debt\nWe currently plan to meet our long-term debt obligations by using cash flows provided by operating activities and opportunistically using other means to\nrepay or refinance our obligations as we determine appropriate.\nThe following schedule sets forth our long-term debt obligations at September 28, 2024:\nLong-Term Debt\nAt September 28, 2024\n(in millions)\nSeptember 28, 2024\nTerm Loan Facility due April 13, 2028 $ 945.0\nSenior Secured Notes due April 15, 2029 500.0\nTotal 1,445.0\nLess: Current portion —\nUnamortized deferred financing costs 7.4\nUnamortized debt discount 8.0\nTotal long-term debt $ 1,429.6\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2021, in connection with our refinancing of our then-existing credit facilities, we incurred approximately $1,000.0 million\nin an aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our new credit facilities (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Facilities”) and issued $500.0 million\nin aggregate principal amount of 4.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the “Senior Secured Notes”), each as described in further detail below.\nCredit Facilities\nThe Credit Facilities were issued under a credit agreement, dated April 13, 2021 (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”), among the\nCompany, as borrower, the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A. (“Bank of America”), as administrative agent and an issuing bank. The Credit\nFacilities consist of (1) $1,000.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured tranche B term loans due in 2028 (the “Term Loan Facility”) and (2)\n$175.0 million in an aggregate principal amount of commitments under a senior secured revolving credit facility (which includes borrowing capacity available\nfor letters of credit) due in 2026 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).\nAs of September 28, 2024, we had $945.0 million in an aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding under our Credit Facilities, with $173.8 million\nof availability and $1.2 million in issued but undrawn letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility subject to its terms and conditions as\ndiscussed below. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 28, 2024.\nAll obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by, subject to certain exceptions, each of our current and future wholly-owned material\ndomestic restricted subsidiaries. All obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of the assets\nof the Company and each guarantor, subject to customary exceptions, including:\n• a pledge of 100% of the equity interests directly held by the Company and each guarantor in any wholly-owned material subsidiary of the\nCompany or any guarantor (which pledge, in the case of any non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. subsidiary, will not include more than 65% of the\nvoting stock of such first-tier non-U.S. subsidiary), subject to certain exceptions; and\n• a security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Credit Facilities require us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:\n• 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0% if we attain certain first lien secured net leverage ratios) of our annual excess cash flow;\n• 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales by the Company and our restricted subsidiaries (including casualty and\ncondemnation events, subject to de minimis thresholds), and subject to the right to reinvest 100% of such proceeds, subject to certain\nqualifications; and\n• 100% of the net proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of debt by the Company or any of our restricted subsidiaries, other than certain debt\npermitted under the Credit Agreement.\n47\nThe foregoing mandatory prepayments will be used to reduce the installments of principal on the Term Loan Facility. We may voluntarily repay\noutstanding loans under the Credit Facilities at any time without penalty, except for customary “breakage” costs with respect to Term SOFR loans under the\nCredit Facilities.\nIn June 2023, in connection with the planned phase-out of LIBOR, we amended our Credit Facilities to replace LIBOR with Term SOFR as the\nbenchmark rate under the Credit Agreement, which is calculated to include a credit spread adjustment of 0.11448%, 0.26161%, 0.42826%, or 0.71513% for 1, 3,\n6, or 12 months period, respectively, in addition to the Term SOFR Screen Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and the margin (which was not amended).\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (1) an applicable margin plus a base rate\ndetermined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50% per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,\n(b) the prime rate of Bank of America and (c) the Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of\none month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus 1.00%; provided that such rate is not lower than a floor of 1.50% or (2) an applicable margin plus a Term\nSOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional\ncosts, provided that Term SOFR is not lower than a floor of 0.50%. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an\napplicable margin based upon a leverage-based pricing grid, plus, at our option, either (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50% per\nannum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate as determined by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, (b) the prime rate of Bank of America and (c) the Term\nSOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain additional costs, plus\n1.00%; provided that such rate is not lower than a floor of 1.00% or (2) a Term SOFR rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for U.S. dollar deposits\nfor the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, provided such rate is not lower than a floor of zero. As of September 28,\n2024, the applicable margins for the Term SOFR rate borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility were 3.50% and 2.75%,\nrespectively.\nOn a quarterly basis, we pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of unutilized commitments thereunder, which\ncommitment fee fluctuates depending upon our Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement).\nThe Credit Agreement contains other customary terms, including (1) representations, warranties and affirmative covenants, (2) negative covenants,\nincluding limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, investments, distributions, prepayments of subordinated debt, amendments of\nmaterial agreements governing subordinated indebtedness, changes to lines of business and transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to baskets, thresholds\nand other exceptions, and (3) customary events of default. As of September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement that\nwere in effect on such date.\nThe availability of certain baskets and the ability to enter into certain transactions are also subject to compliance with certain financial ratios. In addition,\nif the aggregate principal amount of extensions of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of any fiscal quarter end exceeds 35% of the amount\nof the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in effect on such date, we must be in compliance with a Consolidated First Lien Leverage\nRatio of 5.25:1.00 for the period ending after the first fiscal quarter of 2024 through and including the first fiscal quarter of 2025, with a step down to 5.00:1.00,\nfor the period following the first fiscal quarter of 2025. As of September 28, 2024, our actual Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio was 8.88:1.00 and there\nwere no borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and total letters of credit issued were $1.2 million. We were not in compliance with the Consolidated\nFirst Lien Leverage Ratio as of September 28, 2024, and as a result, we are limited to borrowing no more than 35%, or $61.3 million, of the amount of the\naggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility as of each fiscal quarter end until we comply with the applicable ratio.\nSenior Secured Notes\nThe Senior Secured Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of April 13, 2021 (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the\n“Indenture”), among the Company, the guarantors named therein and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee and notes collateral agent. The Indenture\ncontains customary terms, events of default and covenants for an issuer of non-investment grade debt securities. These covenants include limitations on\nindebtedness, liens, mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, investments, distributions, prepayments of subordinated debt and transactions with affiliates, in each case\nsubject to baskets, thresholds and other exceptions. As of September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the Indenture that were in effect\non such date.\n48\nThe Senior Secured Notes accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 4.500% and will mature on April 15, 2029. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is\npayable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. Commencing April 15, 2024, we may on any one or more occasions redeem some or all of the\nSenior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 102.250% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but\nnot including, the redemption date, such optional redemption price decreasing to 101.125% on or after April 15, 2025 and to 100.000% on or after April 15,\n2026. If a change of control occurs, we must offer to purchase for cash the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the\nSenior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the purchase date. Following the sale of certain assets and subject to certain\nconditions, we must offer to purchase for cash the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes,\nplus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the purchase date.\nThe Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by our subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Facilities. The Senior Secured Notes and\nthe note guarantees are secured by a first-priority lien on all the collateral that secures the Credit Facilities, subject to a shared lien of equal priority with our and\neach guarantor’s obligations under the Credit Facilities and subject to certain thresholds, exceptions and permitted liens.\nOutstanding Debt\nAt September 28, 2024, we had $1,445.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes, consisting of borrowings under the\nTerm Loan Facility of $945.0 million, $0.0 drawn down on the Revolving Credit Facility and $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured\nNotes issued and outstanding.\nAt September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, our debt consisted of both fixed and variable-rate instruments. We have historically entered into interest\nrate swaps to hedge a portion of the cash flow exposure associated with our variable-rate borrowings. At September 28, 2024, the Company did not have any\ninterest rate swaps in effect. Further information regarding our use of interest rate swaps can be found in Note 11 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging” in the\nnotes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The weighted average interest rate (which\nincludes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount) on our outstanding debt, exclusive of the impact of any applicable interest rate swaps, was\napproximately 7.77% and 7.64% per annum at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, based on interest rates on these dates. The weighted\naverage interest rate (which includes amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount) on our outstanding debt, including the impact of any applicable\ninterest rate swaps, was approximately 7.39% and 6.53% per annum at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, based on interest rates on these\ndates.\nThe following schedule sets forth our year-by-year debt obligations at September 28, 2024:\nTotal Debt Obligation\n(Including Current Portion)\nAt September 28, 2024\n(in millions)\nRemainder of fiscal 2024 $ —\nFiscal 2025 —\nFiscal 2026 —\nFiscal 2027 10.0\nFiscal 2028 935.0\nFiscal 2029 500.0\nThereafter —\nTotal $ 1,445.0\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nOur accumulated other comprehensive loss includes changes in the effects of foreign currency translations and the fair value of derivative instruments. At\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the cumulative balance of the effects of foreign currency translations, net of taxes, was a loss of $14.6 million and\na loss of $17.5 million, respectively. At September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the cumulative balance of changes in the fair value of derivative\ninstruments, net of taxes, was $0.0 million and a gain of $5.5 million, respectively.\n49\nDividends and Stock Transactions\nWe do not currently pay a dividend and we have no current plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare and pay\ndividends will be made at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, after taking into account our financial condition and results of operations, capital\nrequirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, the provisions of Virginia law affecting the payment of distributions to shareholders and such\nother factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants in our existing indebtedness,\nincluding the Credit Agreement governing the Credit Facilities and the Indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, and may be limited by the agreements\ngoverning other indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur in the future.\nOn October 9, 2003, our Board of Directors authorized, and we announced, a program to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our outstanding common\nstock. On each of June 13, 2005, May 25, 2006 and October 21, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized, and we announced, the addition of $250.0 million to\nthis program. The repurchase program allows for shares to be purchased from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The\nrepurchase program currently has no expiration date. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we did not repurchase any\nshares of our common stock under this program.\nEBITDAS, Adjusted EBITDAS and Net Debt\nWe define EBITDAS, a non-GAAP financial measure, as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation and\nAdjusted EBITDAS, a non-GAAP financial measure, as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, franchise rights\nacquired and goodwill impairments, net restructuring charges, acquisition transaction costs and former CEO separation expenses.\nThe table below sets forth the reconciliations for EBITDAS and Adjusted EBITDAS, each a non-GAAP financial measure, to net (loss) income, the most\ncomparable GAAP financial measure, for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and EBITDAS and Adjusted EBITDAS\nto net loss for the trailing twelve months ended September 28, 2024:\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 28, September 28, Trailing Twelve\n2024 September 30, 2023 2024 September 30, 2023 Months\nNet (loss) income $ (46.2) $ 43.7 $ (370.8) $ (24.1) $ (459.0)\nInterest 28.6 24.5 81.9 71.4 106.4\nTaxes (27.3) (38.4) 12.3 (18.9) 69.8\nDepreciation and amortization 9.2 13.4 29.1 35.6 39.1\nStock-based compensation 0.8 3.2 6.0 9.0 8.3\nEBITDAS $ (34.9) $ 46.4 $ (241.6) $ 73.0 $ (235.3)\nFranchise rights acquired and goodwill\nimpairments 57.0 — 315.0 — 318.7\n2024 plan restructuring charges 14.8 — 14.8 — 14.8\n2023 plan restructuring charges (0.7) 6.2 6.7 30.6 29.8\n2022 plan restructuring charges (0.3) (0.2) 0.1 0.6 0.5\n2021 plan restructuring charges — — — 0.1 —\n2020 plan restructuring charges — — — (0.0) —\nAcquisition transaction costs (1) — — — 8.6 —\nFormer CEO separation expenses 3.9 — 3.9 — 3.9\nAdjusted EBITDAS (2) $ 39.8 $ 52.4 $ 98.9 $ 112.9 $ 132.4\n50\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n(1) Includes stock-based compensation expense attributable to post-combination vesting of $3.9 million.\n(2) The “Adjusted EBITDAS” measure is a non-GAAP financial measure that (i) adjusts the consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 28, 2024 to exclude the\nimpact of the $57.0 million of franchise rights acquired impairments, the net impact of the $14.8 million of 2024 plan restructuring charges, the reversal of $0.7 million of 2023 plan\nrestructuring charges and the reversal of $0.3 million of 2022 plan restructuring charges, and the impact of the $3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses; (ii) adjusts the consolidated\nstatements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to exclude the net impact of the $6.2 million of 2023 plan restructuring charges and the reversal of $0.2 million of 2022\nplan restructuring charges; (iii) adjusts the consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 to exclude the impact of the $315.0 million of franchise rights\nacquired impairments, the net impact of the $14.8 million of 2024 plan restructuring charges, the $6.7 million of 2023 plan restructuring charges and the $0.1 million of 2022 plan restructuring\ncharges, and the impact of the $3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses; (iv) adjusts the consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to exclude\nthe net impact of the $30.6 million of 2023 plan restructuring charges, the $0.6 million of 2022 plan restructuring charges, the $0.1 million of 2021 plan restructuring charges and the reversal of\n$21 thousand of 2020 plan restructuring charges, and the impact of $8.6 million of acquisition transaction costs; and (v) adjusts EBITDAS for the trailing twelve months ended September 28,\n2024 to exclude the impact of the $318.7 million of franchise rights acquired and goodwill impairments, the net impact of the $14.8 million of 2024 plan restructuring charges, the $29.8\nmillion of 2023 plan restructuring charges and the $0.5 million of 2022 plan restructuring charges, and the impact of the $3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses. See “Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures” above for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nReducing leverage is a capital structure priority for the Company. As of September 28, 2024, our total debt less unamortized deferred financing costs and\nunamortized debt discount/net loss ratio was (3.1)x. As of September 28, 2024, our net debt/Adjusted EBITDAS ratio was 10.4x.\nThe table below sets forth the reconciliation for net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, to total debt, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, for\nthe nine months ended:\n(in millions)\nSeptember 28, 2024\nTotal debt $ 1,445.0\nLess: Unamortized deferred financing costs 7.4\nLess: Unamortized debt discount 8.0\nLess: Cash on hand 57.2\nNet debt $ 1,372.4\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\nWe present EBITDAS, Adjusted EBITDAS and net debt/Adjusted EBITDAS because we consider them to be useful supplemental measures of our\nperformance. In addition, we believe EBITDAS, Adjusted EBITDAS and net debt/Adjusted EBITDAS are useful to investors, analysts and rating agencies in\nmeasuring the ability of a company to meet its debt service obligations. See “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” herein for an explanation of our use of these\nnon-GAAP financial measures.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in arrangements that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships\nestablished for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes, such as entities often referred to as\nstructured finance or special purpose entities.\nSEASONALITY\nOur business is seasonal due to the importance of the winter season to our overall member recruitment environment. Historically, we experience our\nhighest level of recruitment during the first quarter of the year, which is supported with the highest concentration of advertising spending. Therefore, our number\nof End of Period Subscribers in the first quarter of the year has been typically higher than the number in other quarters of the year, historically reflecting a\ndecline over the course of the year.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nCorporate information and our press releases, Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments thereto, are available free of charge on our corporate website at corporate.ww.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is\nelectronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. We also make available at that site the Section 16 reports filed electronically by our officers, directors and 10\npercent shareholders.\n51\nWe use our corporate website at corporate.ww.com and certain social media channels such as our Instagram account (Instagram.com/weightwatchers),\ncorporate Facebook page (www.facebook.com/weightwatchers), X (formerly Twitter) account (@ww_us) and LinkedIn page\n(www.linkedin.com/company/weightwatchers) as channels of distribution of Company information. The information we post through these channels may be\ndeemed material.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nPursuant to their respective terms, our interest rate swaps in effect as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 terminated on March 31, 2024. Given\nsubsequent market conditions, management determined to not enter into any new swap arrangements following such termination. Except for the impact from the\ntermination of such swap arrangements discussed below, as of September 28, 2024, the market risk disclosures appearing in “Item 7A. Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 have not materially changed from December 30, 2023.\nAt the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, borrowings under the Credit Facilities bore interest at Term SOFR plus an applicable margin of 3.50%. For\nthe Term Loan Facility, the minimum interest rate for Term SOFR applicable to such facility pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement was set at 0.50%,\nreferred to herein as the Term SOFR Floor. Accordingly, as of September 28, 2024, based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding and the then-current\nTerm SOFR rate, after giving consideration to the Term SOFR Floor, a hypothetical 125 basis point increase in interest rates would have increased annual\ninterest expense by approximately $11.8 million and a hypothetical 125 basis point decrease in interest rates would have decreased annual interest expense by\napproximately $11.8 million. This change in market risk exposure from the end of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to the termination of our interest rate swaps on\nMarch 31, 2024 discussed above.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange\nAct is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated\nand communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions\nregarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the\ndesired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, has evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024, the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Based\nupon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the third\nquarter of fiscal 2024, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n52\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 10 “Legal” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere have been no material changes in the risk factors from those detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 other than as set forth\nbelow.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur new compounded GLP-1 offering exposes us to a variety of risks that could result in an adverse impact on our reputation, business and ability to\neffectively compete.\nIn October 2024, we began offering to our eligible Clinical members access to compounded semaglutide, a GLP-1 prescription medication, sourced via a\n503B outsourcing facility (the “Manufacturing Supplier”) and dispensed by a licensed 503A pharmacy (“Dispensing Pharmacy”). A 503B outsourcing facility\nmust meet certain conditions under Section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), including registration with the U.S. Food and\nDrug Administration (the “FDA”). The facility must also operate in compliance with the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations and\nguidance and is subject to FDA inspection relating to compliance with cGMPs. If the Manufacturing Supplier or any of its compounded products are found by\nthe FDA not to satisfy the criteria set forth in Section 503B, it may not be able to fulfill the prescriptions prescribed by our clinicians, which could have an\nadverse effect on our business. Compounding pharmacies and 503B outsourcing facilities have been subject to increased scrutiny of their compounding activities\nby the FDA and state governmental agencies, and a governmental inquiry or action or litigation could be brought against us, the Dispensing Pharmacy or the\nManufacturing Supplier relating to GLP-1 compounding activities. In such a case, we may experience negative publicity and reputational harm. Manufacturers\nof the branded GLP-1 medications also have brought private actions against compounders and outsourcing facilities, as well as prescribers of compounded\nmedications, including against med-spas, medical practices and telehealth providers, and such action or litigation could be brought against us. The\nManufacturing Supplier is legally permitted to produce the sourced version of compounded semaglutide while the equivalent branded GLP-1 active ingredient\nappears on the FDA drug shortage list, and we cannot predict when such shortage will be resolved. All doses of semaglutide branded under Ozempic and\nWegovy became listed as available on the FDA’s shortage list as of October 30, 2024. As of November 4, 2024, the FDA considers semaglutide injection to\ncontinue to be in shortage, but it may determine to resolve the shortage in the future, which could constrain our ability to continue providing access to\ncompounded semaglutide on our platform once inventory is no longer available. Additionally, on October 22, 2024, Novo Nordisk filed a Petition with the FDA,\nrequesting that semaglutide products be added to the lists of drug products that present demonstrable difficulties for compounding pursuant to the FDCA\nSections 503A(b)(3) and 503B(a)(6) (the “Demonstrable Difficulties for Compounding Lists” or “DDC Lists”). If added to the DDC Lists, 503A pharmacies and\n503B facilities would be prohibited from producing compounded semaglutide, even if it is taken off the shortage list. The regulatory landscape applicable to\nGLP-1s continues to rapidly evolve. Additionally, many branded GLP-1 medications are protected under intellectual property laws that limit the formulations\nthat other parties may use, and our promotion of compounded formulations may result in our being subject to infringement claims and other litigation, which\ncould adversely affect our ability to effectively compete. While the FDA does not limit compounding to drug shortages, we cannot guarantee that we will be able\nto continue this offering in the same manner, to the same extent, or at all, due to a variety of factors outside our control, including intellectual property,\nregulatory and resource allocation matters, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAchieving and maintaining market acceptance of this new offering could be negatively impacted by perceived risks associated with compounded\nmedications. Certain compounding pharmacies and 503B outsourcing facilities have experienced both facility and product quality issues and been the subject of\nnegative media coverage. We or the Manufacturing Supplier or Dispensing Pharmacy may also face allegations, litigation, and regulatory investigations under\nfederal or state laws related to the marketing, fulfillment, distribution, and/or sale of these products. Litigation and regulatory proceedings, and particularly the\nhealthcare, pharmaceutical-related, consumer protection, data privacy and/or class action matters we could face, may be protracted and expensive, and the results\nare difficult to predict. Such litigation or regulatory proceedings and investigations, FDA shortage list implications, unexpected side effects or safety or efficacy\nconcerns with our compounded semaglutide offering (or GLP-1s as a class) or related negative publicity could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business\nand ability to effectively compete.\n53\nWe are undergoing a chief executive officer transition, which could cause disruption to our business, and our failure to appoint a permanent chief\nexecutive officer with the required level of experience and expertise could have an adverse impact on our operations and business strategy as well as the\npublic or market perception of our business.\nIn September 2024, the Company and Sima Sistani, the Company’s then-President and Chief Executive Officer, mutually agreed that Ms. Sistani would\ncease serving as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, effective September 27, 2024. The Board of Directors appointed Tara Comonte, a\ndirector of the Company, as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, effective September 27, 2024, to serve until a permanent President and Chief\nExecutive Officer is identified. If we are unsuccessful in appointing a permanent chief executive officer with the required level of experience and expertise, our\noperations and business strategy could be materially and adversely affected. Any significant leadership change or executive management transition involves\ninherent risk and can be difficult to manage. It may involve a diversion of resources and management attention, be disruptive to our daily operations, make it\nmore difficult to hire and retain key employees, impact public or market perception or hinder progress on key strategic initiatives, any of which could have a\nnegative impact on our business or stock price.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nNothing to report under this item.\nITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNothing to report under this item.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION\nFrom time to time, our directors and officers may engage in open-market transactions with respect to their Company equity holdings for diversification or\nother personal reasons. All such transactions by directors and officers must comply with the Company’s Amended and Restated Securities Trading Policy, which\nrequires that such transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic\ninformation. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in the Company’s\nsecurities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material nonpublic information.\nNo contracts, instructions or written plans for the purchase or sale of Company securities were adopted or terminated by our directors or officers (as\ndefined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 28, 2024, that were intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions\nof Rule 10b5-1(c). No “non-Rule 10b5–1 trading arrangements” (as defined by Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K) or other Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements were\nentered into or terminated, nor were any such arrangements modified, by our directors or officers during such period.\n54\nITEM 6.

For the avoidance of any doubt, the Termination Date shall not be subject to any deferment for whatever reason.\nUntil the Termination Date, the Company shall pay to the Employee his salary and other contractual benefits in accordance with the\nEmployment Agreement and Company's regulations.\nRelease from Obligation to Work and Commencement of New Employment\nThe Employee shall be released irrevocably from his obligation to work effective on the close of business on August 9, 2024 (the\nRelease Date).

In this case, the term \"Termination Date\" as used in this Agreement means \"New Termination Date\". For the avoidance of doubt,\nany compensation due under this Agreement until the Termination Date, will be paid only until the New Termination Date. The Company\nis entitled to reclaim any overpayment made to the Employee. The Employee is obliged to inform the Company in writing and without\ndelay about the start of any such new employment.\nIf the Employee starts any other professional activity before the Termination Date or New Termination Date, he shall account for any\nincome, which shall be deducted from the Company's salary payments. The Employee is obliged to inform the Company in writing and\nwithout delay about the start of any such other professional activity and about any income on a monthly basis.

(NASDAQ: WW) (“WeightWatchers,” “WW,” or the “Company”) today announced its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\n“For over six decades, WeightWatchers has been the trusted leader in weight management, offering a full spectrum of science-backed, proven weight management solutions. With our expanded clinical offering, iconic trusted brand, and global community of members, we are well-equipped to succeed in today’s rapidly evolving market,” said Tara Comonte, Interim CEO. “We do, however, have significant work to do to better unify our solutions and enhance our member experience. I am fully committed to leading our team through this next phase, as we seek to drive meaningful progress in these strategic priorities and return the Company to sustainable growth.”\n\n“The execution of our cost reduction initiatives continues to yield results, including another quarter of record adjusted gross margin,” said Heather Stark, the Company’s CFO. “We remain on track to deliver on our 2024 adjusted operating income guidance and deliver on our overall cost savings targets. Our current actions are driving improved profitability and liquidity as we work to turn around the business.”\n\n**Q3 2024 Consolidated Results**\n\n**% Change**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Adjusted for**  \n**September 28,**| **September 30,**| **Constant**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **Currency****(****1)**  \n(in millions except percentages and per share amounts)  \nSubscription Revenues, net| $191.2| $203.5| (6.0| %)| (6.4| %)  \nOther Revenues, net(2)| 1.6| 11.4| (85.6| %)| (85.7| %)  \n**Revenues, net**|  $192.9| $214.9| (10.2| %)| (10.6| %)  \n**Gross Profit**|  $129.5| $141.8| (8.6| %)| (9.1| %)  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments(1)  \nNet Restructuring Charges(3)| 3.8| 0.4  \n**Adjusted Gross Profit****(****1)**|  $133.3| $142.2| (6.2| %)| (6.6| %)  \n**Operating (Loss) Income**| ($39.0| )| $30.6| 100.0| %*| 100.0| %*  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments(1)  \nFranchise Rights Acquired Impairments| 57.0| -  \nNet Restructuring Charges(3)| 13.8| 6.0  \nFormer CEO Separation Expenses| 3.9| -  \n**Adjusted Operating Income****(****1)**|  $35.7| $36.6| (2.5| %)| (4.2| %)  \n**Net (Loss) Income**| ($46.2| )| $43.7| 100.0| %*| 100.0| %*  \n **EPS**| ($0.58| )| $0.54| 100.0| %*| 100.0| %*  \nNon-GAAP Adjustments(1)  \nFranchise Rights Acquired Impairments| 0.65| -  \nNet Restructuring Charges(3)| 0.13| 0.06  \nFormer CEO Separation Expenses| 0.04| -  \n**Adjusted EPS****(****1)**|  $0.24| $0.60| (60.6| %)| (61.7| %)  \n**Total Paid Weeks**|  48.6| 52.5| (7.4| %)| N/A  \nDigital(4) Paid Weeks| 40.4| 42.8| (5.6| %)| N/A  \nWorkshops + Digital(5) Paid Weeks| 7.2| 9.1| (21.2| %)| N/A  \nClinical(6) Paid Weeks| 1.0| 0.5| 91.3| %| N/A  \n**End of Period Subscribers**(7)| 3.7| 4.0| (8.8| %)| N/A  \nDigital Subscribers| 3.0| 3.3| (7.3| %)| N/A  \nWorkshops + Digital Subscribers| 0.5| 0.7| (21.2| %)| N/A  \nClinical Subscribers| 0.1| 0.0| 71.5| %| N/A  \n___________________________________Note: Totals may not sum due to rounding. *Note: Percentage in excess of 100.0% and not meaningful (1) See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” attached to this release for further detail on adjustments to GAAP financial measures.(2) “Other Revenues, net” (formerly known as “Product Sales and Other, net”) consist of revenues from licensing and publishing, franchise fees with respect to commitment plans and royalties, and other revenues. Prior to fiscal 2024, “Other Revenues, net” included sales of consumer products.(3) See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” attached to this release for further detail on the Company’s previously disclosed 2024, 2023, and 2022 restructuring plans, and the reversal of certain of the charges associated therewith.

Q3 2024 End of Period Clinical Subscribers of 78 thousand increased 71.5% versus the prior year period.\n  * **Total Paid Weeks** in Q3 2024 were down 7.4% versus the prior year period driven by declines in the Digital and Workshops + Digital businesses. Total Paid Weeks benefited from growth in Clinical Paid Weeks. \n  * **Revenues** in Q3 2024 were $192.9 million. On a constant currency basis, Q3 2024 revenues decreased 10.6% versus the prior year period. \n    * **S****ubscription****Revenues** in Q3 2024 were $191.2 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues decreased 6.4% versus the prior year period primarily driven by lower recruitments and non-Clinical Incoming Subscribers. Additionally, Subscription Revenues were negatively impacted by the continued mix shift from the Workshops + Digital business to the Digital business and a higher mix of Digital Subscribers within their initial, lower-priced commitment periods. Subscription Revenues benefited from $19.1 million of Clinical Subscription Revenues, which increased 90.7% versus the prior year period. \n    * **Other Revenues** in Q3 2024 were $1.6 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues decreased 85.7% versus the prior year period driven by the discontinuation of the consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023. \n  * **Gross Profit** in Q3 2024 was $129.5 million, compared to $141.8 million in the prior year period. **Adjusted gross profit** , which excluded the net impact of $3.8 million of restructuring charges, was $133.3 million. Adjusted gross profit in Q3 2023, which excluded the net impact of $0.4 million of restructuring charges, was $142.2 million. \n    * **Gross Margin** in Q3 2024 was 67.1%, as compared to 66.0% in the prior year period. **Adjusted gross margin** in Q3 2024 was 69.1%, up from an adjusted gross margin of 66.2% in the prior year period, driven primarily by actions to reduce the fixed cost base within our business and the discontinuation of our lower margin consumer products business at the end of fiscal 2023.\n  * **Non-Cash Intangible Impairment Charges:** During Q3 2024, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of franchise rights acquired totaling $57.0 million. These impairments were primarily driven by an increase in the Company’s weighted average cost of capital reflecting market factors.\n  * **Operating****Loss** in Q3 2024 was $39.0 million, compared to operating income of $30.6 million in the prior year period. **Adjusted operating income** , which excluded $57.0 million of non-cash intangible impairment charges, the net impact of $13.8 million of restructuring charges, and $3.9 million of former CEO separation expenses, was $35.7 million. Adjusted operating income in Q3 2023, which excluded the net impact of $6.0 million of restructuring charges, was $36.6 million.\n  * **Income Tax Benefit** in Q3 2024 was $27.3 million, which reflected the impact of an unusually high negative annual effective tax rate driven by a valuation allowance and small pretax loss reflected in the Company’s full year fiscal 2024 guidance. In the prior year period, income tax benefit was $38.4 million.\n  * **Net Loss** in Q3 2024 was $46.2 million compared to net income of $43.7 million in the prior year period. \n  * **Diluted Net Loss per share** in Q3 2024 was $0.58 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.54 in the prior year period. Q3 2024**adjusted earnings per share** , which excluded $0.65 of non-cash intangible impairment charges, $0.13 of net impact of restructuring charges, and $0.04 of former CEO separation expenses, was $0.24. In the prior year period, adjusted earnings per share, which excluded $0.06 of net impact of restructuring charges, was $0.60. \n    * Additionally, certain other items affected year-over-year comparability: \n      * In Q3 2024, $0.33 per diluted share positive tax impact arising from an unusually high negative annual effective tax rate as a result of a valuation allowance and small pretax loss reflected in the Company’s full year fiscal 2024 guidance.\n      * In Q3 2023, $0.54 per diluted share positive tax impact arising from an unusually high negative annual effective tax rate as a result of a valuation allowance and small pretax loss reflected in the Company’s full year fiscal 2023 guidance.\n\n\n\n**Other Items**\n\n  * **Cash** balance as of September 28, 2024 was $57.2 million. On that same date, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\n\n\n\n**Full Year Fiscal 2024 Guidance**\n\nThe Company is reiterating its following full year fiscal 2024 guidance:\n\n  * Year end total subscribers of at least 3.1 million;\n  * Revenue of at least $770.0 million; and\n  * Excluding non-cash intangible impairment charges and the net impact of restructuring charges (both of which include Q3 2024 charges), and the Q3 2024 former CEO separation expenses, \n    * Adjusted operating income of at least $100.0 million; and\n    * Adjusted EBITDAS of at least $150.0 million.\n\n\n\nReflecting the Q3 2024 charges and expenses referred to above, the Company is updating its full year fiscal 2024 operating loss guidance to not exceed $240.4 million.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call and Webcast** The Company has scheduled a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET. During the conference call, Tara Comonte, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, Heather Stark, Chief Financial Officer, and Donna Boyer, Chief Product Officer, will discuss the third quarter of fiscal 2024 results and answer questions from the investment community.\n\nThe live webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company’s corporate website, [corporate.ww.com](http://corporate.ww.com), under Events and Presentations. Supplemental investor materials will also be available in the same location prior to the start of the webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available on this site for approximately 90 days.\n\n**Statement regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures** The following provides information regarding non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release and today’s scheduled conference call:\n\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the Company has disclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. Gross profit, gross margin, operating (loss) income, operating (loss) income margin, diluted (net loss) earnings per share, and selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and as adjusted (on a non-GAAP basis), as applicable, with respect to (i) the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to exclude (x) the impact of impairment charges for the Company’s franchise rights acquired related to its United States and United Kingdom units of account, (y) the net impact of (a) charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2024 restructuring plan (the “2024 plan”), (b) charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2023 restructuring plan (the “2023 plan”) or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2023 plan, as applicable and (c) the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2022 restructuring plan (the “2022 plan”), and (z) the impact of certain non-recurring expenses in connection with the separation from the Company of its former Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”); (ii) the first nine months of fiscal 2024 to exclude (x) the impact of impairment charges for the Company's franchise rights acquired related to its United States, Australia, United Kingdom and New Zealand units of account, (y) the net impact of charges associated with the 2024 plan, the 2023 plan and the 2022 plan, and (z) the impact of certain non-recurring expenses in connection with the separation of the Company's former CEO; (iii) the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to exclude the net impact of charges associated with the 2023 plan and the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2022 plan; and (iv) the first nine months of fiscal 2023 to exclude (x) the net impact of (a) charges associated with the 2023 plan, (b) charges associated with the 2022 plan or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2022 plan, as applicable, (c) charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2021 organizational restructuring plan (the “2021 plan”) or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2021 plan, as applicable, and (d) the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2020 organizational restructuring plan (the “2020 plan”), and (y) the impact of certain non-recurring transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of Sequence. The Company generally refers to such non-GAAP measures as excluding or adjusting for the impact of franchise rights acquired impairments, the net impact of restructuring charges, the impact of acquisition transaction costs, and the impact of former CEO separation expenses, as applicable. The Company also presents in the attachments to this release the non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (“EBITDAS”); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, franchise rights acquired and goodwill impairments, net restructuring charges, acquisition transaction costs and former CEO separation expenses (“Adjusted EBITDAS”); total debt less unamortized deferred financing costs, unamortized debt discount and cash on hand (i.e., net debt); and a net debt/Adjusted EBITDAS ratio. In addition, the Company presents certain of its financial results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company calculates constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. A reconciliation of the forward-looking full year EBITDAS outlook to net income cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company's control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a material impact on its future GAAP financial results.\n\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information for its and investors' evaluation of the Company's business performance and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of the Company's business. While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" attached to this release and reconciliations, if any, included elsewhere in this release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**About WW International, Inc.** WeightWatchers is a human-centric technology company powered by our proven, science-based, clinically effective weight loss and weight management programs.

Supplemental investor materials will also be available in the same location prior to the start of the webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available on this site for approximately 90 days.\n\n**Statement regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures** The following provides information regarding non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release and today’s scheduled conference call:\n\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the Company has disclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. Gross profit, gross margin, operating income (loss), operating income (loss) margin and selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and as adjusted (on a non-GAAP basis), as applicable, with respect to (i) the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to exclude the impact or net impact, as applicable, of charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2023 restructuring plan (the “2023 plan”) and the Company's previously disclosed 2022 restructuring plan (the “2022 plan”); (ii) the first six months of fiscal 2024 to exclude (x) the impact of impairment charges for the Company's franchise rights acquired related to its United States, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom units of account and (y) the net impact of charges associated with the 2023 plan and the 2022 plan; and (iii) the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2023 to exclude (x) the net impact of (a) charges associated with the 2023 plan, (b) charges associated with the 2022 plan or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2022 plan, as applicable, (c) charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2021 organizational restructuring plan (the “2021 plan”) or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2021 plan, as applicable, and (d) the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the Company's previously disclosed 2020 organizational restructuring plan (the “2020 plan”) and (y) the impact of certain non-recurring transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of Sequence. The Company generally refers to such non-GAAP measures as excluding or adjusting for the impact of franchise rights acquired impairments, the impact or net impact, as applicable, of restructuring charges, and the impact of acquisition transaction costs, as applicable. The Company also presents in the attachments to this release the non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (“EBITDAS”); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, franchise rights acquired and goodwill impairments, net restructuring charges, and certain non-recurring transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of Sequence (“Adjusted EBITDAS”); total debt less unamortized deferred financing costs, unamortized debt discount and cash on hand (i.e., net debt); and a net debt/Adjusted EBITDAS ratio. In addition, the Company presents certain of its financial results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company calculates constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. A reconciliation of the forward-looking full year EBITDAS outlook to net income cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company's control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a material impact on its future GAAP financial results.\n\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information for its and investors' evaluation of the Company's business performance and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of the Company's business. While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" attached to this release and reconciliations, if any, included elsewhere in this release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**About WW International, Inc.** WeightWatchers is a human-centric technology company powered by our proven, science-based, clinically effective weight loss and weight management programs.

Q1 2024 End of Period Clinical Subscribers were 87 thousand.\n  * **Total Paid Weeks** in Q1 2024 were up 1.6% versus the prior year period, driven by the Digital business and the inclusion of 1.0 million Clinical Paid Weeks. Q1 2024 Digital Paid Weeks increased 3.7% versus the prior year period. Q1 2024 Workshops + Digital Paid Weeks decreased 17.0% versus the prior year period.\n  * **Revenues** in Q1 2024 were $206.5 million. On a constant currency basis, Q1 2024 revenues decreased 14.9% versus the prior year period. \n    * **S****ubscription****Revenues** in Q1 2024 were $204.1 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues decreased 3.7% versus the prior year period. Subscription Revenues included $18.8 million of Clinical Subscription Revenues. \n    * **Other Revenues** in Q1 2024 were $2.5 million. On a constant currency basis, these revenues decreased 92.0% versus the prior year period driven by the wind down of the consumer products business. \n  * **Gross Profit** in Q1 2024 was $137.8 million, compared to $119.5 million in the prior year period. **Adjusted gross profit** in Q1 2024, which excluded the net impact of $2.5 million of restructuring charges related to prior year restructuring plans, was $140.3 million. Adjusted gross profit in Q1 2023, which excluded the net impact of $18.6 million of restructuring charges, was $138.1 million. \n    * **Gross Margin** in Q1 2024 was 66.7%, as compared to 49.4% in the prior year period. **Adjusted gross margin** in Q1 2024 was 67.9%, up from an adjusted gross margin of 57.1% in the prior year period, primarily driven by actions to reduce the fixed cost base and mix shift within the business.\n  * **Non-Cash Intangible Impairment Charges:** During Q1 2024, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of franchise rights acquired totaling $258.0 million. These impairments were primarily driven by an increase in the Company’s weighted average cost of capital reflecting market factors.\n  * **Operating Loss** in Q1 2024 was $269.3 million, compared to operating loss of $28.6 million in the prior year period. **Adjusted operating loss** in Q1 2024, which excluded $258.0 million of non-cash intangible impairment charges and the net impact of $5.7 million of restructuring charges related to prior year restructuring plans, was $5.6 million. Adjusted operating loss in Q1 2023, which excluded the net impact of $22.7 million of restructuring charges and the impact of $3.7 million of acquisition transaction costs, was $2.2 million.\n  * **Income Tax Expense** in Q1 2024 was $55.4 million, which reflected the impact of an unusually high negative annual effective tax rate driven by a valuation allowance and small pretax loss reflected in the Company’s full year fiscal 2024 guidance. In the prior year period, income tax expense was $67.6 million.\n  * **Net Loss** in Q1 2024 was $347.9 million compared to net loss of $118.7 million in the prior year period. \n  * **Diluted Net Loss per share** in Q1 2024 was $4.39 compared to diluted net loss per share of $1.68 in the prior year period. \n    * Certain items affect year-over-year comparability. \n      * Q1 2024 diluted net loss per share incorporated the net negative impact of $4.33 per diluted share in the aggregate due to the following items: \n        * $3.05 per diluted share negative impact of non-cash intangible impairment charges for franchise rights acquired.\n        * $1.22 per diluted share negative tax impact arising from an unusually high negative annual effective tax rate as a result of a valuation allowance and small pretax loss reflected in the Company’s full year fiscal 2024 guidance.\n        * $0.05 per diluted share net negative impact of restructuring charges related to prior year restructuring plans.\n      * Q1 2023 diluted net loss per share incorporated the negative impact of $1.59 per diluted share in the aggregate due to the following items: \n        * $0.24 per diluted share net negative impact of restructuring charges.\n        * $1.30 per diluted share negative tax impact arising from an unusually high negative annual effective tax rate as a result of a valuation allowance and small pretax loss reflected in the Company’s full year fiscal 2023 guidance.\n        * $0.05 per diluted share negative impact from acquisition transaction costs.\n\n\n\n**Other Items**\n\n  * **Cash** balance as of March 30, 2024 was $66.6 million. On that same date, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\n  * **Interest Rate Hedges:** The Company’s interest rate swaps in effect as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 terminated on March 31, 2024. As of May 2, 2024, the Company had no active swaps in place.\n  * **2023 Restructuring Plan:** In connection with the previously announced 2023 restructuring plan, the Company recorded aggregate restructuring charges of $5.5 million in Q1 2024.\n  * **Reportable Segment Update:** As previously disclosed, as a result of the continued evolution of the Company’s centralized organizational structure in fiscal 2023, and management’s 2024 strategic planning process, the Company’s reportable segments changed commencing with the first day of fiscal 2024 to one segment.\n\n\n\n**Full Year Fiscal 2024 Guidance** The Company is providing the following update to full year fiscal 2024 guidance:\n\n  * Maintaining previously provided revenue guidance range of $830.0 million to $860.0 million, reflecting a $55 million year-over-year headwind from the strategic decision to wind down the Company’s low-margin consumer products business.\n  * Operating loss is expected to be in the range of $163.7 million to $153.7 million; excluding the non-cash intangible impairment charges and net impact of restructuring charges recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, adjusted operating income is expected to be in the range of $100.0 million to $110.0 million, which is consistent with previously provided operating income guidance that did not include the above impairment and restructuring charges.\n\n\n\n**First Quarter 2024 Conference Call and Webcast** The Company has scheduled a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. ET. During the conference call, Sima Sistani, Chief Executive Officer, and Heather Stark, Chief Financial Officer, will discuss the first quarter of fiscal 2024 results and answer questions from the investment community.\n\nThe live webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company’s corporate website, [corporate.ww.com](http://corporate.ww.com), under Events and Presentations. Supplemental investor materials will also be available in the same location prior to the start of the webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available on this site for approximately 90 days.\n\n**Statement regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures** The following provides information regarding non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release and today’s scheduled conference call:\n\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the Company has disclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. Gross profit, gross margin, operating loss, operating loss margin and selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and as adjusted (on a non-GAAP basis), as applicable, with respect to (i) the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to exclude (x) the impact of impairment charges for the Company's franchise rights acquired related to its United States, Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom units of account and (y) the net impact of charges associated with the Company’s previously disclosed 2023 restructuring plan (the “2023 plan”) and the Company’s previously disclosed 2022 restructuring plan (the “2022 plan”); and (ii) the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to exclude (x) the net impact of (a) charges associated with the 2023 plan, (b) charges associated with the 2022 plan or the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the 2022 plan, as applicable, (c) the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the Company’s previously disclosed 2021 organizational restructuring plan (the “2021 plan”), and (d) the reversal of certain of the charges associated with the Company’s previously disclosed 2020 organizational restructuring plan (the “2020 plan”); and (y) the impact of certain non-recurring transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of Sequence. The Company generally refers to such non-GAAP measures as excluding or adjusting for the impact of franchise rights acquired impairments, the net impact of restructuring charges, and the impact of acquisition transaction costs, as applicable. The Company also presents in the attachments to this release the non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (“EBITDAS”); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, franchise rights acquired and goodwill impairments, net restructuring charges, and certain non-recurring transaction costs in connection with the acquisition of Sequence (“Adjusted EBITDAS”); total debt less unamortized deferred financing costs, unamortized debt discount and cash on hand (i.e., net debt); and a net debt/Adjusted EBITDAS ratio. In addition, the Company presents certain of its financial results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. The Company calculates constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. A reconciliation of the forward-looking full year EBITDAS outlook to net income cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because of the inherent difficulty of accurately forecasting the occurrence and financial impact of the various adjusting items necessary for such reconciliation that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company's control, or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a material impact on its future GAAP financial results.\n\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information for its and investors' evaluation of the Company's business performance and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of the Company's business. While management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company's business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" attached to this release and reconciliations, if any, included elsewhere in this release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**About WW International, Inc.** WeightWatchers is a human-centric technology company powered by our proven, science-based, clinically effective weight loss and weight management programs.
