KIMMTRAK continues to be the standard of care in most markets where it is launched. The Company sees three key growth areas for KIMMTRAK: continued expansion in mUM, the potential expansion into 2L+ advanced cutaneous melanoma and adjuvant uveal melanoma._\n\n**_Metastatic uveal melanoma_**\n\n  * KIMMTRAK net product sales were $80.2 million and $225.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, representing increases of 28% and 32% respectively, compared to the prior year periods.\n  * Growth in the US and Germany was driven by increased demand based on continued community penetration and growing duration of treatment.\n  * New baseline blood gene expression signature data was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2024 Meeting (ESMO 2024) confirming that T cell fitness in blood is an important parameter of clinical activity for KIMMTRAK in previously treated uveal melanoma. \n\n\n\n**_2L+ previously treated cutaneous melanoma_**\n\n  * Randomization continues in the registrational Phase 3 trial (TEBE-AM), which includes three arms – KIMMTRAK monotherapy, KIMMTRAK in combination with pembrolizumab, and control. The Company expects to complete randomization in the first half of 2026.\n  * The TEBE-AM Phase 3 trial in 2L+ cutaneous melanoma has a primary endpoint of overall survival.\n\n\n\n**_Adjuvant uveal (or ocular) melanoma_**\n\n  * Randomization in the ATOM Phase 3 trial, led by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), is on track to start in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * ATOM is currently the only active registrational Phase 3 trial in adjuvant uveal melanoma. \n\n\n\n**PRAME** _Brenetafusp (IMC-F106C) is the Company’s lead PRAME-A02 ImmTAC bispecific candidate. Brenetafusp is being evaluated in combination with nivolumab, in a Phase 3 registrational trial (PRISM-MEL-301) in patients with first-line advanced cutaneous melanoma and in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, as monotherapy and in combination, across multiple tumor types, including ovarian, non-small cell lung (NSCLC), and endometrial carcinoma._\n\n**_PRISM-MEL-301 – First PRAME Phase 3 clinical trial with brenetafusp in first-line advanced or metastatic HLA-A*02:01 positive cutaneous melanoma_**\n\n  * Ongoing randomization of patients in PRISM-MEL-301 in multiple countries.\n  * Trial is evaluating brenetafusp + nivolumab versus a control arm of either nivolumab or nivolumab + relatlimab.\n\n\n\n**_Phase 1/2 clinical trial of brenetafusp (PRAME-A02) in multiple solid tumors_**\n\n  * Clinical data presented at ESMO 2024 from the Phase 1 trial in patients with heavily pre-treated platinum-resistant high grade serous ovarian cancer showed signals of activity in heavily pretreated, platinum resistant patients. Disease control rate was 58% in monotherapy patients and 69% for combination patients. Overall survival (OS) was still maturing (73% 6-months OS rate in the monotherapy cohort). ctDNA molecular response rate was 31% and 82%, respectively, in the monotherapy and combination cohorts, associated with longer progression free survival and OS. Brenetafusp is well tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel and pegylated doxorubicin.\n  * Data presented at ESMO 2024 showed peripheral blood T cell fitness signature is an important parameter of brenetafusp clinical activity in ovarian cancer and uveal melanoma.\n  * The Company is currently evaluating brenetafusp in combination with non-platinum chemotherapies in platinum resistant ovarian cancer and with bevacizumab and with platinum chemotherapy in earlier lines of platinum sensitive ovarian cancer.\n  * The Company continues signal detection for brenetafusp in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer cohorts, including in combination with docetaxel and with osimertinib in earlier-line NSCLC. As a result, the Company will not release initial data in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n**_IMC-P115C (PRAME-A02 Half-Life Extended) & IMC-T119C (PRAME-A24)_**\n\n  * On track for first patient to be treated in the Phase 1 trial with IMC-P115C in first half of 2025. \n\n\n\n**Additional Oncology Candidates**\n\n**_IMC-R117C (first PIWIL1-A02 targeted immunotherapy) for colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers_** _The Company has leveraged its proprietary peptidomic database to validate a novel target, PIWIL1. PIWIL1 is a negative prognostic marker and is expressed across a range of tumors including colorectal, which is historically insensitive to immune checkpoints, as well as gastro-esophageal, and pancreatic cancer._\n\n  * Remain on track to treat the first patient in the Phase 1/2 trial of IMC-R117C in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * The Phase 1/2 trial will assess the safety and clinical activity of IMC-R117C, as a monotherapy and in combination with standards of care, in colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers. \n\n\n\n**ImmTAV candidates for a functional cure in infectious diseases** _The Company’s bispecific TCR technology platform has potential to offer a new approach for the treatment of chronic infections and aims to eliminate evidence of remaining virus in circulation after the patient stops taking medication - known as a \"functional cure\". Two investigational candidates are in Phase 1 clinical trials for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and people with chronic Hepatitis B infection (HBV)._\n\n**_Phase 1 trial of IMC-M113V (Gag-A02) for people living with HIV_**\n\n  * The objective of the clinical trial is to identify a safe and tolerable dose and evaluate whether IMC-M113V could lead to reduction in the viral reservoir and, after stopping antiretroviral therapies and IMC-M113V, delay or prevent HIV rebound.\n  * A biologically active dose in the multiple ascending dose (MAD) portion of the trial has been reached and the Company is enrolling more people living with HIV to characterize anti-viral activity and to explore higher doses with data expected in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**_Phase 1 trial of IMC-I109V (Envelope-A02) for people living with HBV_**\n\n  * Expect to complete the single ascending dose (SAD) portion of the trial in the fourth quarter of 2024. \n\n\n\n**Tissue-specific down modulation of the immune system for autoimmune diseases** _The Company is expanding its platform into autoimmune diseases with two new, first-in-class bispecific candidates recently entering its pipeline. The key differentiator of the Company’s ImmTAAI (Immune Modulating Monoclonal TCRs Against AutoImmune disease) platform is tissue-specific down modulation of the immune system whereby, when tethered to the tissue of interest, the new candidates suppress pathogenic T cells via PD1 receptor agonism._\n\n**_IMC-S118AI (pre-pro insulin A02 x PD1), intended for disease-modifying treatment in type 1 diabetes_**\n\n  * IMC-S118AI recognizes a peptide from pre-proinsulin presented by HLA-A02 on beta cells, coupled with a PD1 agonist effector arm. \n\n\n\n**_Undisclosed non-HLA restricted (universal) candidate for inflammatory dermatological diseases_**\n\n  * The candidate is an antigen presenting cell (APC) tethered ImmTAAI and is not HLA restricted (i.e. universal for all populations). \n\n\n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\nIn August, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Head of Strategy, Brian Di Donato, informed the Company of his plans to leave at the end of the year, to take the role of Chief Executive Officer at a private, early-stage biotech headquartered in San Diego, California. The Company is progressing in its search for a new CFO. Brian will remain as the Company’s CFO and Head of Strategy through the end of 2024, to ensure a smooth transition.\n\n**Financial Results** For the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated net product sales of $80.2 million compared to $62.6 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was due to revenue from KIMMTRAK, of which $57.3 million was in the United States, $21.0 million in Europe, and $1.9 million in international regions. The increase in net product sales was due primarily to increased volume in the United States and global country expansion, as the Company continued its commercialization efforts.\n\nFor the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, research and development (R&D) expenses were $52.8 million, compared to $43.2 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by expenses incurred for the tebentafusp programs, including the Phase 3 trials: TEBE-AM in previously treated advanced cutaneous melanoma and ATOM in adjuvant uveal melanoma.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, SG&A expenses were $35.5 million, compared to $35.5 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per share was $0.17 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.02 for the same period in 2023. Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $8.7 million, as compared to $0.9 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at September 30, 2024 were $901.3 million. The Company plans to use existing cash to repay its $50 million loan by the end of 2024 and also expects to pay approximately $40 million in sales-related rebate accruals in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**About ImmTAC****®****molecules for cancer**\n\nImmunocore’s proprietary T cell receptor (TCR) technology generates a novel class of bispecific biologics called ImmTAC (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against Cancer) molecules that are designed to redirect the immune system to recognize and kill cancerous cells. ImmTAC molecules are soluble TCRs engineered to recognize intracellular cancer antigens with ultra-high affinity and selectively kill these cancer cells via an anti-CD3 immune-activating effector function. Based on the demonstrated mechanism of T cell infiltration into human tumors, the ImmTAC mechanism of action holds the potential to treat hematologic and solid tumors, regardless of mutational burden or immune infiltration, including immune “cold” low mutation rate tumors.\n\n**About ImmTAV****®****molecules and infectious diseases**\n\nImmTAV (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against Virus) molecules are novel bispecifics that are designed to enable the immune system to recognize and eliminate virally infected cells. Immunocore is advancing clinical candidates to achieve functional cure for patients with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). The Company aims to achieve sustained control of HIV after patients stop anti-retroviral therapy (ART), without the risk of virological relapse or onward transmission. This is known as ‘functional cure’. For the treatment of HBV, the Company aims to achieve sustained loss of circulating viral antigens and markers of viral replication after stopping medication for people living with chronic HBV.\n\n**About ImmTAAI****TM****molecules and autoimmune diseases**\n\nImmTAAI (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against AutoImmune disease) molecules are novel bispecifics that are designed for tissue-specific down modulation of the immune system. When tethered to the tissue of interest, ImmTAAI candidates suppress pathogenic T cells via PD1 receptor agonism. The Company is currently advancing two candidates for autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and inflammatory dermatological diseases.\n\n**About PRISM-MEL-301 (NCT06112314) – Phase 3 trial with brenetafusp (IMC-F106C, PRAME-A02) in 1L advanced cutaneous melanoma**\n\nThe Phase 3 registrational trial is randomizing HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma, to brenetafusp + nivolumab versus nivolumab or nivolumab + relatlimab, depending on the country where the patient is enrolled. The trial will initially randomize to three arms: two brenetafusp dose regimens (40 mcg and 160 mcg) and a control arm. One of the two brenetafusp dose regimens will be discontinued after an initial review of the first 60 patients randomized to the two experimental arms (90 patients randomized total). The primary endpoint of the trial is progression free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR), with secondary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR).\n\n**About the IMC-F106C-101 Phase 1/2 trial**\n\nIMC-F106C-101 is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial in patients with multiple solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), endometrial, ovarian, cutaneous melanoma, and breast cancers. The Phase 1 dose escalation trial was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as well as to evaluate the safety, preliminary anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetics of IMC-F106C (brenetafusp), a bispecific protein built on Immunocore’s ImmTAC technology, and the Company’s first molecule to target the PRAME antigen. The Company is enrolling patients into three expansion arms in NSCLC, as well as ovarian and endometrial carcinomas. The IMC-F106C-101 trial is adaptive and includes the option for Phase 2 expansion, allowing for approximately 100 patients treated per tumor type in the Phase 1 and 2 expansion arms. Dose escalation continues in additional solid tumors as well as plans for combination arms with standards-of-care, including checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and tebentafusp.\n\n**About TEBE-AM – Phase 3 registrational trial with tebentafusp in previously treated advanced cutaneous melanoma**\n\nThe trial is randomizing patients with second-line or later advanced cutaneous melanoma who have progressed on an anti-PD1, received prior ipilimumab and, if applicable, received a BRAF kinase inhibitor. Patients are randomized to one of three arms, including tebentafusp – as monotherapy or in combination with an anti-PD1 – or a control arm. The primary endpoint is overall survival.\n\n**About the ATOM Phase 3 trial – Phase 3 registrational trial with tebentafusp in adjuvant uveal melanoma**\n\nThe EORTC-led Phase 3 clinical trial will include sites in 10 EU countries and the United States and will randomize HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with high-risk primary uveal melanoma after definitive treatment, by surgery or radiotherapy, and no evidence of metastatic disease on imaging. The trial is expected to enroll a total of 290 patients who will be randomized 1:1 to one of two arms: tebentafusp as monotherapy or observation. The primary endpoint of the trial is relapse-free survival (RFS), with secondary objectives of overall survival and safety and tolerability of tebentafusp. Exploratory objectives include comparison of health-related quality of life between the treatment arms and evaluation of the role of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker for the presence of residual disease.\n\n**About Uveal Melanoma**\n\nUveal melanoma is a rare and aggressive form of melanoma affecting the eye. Although it is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, the diagnosis is rare, and up to 50% of people with uveal melanoma will eventually develop metastatic disease. Unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma typically has a poor prognosis and had no approved treatment until KIMMTRAK.\n\n**About Cutaneous Melanoma**\n\nCutaneous melanoma (CM) is the most common form of melanoma. It is the most aggressive skin carcinoma and is associated with the vast majority of skin cancer-related mortality. The majority of patients with CM are diagnosed before metastasis but survival remains poor for the large proportion of patients with metastatic disease. Despite recent progress in advanced melanoma therapy, there is still an unmet need for new therapies that improve first-line response rates and duration of response as well as for patients who are refractory to first-line treatments.\n\n**About KIMMTRAK****®**\n\nKIMMTRAK is a novel bispecific protein comprised of a soluble T cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 immune-effector function. KIMMTRAK specifically targets gp100, a lineage antigen expressed in melanocytes and melanoma. This is the first molecule developed using Immunocore’s ImmTAC technology platform, designed to redirect and activate T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells. KIMMTRAK has been approved for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma in the United States, European Union, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be serious or life-threatening, occurred in patients receiving KIMMTRAK. Monitor for at least 16 hours following first three infusions and then as clinically indicated.** Manifestations of CRS may include fever, hypotension, hypoxia, chills, nausea, vomiting, rash, elevated transaminases, fatigue, and headache. CRS occurred in 89% of patients who received KIMMTRAK, with 0.8% being grade 3 or 4. Ensure immediate access to medications and resuscitative equipment to manage CRS. Ensure patients are euvolemic prior to initiating the infusions. Closely monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS following infusions of KIMMTRAK. Monitor fluid status, vital signs, and oxygenation level and provide appropriate therapy. Withhold or discontinue KIMMTRAK depending on persistence and severity of CRS.\n\n**Skin Reactions**\n\nSkin reactions, including rash, pruritus, and cutaneous edema occurred in 91% of patients treated with KIMMTRAK. Monitor patients for skin reactions. If skin reactions occur, treat with antihistamine and topical or systemic steroids based on persistence and severity of symptoms. Withhold or permanently discontinue KIMMTRAK depending on the severity of skin reactions.\n\n**Elevated Liver Enzymes**\n\nElevations in liver enzymes occurred in 65% of patients treated with KIMMTRAK. Monitor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total blood bilirubin prior to the start of and during treatment with KIMMTRAK. Withhold KIMMTRAK according to severity.\n\n**Embryo-Fetal Toxicity**\n\nKIMMTRAK may cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant patients of potential risk to the fetus and patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KIMMTRAK and 1 week after the last dose.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥30%) in patients who received KIMMTRAK were cytokine release syndrome, rash, pyrexia, pruritus, fatigue, nausea, chills, abdominal pain, edema, hypotension, dry skin, headache, and vomiting. The most common (≥50%) laboratory abnormalities were decreased lymphocyte count, increased creatinine, increased glucose, increased AST, increased ALT, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased phosphate.\n\nFor more information, please see full Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) or full U.S. Prescribing Information (including BOXED WARNING for CRS).\n\n**About KIMMTRAKConnect**\n\nImmunocore is committed to helping patients who need KIMMTRAK obtain access via our KIMMTRAKConnect program.

In a proffered session to be held on Monday, September 16, 2024, the Company will present translational Phase 1/2 data with KIMMTRAK® (tebentafusp-tebn) and brenetafusp demonstrating that T cell fitness gene expression signature in blood is an important parameter associated with clinical activity for both therapies in metastatic uveal melanoma.\n\n“Brenetafusp monotherapy is active in heavily pre-treated, platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients and can be combined safely with chemotherapy. We see the hallmarks of ImmTAC clinical activity in this Phase 1 data, such as disease control, ctDNA molecular response, and association with T cell fitness, which increases our confidence in the potential for brenetafusp in ovarian cancer,” said **David Berman, Head of Research and Development**. “While early, the promising efficacy data from chemotherapy plus brenetafusp led us to expand the combinations we are studying, including in earlier-line platinum sensitive disease.”\n\nDr. Claire Friedman, **Gynecologic Medical Oncologist & Early Drug Development Specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center**, said: “While many solid tumors have benefited from the advances in immunotherapy, the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer has remained an ongoing challenge. These data offer proof of concept that patients with advanced, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer can benefit from brenetafusp, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, and support further development of the drug in this patient population.”\n\n**Phase 1 monotherapy data in heavily pre-treated platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients**\n\nThirty-seven patients with heavily pre-treated (median 5 prior lines) serous ovarian cancer were treated with brenetafusp monotherapy, including four patients previously presented in the efficacy data set at ESMO 2022. A majority of patients had received prior bevacizumab (81%) and PARP inhibitors (59%).\n\nBrenetafusp was well tolerated with no treatment-related discontinuation or death observed. The most frequent treatment-related adverse event was reversible and manageable cytokine release syndrome, observed in 57% of patients, with the majority being Grade 1.\n\nThirty-one of the 37 monotherapy patients were evaluable for RECIST v1.1 tumor assessment, 58% of whom demonstrated disease control (partial response and stable disease), including two confirmed partial responses (6.5% RECIST response rate). Of patients who had tumor progression, 64% were treated beyond progression (median of 2 additional months). Across all 37 patients, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.3 months, and the overall survival (OS), while still maturing, was 73% at 6 months.\n\nOf the 29 monotherapy patients evaluable for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) response, 31% (9/29) had a molecular response (≥0.5 log reduction by week 9).\n\nTwenty-eight monotherapy patients were evaluable for baseline blood T cell fitness (TCF) gene expression signature. There was greater activity in patients with a TCF signature above median versus those at or below the median, respectively, including: disease control (80% vs 38%), PFS (3.7 months vs 2.2 months) and six-month OS (93% vs 47%).\n\n**Phase 1 chemotherapy combination data in heavily pre-treated platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients**\n\nAs presented today at ESMO in a pre-clinical study poster (1021P), the combination of chemotherapy with brenetafusp has the potential to enhance clinical activity by increasing expression of the antigen presentation machinery in cancer cells.\n\nIn the Phase 1 trial, 16 patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer were treated with brenetafusp and either gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel or pegylated doxorubicin chemotherapy. These patients were heavily pre-treated (median of 4 prior treatment lines) including prior bevacizumab (75%) and PARP inhibitors (75%). The safety profile of brenetafusp in combination with chemotherapy was consistent with the expected profile of each individual agent.\n\nThirteen of the 16 combination patients were evaluable for RECIST v1.1 tumor assessment. All 13 patients received prior platinum and taxane therapy, and 6 received prior gemcitabine. Sixty nine percent (9/13) of patients achieved disease control, including three partial responses (23% RECIST response rate). Historical chemotherapy efficacy data in this heavily pre-treated patient population is sparse but indicate response rates are less than 10%, with disease control rates typically ~40-50%1.\n\nEleven of the 16 combination patients were evaluable for ctDNA response. The molecular response rate was 82% (9/11). As previously reported for brenetafusp in cutaneous melanoma (ASCO 2024), ctDNA molecular response in this trial was also associated with longer OS and PFS.\n\n**T cell fitness associated with clinical benefit across ImmTAC platform and in different tumor types**\n\nAt an oral proffered session on Monday, September 16, 2024, the Company will present translational data from previously treated, metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) patients, including 132 patients treated with KIMMTRAK in a Phase 1/2 trial, and 22 patients treated with brenetafusp in a Phase 1 trial.\n\nIn the KIMMTRAK cohort, patients with a TCF signature greater than or equal to the median had higher clinical activity compared to patients with a TCF signature below the median, respectively, including longer OS (28 months vs 11 months), PFS (5 months vs 2 months) and disease control (67% vs 36%). The association of TCF signature with longer OS was independent of known prognostic factors in uveal melanoma. In addition, the TCF signature was associated with greater tumor reduction and a higher rate of on-target, melanocyte-related adverse events; both are consistent with the mechanism of action, and suggest that the signature is not purely prognostic.\n\nThis TCF signature, discovered for KIMMTRAK in mUM, was subsequently confirmed as an important parameter of clinical activity for brenetafusp in mUM (ESMO 2024), ovarian cancer (ESMO 2024), and cutaneous melanoma (ASCO 2024). The accumulating data suggests that ImmTAC therapies may deliver greater clinical activity in earlier line patients, where TCF is expected to be higher, leading the Company to investigate brenetafusp in these populations.\n\n**About ImmTAC****®****molecules for cancer**\n\nImmunocore’s proprietary T cell receptor (TCR) technology generates a novel class of bispecific biologics called ImmTAC (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against Cancer) molecules that are designed to redirect the immune system to recognize and kill cancerous cells. ImmTAC molecules are soluble TCRs engineered to recognize intracellular cancer antigens with ultra-high affinity and selectively kill these cancer cells via an anti-CD3 immune-activating effector function. Based on the demonstrated mechanism of T cell infiltration into human tumors, the ImmTAC mechanism of action holds the potential to treat hematologic and solid tumors, regardless of mutational burden or immune infiltration, including immune “cold” low mutation rate tumors.\n\n**About the IMC-F106C-101 Phase 1/2 trial**\n\nIMC-F106C-101 is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial in patients with multiple solid tumor cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), endometrial, ovarian, cutaneous melanoma, and breast cancers. The Phase 1 dose escalation trial was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as well as to evaluate the safety, preliminary anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetics of IMC-F106C (brenetafusp), a bispecific protein built on Immunocore’s ImmTAC technology, and the Company’s first molecule to target the PRAME antigen. The Company is enrolling patients into three expansion arms in ovarian, NSCLC, and endometrial cancers. The IMC-F106C-101 trial is adaptive and includes the option for Phase 2 expansion, allowing for approximately 100 patients treated per tumor type in the Phase 1 and 2 expansion arms. Dose escalation continues in additional solid tumors as well as plans for combination arms with standards-of-care, including checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and tebentafusp.\n\n**About Ovarian Cancer**\n\nMost patients with ovarian cancer are diagnosed with advanced disease, giving it the highest mortality amongst gynecological malignancies in the US and Europe. The current standard of care is surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy, and although many patients initially respond, the disease often recurs and, over time, becomes resistant to further platinum therapy. There is significant unmet need for new therapies that improve clinical outcomes in both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients.\n\n**About Uveal Melanoma**\n\nUveal melanoma is a rare and aggressive form of melanoma affecting the eye. Although it is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, the diagnosis is rare, and up to 50% of people with uveal melanoma will eventually develop metastatic disease. Unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma typically has a poor prognosis and had no approved treatment until KIMMTRAK.\n\n**About KIMMTRAK****®**\n\nKIMMTRAK is a novel bispecific protein comprised of a soluble T cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 immune-effector function. KIMMTRAK specifically targets gp100, a lineage antigen expressed in melanocytes and melanoma. This is the first molecule developed using Immunocore’s ImmTAC technology platform designed to redirect and activate T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells. KIMMTRAK has been approved for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma in the United States, European Union, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\nCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be serious or life-threatening, occurred in patients receiving KIMMTRAK. Monitor for at least 16 hours following first three infusions and then as clinically indicated. Manifestations of CRS may include fever, hypotension, hypoxia, chills, nausea, vomiting, rash, elevated transaminases, fatigue, and headache. CRS occurred in 89% of patients who received KIMMTRAK with 0.8% being grade 3 or 4. Ensure immediate access to medications and resuscitative equipment to manage CRS. Ensure patients are euvolemic prior to initiating the infusions. Closely monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS following infusions of KIMMTRAK. Monitor fluid status, vital signs, and oxygenation level and provide appropriate therapy. Withhold or discontinue KIMMTRAK depending on persistence and severity of CRS.\n\n**Skin Reactions**\n\nSkin reactions, including rash, pruritus, and cutaneous edema occurred in 91% of patients treated with KIMMTRAK. Monitor patients for skin reactions. If skin reactions occur, treat with antihistamine and topical or systemic steroids based on persistence and severity of symptoms. Withhold or permanently discontinue KIMMTRAK depending on the severity of skin reactions.\n\n**Elevated Liver Enzymes**\n\nElevations in liver enzymes occurred in 65% of patients treated with KIMMTRAK. Monitor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total blood bilirubin prior to the start of and during treatment with KIMMTRAK. Withhold KIMMTRAK according to severity.\n\n**Embryo-Fetal Toxicity**\n\nKIMMTRAK may cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant patients of potential risk to the fetus and patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KIMMTRAK and 1 week after the last dose. The most common adverse reactions (≥30%) in patients who received KIMMTRAK were cytokine release syndrome, rash, pyrexia, pruritus, fatigue, nausea, chills, abdominal pain, edema, hypotension, dry skin, headache, and vomiting. The most common (≥50%) laboratory abnormalities were decreased lymphocyte count, increased creatinine, increased glucose, increased AST, increased ALT, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased phosphate.

KIMMTRAK continues to be the standard of care in most markets where it is launched. The Company sees three key growth areas for the KIMMTRAK opportunity, including: continued global expansion in mUM, as well as the potential expansion into 2L+ advanced cutaneous melanoma (CM) and adjuvant uveal melanoma._\n\n**_Metastatic uveal melanoma_**\n\n  * In Q2 2024, KIMMTRAK net product sales were $75 million and $146 million for the three and six months ended June 30, respectively, representing increases of 32% and 34% respectively, compared to the prior year periods.\n  * US growth driven by increased penetration in community setting and duration of treatment.\n  * As of July 1, 2024, KIMMTRAK is launched in 19 countries. Reimbursement agreements reached in Sweden and Poland with expected launches in second half of 2024.\n  * Published data at ASCO 2024 demonstrating that KIMMTRAK-treated mUM patients with stable disease and any confirmed tumor reduction have similar clinical outcomes to patients with RECIST partial response.\n  * New T cell fitness insights from the Phase 2 KIMMTRAK trial in previously treated uveal melanoma will be an oral presentation during the “Basic Science & Translational Research” proffered session at the 2024 ESMO Congress. \n\n\n\n**_2L + Previously treated cutaneous melanoma_**\n\n  * Converted Phase 2/3 TEBE-AM trial into registrational Phase 3 trial, which will continue three arms: KIMMTRAK monotherapy, KIMMTRAK in combination with pembrolizumab, and control.\n  * Over 120 patients already randomized into the original Phase 2 portion will now be included in the Phase 3 trial, which we expect will accelerate time to final endpoint by up to 12 months.\n  * Expect enrollment to be completed in the first half of 2026. \n\n\n\n**_Adjuvant uveal (or ocular) melanoma_**\n\n  * Randomization in the ATOM Phase 3 trial, led by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), expected to start in the second half of 2024. \n\n\n\n**PRAME franchise** _Brenetafusp (IMC-F106C) is the Company’s lead PRAME-A02 ImmTAC bispecific candidate. Brenetafusp is being evaluated in combination with nivolumab, in a Phase 3 registrational trial (PRISM-MEL-301) in patients with first-line advanced cutaneous melanoma (CM) and in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, as monotherapy and in combination, across multiple tumor types, including platinum resistant ovarian, non-small cell lung (NSCLC), and endometrial carcinoma._\n\n**_PRISM-MEL-301 – First PRAME Phase 3 clinical trial with brenetafusp in first-line advanced or metastatic HLA-A*02:01 positive cutaneous melanoma_**\n\n  * In 2Q, the Company randomized the first patient in PRISM-MEL-301.\n  * Trial is evaluating brenetafusp + nivolumab versus a control arm of either nivolumab or nivolumab + relatlimab.\n\n\n\n**_Phase 1/2 clinical trial of brenetafusp (PRAME-A02) in multiple solid tumors_**\n\n  * Presented data at ASCO 2024 from the Phase 1/2 trial with brenetafusp in patients with late-line CM showing promising brenetafusp monotherapy disease control (partial response and stable disease), progression free survival (PFS), and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) molecular response. In PRAME positive patients, the disease control rate was 58% and median PFS was 4.2 months. Brenetafusp was well tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD1.\n  * Clinical data from monotherapy and chemotherapy combinations in heavily pre-treated platinum-resistant high grade serous ovarian cancer will be presented as a poster at ESMO 2024 (Phase 1 safety and efficacy of brenetafusp, a PRAME × CD3 ImmTAC T cell engager, in platinum resistant ovarian cancer (PROC), Poster 750P). The next step is to further evaluate brenetafusp in combination with non-platinum chemotherapies in platinum resistant disease and to test the combination with platinum chemotherapy and with bevacizumab in platinum sensitive disease.\n  * The Company plans to present clinical data for brenetafusp in late-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the fourth quarter of 2024. The next step is to evaluate brenetafusp in combinations with docetaxel and with osimertinib in earlier-line NSCLC.\n\n\n\n**_IMC-P115C (PRAME-A02 Half-Life Extended) & IMC-T119C (PRAME-A24)_**\n\n  * Submitted Clinical Trial Application (CTA) for IMC-P115C in the second quarter of 2024, which is currently under review.\n  * Remain on track for regulatory submission of Investigational New Drug (IND) or Clinical Trial Application (CTA) for IMC-T119C in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n**Additional Oncology Candidates**\n\n**_IMC-R117C (first PIWIL1-A02 targeted immunotherapy) for colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers_** _The Company has leveraged its proprietary peptidomic database to validate a novel target, PIWIL1. PIWIL1 is a negative prognostic marker and is expressed across a range of tumors including colorectal, which is historically insensitive to immune checkpoints, as well as gastro-esophageal, and pancreatic cancer._\n\n  * The CTA for IMC-R117C was accepted in April 2024 by the EMA, and the Phase 1 clinical trial is expected to start in the second half of 2024.\n\n\n\n**ImmTAV Candidates for a Functional Cure in Infectious Diseases** _The Company’s bispecific TCR technology platform has potential to offer a new approach for the treatment of chronic infections and aims to eliminate evidence of remaining virus in circulation after the patient stops taking medication - known as a \"functional cure\". Two investigational candidates are in Phase 1 clinical trials for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and people with chronic Hepatitis B infection (HBV)._\n\n**_Phase 1 trial of IMC-M113V (Gag-A02) for people living with HIV_**\n\n  * The objective of the clinical trial is to identify a safe and tolerable dose and evaluate whether IMC-M113V could lead to reduction in the viral reservoir and, after stopping antiretroviral therapies (ART) and IMC-M113V, delay or prevent HIV rebound.\n  * Historically, viral rebound occurs rapidly after ART interruption at a median of 2 weeks, and approximately 98% of people will have >200 viral copies/ml (the threshold for transmission) by week 8 (Feher C et. al, 2019).\n  * In the MAD portion, the Company has enrolled 3 cohorts with 5 people living with HIV (PLWH) per cohort. The highest tested dose is 300 mcg.\n  * A biologically active dose has been reached and the Company plans to enroll more PLWH to characterize anti-viral activity and to explore higher doses. This will move the planned data release from fourth quarter of 2024 into first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**_Phase 1 trial of IMC-I109V (Envelope-A02) for people living with HBV or HBV-positive hepatocellular carcinoma_**\n\n  * Patient enrollment continues into the single ascending dose portion of the clinical trial.\n\n\n\n**Tissue-specific Down Modulation of the Immune System for Autoimmune Diseases** _The Company is expanding its platform into autoimmune diseases with two new, first-in-class bispecific candidates recently entering its pipeline. The key differentiator of the Company’s ImmTAAI (Immune Modulating Monoclonal TCRs Against AutoImmune disease) platform is tissue-specific down modulation of the immune system whereby, when tethered to the tissue of interest, the new candidates suppress pathogenic T cells via PD1 receptor agonism._\n\n**_IMC-S118AI (pre-pro insulin A02 x PD1), intended for disease-modifying treatment in type 1 diabetes_**\n\n  * IMC-S118AI recognizes a peptide from pre-proinsulin presented by HLA-A02 on beta cells, coupled with a PD1 agonist effector arm.\n  * IMC-S118AI is advancing towards GMP manufacturing in 2024.\n\n\n\n**_Undisclosed non-HLA restricted (universal) candidate for inflammatory dermatological diseases_**\n\n  * The candidate is an antigen presenting cell (APC) tethered ImmTAAI and is not HLA restricted (i.e. universal for all populations).\n\n\n\n**ESMO Congress 2024 - Presentation and poster details**\n\n**Title:** Phase 1 safety and efficacy of brenetafusp, a PRAME × CD3 ImmTAC T cell engager, in platinum resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) (Poster 750P)**Presenting author:** Claire F. Friedman**Session:** Poster Session – Gynaecological cancers, Saturday 14 September 2024; 09:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. CEST / 04:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. ET\n\n**Title:** Chemotherapy and hypomethylating agents enhance anti-tumor activity of PRAME ImmTAC **Presenting author:** Adel Benlahrech**Session:** Poster Session – Investigational immunotherapy, Saturday 14 September 2024; 09:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. CEST / 04:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. ET (Poster 1021P)\n\n**Title:** Association of a blood T cell fitness gene signature with clinical benefit from ImmTAC bispecific T cell engagers (Oral 66O)**Presenting author:** Joseph Sacco**Session:** Proffered paper session 2 – Basic Science and Translational Research, Monday 16 September 2024; 02:45-04:15 p.m. CEST / 09:45-11:15 a.m. ET\n\n**Financial Results** For the second quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company generated net product sales of $75.3 million compared to $56.9 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was due to revenue from KIMMTRAK, of which $55.6 million was in the United States, $15.4 million (net of an increase in estimated reserves related to prior periods of $6.7 million) in Europe, and $4.3 million in international regions. The increase in net product sales was due primarily to increased volume in the United States and global country expansion, as the Company continued its commercialization efforts.\n\nFor the second quarter ended June 30, 2024, research and development (R&D) expenses were $51.1 million, compared to $38.2 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by expenses incurred for the PRAME programs, including the initiation of the Company’s Phase 3 clinical trial.\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2024, SG&A expenses were $38.6 million, compared to $35.0 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily related to additional employees engaged in business support functions, including medical and regulatory activities, to support our growing pipeline and commercial activities.\n\nBasic and diluted loss per share was $0.23 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to a basic and diluted loss per share of $0.35 for the same period in 2023. Net loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was $11.6 million, as compared to $17.0 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at June 30, 2024 were $859.6 million. The Company plans to use $50 million to repay its existing loan by the end of 2024, and also expects to pay approximately $40 million in sales-related rebate accruals in the second half of 2024.\n\n**About ImmTAC****®****molecules for cancer**\n\nImmunocore’s proprietary T cell receptor (TCR) technology generates a novel class of bispecific biologics called ImmTAC (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against Cancer) molecules that are designed to redirect the immune system to recognize and kill cancerous cells. ImmTAC molecules are soluble TCRs engineered to recognize intracellular cancer antigens with ultra-high affinity and selectively kill these cancer cells via an anti-CD3 immune-activating effector function. Based on the demonstrated mechanism of T cell infiltration into human tumors, the ImmTAC mechanism of action holds the potential to treat hematologic and solid tumors, regardless of mutational burden or immune infiltration, including immune “cold” low mutation rate tumors.\n\n**About ImmTAV****®****molecules and infectious diseases**\n\nImmTAV (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against Virus) molecules are novel bispecifics that are designed to enable the immune system to recognize and eliminate virally infected cells. Immunocore is advancing clinical candidates to achieve functional cure for patients with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). The Company aims to achieve sustained control of HIV after patients stop anti-retroviral therapy (ART), without the risk of virological relapse or onward transmission. This is known as ‘functional cure’. For the treatment of HBV, the Company aims to achieve sustained loss of circulating viral antigens and markers of viral replication after stopping medication for people living with chronic HBV.\n\n**About ImmTAAI****TM****molecules and autoimmune diseases**\n\nImmTAAI (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against AutoImmune disease) molecules are novel bispecifics that are designed for tissue-specific down modulation of the immune system. When tethered to the tissue of interest, ImmTAAI candidates suppress pathogenic T cells via PD1 receptor agonism. The Company is currently advancing two candidates for autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and inflammatory dermatological diseases.\n\n**About PRISM-MEL-301 (NCT06112314) – Phase 3 trial with brenetafusp (IMC-F106C, PRAME-A02) in 1L advanced cutaneous melanoma**\n\nThe Phase 3 registrational trial is randomizing HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma to brenetafusp + nivolumab versus nivolumab or nivolumab + relatlimab, depending on the country where the patient is enrolled. The trial will initially randomize to three arms: two brenetafusp dose regimens (40 mcg and 160 mcg) and a control arm. One of the two brenetafusp dose regimens will be discontinued after an initial review of the first 60 patients randomized to the two experimental arms (90 patients randomized total). The primary endpoint of the trial is progression free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR), with secondary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR).\n\n**About the IMC-F106C-101 Phase 1/2 trial**\n\nIMC-F106C-101 is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial in patients with multiple solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), endometrial, ovarian, cutaneous melanoma, and breast cancers. The Phase 1 dose escalation trial was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as well as to evaluate the safety, preliminary anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetics of IMC-F106C (brenetafusp), a bispecific protein built on Immunocore’s ImmTAC technology, and the Company’s first molecule to target the PRAME antigen. The Company is enrolling patients into three expansion arms in NSCLC, as well as ovarian and endometrial carcinomas. The IMC-F106C-101 trial is adaptive and includes the option for Phase 2 expansion, allowing for approximately 100 patients treated per tumor type in the Phase 1 and 2 expansion arms. Dose escalation continues in additional solid tumors as well as plans for combination arms with standards-of-care, including checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and tebentafusp.\n\n**About TEBE-AM – Phase 3 registrational trial with tebentafusp in previously treated advanced cutaneous melanoma**\n\nThe trial is randomizing patients with second-line or later advanced cutaneous melanoma who have progressed on an anti-PD1, received prior ipilimumab and, if applicable, received a BRAF kinase inhibitor. Patients are randomized to one of three arms, including tebentafusp – as monotherapy or in combination with an anti-PD1 – or a control arm. The primary endpoint is overall survival.\n\n**About the ATOM Phase 3 trial**\n\nThe EORTC-led Phase 3 clinical trial will include sites in 10 EU countries and the United States and will randomize HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with high-risk primary uveal melanoma after definitive treatment, by surgery or radiotherapy, and no evidence of metastatic disease on imaging. The trial is expected to enroll a total of 290 patients who will be randomized 1:1 to one of two arms: tebentafusp as monotherapy or observation. The primary endpoint of the trial is relapse-free survival (RFS), with secondary objectives of overall survival and safety and tolerability of tebentafusp. Exploratory objectives include comparison of health-related quality of life between the treatment arms and evaluation of the role of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker for the presence of residual disease.\n\n**About Uveal Melanoma**\n\nUveal melanoma is a rare and aggressive form of melanoma affecting the eye. Although it is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, the diagnosis is rare, and up to 50% of people with uveal melanoma will eventually develop metastatic disease. Unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma typically has a poor prognosis and had no approved treatment until KIMMTRAK.\n\n**About Cutaneous Melanoma**\n\nCutaneous melanoma (CM) is the most common form of melanoma. It is the most aggressive skin carcinoma and is associated with the vast majority of skin cancer-related mortality. The majority of patients with CM are diagnosed before metastasis but survival remains poor for the large proportion of patients with metastatic disease. Despite recent progress in advanced melanoma therapy, there is still an unmet need for new therapies that improve first-line response rates and duration of response as well as for patients who are refractory to first-line treatments.\n\n**About KIMMTRAK****®**\n\nKIMMTRAK is a novel bispecific protein comprised of a soluble T cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 immune-effector function. KIMMTRAK specifically targets gp100, a lineage antigen expressed in melanocytes and melanoma. This is the first molecule developed using Immunocore’s ImmTAC technology platform, designed to redirect and activate T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells. KIMMTRAK has been approved for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma in the United States, European Union, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be serious or life-threatening, occurred in patients receiving KIMMTRAK. Monitor for at least 16 hours following first three infusions and then as clinically indicated.** Manifestations of CRS may include fever, hypotension, hypoxia, chills, nausea, vomiting, rash, elevated transaminases, fatigue, and headache. CRS occurred in 89% of patients who received KIMMTRAK, with 0.8% being grade 3 or 4. Ensure immediate access to medications and resuscitative equipment to manage CRS. Ensure patients are euvolemic prior to initiating the infusions. Closely monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS following infusions of KIMMTRAK. Monitor fluid status, vital signs, and oxygenation level and provide appropriate therapy. Withhold or discontinue KIMMTRAK depending on persistence and severity of CRS.\n\n**Skin Reactions**\n\nSkin reactions, including rash, pruritus, and cutaneous edema occurred in 91% of patients treated with KIMMTRAK. Monitor patients for skin reactions. If skin reactions occur, treat with antihistamine and topical or systemic steroids based on persistence and severity of symptoms. Withhold or permanently discontinue KIMMTRAK depending on the severity of skin reactions.\n\n**Elevated Liver Enzymes**\n\nElevations in liver enzymes occurred in 65% of patients treated with KIMMTRAK. Monitor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total blood bilirubin prior to the start of and during treatment with KIMMTRAK. Withhold KIMMTRAK according to severity.\n\n**Embryo-Fetal Toxicity**\n\nKIMMTRAK may cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant patients of potential risk to the fetus and patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KIMMTRAK and 1 week after the last dose.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥30%) in patients who received KIMMTRAK were cytokine release syndrome, rash, pyrexia, pruritus, fatigue, nausea, chills, abdominal pain, edema, hypotension, dry skin, headache, and vomiting. The most common (≥50%) laboratory abnormalities were decreased lymphocyte count, increased creatinine, increased glucose, increased AST, increased ALT, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased phosphate.\n\nFor more information, please see full Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) or full U.S. Prescribing Information (including BOXED WARNING for CRS).\n\n**About KIMMTRAKConnect**\n\nImmunocore is committed to helping patients who need KIMMTRAK obtain access via our KIMMTRAKConnect program. The program provides services with dedicated nurse case managers who provide personalized support, including educational resources, financial assistance, and site of care coordination.

Bristol Myers Squibb will provide nivolumab.\n\nProfessor Georgina Long, **Co-Medical Director of Melanoma Institute Australia** , said: “The PRISM-MEL-301 Phase 3 trial is a great example of outside-the-box scientific thinking, leveraging the immune system in a new way in the hope of beating cancer. My hope is that we can get closer to our goal of zero deaths from melanoma by conducting clinical trials with innovative drug therapies such as this.” The Company has shared the cutaneous melanoma Phase 1 data during an oral presentation at the 2024 American Society of Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting on 31 May. The data showed that brenetafusp was well tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD1, and demonstrated promising monotherapy clinical activity, including disease control rate (partial response and stable disease), progression free survival, and circulating tumor DNA molecular response.\n\nBrenetafusp is the first PRAME x CD3 ImmTAC bispecific protein targeting an HLA-A*02:01 PRAME (PReferentially expressed Antigen in Melanoma) antigen. The Company is continuing to enroll patients into a Phase 1/2 trial in monotherapy and combination arms across multiple tumor types, including three expansion arms for patients with advanced ovarian, non-small cell lung, and endometrial cancers.\n\n**About ImmTAC****®****molecules for cancer**\n\nImmunocore’s proprietary T cell receptor (TCR) technology generates a novel class of bispecific biologics called ImmTAC (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against Cancer) molecules that are designed to redirect the immune system to recognize and kill cancerous cells. ImmTAC molecules are soluble TCRs engineered to recognize intracellular cancer antigens with ultra-high affinity and selectively kill these cancer cells via an anti-CD3 immune-activating effector function. Based on the demonstrated mechanism of T cell infiltration into human tumors, the ImmTAC mechanism of action holds the potential to treat hematologic and solid tumors, regardless of mutational burden or immune infiltration, including immune “cold” low mutation rate tumors.\n\n**About PRISM-MEL-301 – Phase 3 trial with brenetafusp (IMC-F106C, PRAME-A02) in 1L advanced cutaneous melanoma**\n\nThe Phase 3 registrational trial will randomize HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma to brenetafusp + nivolumab versus nivolumab or nivolumab + relatlimab, depending on the country where the patient is enrolled. The trial will initially randomize to three arms: two brenetafusp dose regimens (40 mcg and 160 mcg) and control arm and will discontinue one of the brenetafusp dose regimens after an initial review of the first 60 patients randomized to the two experimental arms (90 patients randomized total). The primary endpoint of the trial is progression free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR), with secondary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR).\n\n**About the IMC-F106C-101 Phase 1/2 trial**\n\nIMC-F106C-101 is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial in patients with multiple solid tumor cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), endometrial, ovarian, cutaneous melanoma, and breast cancers. The Phase 1 dose escalation trial was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as well as to evaluate the safety, preliminary anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetics of IMC-F106C (brenetafusp), a bispecific protein built on Immunocore’s ImmTAC technology, and the Company’s first molecule to target the PRAME antigen. The Company has initiated patient enrollment into four expansion arms in cutaneous melanoma, ovarian, NSCLC, and endometrial carcinomas. The IMC-F106C-101 trial is adaptive and includes the option for Phase 2 expansion, allowing for approximately 100 patients treated per tumor type in the Phase 1 and 2 expansion arms. Ph1 monotherapy continues in additional solid tumors as well as multiple combinations with standards-of-care, including checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and tebentafusp.\n\n**About Cutaneous Melanoma**\n\nCutaneous melanoma (CM) is the most common form of melanoma. It is the most aggressive skin carcinoma and is associated with the vast majority of skin cancer-related mortality. The majority of patients with CM are diagnosed before metastasis but survival remains poor for the large proportion of patients with metastatic disease. Despite recent progress in advanced melanoma therapy, there is still an unmet need for new therapies that improve first-line response rates and duration of response as well as for patients who are refractory to first-line treatments.\n\n**About Immunocore**\n\nImmunocore is a commercial-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of a novel class of TCR bispecific immunotherapies called ImmTAX – Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against X disease – designed to treat a broad range of diseases, including cancer, autoimmune, and infectious disease. Leveraging its proprietary, flexible, off-the-shelf ImmTAX platform, Immunocore is developing a deep pipeline in multiple therapeutic areas, including nine active clinical and pre-clinical programs​ in oncology, infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases.

KIMMTRAK has been approved for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma in the United States, European Union, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\n**About Phase 2 IMCgp100-102 Trial**\n\nIMCgp100-102 (NCT02570308) was an open-label, multi-center, single-arm trial of the safety and efficacy of tebentafusp in patients with previously treated mUM. The trial included 127 HLA-A*02:01+ 2L+ mUM patients, treated with tebentafusp at the recommended Phase 2 dose of 68mcg following intra-patient dose escalation of 20 mcg (week 1) and 30 mcg (week 2). The primary endpoint was objective response rate by blinded independent central review, with secondary objectives being overall survival (OS) and safety in 127 patients who had enrolled after progressing on one or more prior therapies.\n\n**About Phase 3 IMCgp100-202 Trial**\n\nIMCgp100-202 (NCT03070392) is a randomized pivotal trial that evaluated overall survival (OS) of KIMMTRAK compared to investigator’s choice (either pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacarbazine) in HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with previously untreated mUM. KIMMTRAK demonstrated an unprecedented OS benefit with a Hazard Ratio (HR) in the intent-to-treat population favoring KIMMTRAK, HR=0.51 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.71); p< 0.0001, over investigator’s choice (82% pembrolizumab; 13% ipilimumab; 6% dacarbazine).\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be serious or life-threatening, occurred in patients receiving KIMMTRAK. Monitor for at least 16 hours following first three infusions and then as clinically indicated.** Manifestations of CRS may include fever, hypotension, hypoxia, chills, nausea, vomiting, rash, elevated transaminases, fatigue, and headache. CRS occurred in 89% of patients who received KIMMTRAK with 0.8% being grade 3 or 4. Ensure immediate access to medications and resuscitative equipment to manage CRS. Ensure patients are euvolemic prior to initiating the infusions. Closely monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS following infusions of KIMMTRAK. Monitor fluid status, vital signs, and oxygenation level and provide appropriate therapy. Withhold or discontinue KIMMTRAK depending on persistence and severity of CRS.\n\n**Skin Reactions**\n\nSkin reactions, including rash, pruritus, and cutaneous edema occurred in 91% of patients treated with KIMMTRAK. Monitor patients for skin reactions. If skin reactions occur, treat with antihistamine and topical or systemic steroids based on persistence and severity of symptoms. Withhold or permanently discontinue KIMMTRAK depending on the severity of skin reactions.\n\n**Elevated Liver Enzymes**\n\nElevations in liver enzymes occurred in 65% of patients treated with KIMMTRAK. Monitor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total blood bilirubin prior to the start of and during treatment with KIMMTRAK. Withhold KIMMTRAK according to severity.\n\n**Embryo-Fetal Toxicity**\n\nKIMMTRAK may cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant patients of potential risk to the fetus and patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KIMMTRAK and 1 week after the last dose.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥30%) in patients who received KIMMTRAK were cytokine release syndrome, rash, pyrexia, pruritus, fatigue, nausea, chills, abdominal pain, edema, hypotension, dry skin, headache, and vomiting. The most common (≥50%) laboratory abnormalities were decreased lymphocyte count, increased creatinine, increased glucose, increased AST, increased ALT, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased phosphate.\n\nFor more information, please see full Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) or full U.S. Prescribing Information (including BOXED WARNING for CRS).\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Brenetafusp was shown to be well tolerated, in monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD1, and demonstrated durable clinical benefit.\n\n“Brenetafusp continues to demonstrate promising monotherapy clinical activity in late-line cutaneous melanoma patients who were previously treated with checkpoint therapies,” said **Dr.** **Omid Hamid, Chief, Translational Research and Immunotherapy, Co-Director, Melanoma Therapeutics at Cedars-Sinai Cancer at the Angeles Clinic and Research Institute**. “The disease control and PFS benefit for these brenetafusp-treated melanoma patients compares favorably to data with other immunotherapies.”\n\n“The best measure of brenetafusp monotherapy activity is disease control, which is observed in 56% of checkpoint pre-treated melanoma patients,” said **David Berman, Head of Research and Development**. “We expect brenetafusp PFS to be even higher in first-line based on our analysis of blood T cell fitness. These data points, in conjunction with the significant molecular response and the expected additive benefit of combining with an active anti-PD1, provide confidence for PFS as an endpoint in our ongoing Phase 3 first-line trial.”\n\n**Phase 1 data in post-checkpoint cutaneous melanoma**\n\nAs of 18 March 2024, 47 patients have received brenetafusp (IMC-F106C) monotherapy at clinically active target dose levels. All monotherapy treated patients had received prior immune checkpoint inhibitors (100% anti-PD1, 81% anti-CTLA4). PRAME expression was high amongst evaluable patients (median H score of 215). Only 11% of patients had PRAME negative tumors, as measured by immunohistochemistry.\n\nBrenetafusp was well-tolerated, with treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) that were manageable and consistent with the mechanism of action. The most frequent TRAE reported was Grade 1 or 2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and rash; these events occurred predominantly following the initial three doses. There were no Grade 3 or higher CRS TRAEs.\n\nOf the 47 monotherapy patients, 36 had a RECIST evaluable tumor assessment. The disease control rate (DCR), consisting of partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD), was 56% including 4 PR (ORR 11%) and 16 SD (44%). Durable tumor reduction, confirmed by at least one subsequent scan, was observed in 28% of patients and is an attribute of the ImmTAC platform1. Clinical benefit was enriched in the 31 evaluable PRAME positive patients. The DCR in this group was 58% and included all 10 patients (32%) with confirmed tumor reduction.\n\nBoth median progression free survival (mPFS) and 6-month overall survival (OS) rates were greater in PRAME positive than in PRAME negative monotherapy patients: 4.2 vs 2.1 months and 95% vs 40%, respectively.\n\n42% of ctDNA-evaluable, PRAME positive monotherapy patients had a molecular response (10/24) and there was a trend for longer PFS and OS in molecular responders. No ctDNA-evaluable PRAME negative patients had ctDNA reduction.\n\nIn addition to the monotherapy patients treated with brenetafusp, there were 9 cutaneous melanoma patients who received brenetafusp in combination with an anti-PD1 (pembrolizumab), all of whom had received prior checkpoint inhibitors (100% prior anti-PD1, 89% prior CTLA4). Overall, patients were more heavily pre-treated in the combination cohort compared to monotherapy (median prior lines: 4 vs 2; PD-1 refractory: 67% vs 30%). Brenetafusp in combination with pembrolizumab was well tolerated, with TRAEs that were manageable and consistent with the mechanism of action of both agents. There was one dose-limiting toxicity (transaminitis) reported in one patient with prior history of checkpoint inhibitor induced autoimmune hepatitis.\n\nOf the 7 patients evaluable for efficacy in combination, 4 achieved disease control including 1 ongoing PR (confirmed after the data cut off for the presentation), and 3 of the 4 ctDNA evaluable patients having molecular response.\n\nIn 41 gene-expression evaluable monotherapy patients, a gene signature was identified from baseline peripheral blood that was a measure of systemic T cell fitness. Patients with gene signature expression levels greater than or equal to the median had higher clinical benefit including a median PFS of 6 months and DCR of 69%, compared to those with less than the median gene expression levels (2 months and 42%, respectively). Patients with only 1-2 prior lines of therapy had higher T cell fitness gene signature, on average, than those with 3 or more prior lines of therapy.\n\nThe advanced cutaneous melanoma data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of brenetafusp will be presented today at 2:45 PM CT / 3:45 PM ET, in the Melanoma/Skin Cancers oral abstract session at the 2024 American Society of Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. The presentation will be accessible in the ‘Events & Presentations’ section of the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website.\n\n**PRISM-MEL-301 – First PRAME Phase 3 clinical trial with brenetafusp in first-line advanced cutaneous melanoma**\n\nThe Company is enrolling patients in a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial with brenetafusp in first-line advanced cutaneous melanoma (CM) with a primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) (NCT06112314). The trial will randomize HLA-A*02:01-positive, first-line advanced CM patients to brenetafusp + nivolumab versus a control arm of either nivolumab or nivolumab + relatlimab, depending on the country where the patient is enrolled.\n\nUnder the terms of a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement, Immunocore will sponsor and fund this registrational Phase 3 clinical trial, and Bristol Myers Squibb will provide nivolumab.\n\n**Audio Webcast**\n\nImmunocore will host a conference call today, May 31, 2024 at 7:15 PM ET / 6:15 PM CT, to discuss the Phase 1 PRAME expansion data and Phase 3 registrational trial in cutaneous melanoma. The call will also be available via webcast by visiting the Events & Presentations section on Immunocore’s website. A replay of this webcast will be available for 30 days.\n\nConference Call Details:U.S. (toll-free): 877-405-1239International (toll): +1 201-389-0851\n\n###\n\n**About ImmTAC ® molecules for cancer**\n\nImmunocore’s proprietary T cell receptor (TCR) technology generates a novel class of bispecific biologics called ImmTAC (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against Cancer) molecules that are designed to redirect the immune system to recognize and kill cancerous cells. ImmTAC molecules are soluble TCRs engineered to recognize intracellular cancer antigens with ultra-high affinity and selectively kill these cancer cells via an anti-CD3 immune-activating effector function. Based on the demonstrated mechanism of T cell infiltration into human tumors, the ImmTAC mechanism of action holds the potential to treat hematologic and solid tumors, regardless of mutational burden or immune infiltration, including immune “cold” low mutation rate tumors.\n\n**About PRISM-MEL-301 – Phase 3 trial with brenetafusp (IMC-F106C; PRAME-A02) in 1L advanced cutaneous melanoma**\n\nThe Phase 3 registrational trial will randomize patients with previously untreated, HLA-A*02:01-positive, advanced melanoma to brenetafusp + nivolumab versus nivolumab or nivolumab + relatlimab, depending on the country where the patient is enrolled. The study will initially randomize to three arms: two brenetafusp dose regimens (40 mcg and 160 mcg) and control arm and will discontinue one of the brenetafusp dose regimens after an initial review of the first 60 patients randomized to the two experimental arms (90 patients randomized total). The primary endpoint of the trial is progression free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR), with secondary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR).\n\n**About the IMC-F106C-101 Phase 1/2 trial**\n\nIMC-F106C-101 is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial in patients with multiple solid tumor cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), endometrial, ovarian, cutaneous melanoma, and breast cancers. The Phase 1 dose escalation trial was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as well as to evaluate the safety, preliminary anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetics of IMC-F106C (brenetafusp), a bispecific protein built on Immunocore’s ImmTAC technology, and the Company’s first molecule to target the PRAME antigen. The Company has initiated patient enrollment into four expansion arms in cutaneous melanoma, ovarian, NSCLC, and endometrial carcinomas. The IMC-F106C-101 trial is adaptive and includes the option for Phase 2 expansion, allowing for approximately 100 patients treated per tumor type in the Phase 1 and 2 expansion arms. Ph1 monotherapy continues in additional solid tumors as well as multiple combinations with standards-of-care, including checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and tebentafusp.\n\n**About Cutaneous Melanoma**\n\nCutaneous melanoma (CM) is the most common form of melanoma. It is the most aggressive skin carcinoma and is associated with the vast majority of skin cancer-related mortality. The majority of patients with CM are diagnosed before metastasis and survival remains poor for the large proportion of patients with metastatic disease. Despite recent progress in advanced melanoma therapy, there is still an unmet need for new therapies that improve first-line response rates and duration of response as well as for patients who are refractory to first-line treatments.\n\n**About KIMMTRAK ®**\n\nKIMMTRAK is a novel bispecific protein comprised of a soluble T cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 immune-effector function. KIMMTRAK specifically targets gp100, a lineage antigen expressed in melanocytes and melanoma. This is the first molecule developed using Immunocore’s ImmTAC technology platform designed to redirect and activate T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells. KIMMTRAK has been approved for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma in the United States, European Union, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\n**Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be serious or life-threatening, occurred in patients receiving KIMMTRAK. Monitor for at least 16 hours following first three infusions and then as clinically indicated.** Manifestations of CRS may include fever, hypotension, hypoxia, chills, nausea, vomiting, rash, elevated transaminases, fatigue, and headache. CRS occurred in 89% of patients who received KIMMTRAK with 0.8% being grade 3 or 4. Ensure immediate access to medications and resuscitative equipment to manage CRS. Ensure patients are euvolemic prior to initiating the infusions. Closely monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS following infusions of KIMMTRAK. Monitor fluid status, vital signs, and oxygenation level and provide appropriate therapy. Withhold or discontinue KIMMTRAK depending on persistence and severity of CRS.\n\n**Skin Reactions**\n\nSkin reactions, including rash, pruritus, and cutaneous edema occurred in 91% of patients treated with KIMMTRAK. Monitor patients for skin reactions. If skin reactions occur, treat with antihistamine and topical or systemic steroids based on persistence and severity of symptoms. Withhold or permanently discontinue KIMMTRAK depending on the severity of skin reactions.\n\n**Elevated Liver Enzymes**\n\nElevations in liver enzymes occurred in 65% of patients treated with KIMMTRAK. Monitor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total blood bilirubin prior to the start of and during treatment with KIMMTRAK. Withhold KIMMTRAK according to severity.\n\n**Embryo-Fetal Toxicity**\n\nKIMMTRAK may cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant patients of potential risk to the fetus and patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KIMMTRAK and 1 week after the last dose.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥30%) in patients who received KIMMTRAK were cytokine release syndrome, rash, pyrexia, pruritus, fatigue, nausea, chills, abdominal pain, edema, hypotension, dry skin, headache, and vomiting. The most common (≥50%) laboratory abnormalities were decreased lymphocyte count, increased creatinine, increased glucose, increased AST, increased ALT, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased phosphate.\n\nFor more information, please see full Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) or full U.S. Prescribing Information (including BOXED WARNING for CRS).\n\n**About Immunocore**\n\nImmunocore is a commercial-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of a novel class of TCR bispecific immunotherapies called ImmTAX – Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against X disease – designed to treat a broad range of diseases, including cancer, autoimmune, and infectious disease.

KIMMTRAK continues to be the standard of care in most markets where it is launched. The Company sees three key growth areas for KIMMTRAK: continued expansion in mUM, the potential expansion into 2L+ advanced cutaneous melanoma and adjuvant uveal melanoma._\n\n**_Metastatic uveal melanoma_**\n\n  * KIMMTRAK net product sales were $80.2 million and $225.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, representing increases of 28% and 32% respectively, compared to the prior year periods.\n  * Growth in the US and Germany was driven by increased demand based on continued community penetration and growing duration of treatment.\n  * New baseline blood gene expression signature data was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2024 Meeting (ESMO 2024) confirming that T cell fitness in blood is an important parameter of clinical activity for KIMMTRAK in previously treated uveal melanoma. \n\n\n\n**_2L+ previously treated cutaneous melanoma_**\n\n  * Randomization continues in the registrational Phase 3 trial (TEBE-AM), which includes three arms – KIMMTRAK monotherapy, KIMMTRAK in combination with pembrolizumab, and control. The Company expects to complete randomization in the first half of 2026.\n  * The TEBE-AM Phase 3 trial in 2L+ cutaneous melanoma has a primary endpoint of overall survival.\n\n\n\n**_Adjuvant uveal (or ocular) melanoma_**\n\n  * Randomization in the ATOM Phase 3 trial, led by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), is on track to start in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * ATOM is currently the only active registrational Phase 3 trial in adjuvant uveal melanoma. \n\n\n\n**PRAME** _Brenetafusp (IMC-F106C) is the Company’s lead PRAME-A02 ImmTAC bispecific candidate. Brenetafusp is being evaluated in combination with nivolumab, in a Phase 3 registrational trial (PRISM-MEL-301) in patients with first-line advanced cutaneous melanoma and in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, as monotherapy and in combination, across multiple tumor types, including ovarian, non-small cell lung (NSCLC), and endometrial carcinoma._\n\n**_PRISM-MEL-301 – First PRAME Phase 3 clinical trial with brenetafusp in first-line advanced or metastatic HLA-A*02:01 positive cutaneous melanoma_**\n\n  * Ongoing randomization of patients in PRISM-MEL-301 in multiple countries.\n  * Trial is evaluating brenetafusp + nivolumab versus a control arm of either nivolumab or nivolumab + relatlimab.\n\n\n\n**_Phase 1/2 clinical trial of brenetafusp (PRAME-A02) in multiple solid tumors_**\n\n  * Clinical data presented at ESMO 2024 from the Phase 1 trial in patients with heavily pre-treated platinum-resistant high grade serous ovarian cancer showed signals of activity in heavily pretreated, platinum resistant patients. Disease control rate was 58% in monotherapy patients and 69% for combination patients. Overall survival (OS) was still maturing (73% 6-months OS rate in the monotherapy cohort). ctDNA molecular response rate was 31% and 82%, respectively, in the monotherapy and combination cohorts, associated with longer progression free survival and OS. Brenetafusp is well tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel and pegylated doxorubicin.\n  * Data presented at ESMO 2024 showed peripheral blood T cell fitness signature is an important parameter of brenetafusp clinical activity in ovarian cancer and uveal melanoma.\n  * The Company is currently evaluating brenetafusp in combination with non-platinum chemotherapies in platinum resistant ovarian cancer and with bevacizumab and with platinum chemotherapy in earlier lines of platinum sensitive ovarian cancer.\n  * The Company continues signal detection for brenetafusp in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer cohorts, including in combination with docetaxel and with osimertinib in earlier-line NSCLC. As a result, the Company will not release initial data in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n**_IMC-P115C (PRAME-A02 Half-Life Extended) & IMC-T119C (PRAME-A24)_**\n\n  * On track for first patient to be treated in the Phase 1 trial with IMC-P115C in first half of 2025. \n\n\n\n**Additional Oncology Candidates**\n\n**_IMC-R117C (first PIWIL1-A02 targeted immunotherapy) for colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers_** _The Company has leveraged its proprietary peptidomic database to validate a novel target, PIWIL1. PIWIL1 is a negative prognostic marker and is expressed across a range of tumors including colorectal, which is historically insensitive to immune checkpoints, as well as gastro-esophageal, and pancreatic cancer._\n\n  * Remain on track to treat the first patient in the Phase 1/2 trial of IMC-R117C in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n  * The Phase 1/2 trial will assess the safety and clinical activity of IMC-R117C, as a monotherapy and in combination with standards of care, in colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers. \n\n\n\n**ImmTAV candidates for a functional cure in infectious diseases** _The Company’s bispecific TCR technology platform has potential to offer a new approach for the treatment of chronic infections and aims to eliminate evidence of remaining virus in circulation after the patient stops taking medication - known as a \"functional cure\". Two investigational candidates are in Phase 1 clinical trials for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and people with chronic Hepatitis B infection (HBV)._\n\n**_Phase 1 trial of IMC-M113V (Gag-A02) for people living with HIV_**\n\n  * The objective of the clinical trial is to identify a safe and tolerable dose and evaluate whether IMC-M113V could lead to reduction in the viral reservoir and, after stopping antiretroviral therapies and IMC-M113V, delay or prevent HIV rebound.\n  * A biologically active dose in the multiple ascending dose (MAD) portion of the trial has been reached and the Company is enrolling more people living with HIV to characterize anti-viral activity and to explore higher doses with data expected in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**_Phase 1 trial of IMC-I109V (Envelope-A02) for people living with HBV_**\n\n  * Expect to complete the single ascending dose (SAD) portion of the trial in the fourth quarter of 2024. \n\n\n\n**Tissue-specific down modulation of the immune system for autoimmune diseases** _The Company is expanding its platform into autoimmune diseases with two new, first-in-class bispecific candidates recently entering its pipeline. The key differentiator of the Company’s ImmTAAI (Immune Modulating Monoclonal TCRs Against AutoImmune disease) platform is tissue-specific down modulation of the immune system whereby, when tethered to the tissue of interest, the new candidates suppress pathogenic T cells via PD1 receptor agonism._\n\n**_IMC-S118AI (pre-pro insulin A02 x PD1), intended for disease-modifying treatment in type 1 diabetes_**\n\n  * IMC-S118AI recognizes a peptide from pre-proinsulin presented by HLA-A02 on beta cells, coupled with a PD1 agonist effector arm. \n\n\n\n**_Undisclosed non-HLA restricted (universal) candidate for inflammatory dermatological diseases_**\n\n  * The candidate is an antigen presenting cell (APC) tethered ImmTAAI and is not HLA restricted (i.e. universal for all populations). \n\n\n\n**Corporate Updates**\n\nIn August, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Head of Strategy, Brian Di Donato, informed the Company of his plans to leave at the end of the year, to take the role of Chief Executive Officer at a private, early-stage biotech headquartered in San Diego, California. The Company is progressing in its search for a new CFO. Brian will remain as the Company’s CFO and Head of Strategy through the end of 2024, to ensure a smooth transition.\n\n**Financial Results** For the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company generated net product sales of $80.2 million compared to $62.6 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was due to revenue from KIMMTRAK, of which $57.3 million was in the United States, $21.0 million in Europe, and $1.9 million in international regions. The increase in net product sales was due primarily to increased volume in the United States and global country expansion, as the Company continued its commercialization efforts.\n\nFor the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, research and development (R&D) expenses were $52.8 million, compared to $43.2 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by expenses incurred for the tebentafusp programs, including the Phase 3 trials: TEBE-AM in previously treated advanced cutaneous melanoma and ATOM in adjuvant uveal melanoma.\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, SG&A expenses were $35.5 million, compared to $35.5 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per share was $0.17 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.02 for the same period in 2023. Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $8.7 million, as compared to $0.9 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at September 30, 2024 were $901.3 million. The Company plans to use existing cash to repay its $50 million loan by the end of 2024 and also expects to pay approximately $40 million in sales-related rebate accruals in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**About ImmTAC****®****molecules for cancer**\n\nImmunocore’s proprietary T cell receptor (TCR) technology generates a novel class of bispecific biologics called ImmTAC (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against Cancer) molecules that are designed to redirect the immune system to recognize and kill cancerous cells. ImmTAC molecules are soluble TCRs engineered to recognize intracellular cancer antigens with ultra-high affinity and selectively kill these cancer cells via an anti-CD3 immune-activating effector function. Based on the demonstrated mechanism of T cell infiltration into human tumors, the ImmTAC mechanism of action holds the potential to treat hematologic and solid tumors, regardless of mutational burden or immune infiltration, including immune “cold” low mutation rate tumors.\n\n**About ImmTAV****®****molecules and infectious diseases**\n\nImmTAV (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against Virus) molecules are novel bispecifics that are designed to enable the immune system to recognize and eliminate virally infected cells. Immunocore is advancing clinical candidates to achieve functional cure for patients with HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). The Company aims to achieve sustained control of HIV after patients stop anti-retroviral therapy (ART), without the risk of virological relapse or onward transmission. This is known as ‘functional cure’. For the treatment of HBV, the Company aims to achieve sustained loss of circulating viral antigens and markers of viral replication after stopping medication for people living with chronic HBV.\n\n**About ImmTAAI****TM****molecules and autoimmune diseases**\n\nImmTAAI (Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against AutoImmune disease) molecules are novel bispecifics that are designed for tissue-specific down modulation of the immune system. When tethered to the tissue of interest, ImmTAAI candidates suppress pathogenic T cells via PD1 receptor agonism. The Company is currently advancing two candidates for autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and inflammatory dermatological diseases.\n\n**About PRISM-MEL-301 (NCT06112314) – Phase 3 trial with brenetafusp (IMC-F106C, PRAME-A02) in 1L advanced cutaneous melanoma**\n\nThe Phase 3 registrational trial is randomizing HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with previously untreated advanced melanoma, to brenetafusp + nivolumab versus nivolumab or nivolumab + relatlimab, depending on the country where the patient is enrolled. The trial will initially randomize to three arms: two brenetafusp dose regimens (40 mcg and 160 mcg) and a control arm. One of the two brenetafusp dose regimens will be discontinued after an initial review of the first 60 patients randomized to the two experimental arms (90 patients randomized total). The primary endpoint of the trial is progression free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR), with secondary endpoints of overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR).\n\n**About the IMC-F106C-101 Phase 1/2 trial**\n\nIMC-F106C-101 is a first-in-human, Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial in patients with multiple solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), endometrial, ovarian, cutaneous melanoma, and breast cancers. The Phase 1 dose escalation trial was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), as well as to evaluate the safety, preliminary anti-tumor activity and pharmacokinetics of IMC-F106C (brenetafusp), a bispecific protein built on Immunocore’s ImmTAC technology, and the Company’s first molecule to target the PRAME antigen. The Company is enrolling patients into three expansion arms in NSCLC, as well as ovarian and endometrial carcinomas. The IMC-F106C-101 trial is adaptive and includes the option for Phase 2 expansion, allowing for approximately 100 patients treated per tumor type in the Phase 1 and 2 expansion arms. Dose escalation continues in additional solid tumors as well as plans for combination arms with standards-of-care, including checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, and tebentafusp.\n\n**About TEBE-AM – Phase 3 registrational trial with tebentafusp in previously treated advanced cutaneous melanoma**\n\nThe trial is randomizing patients with second-line or later advanced cutaneous melanoma who have progressed on an anti-PD1, received prior ipilimumab and, if applicable, received a BRAF kinase inhibitor. Patients are randomized to one of three arms, including tebentafusp – as monotherapy or in combination with an anti-PD1 – or a control arm. The primary endpoint is overall survival.\n\n**About the ATOM Phase 3 trial – Phase 3 registrational trial with tebentafusp in adjuvant uveal melanoma**\n\nThe EORTC-led Phase 3 clinical trial will include sites in 10 EU countries and the United States and will randomize HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with high-risk primary uveal melanoma after definitive treatment, by surgery or radiotherapy, and no evidence of metastatic disease on imaging. The trial is expected to enroll a total of 290 patients who will be randomized 1:1 to one of two arms: tebentafusp as monotherapy or observation. The primary endpoint of the trial is relapse-free survival (RFS), with secondary objectives of overall survival and safety and tolerability of tebentafusp. Exploratory objectives include comparison of health-related quality of life between the treatment arms and evaluation of the role of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker for the presence of residual disease.\n\n**About Uveal Melanoma**\n\nUveal melanoma is a rare and aggressive form of melanoma affecting the eye. Although it is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, the diagnosis is rare, and up to 50% of people with uveal melanoma will eventually develop metastatic disease. Unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma typically has a poor prognosis and had no approved treatment until KIMMTRAK.\n\n**About Cutaneous Melanoma**\n\nCutaneous melanoma (CM) is the most common form of melanoma. It is the most aggressive skin carcinoma and is associated with the vast majority of skin cancer-related mortality. The majority of patients with CM are diagnosed before metastasis but survival remains poor for the large proportion of patients with metastatic disease. Despite recent progress in advanced melanoma therapy, there is still an unmet need for new therapies that improve first-line response rates and duration of response as well as for patients who are refractory to first-line treatments.\n\n**About KIMMTRAK****®**\n\nKIMMTRAK is a novel bispecific protein comprised of a soluble T cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 immune-effector function. KIMMTRAK specifically targets gp100, a lineage antigen expressed in melanocytes and melanoma. This is the first molecule developed using Immunocore’s ImmTAC technology platform, designed to redirect and activate T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells. KIMMTRAK has been approved for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma in the United States, European Union, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\n**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**\n\n**Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), which may be serious or life-threatening, occurred in patients receiving KIMMTRAK. Monitor for at least 16 hours following first three infusions and then as clinically indicated.** Manifestations of CRS may include fever, hypotension, hypoxia, chills, nausea, vomiting, rash, elevated transaminases, fatigue, and headache. CRS occurred in 89% of patients who received KIMMTRAK, with 0.8% being grade 3 or 4. Ensure immediate access to medications and resuscitative equipment to manage CRS. Ensure patients are euvolemic prior to initiating the infusions. Closely monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS following infusions of KIMMTRAK. Monitor fluid status, vital signs, and oxygenation level and provide appropriate therapy. Withhold or discontinue KIMMTRAK depending on persistence and severity of CRS.\n\n**Skin Reactions**\n\nSkin reactions, including rash, pruritus, and cutaneous edema occurred in 91% of patients treated with KIMMTRAK. Monitor patients for skin reactions. If skin reactions occur, treat with antihistamine and topical or systemic steroids based on persistence and severity of symptoms. Withhold or permanently discontinue KIMMTRAK depending on the severity of skin reactions.\n\n**Elevated Liver Enzymes**\n\nElevations in liver enzymes occurred in 65% of patients treated with KIMMTRAK. Monitor alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total blood bilirubin prior to the start of and during treatment with KIMMTRAK. Withhold KIMMTRAK according to severity.\n\n**Embryo-Fetal Toxicity**\n\nKIMMTRAK may cause fetal harm. Advise pregnant patients of potential risk to the fetus and patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KIMMTRAK and 1 week after the last dose.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (≥30%) in patients who received KIMMTRAK were cytokine release syndrome, rash, pyrexia, pruritus, fatigue, nausea, chills, abdominal pain, edema, hypotension, dry skin, headache, and vomiting. The most common (≥50%) laboratory abnormalities were decreased lymphocyte count, increased creatinine, increased glucose, increased AST, increased ALT, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased phosphate.\n\nFor more information, please see full Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) or full U.S. Prescribing Information (including BOXED WARNING for CRS).\n\n**About KIMMTRAKConnect**\n\nImmunocore is committed to helping patients who need KIMMTRAK obtain access via our KIMMTRAKConnect program.
