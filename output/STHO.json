Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n**Note 1—Business and Organization**\n\nOn March 31, 2023, Star Holdings, a Maryland statutory trust (the \"Company,\" \"Star Holdings,\" \"we\" or \"us\") completed a series of reorganization and separation transactions (collectively, the “Spin-Off”) in accordance with the terms of a Separation and Distribution Agreement (the “Separation and Distribution Agreement”), dated as of March 31, 2023, by and between iStar Inc., a Maryland corporation (\"iStar\"), and Star Holdings. To effectuate the Spin-Off: (i) iStar contributed its remaining legacy non-ground lease assets, 13,522,651 shares of common stock of Safehold Inc. (the “Safe Shares”) and certain other assets (“iStar Included Assets”) to Star Holdings; and (ii) iStar distributed 100% of the common shares of beneficial interest in Star Holdings to holders of common stock of iStar (\"iStar Common Stock\") by way of a pro rata distribution of 0.153 common shares of Star Holdings for each outstanding share of iStar Common Stock held on the record date of the distribution. \n\nThe Spin-Off became effective at 12:02 a.m., Eastern Time, on March 31, 2023 (the “Spin-Off Effective Time”). Following the Spin-Off, Star Holdings became an independent, publicly traded company. Star Holdings' common shares commenced regular-way trading on the Nasdaq Global Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “STHO” on March 31, 2023. Shortly after the Spin-Off, iStar completed its previously-announced merger (the \"Merger\") with Safehold Inc., a Maryland corporation. iStar continued as the surviving corporation in the Merger and changed its name to “Safehold Inc.” (\"Safe\").\n\n​\n\nThe Company operates its business as one segment that focuses on realizing value for shareholders primarily by generating cash flows through active asset management and sales of its existing loans, operating properties and land and development properties. The Company’s short-term and long-term liquidity requirements include capital expenditures on its development projects, debt service, management fees and expense reimbursements payable to its Manager (refer to Note 7) and operating expenses, among others. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings on the incremental facility under the Safe Credit Facility (refer to Note 9) and unrestricted cash. The Company expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales.\n\n​\n\nThe combined and consolidated financial statements of the Company include loans and other lending investments, operating properties and land and development assets that represent the assets, liabilities and operations from the assets included in the Spin-Off. References to \"iStar\" in the notes to the Company's financial statements refer to iStar prior to the closing of the Merger and the Spin-Off.\n\n​\n\nNote 2—Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\n**Basis of Presentation** —The accompanying unaudited combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10-01 of Regulation S-X for interim financial statements. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements. These unaudited combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Information Statement.\n\nThe preparation of these combined and consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Such operating results may not be indicative of the expected results for any other interim periods or the entire year.\n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nThe combined and consolidated financial statements of the Company prior to the Spin-Off on March 31, 2023 represented a combination of entities under common control that have been “carved out” from iStar’s consolidated financial statements. Historically, financial statements of the Company have not been prepared as it was not operated separately from iStar. These combined and consolidated financial statements reflect the revenues and expenses of the Company and include certain assets and liabilities that were included in the Spin-Off, which have been reflected at iStar’s historical basis. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The combined and consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of the Company’s future performance and do not necessarily reflect what the financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been had the Company operated as a standalone company during the periods presented.\n\n​\n\nThese combined and consolidated financial statements include an allocation of general and administrative expenses and interest expense to the Company from iStar through the date of the Spin-Off. General and administrative expenses include certain iStar corporate functions, including executive oversight, treasury, finance, human resources, tax compliance and planning, internal audit, financial reporting, information technology and investor relations. General and administrative expenses, including stock-based compensation, represent a pro rata allocation of costs from iStar’s real estate finance, operating properties, land and development and corporate business segments based on the Company’s average net assets for those segments as a percentage of iStar’s average net assets for those segments. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was allocated to the Company by calculating the Company’s average net assets as a percentage of the average net assets in iStar’s segments and multiplying that percentage by the interest expense allocated to iStar’s segments. The Company believes the allocationmethodology for general and administrative expenses and interest expense is reasonable. Accordingly, the general and administrative expense and interest expense allocations presented in our combined and consolidated statements of operations for historical periods does not necessarily reflect what our general and administrative expenses and interest expense will be as a standalone public company. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company was allocated $14.1 million of general and administrative expense and $8.0 million of interest expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the general and administrative expense allocation includes $1.8 million of stock-based compensation. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, the Company has its own general and administrative expense and interest expense as a stand-alone public company.\n\n​\n\nPrior to the Spin-Off, certain of the entities included in the Company’s financial statements did not have bank accounts for the periods presented, and certain cash transactions for the Company were transacted through bank accounts owned by iStar. The combined and consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented were prepared as if operating, investing and financing transactions for the Company had been transacted through its own bank accounts.\n\n​\n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\n**Principles of Combination and Consolidation** —The combined and consolidated financial statements include on a carve-out basis the historical balance sheets and statements of operations and cash flows of assets, liabilities and operations included in the Spin-Off. For periods prior to March 31, 2023, the Company was allocated a number of shares of Safe common stock based on estimates driven by the total value of stock that iStar expected to contribute to the Company and the price per share of Safe common stock (refer to Note 7). Information for the periods subsequent to March 31, 2023 reflect the actual number of Safe Shares contributed to the Company.\n\nConsolidated VIEs—The Company consolidates VIEs for which it is considered the primary beneficiary. The liabilities of these VIEs are non-recourse to the Company and can only be satisfied from each VIE’s respective assets. The Company did not have any unfunded commitments related to consolidated VIEs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The following table presents the assets and liabilities of the Company’s consolidated VIEs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of**  \n​| **September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n**ASSETS**|  ​| ​| ​  \nReal estate| ​| ​| ​  \nReal estate, at cost| ​| $|  95,288| ​| $|  94,682  \nLess: accumulated depreciation| ​|  (23,705)| ​|  (21,349)  \nReal estate, net| ​|  71,583| ​|  73,333  \nLand and development, net| ​|  102,494| ​|  108,284  \nCash and cash equivalents| ​|  9,765| ​|  31,479  \nAccrued interest and operating lease income receivable, net| ​|  —| ​|  24  \nDeferred expenses and other assets, net| ​|  7,749| ​|  8,758  \nTotal assets| ​| $|  191,591| ​| $|  221,878  \n**LIABILITIES**|  ​| ​  \nTotal liabilities| ​| $|  34,563| ​| $|  23,600  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nNote 3—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies have not changed materially from those described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”). Please refer to the 2023 Annual Report for the Company’s significant accounting policies.\n\n​\n\nNew accounting pronouncements—In August 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-05, Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement (“ASU 2023-05”). ASU 2023-05 requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value and is effective for all joint venture entities with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. ASU 2023-05 is to be applied on a prospective basis, while retrospective application can be elected for joint ventures formed before the effective date. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2023-05 but does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 improves disclosures for reportable segments primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective on a retrospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2023-07 but does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction and certain other amendments to improve income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2023-09 but does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote 4—Real Estate\n\nThe Company’s real estate assets were comprised of the following ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of**  \n​| ​| **September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \nLand, at cost| ​| $|  5,570| ​| $|  5,570  \nBuildings and improvements, at cost| ​|  92,517| ​|  91,911  \nLess: accumulated depreciation| ​|  (24,565)| ​|  (22,075)  \nReal estate, net(1)| ​| $|  73,522| ​| $|  75,406  \n(1)| During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold residential condominiums with a carrying value of $1.7 million that were transferred from land and development to real estate available and held for sale.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Tenant Reimbursements—** The Company receives reimbursements from tenants for certain facility operating expenses including common area costs, insurance, utilities and real estate taxes. Tenant reimbursements were $0.4 million and $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Tenant reimbursements were $1.2 million and $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are included in “Operating lease income” in the Company’s combined and consolidated statements of operations.\n\n**Allowance for Doubtful Accounts—** As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for doubtful accounts related to real estate tenant receivables was $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. These amounts are included in “Accrued interest and operating lease income receivable, net” on the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheets.\n\n**Future Minimum Operating Lease Payments** —Future minimum operating lease payments to be collected under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding tenant reimbursements of expenses, in effect as of September 30, 2024, are as follows by year ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Year**|  ​| **Amount**  \n2024 (remaining three months)| ​| $|  1,105  \n2025| ​|  4,387  \n2026| ​|  4,276  \n2027| ​|  1,578  \n2028| ​|  242  \nThereafter| ​|  875  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nNote 5—Land and Development\n\nThe Company’s land and development assets were comprised of the following ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of**|  ​  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| **December 31,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \nLand and land development, at cost| ​| $|  180,540| ​| $|  193,360| ​  \nLess: accumulated depreciation| ​|  (12,604)| ​|  (11,966)| ​  \nTotal land and development, net| ​| $|  167,936| ​| $|  181,394| ​  \n  \n​\n\n**Dispositions—** During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company sold land parcels and residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of $6.1 million and $24.8 million, respectively, and land development cost of sales of $8.1 million and $17.8 million, respectively, from its land and development portfolio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company sold land parcels and residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of $38.5 million and $46.2 million, respectively, and land development cost of sales of $39.4 million and $40.1 million, respectively, from its land and development portfolio.\n\n​\n\nIn September 2023, the Company sold a land parcel to a third-party and provided the buyer with a loan to finance the acquisition. The buyer had the option to prepay the loan in full on or before a specified date, it would receive a discounted purchase price. At origination, the Company recorded the loan based on the discounted purchase price since collection of the discounted portion of the sale was undetermined. The buyer elected to not prepay the loan and receive the discounted purchase price and, as such, the Company recorded additional land development revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The loan to the buyer is included in “Loans receivable and other lending investments, net” on the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheets. \n\nIn December 2023, the Company transferred the ownership interests in a subsidiary land owner to a third-party venture (the “Venture”) for its development and construction of a multifamily project in Asbury Park, NJ (the “Project”). In connection with this transfer, the Company (i) provided the Venture with a $10.6 million mezzanine loan that was fully funded at closing and is secured by the ownership interests in the subsidiary land owner; and (ii) provided a completion and carry guaranty on the Venture’s $80.0 million senior construction mortgage loan (refer to Note 9) with a third-party lender in return for a fee. The Company is a non-member manager of the Venture and is entitled to certain fees, but otherwise has no expected member-related economics. Until the mezzanine loan is repaid and the guaranties are released, the Company controls all decision-making of the Venture. The Venture is responsible for the funding and performance of all development and construction activities and the Company is not obligated to provide any capital contributions to the Venture. At closing, the third-party members provided $21.0 million in cash capital contributions to the Venture, exclusive of a $3.0 million deferred profits interest, which combined represent the total equity capitalization.\n\n​\n\nThe Company determined that the Venture (and its consolidated subsidiaries developing the Project) is a VIE for which the Company is the primary beneficiary and thus consolidated it under ASC 810. As a result, for accounting purposes, the Project was recorded on the Company’s combined and consolidated financial statements and the mezzanine loan eliminates in consolidation. The $21.0 million in third-party cash capital contributions to the Venture represents noncontrolling interests in the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects this consolidation treatment to continue until the mezzanine loan is paid in full by the Venture and the Company’s senior loan guaranties are released by the lender. \n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nNote 6—Loans Receivable and Other Lending Investments, net\n\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s loans receivable and other lending investments by class ($ in thousands): (1) \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of**|  ​  \n​| **September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**|  ​  \n**Loans**|  ​| ​| ​  \nSenior mortgages| ​| $|  3,050| ​| $|  2,550| ​  \nSubordinate mortgages| ​|  15,009| ​|  14,266| ​  \nSubtotal - gross carrying value of loans| ​|  18,059| ​|  16,816| ​  \n**Other lending investments**|  ​| ​| ​  \nAvailable-for-sale debt securities| ​|  13,721| ​|  4,579| ​  \nSubtotal - other lending investments| ​|  13,721| ​|  4,579| ​  \n**Total gross carrying value of loans receivable and other lending investments**|  ​|  31,780| ​|  21,395| ​  \nAllowance for loan losses| ​|  (555)| ​|  (497)| ​  \n**Total loans receivable and other lending investments, net**|  ​| $|  31,225| ​| $|  20,898| ​  \n(1)| As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest was $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and is recorded in “Accrued interest and operating lease income receivable, net” on the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheets.

The provision in 2024 was due primarily to a principal addition to a loan originated in September 2023 (refer to Note 5). The provision in 2023 was due primarily to a $2.2 million provision on the sale of a loan held for sale, which was partially offset by a recovery due to the repayment of loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company’s investment in loans, all of which were collectively evaluated for impairment, and the associated allowance for loan losses were as follows as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n**As of September 30, 2024**|  ​  \nLoans| ​| $|  18,059  \nLess: Allowance for loan losses| ​|  (555)  \nTotal| ​| $|  17,504  \n**As of December 31, 2023**|  ​  \nLoans| ​| $|  16,816  \nLess: Allowance for loan losses| ​|  (497)  \nTotal| ​| $|  16,319  \n  \n​\n\n**Credit Characteristics** —As part of the Company’s process for monitoring the credit quality of its loans, it performs a quarterly loan portfolio assessment and assigns risk ratings to each of its performing loans. Risk ratings, which range from 1 (lower risk) to 5 (higher risk), are based on judgments which are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that actual performance will be similar to current expectation. The Company designates loans as non-performing at such time as: (1) interest payments become 90 days delinquent; (2) the loan has a maturity default; or (3) management determines it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. All non-performing loans are placed on non-accrual status and income is only recognized in certain cases upon actual cash receipt.\n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to

The Company does not have significant influence over Safe and accounts for its investment in Safe as an equity investment under ASC 321 – Investments – Equity Securities (“ASC 321”), which requires that the Company adjust its investment in Safe to fair value through income at each reporting period. As such, the Company recognized an “Unrealized gain (loss) on equity investment” of $93.8 million and ($80.2) million, respectively, in its combined and consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Prior to the Spin-Off, iStar accounted for its investment in Safe as an equity method investment under ASC 323 – Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (“ASC 323”) due to its ability to exercise significant influence. Pursuant to ASC 323-10-40-1, an equity method investor shall account for a share issuance by an investee as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment. Any gain or loss to the investor resulting from an investee’s share issuance shall be recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was allocated ownership of approximately 15.2 million shares of Safe common stock from iStar. The allocation was adjusted based upon the final terms of the Spin-Off on March 31, 2023, and the Company’s investment basis was reduced by approximately 1.8 million shares with a carrying value of approximately $65.6 million, which was adjusted against additional paid-in capital within equity.  \n---|---  \n(2)| For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded $29.3 million in earnings from equity method investments primarily from the sale of properties within its equity method investments.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Safehold Inc.** —Safe is a publicly-traded company that acquires, owns, manages, finances and capitalizes ground leases. Ground leases generally represent ownership of the land underlying commercial real estate projects that is net leased by the fee owner of the land to the owners/operators of the real estate projects built thereon (“Ground Leases”). As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned approximately 13.5 million shares, or 18.9%, of Safe’s outstanding common stock. The Company accounts for its investment in the Safe Shares as an equity investment due to the terms of the governance agreement described below.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company entered into the following agreements with Safe:\n\n_Separation and Distribution Agreement_ —The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the Spin-Off and provisions governing Star Holdings' relationship with Safe with respect to and following the Spin-Off. The Separation and Distribution Agreement includes provisions allocating assets and liabilities between Star Holdings and Safe and various post-closing covenants relating to, among other things, the treatment of the parties’ insurance policies, information sharing and other operational matters. The Separation and Distribution Agreement includes a mutual release by Star Holdings, on the one hand, and Safe, on the other hand, of the other party from certain specified liabilities, as well as mutual indemnification covenants pursuant to which Star Holdings and Safe have agreed to indemnify each other from certain specified liabilities.\n\n_Management Agreement_ —The Company entered into the Management Agreement with Safehold Management Services Inc. (the “Manager”), a subsidiary of Safe. The Management Agreement requires the Manager to manage the Company’s assets and its and its subsidiaries’ day-to-day operations, subject to the supervision of Board of Trustees of the Company (the “Board”). Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Manager is required to provide the Company with a management team, including a chief executive officer, a chief financial officer and a chief compliance officer, along with support personnel, to provide the management services to be provided by the Manager to the Company. The Manager does \n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nnot assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and is not responsible for any action of the Board in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations.\n\nThe Management Agreement has an annual term that automatically renews on March 31 of each year. The Company pays a fixed cash management fee and reimburses the Manager for third party expenses incurred in connection with its services. The Company paid the Manager management fees of $25.0 million for the term ended March 31, 2024. The annual fee declines to $15.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in each of the following annual terms, and adjusts to 2.0% of the gross book value of the Company’s assets, excluding the Safe Shares, thereafter. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $3.8 million and $6.3 million, respectively, of management fees to the Manager. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $13.8 million and $13.5 million, respectively, of management fees to the Manager.\n\nThe Management Agreement may be terminated by the Company without cause by not less than one hundred eighty days’ written notice to the Manager upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Company’s independent directors, provided, however, that if the date of termination occurs prior to the fourth anniversary of the Spin-Off, the termination will be subject to payment of the applicable termination fee to the Manager. The Company may also terminate the Management Agreement at any time, including during the initial term, with 30 days’ prior written notice from the Company’s board of trustees for “cause,” as defined in the Management Agreement.\n\n​\n\nIn the event of a termination without cause by the Company prior to the fourth anniversary of the Spin-Off, the Company will pay the Manager a termination fee of $50.0 million minus the aggregate amount of management fees actually paid to the Manager prior to the termination date. However, if the Company has completed the liquidation of its assets on or before the termination date, the termination fee will consist of any portion of the annual management fee that remained unpaid for the remainder of the then current annual term plus, if the termination date occurs on or before the third anniversary of the Spin-Off, the amount of the management fee that would have been payable for the next succeeding annual term, or if the termination date occurs after the third anniversary of the Spin-Off, zero.\n\nIn the event of a termination by the Manager based on a reduction in the amount of the Company’s combined and consolidated assets below designated thresholds, the Company will pay the Manager a termination fee of $30.0 million if the termination occurs in the first year, $15.0 million if the termination occurs in the second year and $5.0 million if the termination occurs in the third year, in each case, plus the balance of any unpaid portion of the annual management fee for the applicable year.\n\n​\n\n _Governance Agreement_ —The Company and Safe entered into a governance agreement (the “Governance Agreement”) in order to establish various arrangements and restrictions with respect to the governance of the Company and certain rights and restrictions with respect to the Safe Shares owned by the Company.\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from transferring at any time any Safe Shares held by the Company or its subsidiaries to any person who is known by the Company or its subsidiaries to be an “Activist” or “Company Competitor” (as such terms are defined in the Governance Agreement), or to any group that, to the knowledge of the Company or its subsidiaries, includes as “Activist” or “Company Competitor,” without first obtaining the Safe’s prior written consent.\n\nDuring a “restrictive period” which lasts until the earliest to occur of (i) the effective date on which Safe terminates the Management Agreement; or (ii) the date on which we beneficially own less than 7.5% of Safe’s outstanding common stock and Safe is no longer our external Manager; or (iii) a Change of Control of Safe (as defined in the Governance Agreement), we and our directly or indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries are required to vote the Safe Shares in accordance with the recommendations of the board of directors of Safe.

There are three main components of economic risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different points in time and potentially at different bases, than its interest-earning assets. Credit risk is the risk of default on the Company’s lending investments or leases that result from a borrower’s or tenant’s inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments. Market risk reflects changes in the value of loans and other lending investments due to changes in interest rates or other market factors, including the rate of prepayments of principal and the value of the collateral underlying loans, the valuation of real estate assets by the Company as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n​\n\n**Risk concentrations—** Concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of borrowers, tenants or investees related to the Company’s investments are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the Company, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.\n\n​\n\nAll of the Company’s real estate and assets collateralizing its loans receivable are located in the United States. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s portfolio contains concentrations in the following property types: entertainment/leisure, land and development, hotel, retail and the Safe Shares.\n\n​\n\nThe Company underwrites the credit of prospective borrowers and tenants and often requires them to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees, letters of credit and/or cash security deposits. Although the Company’s loans and real estate assets are geographically diverse and the borrowers and tenants operate in a \n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nvariety of industries, to the extent the Company has a significant concentration of interest or operating lease revenues from any single borrower or tenant, the inability of that borrower or tenant to make its payment could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, declines in the market price of Safe common stock could require the Company to post additional collateral or prepay some or all of the outstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan Facility.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote 12—Equity\n\n**Common Stock—** On March 31, 2023, in connection with the Spin-Off,  iStar distributed 100% of the common shares of beneficial interest in the Company to holders of common stock of iStar (\"iStar Common Stock\") by way of a pro rata distribution of 0.153 common shares of the Company for each outstanding share of iStar Common Stock held on the record date of the distribution.  As of September 30, 2024, the Company has one class of common stock with 13,319,552 shares outstanding.\n\n**Net Parent Investment—** The Company’s net parent investment represented net contributions from and distributions to iStar through the date of the Spin-Off. Certain of the entities included in the Company’s financial statements did not have bank accounts for the periods presented and most cash transactions for the Company were transacted through bank accounts owned by iStar and are included in the Company’s equity.\n\n**Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)** — “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” reflected in the Company’s shareholders’ equity is comprised of the Company’s share of unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of its equity method investments and unrealized gains or losses on the Company’s available-for-sale securities. The Company does not have any derivatives as of September 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote 13—Earnings Per Share\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of income from operations used in the basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) calculations ($ in thousands, except for per share data): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \nNet income (loss)| ​| $|  91,469| ​| $|  (81,758)| ​| $|  14,521| ​| $|  (262,432)| ​  \nNet (income) loss from operations attributable to noncontrolling interests| ​|  429| ​|  (56)| ​|  1,281| ​|  (58)| ​  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| ​| $|  91,898| ​| $|  (81,814)| ​| $|  15,802| ​| $|  (262,490)| ​  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the Three Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \n**Earnings allocable to common shares:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n _Numerator for basic and diluted earnings per share:_|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| ​| $|  91,898| ​| $|  (81,814)| ​| $|  15,802| ​| $|  (262,490)| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n _Denominator for basic and diluted earnings per share:_(1)| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per common share| ​|  13,320| ​|  13,320| ​|  13,320| ​|  13,320| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Basic and diluted earnings per common share:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| ​| $|  6.90| ​| $|  (6.14)| ​| $|  1.19| ​| $|  (19.71)| ​  \n(1)| For periods presented prior to the Spin-Off, the weighted average shares outstanding for the EPS calculation assumes the pro rata distribution of 0.153 common shares of the Company’s common stock for each outstanding share of iStar Common Stock on the record date of the distribution were issued and outstanding.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote 14—Fair Values\n\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to be used in valuation techniques to measure fair value:\n\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;\n\nLevel 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and\n\nLevel 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).\n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nCertain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value either on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Assets required to be marked-to-market and reported at fair value every reporting period are classified as being valued on a recurring basis. Assets not required to be recorded at fair value every period may be recorded at fair value if a specific provision or other impairment is recorded within the period to mark the carrying value of the asset to market as of the reporting date. Such assets are classified as being valued on a non-recurring basis.\n\nThe following fair value hierarchy table summarizes the Company’s assets recorded at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis by the above categories as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 ($ in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Fair Value Using**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Quoted**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **market**|  ​| **Significant**|  ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **prices in**|  ​| **other**|  ​| **Significant**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **active**|  ​| **observable**|  ​| **unobservable**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **markets**|  ​| **inputs**|  ​| **inputs**  \n​| **Total**|  **(Level 1)**|  **(Level 2)**|  **(Level 3)**  \n**As of September 30, 2024**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nRecurring basis:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAvailable-for-sale debt securities(1)| ​| $|  13,721| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  13,721  \nOther investments (refer to Note 7)| ​| ​|  354,699| ​| ​|  354,699| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**As of December 31, 2023**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNon-recurring basis:| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAvailable-for-sale debt securities(1)| ​| $|  4,579| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  4,579  \nOther investments (refer to Note 7)| ​|  316,430| ​|  316,430| ​|  —| ​|  —  \n(1)| The fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities are based upon unadjusted third-party broker quotes and are classified as Level 3.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table summarizes changes in Level 3 available-for-sale securities reported at fair value on the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \nBeginning balance| ​| $|  4,579  \nPurchases| ​| ​|  8,950  \nUnrealized gain (loss) recorded in other comprehensive income (loss)| ​|  192  \nEnding balance| ​| $|  13,721  \n  \n​\n\n**Fair values of financial instruments—** The following table presents the carrying value and fair value for the Company’s financial instruments ($ in millions): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **As of September 30, 2024**|  ​| **As of December 31, 2023**  \n​| ​| **Carrying**|  ​| **Fair** | ​| **Carrying**|  ​| **Fair**  \n​| **Value**| **Value**| **Value**| **Value**  \n**Assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nLoans receivable and other lending investments, net(1)| ​| $|  31| ​| $|  29| ​| $|  21| ​| $|  17  \nCash and cash equivalents(2)| ​|  45| ​|  45| ​|  51| ​|  51  \nRestricted cash(2)| ​|  9| ​|  9| ​|  10| ​|  10  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Liabilities**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDebt obligations, net(1)| ​| ​|  201| ​| ​|  206| ​| ​|  193| ​| ​|  193  \n(1)| The fair value of the Company’s loans receivable and other lending investments, net and debt obligations are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  \n---|---  \n(2)| The Company determined the carrying values of its cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximated their fair values.

These historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. \n\nOur Development Portfolio\n\n​\n\n _Asbury Park Waterfront_\n\n​\n\nWe are the managing member in Asbury Partners, LLC, which is the joint venture that owns the Asbury Park Waterfront investment. The aggregate carrying value of the Asbury Park Waterfront investment was approximately $132.6 million as of September 30, 2024. \n\nThe Asbury Park Waterfront investment includes the following:\n\n●| Asbury Ocean Club Surfside Resort and Residences: a 16-story mixed use project featuring 130 residential condominium units, a 54-key luxury boutique hotel, 24,000 square feet of retail space, 410 structured parking spaces and a 15,000 square foot gym and spa amenity area. The property was completed in 2019. The hotel is managed by a third party. As of September 30, 2024, all residential condominium units have been sold.  \n---|---  \n●| The Asbury: a 110-key independent boutique hotel with indoor and outdoor event spaces, and a rooftop bar. The hotel was completed in 2016 and is managed by a third party.  \n---|---  \n●| Asbury Lanes: a 12,000 square foot music and entertainment venue. The venue was completed in 2018, is connected to The Asbury and managed by a third party.  \n---|---  \n  \nOur current strategy for the Asbury Park Waterfront investment is to actively asset manage our operating assets, and strategically monetize the remaining development sites and our operating assets through sales to third party developers and operators while meeting our obligations under the redevelopment agreement with the city of Asbury Park. \n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n _Magnolia Green_\n\n​\n\nMagnolia Green is an approximately 1,900 acre multi-generational master planned residential community that is entitled for 3,550 single and multifamily dwelling units and approximately 193 acres of land for commercial development. The community is located 19 miles southwest of Richmond, Virginia and offers distinct phases designed for people in different life stages, from first home buyers to empty nesters in single family and townhomes built by the area’s top homebuilders. The project is anchored by the Magnolia Green Golf Club, a semi-private 18-hole Nicklaus Design championship golf course with full-service clubhouse and driving range. There are also numerous community amenities, including the Aquatic Center, featuring multiple pools and a snack bar, Arbor Walk, featuring a junior Olympic competition pool, water slide and sports courts, the Tennis Center, featuring tennis and pickleball courts and a pro shop, and miles of paved trails. The aggregate carrying value of our Magnolia Green assets as of September 30, 2024 was $43.9 million.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, 2,108 residential lots have been sold to homebuilders. We anticipate selling our remaining residential lots to homebuilders either upon completion of horizontal lot development or in bulk as unimproved lots over the next two years and it could take substantially longer. We anticipate selling the golf course operations to a third party upon completion of residential lot sellout. There can be no assurance, however, that these sales will be completed.\n\n**Our Monetizing Portfolio**\n\n​\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we owned assets that we expect to monetize primarily through asset sales, loan repayments or active asset management. These assets included in our portfolio as of September 30, 2024 had an aggregate carrying value of approximately $96.1 million and were comprised primarily of loans, operating properties, land and other assets. Summarized information regarding these assets is set forth below.\n\nLoans and other lending investments _._ The loans and other lending investments included in our monetizing portfolio as of September 30, 2024 include two loans with an aggregate carrying value of $17.5 million and six available-for-sale debt securities with an aggregate carrying value of $13.7 million. \n\n​\n\nLand _._ The land assets included in our portfolio as of September 30, 2024 include two assets with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $23.2 million. Our general strategy is to seek to sell the land assets to third party developers. In addition, another land asset at Asbury Park with a carrying value of $38.4 million is held by a venture to which we have provided a loan and certain credit support (refer to Note 5 to the combined and consolidated financial statements).\n\n​\n\nOther _._ The remainder of the monetizing assets primarily consist of two short term leases that we have subleased to third parties, which had an aggregate carrying value of $3.3 million as of September 30, 2024, and a group of loans and equity interests that are recorded as having no carrying value in our financial statements. Our general strategy is to seek to sell the leased assets, although we may hold one or both leases until they expire. For the assets with no carrying value, we may seek to sell these assets but can give no assurance that we will recover any value from them.\n\n​\n\nInvestment in Safe. In addition to the assets described above, we also own the Safe Shares which had a fair value of $354.7 million based on the closing price of $26.23 as of September 30, 2024. \n\n​\n\nOur Margin Loan Facility is collateralized by 12.9 million Safe Shares as of September 30, 2024. The net proceeds from the sale of any Safe Shares must be applied in accordance with the terms of the Margin Loan Facility. \n\n​\n\nIn the second half of 2023, we took certain steps intended to address declines that had occurred in the market value of the Safe Shares. We paid down the outstanding balance of the Margin Loan Facility which has a principal balance of $87.4 million as of September 30, 2024. We also entered into amendments to the Margin Loan Facility and the Safe Credit Facility to, among other things, reduce the floor price of the Safe Shares that would trigger a \n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nmandatory prepayment in full of the Margin Loan Facility and enable us to access incremental borrowings under the Safe Credit Facility to replenish funds used to voluntarily prepay the Margin Loan Facility. Future declines in the market value of the Safe Shares could require us to make additional prepayments of some or all of the outstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan Facility. Accessing incremental borrowings under the Safe Credit Facility will increase our interest expense because the interest rate on all borrowings increases to 10.0% per annum while incremental borrowings remain outstanding.\n\n​\n\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended **September 30, 2024** compared to the Three Months Ended **September 30, 2023**\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the Three Months Ended**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **September 30,**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **$ Change**|  ​  \n​| ​| **(in thousands)**|  ​  \nOperating lease income| ​| $|  1,632| ​| $|  1,866| ​| $|  (234)| ​  \nInterest income| ​|  548| ​|  244| ​|  304| ​  \nOther income| ​|  16,224| ​|  16,625| ​|  (401)| ​  \nLand development revenue| ​|  6,146| ​|  24,836| ​|  (18,690)| ​  \nTotal revenue| ​|  24,550| ​|  43,571| ​|  (19,021)| ​  \nInterest expense| ​|  1,827| ​|  2,297| ​|  (470)| ​  \nInterest expense - related party| ​| ​|  2,181| ​| ​|  2,100| ​| ​|  81| ​  \nReal estate expense| ​|  12,932| ​|  14,006| ​|  (1,074)| ​  \nLand development cost of sales| ​|  8,093| ​|  17,761| ​|  (9,668)| ​  \nDepreciation and amortization| ​|  986| ​|  1,125| ​|  (139)| ​  \nGeneral and administrative| ​|  4,563| ​|  7,310| ​|  (2,747)| ​  \nProvision for (recovery of) loan losses| ​|  43| ​|  95| ​|  (52)| ​  \nOther expense| ​|  2| ​|  181| ​|  (179)| ​  \nTotal costs and expenses| ​|  30,627| ​|  44,875| ​|  (14,248)| ​  \nUnrealized loss on equity investment| ​| ​|  93,847| ​| ​|  (80,189)| ​| ​|  174,036| ​  \nIncome from sales of real estate| ​|  3,699| ​|  —| ​|  3,699| ​  \nLoss on early extinguishment of debt| ​| ​|  —| ​|  (482)| ​|  482| ​  \nEarnings from equity method investments| ​|  —| ​|  217| ​|  (217)| ​  \nNet income (loss)| ​| $|  91,469| ​| $|  (81,758)| ​| $|  173,227| ​  \n  \n​\n\nRevenue—Operating lease income, which primarily includes income from commercial operating properties, decreased to $1.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $1.9 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in insurance recoveries at one of our properties.\n\nInterest income increased to $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $0.2 million for the same period in 2023. Our interest income is earned on our loans and available-for-sale securities.\n\n​\n\nOther income decreased to $16.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $16.6 million for the same period in 2023. Other income consists primarily of dividend income from our investment in Safe and income from our hotel properties and other operating properties, including Asbury Lanes and the Magnolia Green Golf Club. \n\nLand development revenue and cost of sales—During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold residential lots at our Magnolia Green property and recognized land development revenue of $6.1 million which had associated cost of sales of $8.1 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we sold residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of $24.8 million which had associated cost of sales of $17.8 million. The decrease in 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in bulk sales at our Asbury Park property, which was partially offset by an increase in sales at our Magnolia Green property. As we execute future sales and have fewer remaining residential and development assets, we expect our land development revenue will decline. The timing and amount of such sales cannot be predicted with certainty.\n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nCosts and expenses—For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $1.8 million of interest expense on our Margin Loan Facility, net of amounts capitalized. We elected to pay interest in kind (\"PIK\") on the Margin Loan Facility in respect of the $1.9 million interest payment payable for the third quarter of 2024. That amount was added to the principal balance of the loan. The applicable margin on the Margin Loan Facility increases by 25 basis points for the entirety of the interest period immediately succeeding any interest period with respect to which we make a PIK election. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred $2.3 million of interest expense on our Margin Loan Facility, net of amounts capitalized. The decrease in expense in 2024 was the result of repayments on our Margin Loan Facility.\n\nInterest expense - related party represents the interest cost on our Safe Credit Facility, net of amounts capitalized.\n\nReal estate expense was $12.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $14.0 million for the same period in 2023. Real estate expense primarily represents expenses at our hotel and retail operating properties and land properties. The decrease in 2024 was due primarily to a decrease in expenses at our Asbury Park properties.\n\nDepreciation and amortization was $1.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $1.1 million for the same period in 2023. \n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $4.6 million of general and administrative expense, primarily resulting from management fees to Safe and director fees. The annual management fee payable to our Manager under the Management Agreement declined from $25.0 million to $15.0 million for the second annual term of the Management Agreement which began on March 31, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred $7.3 million of general and administrative expense, primarily resulting from management fees to Safe and director fees. \n\nThe provision for loan losses was $43 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a provision for loan losses of $0.1 million for the same period in 2023. The provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from a declining economic forecast. The provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from the origination of a new loan during the quarter.\n\nOther expense was $2 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $0.2 million for the same period in 2023. \n\nUnrealized gain (loss) on equity investment represents the unrealized loss on our Safe Shares. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, we account for our Safe Shares as an equity investment under ASC 321, which requires that we adjust our investment in the Safe Shares to fair value through income at each reporting period. The unrealized gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 represents the difference between the fair value of our investment in the Safe Shares as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. The unrealized loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 represents the difference between the fair value of our investment in the Safe Shares as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold residential condominiums and recognized income from sales of real estate of $3.7 million.\n\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt, net—During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt from the repayment of our Margin Loan Facility (refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n​\n\nEarnings from equity method investments—Earnings from equity method investments was $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which represented our aggregate income from our land and operating property ventures.\n\n​\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nResults of Operations for the Nine Months Ended **September 30, 2024** compared to the Nine Months Ended **September 30, 2023**\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **$ Change**|  ​  \n​| ​| **(in thousands)**|  ​  \nOperating lease income| ​| $|  5,214| ​| $|  5,177| ​| $|  37| ​  \nInterest income| ​|  1,378| ​|  1,755| ​|  (377)| ​  \nOther income| ​|  35,482| ​|  32,686| ​|  2,796| ​  \nLand development revenue| ​|  38,462| ​|  46,219| ​|  (7,757)| ​  \nTotal revenue| ​|  80,536| ​|  85,837| ​|  (5,301)| ​  \nInterest expense| ​|  5,260| ​|  15,005| ​|  (9,745)| ​  \nInterest expense - related party| ​| ​|  6,377| ​|  4,200| ​|  2,177| ​  \nReal estate expense| ​|  36,886| ​|  35,995| ​|  891| ​  \nLand development cost of sales| ​|  39,446| ​|  40,093| ​|  (647)| ​  \nDepreciation and amortization| ​|  3,347| ​|  3,295| ​|  52| ​  \nGeneral and administrative| ​|  16,544| ​|  28,960| ​|  (12,416)| ​  \nProvision for loan losses| ​|  58| ​|  1,727| ​|  (1,669)| ​  \nOther expense| ​|  63| ​|  783| ​|  (720)| ​  \nTotal costs and expenses| ​|  107,981| ​|  130,058| ​|  (22,077)| ​  \nUnrealized and realized gains (losses) on equity investments| ​| ​|  38,269| ​|  (247,121)| ​|  285,390| ​  \nIncome from sales of real estate| ​|  3,699| ​|  —| ​|  3,699| ​  \nLoss on early extinguishment of debt, net| ​|  —| ​|  (1,523)| ​|  1,523| ​  \nEarnings from equity method investments| ​|  —| ​|  30,433| ​|  (30,433)| ​  \nIncome tax expense| ​|  (2)| ​|  —| ​|  (2)| ​  \nNet income (loss)| ​| $|  14,521| ​| $|  (262,432)| ​| $|  276,953| ​  \n  \n​\n\nRevenue—During both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. operating lease income, which primarily includes income from commercial operating properties, was $5.2 million. \n\nInterest income decreased to $1.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $1.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest income was due primarily to a decrease in the average balance of our performing loans and other lending investments due to the repayment of loans.\n\n​\n\nOther income increased to $35.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $32.7 million for the same period in 2023. Other income consists primarily of dividend income from our investment in Safe and income from our hotel properties and other operating properties, including Asbury Lanes and the Magnolia Green Golf Club. The increase was due primarily to an additional $2.4 million of dividend income from Safe for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nLand development revenue and cost of sales—During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had bulk sales and sold residential lots and recognized land development revenue of $38.5 million which had associated cost of sales of $39.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of $46.2 million which had associated cost of sales of $40.1 million. The decrease in land development revenue in 2024 was due primarily to an decrease in revenues from bulk sales and condominium sales at our Asbury properties, which was partially offset by a bulk sale at our Coney Island property and an increase in lot sales at our Magnolia Green property. As we execute future sales and have fewer remaining residential and development assets, we expect our land development revenue will decline. The timing and amount of such sales cannot be predicted with certainty.\n\nCosts and expenses—Prior to the Spin-Off, interest expense represented an allocation to us from iStar. Interest expense was allocated to us by calculating our average net assets by property type as a percentage of the average net assets of iStar's segments and multiplying that percentage by the interest expense allocated to each of iStar's segments (refer to Note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). Subsequent to the Spin-Off, interest expense \n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nrepresents the interest cost on our Margin Loan Facility. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred $5.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively, of interest expense on our Margin Loan Facility, net of amounts capitalized. We elected to pay PIK interest on the Margin Loan Facility in respect of the interest payments payable for each of the first, second and third quarters of 2024 (refer to Note 9 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). These amounts were added to the principal balance of the loan. The applicable margin on the Margin Loan Facility increases by 25 basis points for the entirety of the interest period immediately succeeding any interest period with respect to which we make a PIK election. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we were also allocated $8.0 million of interest expense and interest expense also included amounts payable to iStar.\n\nInterest expense - related party represents the interest cost on our Safe Credit Facility, net of amounts capitalized.\n\nReal estate expense was $36.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $36.0 million for the same period in 2023. Real estate expense primarily represents expenses at our hotel and retail operating properties and land properties. The slight increase in 2024 was due primarily to an increase in expenses at our Asbury Park and Coney Island properties.\n\nDepreciation and amortization was $3.3 million during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. \n\nPrior to the Spin-Off, general and administrative expense represented an allocation of costs, including performance-based compensation, to us from iStar. General and administrative expenses, including stock-based compensation, represented a pro rata allocation of costs from iStar's real estate finance, operating properties, land and development and corporate business segments based on our average net assets for those property types as a percentage of iStar's average net assets for those segments (refer to Note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). Subsequent to the Spin-Off, general and administrative expense includes management fees to our Manager and other costs of operating as a public company. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred $16.5 million of general and administrative expense, primarily resulting from $13.8 million of management fees to Safe and director fees. The annual management fee payable to our Manager under the Management Agreement declined from $25.0 million to $15.0 million for the second annual term of the Management Agreement which began on March 31, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred $29.0 million of general and administrative expense, primarily resulting from management fees to Safe, audit and legal fees and $14.1 million allocated from iStar. \n\nThe provision for loan losses was $58 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a provision for loan losses of $1.7 million for the same period in 2023. The provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from the addition to a loan during the year (refer to Note 5 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). The provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted primarily from the sale of a non-performing loan, which was partially offset by a reversal of Expected Loss allowances on loans that repaid in full in during 2023. \n\nOther expense was $0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and $0.8 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in 2024 was due primarily to professional fees incurred in 2023 in connection with the Spin-Off.\n\nUnrealized gain (loss) on equity investment represents the unrealized gain or loss on our Safe Shares. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, we account for our Safe Shares as an equity investment under ASC 321, which requires that we adjust our investment in the Safe Shares to fair value through income at each reporting period. The unrealized gain for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 represents the difference between the fair value of our investment in the Safe Shares as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The unrealized loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 represents the difference between the fair value of our investment in the Safe Shares as of September 30, 2023 and iStar’s historical carrying amount of the Safe Shares at the time of the Spin-Off.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold residential condominiums and recognized income from sales of real estate of $3.7 million.\n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt, net—During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt from the repayment of our Margin Loan Facility (refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n​\n\nEarnings from equity method investments—Earnings from equity method investments was $30.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized $1.1 million of income from our historical equity method investment in Safe and $29.3 million of net aggregate income from our remaining equity method investments due to asset sales at the ventures. \n\n​\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including to pay interest and repay borrowings, develop our assets and maintain our operations, make distributions to our shareholders and meet other general business needs. We were formed in 2023 and we have not paid any dividends. We do not expect to pay regular dividends. We intend to make distributions of available cash from time to time, primarily dependent upon our ability to sell assets and the prices at which we sell our assets.\n\nOur sources of cash will be largely dependent on asset sales, which are difficult to predict in terms of timing and amount. While we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations, such as prepayments on the Margin Loan Facility resulting from declines in the market value of the Safe Shares. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. Our primary sources of liquidity will generally consist of our cash on hand and proceeds from asset sales.\n\nWe expect our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements to include:\n\n●| capital expenditures on our Asbury Park Waterfront and Magnolia Green development projects;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| debt service on the Safe Credit Facility and the Margin Loan Facility (refer to Note 9 to the combined and consolidated financial statements), and any other indebtedness including any repurchase agreements;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| management fees and expense reimbursements payable to our Manager (refer to Note 7 to the combined and consolidated financial statements);  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| operating expenses; and  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| distributions to shareholders if we have any excess cash on hand from asset sales after the repayment of our debt obligations.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings on the incremental facility under the Safe Credit Facility and our unrestricted cash. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales.\n\nOur future cash sources will be largely dependent on proceeds from asset sales. The amount and timing of asset sales, including the sale of Safe Shares, could be adversely affected by a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including the macroeconomic factors discussed below. We cannot predict with certainty the specific transactions we will undertake to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they come due. We will adjust our plans as appropriate in response to changes in our expectations and changes in market conditions. The uncertainty related to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rate increases, market volatility, disruptions in the banking sector and the availability of financing, and the effects of these factors on the economy generally and on the commercial real estate markets in which we operate, make it impossible for us to predict or to quantify the impact of these or other trends on our financial results or liquidity.\n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe following table outlines our cash flows used in operating activities, cash flows provided by investing activities and cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 ($ in thousands): \n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \nCash flows used in operating activities| ​| $|  (24,423)| ​| $|  (12,975)| ​  \nCash flows provided by investing activities| ​| ​|  16,465| ​| ​|  145,881| ​  \nCash flows provided by (used in) financing activities| ​| ​|  1,783| ​| ​|  (89,164)| ​  \n  \n​\n\nThe increase in cash flows used in operating activities during 2024 was due primarily to a decrease in distributions from other investments. The decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities during 2024 was due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from the repayment and sale of loans receivable and a decrease in distributions from other investments. Cash flows provided by financing activities during 2024 represents borrowings from a construction loan and cash flows used in financing activities during 2023 was due primarily to distributions to iStar in 2023 prior to the Spin-Off, which was partially offset by net borrowings from debt obligations in 2023.\n\n​\n\n**Debt Covenants** —The Margin Loan Facility requires that we comply with various covenants, including, without limitation, covenants restricting, subject to certain exceptions, indebtedness, liens, investments and the payment of dividends. Additionally, the Margin Loan Facility includes customary representations and warranties, events of default and other creditor protections for this type of facility. Upon the occurrence of certain events which are customary for this type of facility, we may be required to prepay all amounts due under the Margin Loan Facility or post additional collateral in accordance with the Margin Loan Facility and related agreements. In October 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Margin Loan Facility primarily to reduce the floor price at which the market price of the Safe Shares would trigger a mandatory prepayment of outstanding borrowings under the facility.\n\n​\n\nThe Safe Credit Facility requires that we comply with various covenants, including, without limitation, covenants restricting, subject to certain exceptions, indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, asset sales and the payment of certain dividends. Additionally, the Safe Credit Facility includes customary representations and warranties as well as customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable grace period, would permit Safe to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of ours under the Safe Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on the collateral securing the Safe Credit Facility. In October 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Safe Credit Facility primarily to enable us to access the $25.0 million incremental facility to replenish funds that we use to make voluntary prepayments under the Margin Loan Facility. \n\nA subsidiary of ours provided a completion and carry guaranty on the Loan (refer to Note 9 to the combined and consolidated financial statements) and is required to maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum liquidity amount both prior to and after the completion of the Project while the Loan is outstanding.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well controlled, reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. We base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and, therefore, routinely require adjustment.\n\nFor a discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to Note 3 to the combined and consolidated financial statements of our 2023 Annual Report.\n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nMarket Risks \n\nMarket risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, commodity prices and equity prices. In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Our operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets will affect our floating liabilities. Any significant increase in interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that our profitability will not be materially adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates.\n\nIn the event of a significant rising interest rate environment or economic downturn, defaults could increase and cause us to incur additional credit losses which would adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. Such delinquencies or defaults would likely have a material adverse effect on the spreads between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, an increase in interest rates could, among other things, reduce the value of our fixed-rate interest-bearing assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets.\n\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. We monitor the spreads between our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and may implement hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations, including engaging in interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and other interest rate-related derivative contracts. Such strategies are designed to reduce our exposure, on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis, to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes or as a hedge against changes in our credit risk or the credit risk of our borrowers.\n\nThe following table quantifies the potential changes in annual net income, assuming no change in our interest earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, should interest rates decrease or increase by 10, 50 or 100 basis points, assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve (i.e., relative interest rates). Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table.\n\nEstimated Change In Net Income\n\n($ in thousands) \n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Change in Interest Rates**|  ​| **Net Income**(1)  \n-100 Basis Points| ​| $|  329  \n-50 Basis Points| ​|  164  \n-10 Basis Points| ​| ​|  33  \nBase Interest Rate| ​|  —  \n+10 Basis Points| ​|  (33)  \n+50 Basis Points| ​|  (164)  \n+100 Basis Points| ​|  (329)  \n(1)| As of September 30, 2024, we had $87.4 million principal amount of floating-rate debt obligations outstanding and $54.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company has formed a disclosure committee \n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nthat is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining the disclosure obligations of the Company on a timely basis. The disclosure committee reports directly to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the disclosure committee and other members of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\n\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this quarterly report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company’s periodic reports.\n\n​\n\n35\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nPART II.

Statements\n\n(unaudited)\n\n**Note 1—Business and Organization**\n\nOn March 31, 2023, Star Holdings, a Maryland statutory trust (the \"Company,\" \"Star Holdings,\" \"we\" or \"us\") completed a series of reorganization and separation transactions (collectively, the “Spin-Off”) in accordance with the terms of a Separation and Distribution Agreement (the “Separation and Distribution Agreement”), dated as of March 31, 2023, by and between iStar Inc., a Maryland corporation (\"iStar\"), and Star Holdings. To effectuate the Spin-Off: (i) iStar contributed its remaining legacy non-ground lease assets, 13,522,651 shares of common stock of Safehold Inc. (the “Safe Shares”) and certain other assets (“iStar Included Assets”) to Star Holdings; and (ii) iStar distributed 100% of the common shares of beneficial interest in Star Holdings to holders of common stock of iStar (\"iStar Common Stock\") by way of a pro rata distribution of 0.153 common shares of Star Holdings for each outstanding share of iStar Common Stock held on the record date of the distribution. \n\nThe Spin-Off became effective at 12:02 a.m., Eastern Time, on March 31, 2023 (the “Spin-Off Effective Time”). Following the Spin-Off, Star Holdings became an independent, publicly traded company. Star Holdings' common shares commenced regular-way trading on the Nasdaq Global Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “STHO” on March 31, 2023. Shortly after the Spin-Off, iStar completed its previously-announced merger (the \"Merger\") with Safehold Inc., a Maryland corporation. iStar continued as the surviving corporation in the Merger and changed its name to “Safehold Inc.” (\"Safe\").\n\n​\n\nThe Company operates its business as one segment that focuses on realizing value for shareholders primarily by generating cash flows through active asset management and sales of its existing loans, operating properties and land and development properties. The Company’s short-term and long-term liquidity requirements include capital expenditures on its development projects, debt service, management fees and expense reimbursements payable to its Manager (refer to Note 7) and operating expenses, among others. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings on the incremental facility under the Safe Credit Facility (refer to Note 9) and unrestricted cash. The Company expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales.\n\n​\n\nThe combined and consolidated financial statements of the Company include loans and other lending investments, operating properties and land and development assets that represent the assets, liabilities and operations from the assets included in the Spin-Off. References to \"iStar\" in the notes to the Company's financial statements refer to iStar prior to the closing of the Merger and the Spin-Off.\n\n​\n\nNote 2—Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\n**Basis of Presentation** —The accompanying unaudited combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10-01 of Regulation S-X for interim financial statements. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements. These unaudited combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Information Statement.\n\nThe preparation of these combined and consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Such operating results may not be indicative of the expected results for any other interim periods or the entire year.\n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nThe combined and consolidated financial statements of the Company prior to the Spin-off on March 31, 2023 represented a combination of entities under common control that have been “carved out” from iStar’s consolidated financial statements. Historically, financial statements of the Company have not been prepared as it was not operated separately from iStar. These combined and consolidated financial statements reflect the revenues and expenses of the Company and include certain assets and liabilities that were included in the Spin-Off, which have been reflected at iStar’s historical basis. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The combined and consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of the Company’s future performance and do not necessarily reflect what the financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been had the Company operated as a standalone company during the periods presented.\n\n​\n\nThese combined and consolidated financial statements include an allocation of general and administrative expenses and interest expense to the Company from iStar through the date of the Spin-Off. General and administrative expenses include certain iStar corporate functions, including executive oversight, treasury, finance, human resources, tax compliance and planning, internal audit, financial reporting, information technology and investor relations. General and administrative expenses, including stock-based compensation, represent a pro rata allocation of costs from iStar’s real estate finance, operating properties, land and development and corporate business segments based on the Company’s average net assets for those segments as a percentage of iStar’s average net assets for those segments. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was allocated to the Company by calculating the Company’s average net assets as a percentage of the average net assets in iStar’s segments and multiplying that percentage by the interest expense allocated to iStar’s segments. The Company believes the allocationmethodology for general and administrative expenses and interest expense is reasonable. Accordingly, the general and administrative expense and interest expense allocations presented in our combined and consolidated statements of operations for historical periods does not necessarily reflect what our general and administrative expenses and interest expense will be as a standalone public company. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company was allocated $14.1 million of general and administrative expense and $8.0 million of interest expense. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the general and administrative expense allocation includes $1.8 million of stock-based compensation. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, the Company has its own general and administrative expense and interest expense as a stand-alone public company.\n\n​\n\nPrior to the Spin-Off, certain of the entities included in the Company’s financial statements did not have bank accounts for the periods presented, and certain cash transactions for the Company were transacted through bank accounts owned by iStar. The combined and consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented were prepared as if operating, investing and financing transactions for the Company had been transacted through its own bank accounts.\n\n​\n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\n**Principles of Combination and Consolidation** —The combined and consolidated financial statements include on a carve-out basis the historical balance sheets and statements of operations and cash flows of assets, liabilities and operations included in the Spin-Off. For periods prior to March 31, 2023, the Company was allocated a number of shares of Safe common stock based on estimates driven by the total value of stock that iStar expected to contribute to the Company and the price per share of Safe common stock (refer to Note 7). Information for the periods subsequent to March 31, 2023 reflect the actual number of Safe Shares contributed to the Company.\n\nConsolidated VIEs—The Company consolidates VIEs for which it is considered the primary beneficiary. The liabilities of these VIEs are non-recourse to the Company and can only be satisfied from each VIE’s respective assets. The Company did not have any unfunded commitments related to consolidated VIEs as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The following table presents the assets and liabilities of the Company’s consolidated VIEs as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of**  \n​| **June 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n**ASSETS**|  ​| ​| ​  \nReal estate| ​| ​| ​  \nReal estate, at cost| ​| $|  95,108| ​| $|  94,682  \nLess: accumulated depreciation| ​|  (23,045)| ​|  (21,349)  \nReal estate, net| ​|  72,063| ​|  73,333  \nReal estate available and held for sale| ​| ​|  1,746| ​| ​|  —  \nTotal real estate| ​| ​|  73,809| ​| ​|  73,333  \nLand and development, net| ​|  89,096| ​|  108,284  \nCash and cash equivalents| ​|  15,797| ​|  31,479  \nAccrued interest and operating lease income receivable, net| ​|  —| ​|  24  \nDeferred expenses and other assets, net| ​|  7,158| ​|  8,758  \nTotal assets| ​| $|  185,860| ​| $|  221,878  \n**LIABILITIES**|  ​| ​  \nTotal liabilities| ​| $|  31,007| ​| $|  23,600  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nNote 3—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies have not changed materially from those described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”). Please refer to the 2023 Annual Report for the Company’s significant accounting policies.\n\n​\n\nNew accounting pronouncements—In August 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-05, Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement (“ASU 2023-05”). ASU 2023-05 requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value and is effective for all joint venture entities with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. ASU 2023-05 is to be applied on a prospective basis, while retrospective application can be elected for joint ventures formed before the effective date. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2023-05 but does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 improves disclosures for reportable segments primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective on a retrospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2023-07 but does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction and certain other amendments to improve income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2023-09 but does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote 4—Real Estate\n\nThe Company’s real estate assets were comprised of the following ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of**  \n​| ​| **June 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \nLand, at cost| ​| $|  5,570| ​| $|  5,570  \nBuildings and improvements, at cost| ​|  92,337| ​|  91,911  \nLess: accumulated depreciation| ​|  (23,863)| ​|  (22,075)  \nReal estate, net| ​| ​|  74,044| ​| ​|  75,406  \nReal estate available and held for sale (1)| ​|  1,746| ​|  —  \nTotal real estate| ​| $|  75,790| ​| $|  75,406  \n(1)| During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company transferred $1.7 million of residential condominiums from land and development to real estate available and held for sale. The condominiums were sold in July 2024.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Tenant Reimbursements—** The Company receives reimbursements from tenants for certain facility operating expenses including common area costs, insurance, utilities and real estate taxes. Tenant reimbursements were $0.4 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Tenant reimbursements were $0.8 million and $0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are included in “Operating lease income” in the Company’s combined and consolidated statements of operations.\n\n**Allowance for Doubtful Accounts—** As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for doubtful accounts related to real estate tenant receivables was $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. These amounts are included in “Accrued interest and operating lease income receivable, net” on the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheets.\n\n**Future Minimum Operating Lease Payments** —Future minimum operating lease payments to be collected under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding tenant reimbursements of expenses, in effect as of June 30, 2024, are as follows by year ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Year**|  ​| **Amount**  \n2024 (remaining six months)| ​| $|  2,169  \n2025| ​|  4,310  \n2026| ​|  4,225  \n2027| ​|  1,578  \n2028| ​|  242  \nThereafter| ​|  875  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nNote 5—Land and Development\n\nThe Company’s land and development assets were comprised of the following ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of**|  ​  \n​| ​| **June 30,**|  ​| **December 31,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \nLand and land development, at cost| ​| $|  173,221| ​| $|  193,360| ​  \nLess: accumulated depreciation| ​|  (12,392)| ​|  (11,966)| ​  \nTotal land and development, net| ​| $|  160,829| ​| $|  181,394| ​  \n  \n​\n\n**Dispositions—** During the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company sold land parcels and residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of $15.7 million and $11.8 million, respectively, and land development cost of sales of $19.0 million and $12.4 million, respectively, from its land and development portfolio. During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company sold land parcels and residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of $32.3 million and $21.4 million, respectively, and land development cost of sales of $31.4 million and $22.3 million, respectively, from its land and development portfolio.\n\n​\n\nIn September 2023, the Company sold a land parcel to a third-party and provided the buyer with a loan to finance the acquisition. The buyer had the option to prepay the loan in full on or before a specified date, it would receive a discounted purchase price. At origination, the Company recorded the loan based on the discounted purchase price since collection of the discounted portion of the sale was undetermined. The buyer elected to not prepay the loan and receive the discounted purchase price and, as such, the Company recorded additional land development revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2024. The loan to the buyer is included in “Loans receivable and other lending investments, net” on the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheets. \n\nIn December 2023, the Company transferred the ownership interests in a subsidiary land owner to a third-party venture (the “Venture”) for its development and construction of a multifamily project in Asbury Park, NJ (the “Project”). In connection with this transfer, the Company (i) provided the Venture with a $10.6 million mezzanine loan that was fully funded at closing and is secured by the ownership interests in the subsidiary land owner; and (ii) provided a completion and carry guaranty on the Venture’s $80.0 million senior construction mortgage loan (refer to Note 9) with a third-party lender in return for a fee. The Company is a non-member manager of the Venture and is entitled to certain fees, but otherwise has no expected member-related economics. Until the mezzanine loan is repaid and the guaranties are released, the Company controls all decision-making of the Venture. The Venture is responsible for the funding and performance of all development and construction activities and the Company is not obligated to provide any capital contributions to the Venture. At closing, the third-party members provided $21.0 million in cash capital contributions to the Venture, exclusive of a $3.0 million deferred profits interest, which combined represent the total equity capitalization.\n\n​\n\nThe Company determined that the Venture (and its consolidated subsidiaries developing the Project) is a VIE for which the Company is the primary beneficiary and thus consolidated it under ASC 810. As a result, for accounting purposes, the Project will be recorded on the Company’s combined and consolidated financial statements and the mezzanine loan will eliminate in consolidation. The $21.0 million in third-party cash capital contributions to the Venture represents noncontrolling interests in the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects this consolidation treatment to continue until the mezzanine loan is paid in full by the Venture and the Company’s senior loan guaranties are released by the lender. \n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nNote 6—Loans Receivable and Other Lending Investments, net\n\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s loans receivable and other lending investments by class ($ in thousands): (1) \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of**|  ​  \n​| **June 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**|  ​  \n**Loans**|  ​| ​| ​  \nSenior mortgages| ​| $|  3,050| ​| $|  2,550| ​  \nSubordinate mortgages| ​|  14,757| ​|  14,266| ​  \nSubtotal - gross carrying value of loans| ​|  17,807| ​|  16,816| ​  \n**Other lending investments**|  ​| ​| ​  \nAvailable-for-sale debt securities| ​|  13,386| ​|  4,579| ​  \nSubtotal - other lending investments| ​|  13,386| ​|  4,579| ​  \n**Total gross carrying value of loans receivable and other lending investments**|  ​|  31,193| ​|  21,395| ​  \nAllowance for loan losses| ​|  (512)| ​|  (497)| ​  \n**Total loans receivable and other lending investments, net**|  ​| $|  30,681| ​| $|  20,898| ​  \n(1)| As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest was $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and is recorded in “Accrued interest and operating lease income receivable, net” on the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheets.

The provision in 2023 was due primarily to a $2.2 million provision on the sale of a loan held for sale, which was partially offset by a recovery due to the repayment of loans during the six months ended June 30, 2023.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company’s investment in loans, all of which were collectively evaluated for impairment, and the associated allowance for loan losses were as follows as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n**As of June 30, 2024**|  ​  \nLoans| ​| $|  17,807  \nLess: Allowance for loan losses| ​|  (512)  \nTotal| ​| $|  17,295  \n**As of December 31, 2023**|  ​  \nLoans| ​| $|  16,816  \nLess: Allowance for loan losses| ​|  (497)  \nTotal| ​| $|  16,319  \n  \n​\n\n**Credit Characteristics** —As part of the Company’s process for monitoring the credit quality of its loans, it performs a quarterly loan portfolio assessment and assigns risk ratings to each of its performing loans. Risk ratings, which range from 1 (lower risk) to 5 (higher risk), are based on judgments which are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that actual performance will be similar to current expectation. The Company designates loans as non-performing at such time as: (1) interest payments become 90 days delinquent; (2) the loan has a maturity default; or (3) management determines it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. All non-performing loans are placed on non-accrual status and income is only recognized in certain cases upon actual cash receipt.\n\n13\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to

The Company does not have significant influence over Safe and accounts for its investment in Safe as an equity investment under ASC 321 – Investments – Equity Securities (“ASC 321”), which requires that the Company adjust its investment in Safe to fair value through income at each reporting period. As such, the Company recognized an “Unrealized loss on equity investment” of $17.7 million and $76.3 million, respectively, in its combined and consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recognized an “Unrealized loss on equity investment” of $55.6 million and $166.9 million, respectively, in its combined and consolidated statements of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Prior to the Spin-Off, iStar accounted for its investment in Safe as an equity method investment under ASC 323 – Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (“ASC 323”) due to its ability to exercise significant influence. Pursuant to ASC 323-10-40-1, an equity method investor shall account for a share issuance by an investee as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment. Any gain or loss to the investor resulting from an investee’s share issuance shall be recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was allocated ownership of approximately 15.2 million shares of Safe common stock from iStar. The allocation was adjusted based upon the final terms of the Spin-Off on March 31, 2023, and the Company’s investment basis was reduced by approximately 1.8 million shares with a carrying value of approximately $65.6 million, which was adjusted against additional paid-in capital within equity.  \n---|---  \n(2)| For the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded $29.1 million in earnings from equity method investments primarily from the sale of properties within its equity method investments.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Safehold Inc.** —Safe is a publicly-traded company that acquires, owns, manages, finances and capitalizes ground leases. Ground leases generally represent ownership of the land underlying commercial real estate projects that is net leased by the fee owner of the land to the owners/operators of the real estate projects built thereon (“Ground Leases”). As of June 30, 2024, the Company owned approximately 13.5 million shares, or 18.9%, of Safe’s outstanding common stock. The Company accounts for its investment in the Safe Shares as an equity investment due to the terms of the governance agreement described below.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company entered into the following agreements with Safe:\n\n_Separation and Distribution Agreement_ —The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the Spin-Off and provisions governing Star Holdings' relationship with Safe with respect to and following the Spin-Off. The Separation and Distribution Agreement includes provisions allocating assets and liabilities between Star Holdings and Safe and various post-closing covenants relating to, among other things, the treatment of the parties’ insurance policies, information sharing and other operational matters. The Separation and Distribution Agreement includes a mutual release by Star Holdings, on the one hand, and Safe, on the other hand, of the other party from certain specified liabilities, as well as mutual indemnification covenants pursuant to which Star Holdings and Safe have agreed to indemnify each other from certain specified liabilities.\n\n_Management Agreement_ —The Company entered into the Management Agreement with Safehold Management Services Inc. (the “Manager”), a subsidiary of Safe. The Management Agreement requires the Manager to manage the Company’s assets and its and its subsidiaries’ day-to-day operations, subject to the supervision of Board of Trustees of the Company (the “Board”). Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Manager is required to provide the Company with a management team, including a chief executive officer, a chief financial officer and a chief compliance officer, along with support personnel, to provide the management services to be provided by the Manager to the Company. The Manager does \n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nnot assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and is not responsible for any action of the Board in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations.\n\nThe Management Agreement has an annual term that automatically renews on March 31 of each year. The Company pays a fixed cash management fee and reimburses the Manager for third party expenses incurred in connection with its services. The Company paid the Manager management fees of $25.0 million for the term ended March 31, 2024. The annual fee declines to $15.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in each of the following annual terms, and adjusts to 2.0% of the gross book value of the Company’s assets, excluding the Safe Shares, thereafter. During the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $3.8 million and $7.2 million, respectively, of management fees to the Manager. During the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $10.0 million and $7.2 million, respectively, of management fees to the Manager.\n\nThe Management Agreement may be terminated by the Company without cause by not less than one hundred eighty days’ written notice to the Manager upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Company’s independent directors, provided, however, that if the date of termination occurs prior to the fourth anniversary of the Spin-Off, the termination will be subject to payment of the applicable termination fee to the Manager. The Company may also terminate the Management Agreement at any time, including during the initial term, with 30 days’ prior written notice from the Company’s board of trustees for “cause,” as defined in the Management Agreement.\n\n​\n\nIn the event of a termination without cause by the Company prior to the fourth anniversary of the Spin-Off, the Company will pay the Manager a termination fee of $50.0 million minus the aggregate amount of management fees actually paid to the Manager prior to the termination date. However, if the Company has completed the liquidation of its assets on or before the termination date, the termination fee will consist of any portion of the annual management fee that remained unpaid for the remainder of the then current annual term plus, if the termination date occurs on or before the third anniversary of the Spin-Off, the amount of the management fee that would have been payable for the next succeeding annual term, or if the termination date occurs after the third anniversary of the Spin-Off, zero.\n\nIn the event of a termination by the Manager based on a reduction in the amount of the Company’s combined and consolidated assets below designated thresholds, the Company will pay the Manager a termination fee of $30.0 million if the termination occurs in the first year, $15.0 million if the termination occurs in the second year and $5.0 million if the termination occurs in the third year, in each case, plus the balance of any unpaid portion of the annual management fee for the applicable year.\n\n​\n\n _Governance Agreement_ —The Company and Safe entered into a governance agreement (the “Governance Agreement”) in order to establish various arrangements and restrictions with respect to the governance of the Company and certain rights and restrictions with respect to the Safe Shares owned by the Company.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Governance Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary restrictions on the transfer of Safe Shares held by the Company. Furthermore, the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from transferring at any time any the Safe Shares held by the Company or its subsidiaries to any person who is known by the Company or its subsidiaries to be an “Activist” or “Company Competitor” (as such terms are defined in the Governance Agreement), or to any group that, to the knowledge of the Company or its subsidiaries, includes as “Activist” or “Company Competitor,” without first obtaining the Safe’s prior written consent.\n\nDuring a “restrictive period” which lasts until the earliest to occur of (i) the effective date on which Safe terminates the Management Agreement; or (ii) the date on which we beneficially own less than 7.5% of Safe’s outstanding common stock and Safe is no longer our external Manager; or (iii) a Change of Control of Safe (as defined in the Governance Agreement), we and our directly or indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries are required to vote the Safe Shares in accordance with the recommendations of the board of directors of Safe.

There are three main components of economic risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different points in time and potentially at different bases, than its interest-earning assets. Credit risk is the risk of default on the Company’s lending investments or leases that result from a borrower’s or tenant’s inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments. Market risk reflects changes in the value of loans and other lending investments due to changes in interest rates or other market factors, including the rate of prepayments of principal and the value of the collateral underlying loans, the valuation of real estate assets by the Company as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n​\n\n**Risk concentrations—** Concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of borrowers, tenants or investees related to the Company’s investments are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the Company, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.\n\n​\n\nAll of the Company’s real estate and assets collateralizing its loans receivable are located in the United States. As of June 30, 2024, the Company’s portfolio contains concentrations in the following property types: entertainment/leisure, land and development, hotel, condominium and retail and the Safe Shares.\n\n​\n\nThe Company underwrites the credit of prospective borrowers and tenants and often requires them to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees, letters of credit and/or cash security deposits. Although the Company’s loans and real estate assets are geographically diverse and the borrowers and tenants operate in a \n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\nvariety of industries, to the extent the Company has a significant concentration of interest or operating lease revenues from any single borrower or tenant, the inability of that borrower or tenant to make its payment could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, declines in the market price of Safe common stock could require the Company to post additional collateral or prepay some or all of the outstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan Facility.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote 12—Equity\n\n**Common Stock—** On March 31, 2023, in connection with the Spin-Off,  iStar distributed 100% of the common shares of beneficial interest in the Company to holders of common stock of iStar (\"iStar Common Stock\") by way of a pro rata distribution of 0.153 common shares of the Company for each outstanding share of iStar Common Stock held on the record date of the distribution.  As of June 30, 2024, the Company has one class of common stock with 13,319,552 shares outstanding.\n\n**Net Parent Investment—** The Company’s net parent investment represented net contributions from and distributions to iStar through the date of the Spin-Off. Certain of the entities included in the Company’s financial statements did not have bank accounts for the periods presented and most cash transactions for the Company were transacted through bank accounts owned by iStar and are included in the Company’s equity.\n\n**Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)** — “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” reflected in the Company’s shareholders’ equity is comprised of the Company’s share of unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of its equity method investments and unrealized gains or losses on the Company’s available-for-sale securities. The Company does not have any derivatives as of June 30, 2024.\n\n​\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Star Holdings**\n\n**Notes to Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**\n\n**(unaudited)**\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote 13—Earnings Per Share\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of income from operations used in the basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) calculations ($ in thousands, except for per share data):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the Three Months Ended June 30,**|  ​| **For the Six Months Ended June 30,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \nNet income (loss)| ​| $|  (27,952)| ​| $|  (89,934)| ​| $|  (76,948)| ​| $|  (180,674)| ​  \nNet (income) loss from operations attributable to noncontrolling interests| ​|  837| ​|  (27)| ​|  852| ​|  (2)| ​  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| ​| $|  (27,115)| ​| $|  (89,961)| ​| $|  (76,096)| ​| $|  (180,676)| ​  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the Three Months Ended June 30,**|  ​| **For the Six Months Ended June 30,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \n**Earnings allocable to common shares:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n _Numerator for basic and diluted earnings per share:_|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| ​| $|  (27,115)| ​| $|  (89,961)| ​| $|  (76,096)| ​| $|  (180,676)| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n _Denominator for basic and diluted earnings per share:_(1)| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per common share| ​|  13,320| ​|  13,320| ​|  13,320| ​|  13,320| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Basic and diluted earnings per common share:**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet income (loss) allocable to common shareholders| ​| $|  (2.04)| ​| $|  (6.75)| ​| $|  (5.71)| ​| $|  (13.56)| ​  \n(1)| For periods presented prior to the Spin-Off, the weighted average shares outstanding for the EPS calculation assumes the pro rata distribution of 0.153 common shares of the Company’s common stock for each outstanding share of iStar Common Stock on the record date of the distribution were issued and outstanding.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote 14—Fair Values\n\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to be used in valuation techniques to measure fair value:\n\nLevel 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;\n\nLevel 2: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and\n\nLevel 3: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).\n\nCertain of the Company’s assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value either on a recurring or non-recurring basis. Assets required to be marked-to-market and reported at fair value every reporting period are classified as being valued on a recurring basis. Assets not required to be recorded at fair value every period may be recorded at fair value if a specific provision or other impairment is recorded within the period to mark the carrying value of the asset to market as of the reporting date.

These historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. \n\nOur Development Portfolio\n\n​\n\n _Asbury Park Waterfront_\n\n​\n\nWe are the managing member in Asbury Partners, LLC, which is the joint venture that owns the Asbury Park Waterfront investment. The aggregate carrying value of the Asbury Park Waterfront investment was approximately $132.5 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\nThe Asbury Park Waterfront investment includes the following:\n\n●| Asbury Ocean Club Surfside Resort and Residences: a 16-story mixed use project featuring 130 residential condominium units, a 54-key luxury boutique hotel, 24,000 square feet of retail space, 410 structured parking spaces and a 15,000 square foot gym and spa amenity area. The property was completed in 2019. The hotel is managed by a third party. As of June 30, 2024, two residential condominium units remain unsold.  \n---|---  \n●| The Asbury: a 110-key independent boutique hotel with indoor and outdoor event spaces, and a rooftop bar. The hotel was completed in 2016 and is managed by a third party.  \n---|---  \n●| Asbury Lanes: a 12,000 square foot music and entertainment venue. The venue was completed in 2018, is connected to The Asbury and managed by a third party.  \n---|---  \n  \nOur current strategy for the Asbury Park Waterfront investment is to sell the remaining residential condominium units at Asbury Ocean Club, actively asset manage our operating assets, and strategically monetize the remaining development sites and our operating assets through sales to third party developers and operators while meeting our obligations under the redevelopment agreement with the city of Asbury Park. \n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n _Magnolia Green_\n\n​\n\nMagnolia Green is an approximately 1,900 acre multi-generational master planned residential community that is entitled for 3,550 single and multifamily dwelling units and approximately 193 acres of land for commercial development. The community is located 19 miles southwest of Richmond, Virginia and offers distinct phases designed for people in different life stages, from first home buyers to empty nesters in single family and townhomes built by the area’s top homebuilders. The project is anchored by the Magnolia Green Golf Club, a semi-private 18-hole Nicklaus Design championship golf course with full-service clubhouse and driving range. There are also numerous community amenities, including the Aquatic Center, featuring multiple pools and a snack bar, Arbor Walk, featuring a junior Olympic competition pool, water slide and sports courts, the Tennis Center, featuring tennis and pickleball courts and a pro shop, and miles of paved trails. The aggregate carrying value of our Magnolia Green assets as of June 30, 2024 was $50.2 million.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, 2,077 residential lots have been sold to homebuilders. We anticipate selling our remaining residential lots to homebuilders either upon completion of horizontal lot development or in bulk as unimproved lots over the next two years and it could take substantially longer. We anticipate selling the golf course operations to a third party upon completion of residential lot sellout. There can be no assurance, however, that these sales will be completed.\n\n**Our Monetizing Portfolio**\n\n​\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, we owned assets that we expect to monetize primarily through asset sales, loan repayments or active asset management. These assets included in our portfolio as of June 30, 2024 had an aggregate carrying value of approximately $84.6 million and were comprised primarily of loans, operating properties, land and other assets. Summarized information regarding these assets is set forth below.\n\nLoans and other lending investments _._ The loans and other lending investments included in our monetizing portfolio as of June 30, 2024 include two loans with an aggregate carrying value of $17.3 million and six available-for-sale debt securities with an aggregate carrying value of $13.4 million. \n\n​\n\nLand _._ The land assets included in our portfolio as of June 30, 2024 include two assets with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $23.3 million. Our general strategy is to seek to sell the land assets to third party developers. In addition, we have another land asset related to a venture at Asbury Park with a carrying value of $27.3 million (refer to Note 5 to the combined and consolidated financial statements).\n\n​\n\nOther _._ The remainder of the monetizing assets primarily consist of two short term leases that we have subleased to third parties, which had an aggregate carrying value of $3.4 million as of June 30, 2024, and a group of loans and equity interests that are recorded as having no carrying value in our financial statements. Our general strategy is to seek to sell the leased assets, although we may hold one or both leases until they expire. For the assets with no carrying value, we may seek to sell these assets but can give no assurance that we will recover any value from them.\n\n​\n\nInvestment in Safe. In addition to the assets described above, we also own the Safe Shares which had a fair value of $260.9 million based on the closing price of $19.29 as of June 28, 2024. \n\n​\n\nThe Safe Shares collateralize our Margin Loan Facility and the net proceeds from the sale of any Safe Shares must be applied first to repay the Margin Loan Facility. \n\n​\n\nIn the second half of 2023, we took certain steps intended to address declines in the market value of the Safe Shares. We paid down the outstanding balance of the Margin Loan Facility which has a principal balance of $85.5 million as of June 30, 2024. We also entered into amendments to the Margin Loan Facility and the Safe Credit Facility to, among other things, reduce the floor price of the Safe Shares that would trigger a mandatory prepayment in full of the Margin Loan Facility and enable us to access incremental borrowings under the Safe Credit Facility to replenish funds used to voluntarily prepay the Margin Loan Facility. Further declines in the market value of the Safe \n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nShares could require us to make additional prepayments of some or all of the outstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan Facility. Accessing incremental borrowings under the Safe Credit Facility will increase our interest expense because the interest rate on all borrowings increases to 10.0% per annum while incremental borrowings remain outstanding.\n\n​\n\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended **June 30, 2024** compared to the Three Months Ended **June 30, 2023**\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the Three Months Ended**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **June 30,**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **$ Change**|  ​  \n​| ​| **(in thousands)**|  ​  \nOperating lease income| ​| $|  1,701| ​| $|  1,610| ​| $|  91| ​  \nInterest income| ​|  442| ​|  397| ​|  45| ​  \nOther income| ​|  12,707| ​|  11,655| ​|  1,052| ​  \nLand development revenue| ​|  15,701| ​|  11,818| ​|  3,883| ​  \nTotal revenue| ​|  30,551| ​|  25,480| ​|  5,071| ​  \nInterest expense| ​|  1,725| ​|  2,609| ​|  (884)| ​  \nInterest expense - related party| ​| ​|  2,108| ​| ​|  2,100| ​| ​|  8| ​  \nReal estate expense| ​|  12,178| ​|  12,395| ​|  (217)| ​  \nLand development cost of sales| ​|  19,007| ​|  12,356| ​|  6,651| ​  \nDepreciation and amortization| ​|  1,178| ​|  1,090| ​|  88| ​  \nGeneral and administrative| ​|  4,586| ​|  7,552| ​|  (2,966)| ​  \nProvision for (recovery of) loan losses| ​|  (2)| ​|  (69)| ​|  67| ​  \nOther expense| ​|  8| ​|  315| ​|  (307)| ​  \nTotal costs and expenses| ​|  40,788| ​|  38,348| ​|  2,440| ​  \nUnrealized loss on equity investment| ​| ​|  (17,715)| ​| ​|  (76,268)| ​| ​|  58,553| ​  \nLoss on early extinguishment of debt| ​| ​|  —| ​|  (1,040)| ​|  1,040| ​  \nEarnings from equity method investments| ​|  —| ​|  242| ​|  (242)| ​  \nNet income (loss)| ​| $|  (27,952)| ​| $|  (89,934)| ​| $|  61,982| ​  \n  \n​\n\nRevenue—Operating lease income, which primarily includes income from commercial operating properties, increased to $1.7 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 from $1.6 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in percentage rent at certain of our properties.\n\nInterest income was $0.4 million for both the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Our interest income is earned on our loans and available-for-sale securities.\n\n​\n\nOther income increased to $12.7 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 from $11.7 million for the same period in 2023. Other income consists primarily of dividend income from our investment in Safe and income from our hotel properties and other operating properties, including Asbury Lanes and the Magnolia Green Golf Club. The increase was due primarily to an increase in revenues at our operating properties.\n\nLand development revenue and cost of sales—During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we had a bulk sale at our Coney Island property and sold residential lots at our Magnolia Green property and recognized land development revenue of $15.7 million which had associated cost of sales of $19.0 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we sold residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of $11.8 million which had associated cost of sales of $12.4 million. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to the bulk sale at our Coney Island property, which was partially offset by a decrease in condominium sales at our Asbury Park property. As we execute future sales and have fewer remaining residential and development assets, we expect our land development revenue will decline. The timing and amount of such sales cannot be predicted with certainty.\n\nCosts and expenses—For the three months ended June 30, 2024, we incurred $1.7 million of interest expense on our Margin Loan Facility, net of amounts capitalized. We elected to pay interest in kind (\"PIK\") on the Margin Loan Facility in respect of the $1.8 million interest payment payable for the second quarter of 2024. That amount was added to \n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nthe principal balance of the loan. The applicable margin on the Margin Loan Facility increases by 25 basis points for the entirety of the interest period immediately succeeding any interest period with respect to which we make a PIK election. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, we incurred $2.5 million of interest expense on our Margin Loan Facility, net of amounts capitalized.\n\nInterest expense - related party represents the interest cost on our Safe Credit Facility, net of amounts capitalized.\n\nReal estate expense was $12.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $12.4 million for the same period in 2023. Real estate expense primarily represents expenses at our hotel and retail operating properties and land properties. The decrease in 2024 was due primarily to a decrease in expenses at our Asbury Park and Magnolia Green properties.\n\nDepreciation and amortization was $1.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $1.1 million for the same period in 2023. \n\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, we incurred $4.6 million of general and administrative expense, primarily resulting from management fees to Safe and director fees. The annual management fee payable to our Manager under the Management Agreement declined from $25.0 million to $15.0 million for the second annual term of the Management Agreement which began on March 31, 2024. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we incurred $7.6 million of general and administrative expense, primarily resulting from management fees to Safe and director fees. \n\nThe recovery of loan losses was $2 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to a recovery of loan losses of $0.1 million for the same period in 2023. The recovery of loan losses for the three months ended June 30, 2024 resulted primarily from an improving economic forecast. The recovery of loan losses for the three months ended June 30, 2023 resulted primarily from the repayment of a loan during the quarter.\n\nOther expense was $8 thousand during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $0.3 million for the same period in 2023. \n\nUnrealized gain (loss) on equity investment represents the unrealized loss on our Safe Shares. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, we account for our Safe Shares as an equity investment under ASC 321, which requires that we adjust our investment in the Safe Shares to fair value through income at each reporting period. The unrealized loss for the three months ended June 30, 2024 represents the difference between the fair value of our investment in the Safe Shares as of June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024. The unrealized loss for the three months ended June 30, 2023 represents the difference between the fair value of our investment in the Safe Shares as of June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023.\n\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt, net—During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt from the repayment of our Margin Loan Facility (refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n​\n\nEarnings from equity method investments—Earnings from equity method investments was $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized $0.2 million of net aggregate income from our land and operating property ventures.\n\n​\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nResults of Operations for the Six Months Ended **June 30, 2024** compared to the Six Months Ended **June 30, 2023**\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **For the Six Months Ended June 30,**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **$ Change**|  ​  \n​| ​| **(in thousands)**|  ​  \nOperating lease income| ​| $|  3,581| ​| $|  3,310| ​| $|  271| ​  \nInterest income| ​|  830| ​|  1,512| ​|  (682)| ​  \nOther income| ​|  19,259| ​|  16,062| ​|  3,197| ​  \nLand development revenue| ​|  32,316| ​|  21,382| ​|  10,934| ​  \nTotal revenue| ​|  55,986| ​|  42,266| ​|  13,720| ​  \nInterest expense| ​|  3,433| ​|  12,708| ​|  (9,275)| ​  \nInterest expense - related party| ​| ​|  4,196| ​|  2,100| ​|  2,096| ​  \nReal estate expense| ​|  23,954| ​|  21,989| ​|  1,965| ​  \nLand development cost of sales| ​|  31,353| ​|  22,332| ​|  9,021| ​  \nDepreciation and amortization| ​|  2,361| ​|  2,171| ​|  190| ​  \nGeneral and administrative| ​|  11,979| ​|  21,650| ​|  (9,671)| ​  \nProvision for loan losses| ​|  15| ​|  1,632| ​|  (1,617)| ​  \nOther expense| ​|  63| ​|  602| ​|  (539)| ​  \nTotal costs and expenses| ​|  77,354| ​|  85,184| ​|  (7,830)| ​  \nUnrealized and realized gains (losses) on equity investments| ​| ​|  (55,578)| ​|  (166,932)| ​|  111,354| ​  \nLoss on early extinguishment of debt, net| ​|  —| ​|  (1,040)| ​|  1,040| ​  \nEarnings from equity method investments| ​|  —| ​|  30,216| ​|  (30,216)| ​  \nIncome tax expense| ​|  (2)| ​|  —| ​|  (2)| ​  \nNet income (loss)| ​| $|  (76,948)| ​| $|  (180,674)| ​| $|  103,726| ​  \n  \n​\n\nRevenue—Operating lease income, which primarily includes income from commercial operating properties, increased to $3.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 from $3.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in percentage rent at certain of our properties.\n\nInterest income decreased to $0.8 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 from $1.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest income was due primarily to a decrease in the average balance of our performing loans and other lending investments due to the repayment of loans.\n\n​\n\nOther income increased to $19.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 from $16.1 million for the same period in 2023. Other income consists primarily of dividend income from our investment in Safe and income from our hotel properties and other operating properties, including Asbury Lanes and the Magnolia Green Golf Club. The increase was due primarily to an additional $2.4 million of dividend income from Safe for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nLand development revenue and cost of sales—During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we had bulk sales and sold residential lots and recognized land development revenue of $32.3 million which had associated cost of sales of $31.4 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we sold residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of $21.4 million which had associated cost of sales of $22.3 million. The increase in land development revenue in 2024 was due primarily to an increase in revenues from bulk sales at our Magnolia Green, Asbury and Coney Island properties. As we execute future sales and have fewer remaining residential and development assets, we expect our land development revenue will decline. The timing and amount of such sales cannot be predicted with certainty.\n\nCosts and expenses—Prior to the Spin-Off, interest expense represented an allocation to us from iStar. Interest expense was allocated to us by calculating our average net assets by property type as a percentage of the average net assets of iStar's segments and multiplying that percentage by the interest expense allocated to each of iStar's segments (refer to Note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). Subsequent to the Spin-Off, interest expense represents the interest cost on our Margin Loan Facility. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred $3.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of interest expense on our Margin Loan Facility, net of amounts capitalized. We elected to pay interest in kind (\"PIK\") on the Margin Loan Facility in respect of the $1.8 million interest \n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\npayments payable for each of the first and second quarters of 2024. These amounts were added to the principal balance of the loan. The applicable margin on the Margin Loan Facility increases by 25 basis points for the entirety of the interest period immediately succeeding any interest period with respect to which we make a PIK election. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we were also allocated $8.0 million of interest expense and interest expense also included amounts payable to iStar.\n\nInterest expense - related party represents the interest cost on our Safe Credit Facility, net of amounts capitalized.\n\nReal estate expense was $24.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and $22.0 million for the same period in 2023. Real estate expense primarily represents expenses at our hotel and retail operating properties and land properties. The increase in 2024 was due primarily to an increase in expenses at our Asbury Park and Coney Island properties.\n\nDepreciation and amortization was $2.4 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. \n\nPrior to the Spin-Off, general and administrative expense represented an allocation of costs, including performance-based compensation, to us from iStar. General and administrative expenses, including stock-based compensation, represented a pro rata allocation of costs from iStar's real estate finance, operating properties, land and development and corporate business segments based on our average net assets for those property types as a percentage of iStar's average net assets for those segments (refer to Note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). Subsequent to the Spin-Off, general and administrative expense includes management fees to our Manager and other costs of operating as a public company. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we incurred $12.0 million of general and administrative expense, primarily resulting from $10.0 million of management fees to Safe and director fees. The annual management fee payable to our Manager under the Management Agreement declined from $25.0 million to $15.0 million for the second annual term of the Management Agreement which began on March 31, 2024. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we incurred $21.7 million of general and administrative expense, primarily resulting from management fees to Safe, audit and legal fees and a $14.1 million allocation from iStar. \n\nThe provision for loan losses was $15 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to a provision for loan losses of $1.6 million for the same period in 2023. The provision for loan losses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 resulted primarily from the addition to a loan during the year (refer to Note 5 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). The provision for loan losses for the six months ended June 30, 2023 resulted primarily from the sale of a non-performing loan, which was partially offset by a reversal of Expected Loss allowances on loans that repaid in full in during 2023. \n\nOther expense was $0.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and $0.6 million for the same period in 2023. \n\nUnrealized loss on equity investment represents the unrealized loss on our Safe Shares. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, we account for our Safe Shares as an equity investment under ASC 321, which requires that we adjust our investment in the Safe Shares to fair value through income at each reporting period. The unrealized loss for the six months ended June 30, 2024 represents the difference between the fair value of our investment in the Safe Shares as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The unrealized loss for the six months ended June 30, 2023 represents the difference between the fair value of our investment in the Safe Shares as of June 30, 2023 and iStar’s historical carrying amount of the Safe Shares at the time of the Spin-Off.\n\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt, net—During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we incurred losses on early extinguishment of debt from the repayment of our Margin Loan Facility (refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n​\n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nEarnings from equity method investments—Earnings from equity method investments was $30.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized $1.1 million of income from our historical equity method investment in Safe and $29.1 million of net aggregate income from our remaining equity method investments due to asset sales at the ventures. \n\n​\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including to pay interest and repay borrowings, develop our assets and maintain our operations, make distributions to our shareholders and meet other general business needs. We were formed in 2023 and we have not paid any dividends. We do not expect to pay regular dividends. We intend to make distributions of available cash from time to time, primarily dependent upon our ability to sell assets and the prices at which we sell our assets.\n\nOur sources of cash will be largely dependent on asset sales, which are difficult to predict in terms of timing and amount. While we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations, such as prepayments on the Margin Loan Facility resulting from declines in the market value of the Safe Shares. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. Our primary sources of liquidity will generally consist of our cash on hand and proceeds from asset sales.\n\nWe expect our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements to include:\n\n●| capital expenditures on our Asbury Park Waterfront and Magnolia Green development projects;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| debt service on the Safe Credit Facility and the Margin Loan Facility (refer to Note 9 to the combined and consolidated financial statements), and any other indebtedness including any repurchase agreements;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| management fees and expense reimbursements payable to our Manager (refer to Note 7 to the combined and consolidated financial statements);  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| operating expenses; and  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| distributions to shareholders if we have any excess cash on hand from asset sales after the repayment of our debt obligations.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings on the incremental facility under the Safe Credit Facility and our unrestricted cash. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales.\n\nOur future cash sources will be largely dependent on proceeds from asset sales. The amount and timing of asset sales, including the sale of Safe Shares, could be adversely affected by a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including the macroeconomic factors discussed below. We cannot predict with certainty the specific transactions we will undertake to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they come due. We will adjust our plans as appropriate in response to changes in our expectations and changes in market conditions. The uncertainty related to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rate increases, market volatility, disruptions in the banking sector and the availability of financing, and the effects of these factors on the economy generally and on the commercial real estate markets in which we operate, make it impossible for us to predict or to quantify the impact of these or other trends on our financial results or liquidity.\n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe following table outlines our cash flows used in operating activities, cash flows provided by investing activities and cash flows used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 ($ in thousands):\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \nCash flows used in operating activities| ​| $|  (20,637)| ​| $|  (4,656)| ​  \nCash flows provided by investing activities| ​| ​|  17,510| ​| ​|  128,880| ​  \nCash flows used in financing activities| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  (73,904)| ​  \n  \n​\n\nThe increase in cash flows used in operating activities during 2024 was due primarily to a decrease in distributions from other investments. The decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities during 2024 was due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from the repayment and sale of loans receivable and a decrease in distributions from other investments. Cash flows used in financing activities during 2023 was due primarily to distributions to iStar in 2023, which was partially offset by net borrowings from debt obligations in 2023.\n\n​\n\n**Debt Covenants** —The Margin Loan Facility requires that we comply with various covenants, including, without limitation, covenants restricting, subject to certain exceptions, indebtedness, liens, investments and the payment of dividends. Additionally, the Margin Loan Facility includes customary representations and warranties, events of default and other creditor protections for this type of facility. Upon the occurrence of certain events which are customary for this type of facility, we may be required to prepay all amounts due under the Margin Loan Facility or post additional collateral in accordance with the Margin Loan Facility and related agreements. In October 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Margin Loan Facility primarily to reduce the floor price at which the market price of the Safe Shares would trigger a mandatory prepayment of outstanding borrowings under the facility.\n\n​\n\nThe Safe Credit Facility requires that we comply with various covenants, including, without limitation, covenants restricting, subject to certain exceptions, indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, asset sales and the payment of certain dividends. Additionally, the Safe Credit Facility includes customary representations and warranties as well as customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable grace period, would permit Safe to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of ours under the Safe Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on the collateral securing the Safe Credit Facility. In October 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Safe Credit Facility primarily to enable us to access the $25.0 million incremental facility to replenish funds that we use to make voluntary prepayments under the Margin Loan Facility. \n\nA subsidiary of ours provided a completion and carry guaranty on the Loan (refer to Note 9 to the combined and consolidated financial statements) and is required to maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum liquidity amount both prior to and after the completion of the Project while the Loan is outstanding.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well controlled, reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. We base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and, therefore, routinely require adjustment.\n\nFor a discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to Note 3 to the combined and consolidated financial statements of our 2023 Annual Report.\n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nMarket Risks \n\nMarket risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, commodity prices and equity prices. In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Our operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets will affect our floating liabilities. Any significant increase in interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that our profitability will not be materially adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates.\n\nIn the event of a significant rising interest rate environment or economic downturn, defaults could increase and cause us to incur additional credit losses which would adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. Such delinquencies or defaults would likely have a material adverse effect on the spreads between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, an increase in interest rates could, among other things, reduce the value of our fixed-rate interest-bearing assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets.\n\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. We monitor the spreads between our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and may implement hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations, including engaging in interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and other interest rate-related derivative contracts. Such strategies are designed to reduce our exposure, on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis, to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes or as a hedge against changes in our credit risk or the credit risk of our borrowers.\n\nThe following table quantifies the potential changes in annual net income, assuming no change in our interest earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, should interest rates decrease or increase by 10, 50 or 100 basis points, assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve (i.e., relative interest rates). Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table.\n\nEstimated Change In Net Income\n\n($ in thousands) \n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Change in Interest Rates**|  ​| **Net Income**(1)  \n-100 Basis Points| ​| $|  279  \n-50 Basis Points| ​|  140  \n-10 Basis Points| ​| ​|  28  \nBase Interest Rate| ​|  —  \n+10 Basis Points| ​|  (28)  \n+50 Basis Points| ​|  (140)  \n+100 Basis Points| ​|  (279)  \n(1)| As of June 30, 2024, we had $85.5 million principal amount of floating-rate debt obligations outstanding and $57.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company has formed a disclosure committee \n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nthat is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining the disclosure obligations of the Company on a timely basis. The disclosure committee reports directly to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the disclosure committee and other members of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\n\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this quarterly report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company’s periodic reports.\n\n​\n\n35\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\n\nThe Company and/or one or more of its subsidiaries is party to various pending litigation matters that are considered ordinary routine litigation incidental to the Company’s business as a finance and investment company focused on the commercial real estate industry, including foreclosure-related proceedings. The Company believes it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any pending legal proceeding that would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s combined and consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\nItem 1A.

Holdings, a Maryland statutory trust (the \"Company,\" \"Star Holdings,\" \"we\" or \"us\") completed a series of reorganization and separation transactions (collectively, the “Spin-Off”) in accordance with the terms of a Separation and Distribution Agreement (the “Separation and Distribution Agreement”), dated as of March 31, 2023, by and between iStar Inc., a Maryland corporation (\"iStar\"), and Star Holdings. To effectuate the Spin-Off: (i) iStar contributed its remaining legacy non-ground lease assets, 13,522,651 shares of common stock of Safehold Inc. (the “Safe Shares”) and certain other assets (“iStar Included Assets”) to Star Holdings; and (ii) iStar distributed 100% of the common shares of beneficial interest in Star Holdings to holders of common stock of iStar (\"iStar Common Stock\") by way of a pro rata distribution of 0.153 common shares of Star Holdings for each outstanding share of iStar Common Stock held on the record date of the distribution. \n\nThe Spin-Off became effective at 12:02 a.m., Eastern Time, on March 31, 2023 (the “Spin-Off Effective Time”). Following the Spin-Off, Star Holdings became an independent, publicly traded company. Star Holdings' common shares commenced regular-way trading on the Nasdaq Global Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the symbol “STHO” on March 31, 2023. Shortly after the Spin-Off, iStar completed its previously-announced merger (the \"Merger\") with Safehold Inc., a Maryland corporation. iStar continued as the surviving corporation in the Merger and changed its name to “Safehold Inc.” (\"Safe\").\n\n​\n\nThe Company operates its business as one segment that focuses on realizing value for shareholders primarily by generating cash flows through active asset management and sales of its existing loans, operating properties and land and development properties. The Company’s short-term and long-term liquidity requirements include capital expenditures on its development projects, debt service, management fees and expense reimbursements payable to its Manager (refer to Note 7) and operating expenses, among others. The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings on the incremental facility under the Safe Credit Facility (refer to Note 9) and unrestricted cash. The Company expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales.\n\n​\n\nThe combined and consolidated financial statements of the Company include loans and other lending investments, operating properties and land and development assets that represent the assets, liabilities and operations from the assets included in the Spin-Off. References to \"iStar\" in the notes to the Company's financial statements refer to iStar prior to the closing of the Merger and the Spin-Off.\n\n​\n\nNote 2—Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\n**Basis of Presentation** —The accompanying unaudited combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10-01 of Regulation S-X for interim financial statements. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete financial statements. These unaudited combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Information Statement.\n\nThe preparation of these combined and consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Such operating results may not be indicative of the expected results for any other interim periods or the entire year.\n\nThe combined and consolidated financial statements of the Company prior to the Spin-off on March 31, 2023 represented a combination of entities under common control that have been “carved out” from iStar’s consolidated \n\n7\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nfinancial statements. Historically, financial statements of the Company have not been prepared as it was not operated separately from iStar. These combined and consolidated financial statements reflect the revenues and expenses of the Company and include certain assets and liabilities that were included in the Spin-Off, which have been reflected at iStar’s historical basis. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The combined and consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of the Company’s future performance and do not necessarily reflect what the financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been had the Company operated as a standalone company during the periods presented.\n\n​\n\nThese combined and consolidated financial statements include an allocation of general and administrative expenses and interest expense to the Company from iStar through the date of the Spin-Off. General and administrative expenses include certain iStar corporate functions, including executive oversight, treasury, finance, human resources, tax compliance and planning, internal audit, financial reporting, information technology and investor relations. General and administrative expenses, including stock-based compensation, represent a pro rata allocation of costs from iStar’s real estate finance, operating properties, land and development and corporate business segments based on the Company’s average net assets for those segments as a percentage of iStar’s average net assets for those segments. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was allocated to the Company by calculating the Company’s average net assets as a percentage of the average net assets in iStar’s segments and multiplying that percentage by the interest expense allocated to iStar’s segments. The Company believes the allocationmethodology for general and administrative expenses and interest expense is reasonable. Accordingly, the general and administrative expense and interest expense allocations presented in our combined and consolidated statements of operations for historical periods does not necessarily reflect what our general and administrative expenses and interest expense will be as a standalone public company. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company was allocated $14.1 million of general and administrative expense and $8.0 million of interest expense. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the general and administrative expense allocation includes $1.8 million of stock-based compensation. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, the Company has its own general and administrative expense and interest expense as a stand-alone public company.\n\n​\n\nPrior to the Spin-Off, certain of the entities included in the Company’s financial statements did not have bank accounts for the periods presented, and certain cash transactions for the Company were transacted through bank accounts owned by iStar. The combined and consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented were prepared as if operating, investing and financing transactions for the Company had been transacted through its own bank accounts.\n\n​\n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**Principles of Combination and Consolidation** —The combined and consolidated financial statements include on a carve-out basis the historical balance sheets and statements of operations and cash flows of assets, liabilities and operations included in the Spin-Off. For periods prior to March 31, 2023, the Company was allocated a number of shares of Safe common stock based on estimates driven by the total value of stock that iStar expected to contribute to the Company and the price per share of Safe common stock (refer to Note 7). Information for the periods subsequent to March 31, 2023 reflect the actual number of Safe Shares contributed to the Company.\n\nConsolidated VIEs—The Company consolidates VIEs for which it is considered the primary beneficiary. The liabilities of these VIEs are non-recourse to the Company and can only be satisfied from each VIE’s respective assets. The Company did not have any unfunded commitments related to consolidated VIEs as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The following table presents the assets and liabilities of the Company’s consolidated VIEs as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of**  \n​| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n**ASSETS**|  ​| ​| ​  \nReal estate| ​| ​| ​  \nReal estate, at cost| ​| $|  94,923| ​| $|  94,682  \nLess: accumulated depreciation| ​|  (22,200)| ​|  (21,349)  \nReal estate, net| ​|  72,723| ​|  73,333  \nLand and development, net| ​|  115,267| ​|  108,284  \nCash and cash equivalents| ​|  16,218| ​|  31,479  \nAccrued interest and operating lease income receivable, net| ​|  —| ​|  24  \nDeferred expenses and other assets, net| ​|  8,295| ​|  8,758  \nTotal assets| ​| $|  212,503| ​| $|  221,878  \n**LIABILITIES**|  ​| ​  \nTotal liabilities| ​| $|  24,879| ​| $|  23,600  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote 3—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies have not changed materially from those described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report”). Please refer to the 2023 Annual Report for the Company’s significant accounting policies.\n\n​\n\nNew accounting pronouncements—In August 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-05, Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement (“ASU 2023-05”). ASU 2023-05 requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value and is effective for all joint venture entities with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. ASU 2023-05 is to be applied on a prospective basis, while retrospective application can be elected for joint ventures formed before the effective date. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2023-05 but does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 improves disclosures for reportable segments primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective on a retrospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-07 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 requires greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction and certain other amendments to improve income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2023-09 but does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote 4—Real Estate\n\nThe Company’s real estate assets were comprised of the following ($ in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of**  \n​| ​| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \nLand, at cost| ​| $|  5,570| ​| $|  5,570  \nBuildings and improvements, at cost| ​|  92,152| ​|  91,911  \nLess: accumulated depreciation| ​|  (22,972)| ​|  (22,075)  \nReal estate, net| ​| $|  74,750| ​| $|  75,406  \n  \n​\n\n**Tenant Reimbursements—** The Company receives reimbursements from tenants for certain facility operating expenses including common area costs, insurance, utilities and real estate taxes. Tenant reimbursements were $0.4 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These amounts are included in “Operating lease income” in the Company’s combined and consolidated statements of operations.\n\n**Allowance for Doubtful Accounts—** As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the allowance for doubtful accounts related to real estate tenant receivables was $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. These amounts are included in “Accrued interest and operating lease income receivable, net” on the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheets.\n\n**Future Minimum Operating Lease Payments** —Future minimum operating lease payments to be collected under non-cancelable operating leases, excluding tenant reimbursements of expenses, in effect as of March 31, 2024, are as follows by year ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Year**|  ​| **Amount**  \n2024 (remaining nine months)| ​| $|  3,153  \n2025| ​|  4,257  \n2026| ​|  4,171  \n2027| ​|  1,559  \n2028| ​|  242  \nThereafter| ​|  875  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote 5—Land and Development\n\nThe Company’s land and development assets were comprised of the following ($ in thousands): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of**|  ​  \n​| ​| **March 31,**|  ​| **December 31,**|  ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \nLand and land development, at cost| ​| $|  189,735| ​| $|  193,360| ​  \nLess: accumulated depreciation| ​|  (12,179)| ​|  (11,966)| ​  \nTotal land and development, net| ​| $|  177,556| ​| $|  181,394| ​  \n  \n​\n\n**Dispositions—** During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company sold land parcels and residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of $16.6 million and $9.6 million, respectively, and land development cost of sales of $12.3 million and $10.0 million, respectively, from its land and development portfolio. \n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​\n\nIn September 2023, the Company sold a land parcel to a third-party and provided the buyer with a loan to finance the acquisition. The buyer had the option to prepay the loan in full on or before a specified date, it would receive a discounted purchase price. At origination, the Company recorded the loan based on the discounted purchase price since collection of the discounted portion of the sale was undetermined. The buyer elected to not prepay the loan and receive the discounted purchase price and, as such, the Company recorded additional land development revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The loan to the buyer is included in “Loans receivable and other lending investments, net” on the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheets. \n\nIn December 2023, the Company transferred the ownership interests in a subsidiary land owner to a third-party venture (the “Venture”) for its development and construction of a multifamily project in Asbury Park, NJ (the “Project”). In connection with this transfer, the Company (i) provided the Venture with a $10.6 million mezzanine loan that was fully funded at closing and is secured by the ownership interests in the subsidiary land owner; and (ii) provided a completion and carry guaranty on the Venture’s $80.0 million senior construction mortgage loan (refer to Note 9) with a third-party lender in return for a fee. The Company is a non-member manager of the Venture and is entitled to certain fees, but otherwise has no expected member-related economics. Until the mezzanine loan is repaid and the guaranties are released, the Company controls all decision-making of the Venture. The Venture is responsible for the funding and performance of all development and construction activities and the Company is not obligated to provide any capital contributions to the Venture. At closing, the third-party members provided $21.0 million in cash capital contributions to the Venture, exclusive of a $3.0 million deferred profits interest, which combined represent the total equity capitalization.\n\n​\n\nThe Company determined that the Venture (and its consolidated subsidiaries developing the Project) is a VIE for which the Company is the primary beneficiary and thus consolidated it under ASC 810. As a result, for accounting purposes, the Project will be recorded on the Company’s combined and consolidated financial statements and the mezzanine loan will eliminate in consolidation. The $21.0 million in third-party cash capital contributions to the Venture represents noncontrolling interests in the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheet. The Company expects this consolidation treatment to continue until the mezzanine loan is paid in full by the Venture and the Company’s senior loan guaranties are released by the lender. \n\n​\n\nNote 6—Loans Receivable and Other Lending Investments, net\n\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s loans receivable and other lending investments by class ($ in thousands): (1)\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **As of**|  ​  \n​| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**|  ​  \n**Loans**|  ​| ​| ​  \nSenior mortgages| ​| $|  3,050| ​| $|  2,550| ​  \nSubordinate mortgages| ​|  14,509| ​|  14,266| ​  \nSubtotal - gross carrying value of loans| ​|  17,559| ​|  16,816| ​  \n**Other lending investments**|  ​| ​| ​  \nAvailable-for-sale debt securities| ​|  5,196| ​|  4,579| ​  \nSubtotal - other lending investments| ​|  5,196| ​|  4,579| ​  \n**Total gross carrying value of loans receivable and other lending investments**|  ​|  22,755| ​|  21,395| ​  \nAllowance for loan losses| ​|  (514)| ​|  (497)| ​  \n**Total loans receivable and other lending investments, net**|  ​| $|  22,241| ​| $|  20,898| ​  \n(1)| As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest was $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and is recorded in “Accrued interest and operating lease income receivable, net” on the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheets.

Risk ratings, which range from 1 (lower risk) to 5 (higher risk), are based on judgments which are inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that actual performance will be similar to current expectation. The Company designates loans as non-performing at such time as: (1) interest payments become 90 days delinquent; (2) the loan has a maturity default; or (3) management determines it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. All non-performing loans are placed on non-accrual status and income is only recognized in certain cases upon actual cash receipt.\n\n12\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe Company’s amortized cost

The Company does not have significant influence over Safe and accounts for its investment in Safe as an equity investment under ASC 321 – Investments – Equity Securities (“ASC 321”), which requires that the Company adjust its investment in Safe to fair value through income at each reporting period. As such, the Company recognized an “Unrealized loss on equity investment” of $37.9 million and $90.7 million, respectively, in its combined and consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Prior to the Spin-Off, iStar accounted for its investment in Safe as an equity method investment under ASC 323 – Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures (“ASC 323”) due to its ability to exercise significant influence. Pursuant to ASC 323-10-40-1, an equity method investor shall account for a share issuance by an investee as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of its investment. Any gain or loss to the investor resulting from an investee’s share issuance shall be recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was allocated ownership of approximately 15.2 million shares of Safe common stock from iStar. The allocation was adjusted based upon the final terms of the Spin-Off on March 31, 2023, and the Company’s investment basis was reduced by approximately 1.8 million shares with a carrying value of approximately $65.6 million, which was adjusted against additional paid-in capital within equity.  \n---|---  \n(2)| For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded $28.9 million in earnings from equity method investments primarily from the sale of properties within its equity method investments.   \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n**Safehold Inc.** —Safe is a publicly-traded company that acquires, owns, manages, finances and capitalizes ground leases. Ground leases generally represent ownership of the land underlying commercial real estate projects that is net leased by the fee owner of the land to the owners/operators of the real estate projects built thereon (“Ground Leases”). As of March 31, 2024, the Company owned approximately 13.5 million shares, or 18.9%, of Safe’s outstanding common stock. The Company accounts for its investment in the Safe Shares as an equity investment due to the terms of the governance agreement described below.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company entered into the following agreements with Safe:\n\n_Separation and Distribution Agreement_ —The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the Spin-Off and provisions governing Star Holdings' relationship with Safe with respect to and following the Spin-Off. The Separation and Distribution Agreement includes provisions allocating assets and liabilities between Star Holdings and Safe and various post-closing covenants relating to, among other things, the treatment of the parties’ insurance policies, information sharing and other operational matters. The Separation and Distribution Agreement includes a mutual release by Star Holdings, on the one hand, and Safe, on the other hand, of the other party from certain specified liabilities, as well as mutual indemnification covenants pursuant to which Star Holdings and Safe have agreed to indemnify each other from certain specified liabilities.\n\n_Management Agreement_ —The Company entered into the Management Agreement with Safehold Management Services Inc. (the “Manager”), a subsidiary of Safe. The Management Agreement requires the Manager to manage the Company’s assets and its and its subsidiaries’ day-to-day operations, subject to the supervision of Board of Trustees of the Company (the “Board”). Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Manager is required to provide the Company with a management team, including a chief executive officer, a chief financial officer and a chief compliance officer, along with support personnel, to provide the management services to be provided by the Manager to the Company. The Manager does not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and is not responsible for any action of the Board in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations.\n\nThe Management Agreement has an annual term that automatically renews on March 31 of each year. The Company pays a fixed cash management fee and reimburses the Manager for third party expenses incurred in connection with its \n\n15\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nservices. The Company paid the Manager management fees of $25.0 million for the term ended March 31, 2024. The annual fee declines to $15.0 million, $10.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in each of the following annual terms, and adjusts to 2.0% of the gross book value of the Company’s assets, excluding the Safe Shares, thereafter. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded $6.3 million of management fees to the Manager.\n\nThe Management Agreement may be terminated by the Company without cause by not less than one hundred eighty days’ written notice to the Manager upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Company’s independent directors, provided, however, that if the date of termination occurs prior to the fourth anniversary of the Spin-Off, the termination will be subject to payment of the applicable termination fee to the Manager. The Company may also terminate the Management Agreement at any time, including during the initial term, with 30 days’ prior written notice from the Company’s board of trustees for “cause,” as defined in the Management Agreement.\n\n​\n\nIn the event of a termination without cause by the Company prior to the fourth anniversary of the Spin-Off, the Company will pay the Manager a termination fee of $50.0 million minus the aggregate amount of management fees actually paid to the Manager prior to the termination date. However, if the Company has completed the liquidation of its assets on or before the termination date, the termination fee will consist of any portion of the annual management fee that remained unpaid for the remainder of the then current annual term plus, if the termination date occurs on or before the third anniversary of the Spin-Off, the amount of the management fee that would have been payable for the next succeeding annual term, or if the termination date occurs after the third anniversary of the Spin-Off, zero.\n\nIn the event of a termination by the Manager based on a reduction in the amount of the Company’s combined and consolidated assets below designated thresholds, the Company will pay the Manager a termination fee of $30.0 million if the termination occurs in the first year, $15.0 million if the termination occurs in the second year and $5.0 million if the termination occurs in the third year, in each case, plus the balance of any unpaid portion of the annual management fee for the applicable year.\n\n​\n\n _Governance Agreement_ —The Company and Safe entered into a governance agreement (the “Governance Agreement”) in order to establish various arrangements and restrictions with respect to the governance of the Company and certain rights and restrictions with respect to the Safe Shares owned by the Company.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Governance Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary restrictions on the transfer of Safe Shares held by the Company. Furthermore, the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from transferring at any time any the Safe Shares held by the Company or its subsidiaries to any person who is known by the Company or its subsidiaries to be an “Activist” or “Company Competitor” (as such terms are defined in the Governance Agreement), or to any group that, to the knowledge of the Company or its subsidiaries, includes as “Activist” or “Company Competitor,” without first obtaining the Safe’s prior written consent.\n\nDuring a “restrictive period” which lasts until the earliest to occur of (i) the effective date on which Safe terminates the Management Agreement; or (ii) the date on which we beneficially own less than 7.5% of Safe’s outstanding common stock and Safe is no longer our external Manager; or (iii) a Change of Control of Safe (as defined in the Governance Agreement), we and our directly or indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries are required to vote the Safe Shares in accordance with the recommendations of the board of directors of Safe.

There are three main components of economic risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and market risk. The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different points in time and potentially at different bases, than its interest-earning assets. Credit risk is the risk of default on the Company’s lending investments or leases that result from a borrower’s or tenant’s inability or unwillingness to make contractually required payments. Market risk reflects changes in the value of loans and other lending investments due to changes in interest rates or other market factors, including the rate of prepayments of principal and the value of the collateral underlying loans, the valuation of real estate assets by the Company as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n​\n\n**Risk concentrations—** Concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of borrowers, tenants or investees related to the Company’s investments are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to the Company, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.\n\n​\n\nAll of the Company’s real estate and assets collateralizing its loans receivable are located in the United States. As of March 31, 2024, the Company’s portfolio contains concentrations in the following property types: entertainment/leisure, land and development, hotel, condominium and retail and the Safe Shares.\n\n​\n\nThe Company underwrites the credit of prospective borrowers and tenants and often requires them to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees, letters of credit and/or cash security deposits. Although the Company’s loans and real estate assets are geographically diverse and the borrowers and tenants operate in a variety of industries, to the extent the Company has a significant concentration of interest or operating lease revenues from any single borrower or tenant, the inability of that borrower or tenant to make its payment could have a material \n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nadverse effect on the Company. In addition, declines in the market price of Safe common stock could require the Company to post additional collateral or prepay some or all of the outstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan Facility.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNote 12—Equity\n\n**Common Stock—** On March 31, 2023, in connection with the Spin-Off,  iStar distributed 100% of the common shares of beneficial interest in the Company to holders of common stock of iStar (\"iStar Common Stock\") by way of a pro rata distribution of 0.153 common shares of the Company for each outstanding share of iStar Common Stock held on the record date of the distribution.  As of March 31, 2024, the Company has one class of common stock with 13,319,552 shares outstanding.\n\n**Net Parent Investment—** The Company’s net parent investment represented net contributions from and distributions to iStar through the date of the Spin-Off.

Assets required to be marked-to-market and reported at fair value every reporting period are classified as being valued on a recurring basis. Assets not required to be recorded at fair value every period may be recorded at fair value if a specific provision or other impairment is recorded within the period to mark the carrying value of the asset to market as of the reporting date. Such assets are classified as being valued on a non-recurring basis.\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe following fair value hierarchy table summarizes the Company’s assets recorded at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis by the above categories as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 ($ in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Fair Value Using**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **Quoted**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **market**|  ​| **Significant**|  ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **prices in**|  ​| **other**|  ​| **Significant**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **active**|  ​| **observable**|  ​| **unobservable**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| **markets**|  ​| **inputs**|  ​| **inputs**  \n​| **Total**|  **(Level 1)**|  **(Level 2)**|  **(Level 3)**  \n**As of March 31, 2024**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nRecurring basis:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAvailable-for-sale debt securities(1)| ​| $|  5,196| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  5,196  \nOther investments (refer to Note 7)| ​| ​|  278,567| ​| ​|  278,567| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  —  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**As of December 31, 2023**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNon-recurring basis:| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAvailable-for-sale debt securities(1)| ​| $|  4,579| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  —| ​| $|  4,579  \nOther investments (refer to Note 7)| ​|  316,430| ​|  316,430| ​|  —| ​|  —  \n(1)| The fair value of the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities are based upon unadjusted third-party broker quotes and are classified as Level 3.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\nThe following table summarizes changes in Level 3 available-for-sale securities reported at fair value on the Company’s combined and consolidated balance sheets for the three months ended March 31, 2024 ($ in thousands):\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \nBeginning balance| ​| $|  4,579  \nPurchases| ​| ​|  770  \nUnrealized gain (loss) recorded in other comprehensive income (loss)| ​|  (153)  \nEnding balance| ​| $|  5,196  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n**Fair values of financial instruments—** The following table presents the carrying value and fair value for the Company’s financial instruments ($ in millions): \n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **As of March 31, 2024**|  ​| **As of December 31, 2023**  \n​| ​| **Carrying**|  ​| **Fair** | ​| **Carrying**|  ​| **Fair**  \n​| **Value**| **Value**| **Value**| **Value**  \n**Assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nLoans receivable and other lending investments, net(1)| ​| $|  22| ​| $|  19| ​| $|  21| ​| $|  17  \nEquity investment in Safe(2)| ​| ​|  279| ​| ​|  279| ​| ​|  316| ​| ​|  316  \nCash and cash equivalents(3)| ​|  46| ​|  46| ​|  51| ​|  51  \nRestricted cash(3)| ​|  10| ​|  10| ​|  10| ​|  10  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Liabilities**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDebt obligations, net(1)| ​| ​|  195| ​| ​|  199| ​| ​|  193| ​| ​|  193  \n(1)| The fair value of the Company’s loans receivable and other lending investments, net and debt obligations are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  \n---|---  \n(2)| The fair value of the Company’s investment in approximately 13.5 million shares of Safe common stock is classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, and is included within “Other investments” on the Company’s balance sheet.  \n---|---  \n(3)| The Company determined the carrying values of its cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximated their fair values.

For purposes of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Star Holdings and its combined and consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.\n\nThe discussion below should be read in conjunction with our combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and our 2023 Annual Report. These historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. \n\nOur Development Portfolio\n\n​\n\n _Asbury Park Waterfront_\n\n​\n\nWe are the managing member in Asbury Partners, LLC, which is the joint venture that owns the Asbury Park Waterfront investment. The aggregate carrying value of the Asbury Park Waterfront investment was approximately $138.9 million as of March 31, 2024.\n\nThe Asbury Park Waterfront investment includes the following:\n\n●| Asbury Ocean Club Surfside Resort and Residences: a 16-story mixed use project featuring 130 residential condominium units, a 54-key luxury boutique hotel, 24,000 square feet of retail space, 410 structured parking spaces and a 15,000 square foot gym and spa amenity area. The property was completed in 2019. The hotel is managed by a third party. As of March 31, 2024, two residential condominium units remain unsold.  \n---|---  \n●| The Asbury: a 110-key independent boutique hotel with indoor and outdoor event spaces, and a rooftop bar. The hotel was completed in 2016 and is managed by a third party.  \n---|---  \n●| Asbury Lanes: a 12,000 square foot music and entertainment venue. The venue was completed in 2018, is connected to The Asbury and managed by a third party.  \n---|---  \n  \nOur current strategy for the Asbury Park Waterfront investment is to sell the remaining residential condominium units at Asbury Ocean Club, actively asset manage our operating assets, and strategically monetize the remaining development sites and our operating assets through sales to third party developers and operators while meeting our obligations under the redevelopment agreement with the city of Asbury Park. \n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n _Magnolia Green_\n\n​\n\nMagnolia Green is an approximately 1,900 acre multi-generational master planned residential community that is entitled for 3,550 single and multifamily dwelling units and approximately 193 acres of land for commercial development. The community is located 19 miles southwest of Richmond, Virginia and offers distinct phases designed for people in different life stages, from first home buyers to empty nesters in single family and townhomes built by the area’s top homebuilders. The project is anchored by the Magnolia Green Golf Club, a semi-private 18-hole Nicklaus Design championship golf course with full-service clubhouse and driving range. There are also numerous community amenities, including the Aquatic Center, featuring multiple pools and a snack bar, Arbor Walk, featuring a junior Olympic competition pool, water slide and sports courts, the Tennis Center, featuring tennis and pickleball courts and a pro shop, and miles of paved trails. The aggregate carrying value of our Magnolia Green assets as of March 31, 2024 was $55.1 million.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, 2,027 residential lots have been sold to homebuilders. We anticipate selling our remaining residential lots to homebuilders either upon completion of horizontal lot development or in bulk as unimproved lots over the next two years and it could take substantially longer. We anticipate selling the golf course operations to a third party upon completion of residential lot sellout. There can be no assurance, however, that these sales will be completed.\n\n**Our Monetizing Portfolio**\n\n​\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, we owned assets that we expect to monetize primarily through asset sales, loan repayments or active asset management. These assets included in our portfolio as of March 31, 2024 had an aggregate carrying value of approximately $80.5 million and were comprised primarily of loans, operating properties, land and other assets. Summarized information regarding these assets is set forth below.\n\nLoans and other lending investments _._ The loans and other lending investments included in our monetizing portfolio as of March 31, 2024 include two loans with an aggregate carrying value of $17.0 million and three available-for-sale debt securities with an aggregate carrying value of $5.2 million. \n\n​\n\nLand _._ The land assets included in our portfolio as of March 31, 2024 include two assets with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $35.2 million. Our general strategy is to seek to sell the land assets to third party developers. In addition, we have another land asset related to a venture at Asbury Park with a carrying value of $19.6 million (refer to Note 5 to the combined and consolidated financial statements).\n\n​\n\nOther _._ The remainder of the monetizing assets primarily consist of two short term leases that we have subleased to third parties, which had an aggregate carrying value of $3.5 million as of March 31, 2024, and a group of loans and equity interests that are recorded as having no carrying value in our financial statements. Our general strategy is to seek to sell the leased assets, although we may hold one or both leases until they expire. For the assets with no carrying value, we may seek to sell these assets but can give no assurance that we will recover any value from them.\n\n​\n\nInvestment in Safe. In addition to the assets described above, we also own the Safe Shares which had a fair value of $278.6 million based on the closing price of $20.60 as of March 28, 2024. \n\n​\n\nThe Safe Shares collateralize our Margin Loan Facility and the net proceeds from the sale of any Safe Shares must be applied first to repay the Margin Loan Facility. \n\n​\n\nIn the second half of 2023, we took certain steps intended to address declines in the market value of the Safe Shares. We paid down the outstanding balance of the Margin Loan Facility which has a principal balance of $83.7 million as of March 31, 2024. We also entered into amendments to the Margin Loan Facility and the Safe Credit Facility to, among other things, reduce the floor price of the Safe Shares that would trigger a mandatory prepayment in full of the Margin Loan Facility and enable us to access incremental borrowings under the Safe Credit Facility to replenish funds used to voluntarily prepay the Margin Loan Facility. Further declines in the market value of the Safe \n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nShares could require us to make additional prepayments of some or all of the outstanding borrowings under the Margin Loan Facility. Accessing incremental borrowings under the Safe Credit Facility will increase our interest expense because the interest rate on all borrowings increases to 10.0% per annum while incremental borrowings remain outstanding.\n\n​\n\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended **March 31, 2024** compared to the Three Months Ended **March 31, 2023**\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the Three Months Ended**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **March 31,**|  ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| **2024**| **2023**| **$ Change**|  ​  \n​| ​| **(in thousands)**|  ​  \nOperating lease income| ​| $|  1,881| ​| $|  1,701| ​| $|  180| ​  \nInterest income| ​|  389| ​|  1,115| ​|  (726)| ​  \nOther income| ​|  6,551| ​|  4,406| ​|  2,145| ​  \nLand development revenue| ​|  16,615| ​|  9,564| ​|  7,051| ​  \nTotal revenue| ​|  25,436| ​|  16,786| ​|  8,650| ​  \nInterest expense| ​|  1,708| ​|  10,099| ​|  (8,391)| ​  \nInterest expense - related party| ​| ​|  2,088| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  2,088| ​  \nReal estate expense| ​|  11,776| ​|  9,594| ​|  2,182| ​  \nLand development cost of sales| ​|  12,346| ​|  9,976| ​|  2,370| ​  \nDepreciation and amortization| ​|  1,183| ​|  1,080| ​|  103| ​  \nGeneral and administrative| ​|  7,393| ​|  14,098| ​|  (6,705)| ​  \nProvision for loan losses| ​|  17| ​|  1,701| ​|  (1,684)| ​  \nOther expense| ​|  56| ​|  288| ​|  (232)| ​  \nTotal costs and expenses| ​|  36,567| ​|  46,836| ​|  (10,269)| ​  \nUnrealized loss on equity investment| ​| ​|  (37,863)| ​| ​|  (90,664)| ​| ​|  52,801| ​  \nEarnings from equity method investments| ​|  —| ​|  29,974| ​|  (29,974)| ​  \nIncome tax expense| ​|  (2)| ​|  —| ​|  (2)| ​  \nNet loss| ​| $|  (48,996)| ​| $|  (90,740)| ​| $|  41,744| ​  \n  \n​\n\nRevenue—Operating lease income, which primarily includes income from commercial operating properties, increased to $1.9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $1.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in percentage rent at certain of our properties.\n\nInterest income decreased to $0.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $1.1 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease in interest income was due primarily to a decrease in the average balance of our performing loans and other lending investments due to the repayment of loans.\n\n​\n\nOther income increased to $6.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $4.4 million for the same period in 2023. Other income consists primarily of dividend income from our investment in Safe and income from our hotel properties and other operating properties, including Asbury Lanes and the Magnolia Green Golf Club. The increase was due primarily to $2.4 million of dividend income from Safe, which was partially offset by other ancillary income from investments.\n\nLand development revenue and cost of sales—During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we sold residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of $16.6 million which had associated cost of sales of $12.3 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we sold residential lots and units and recognized land development revenue of $9.6 million which had associated cost of sales of $10.0 million. The increase in land development revenue in 2024 was due primarily to an increase in revenues from bulk sales at our Magnolia Green property. As we execute future sales and have fewer remaining residential and development assets, we expect our land development revenue will decline. The timing and amount of such sales cannot be predicted with certainty.\n\nCosts and expenses—Prior to the Spin-Off, interest expense represented an allocation to us from iStar. Interest expense was allocated to us by calculating our average net assets by property type as a percentage of the average net \n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nassets of iStar's segments and multiplying that percentage by the interest expense allocated to each of iStar's segments (refer to Note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). Subsequent to the Spin-Off, interest expense represents the interest cost on our Margin Loan Facility. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we incurred $1.7 million of interest expense on our Margin Loan Facility, net of amounts capitalized. We elected to pay interest in kind (\"PIK\") on the Margin Loan Facility in respect of the $1.8 million interest payment payable for the first quarter of 2024. That amount was added to the principal balance of the loan. The applicable margin on the Margin Loan Facility increases by 25 basis points for the entirety of the interest period immediately succeeding any interest period with respect to which we make a PIK election. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we were allocated $8.0 million of interest expense. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, interest expense also included amounts payable to iStar.\n\nInterest expense - related party represents the interest cost on our Safe Credit Facility, net of amounts capitalized.\n\nReal estate expense was $11.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $9.6 million for the same period in 2023. Real estate expense primarily represents expenses at our hotel and retail operating properties and land properties. The increase in 2024 was due primarily to an increase in expenses at our Asbury Park and Magnolia Green properties.\n\nDepreciation and amortization was $1.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $1.1 million for the same period in 2023. \n\nPrior to the Spin-Off, general and administrative expense represented an allocation of costs, including performance-based compensation, to us from iStar. General and administrative expenses, including stock-based compensation, represented a pro rata allocation of costs from iStar's real estate finance, operating properties, land and development and corporate business segments based on our average net assets for those property types as a percentage of iStar's average net assets for those segments (refer to Note 2 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). Subsequent to the Spin-Off, general and administrative expense includes management fees to our Manager and other costs of operating as a public company. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we incurred $7.4 million of general and administrative expense, primarily resulting from management fees to Safe and director fees. The annual management fee payable to our Manager under the Management Agreement will decline from $25.0 million to $15.0 million for the second annual term of the Management Agreement beginning on March 31, 2024. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we were allocated $14.1 million of general and administrative expense from iStar. \n\nThe provision for loan losses was $17 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to a provision for loan losses of $1.7 million for the same period in 2023. The provision for loan losses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 resulted primarily from the addition to a loan during the quarter (refer to Note 5 to the combined and consolidated financial statements). The provision for loan losses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 resulted primarily from the sale of a non-performing loan, which was partially offset by a reversal of Expected Loss allowances on loans that repaid in full in the first quarter 2023. \n\nOther expense was $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $0.3 million for the same period in 2023. \n\nUnrealized loss on equity investment represents the unrealized loss on our Safe Shares. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, we account for our Safe Shares as an equity investment under ASC 321, which requires that we adjust our investment in the Safe Shares to fair value through income at each reporting period. The unrealized loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 represents the difference between the fair value of our investment in the Safe Shares as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The unrealized loss for the three months ended March 31, 2023 represents the difference between the fair value of our investment in the Safe Shares as of March 31, 2023 and iStar’s historical carrying amount of the Safe Shares at the time of the Spin-Off.\n\n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nEarnings from equity method investments—Earnings from equity method investments was $30.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recognized $1.1 million of income from our historical equity method investment in Safe and $28.9 million of net aggregate income from our remaining equity method investments due to asset sales at the ventures. \n\n​\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including to pay interest and repay borrowings, develop our assets and maintain our operations, make distributions to our shareholders and meet other general business needs. We are a recently formed company and, as a result, we have not paid any dividends. We do not expect to pay regular dividends. We intend to make distributions of available cash from time to time, primarily dependent upon our ability to sell assets and the prices at which we sell our assets.\n\nOur sources of cash will be largely dependent on asset sales, which are difficult to predict in terms of timing and amount. While we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain liquidity needs, there may be unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which would affect our financial position, liquidity and results of operations, such as prepayments on the Margin Loan Facility resulting from declines in the market value of the Safe Shares. Even if there are no material changes to our anticipated liquidity requirements, our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or needed. Our primary sources of liquidity will generally consist of our cash on hand and proceeds from asset sales.\n\nWe expect our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements to include:\n\n●| capital expenditures on our Asbury Park Waterfront and Magnolia Green development projects;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| debt service on the Safe Credit Facility and the Margin Loan Facility (refer to Note 9 to the combined and consolidated financial statements), and any other indebtedness including any repurchase agreements;  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| management fees and expense reimbursements payable to our Manager (refer to Note 7 to the combined and consolidated financial statements);  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| operating expenses; and  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n●| distributions to shareholders if we have any excess cash on hand from asset sales after the repayment of our debt obligations.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings on the incremental facility under the Safe Credit Facility and our unrestricted cash. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through any cash flows from operations and proceeds from asset sales.\n\nOur future cash sources will be largely dependent on proceeds from asset sales. The amount and timing of asset sales, including the sale of Safe Shares, could be adversely affected by a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control, including the macroeconomic factors discussed below. We cannot predict with certainty the specific transactions we will undertake to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations as they come due. We will adjust our plans as appropriate in response to changes in our expectations and changes in market conditions. The uncertainty related to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rate increases, market volatility, disruptions in the banking sector and the availability of financing, and the effects of these factors on the economy generally and on the commercial real estate markets in which we operate, make it impossible for us to predict or to quantify the impact of these or other trends on our financial results or liquidity.\n\n29\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nThe following table outlines our cash flows used in operating activities, cash flows provided by investing activities and cash flows used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 ($ in thousands): \n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **For the Three Months Ended March 31,**  \n​| ​| **2024**| **2023**|  ​  \nCash flows used in operating activities| ​| $|  (14,230)| ​| $|  (554)| ​  \nCash flows provided by investing activities| ​| ​|  9,634| ​| ​|  116,779| ​  \nCash flows used in financing activities| ​| ​|  —| ​| ​|  (48,268)| ​  \n  \n​\n\nThe increase in cash flows used in operating activities during 2024 was due primarily to a decrease in distributions from other investments. The decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities during 2024 was due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from the repayment and sale of loans receivable and a decrease in distributions from other investments. Cash flows used in financing activities during 2023 was due primarily to distributions to iStar in 2023, which was partially offset by net borrowings from debt obligations in 2023.\n\n​\n\n**Debt Covenants** —The Margin Loan Facility requires that we comply with various covenants, including, without limitation, covenants restricting, subject to certain exceptions, indebtedness, liens, investments and the payment of dividends. Additionally, the Margin Loan Facility includes customary representations and warranties, events of default and other creditor protections for this type of facility. Upon the occurrence of certain events which are customary for this type of facility, we may be required to prepay all amounts due under the Margin Loan Facility or post additional collateral in accordance with the Margin Loan Facility and related agreements. In October 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Margin Loan Facility primarily to reduce the floor price at which the market price of the Safe Shares would trigger a mandatory prepayment of outstanding borrowings under the facility.\n\n​\n\nThe Safe Credit Facility requires that we comply with various covenants, including, without limitation, covenants restricting, subject to certain exceptions, indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, asset sales and the payment of certain dividends. Additionally, the Safe Credit Facility includes customary representations and warranties as well as customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable grace period, would permit Safe to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations of ours under the Safe Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable and foreclose on the collateral securing the Safe Credit Facility. In October 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Safe Credit Facility primarily to enable us to access the $25.0 million incremental facility to replenish funds that we use to make voluntary prepayments under the Margin Loan Facility. \n\nA subsidiary of ours provided a completion and carry guaranty on the Loan (refer to Note 9 to the combined and consolidated financial statements) and is required to maintain a minimum net worth and a minimum liquidity amount both prior to and after the completion of the Project while the Loan is outstanding.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well controlled, reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. We base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances. For all of these estimates, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and, therefore, routinely require adjustment.\n\nFor a discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to Note 3 to the combined and consolidated financial statements of our 2023 Annual Report.\n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n​\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nMarket Risks \n\nMarket risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates, commodity prices and equity prices. In pursuing our business plan, the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk. Our operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets will affect our floating liabilities. Any significant increase in interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that our profitability will not be materially adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates.\n\nIn the event of a significant rising interest rate environment or economic downturn, defaults could increase and cause us to incur additional credit losses which would adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. Such delinquencies or defaults would likely have a material adverse effect on the spreads between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, an increase in interest rates could, among other things, reduce the value of our fixed-rate interest-bearing assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets.\n\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. We monitor the spreads between our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and may implement hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations, including engaging in interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and other interest rate-related derivative contracts. Such strategies are designed to reduce our exposure, on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis, to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes or as a hedge against changes in our credit risk or the credit risk of our borrowers.\n\nThe following table quantifies the potential changes in annual net income, assuming no change in our interest earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, should interest rates decrease or increase by 10, 50 or 100 basis points, assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve (i.e., relative interest rates). Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table.\n\nEstimated Change In Net Income\n\n($ in thousands) \n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Change in Interest Rates**|  ​| **Net Income**(1)  \n-100 Basis Points| ​| $|  276  \n-50 Basis Points| ​|  138  \n-10 Basis Points| ​| ​|  28  \nBase Interest Rate| ​|  —  \n+10 Basis Points| ​|  (28)  \n+50 Basis Points| ​|  (138)  \n+100 Basis Points| ​|  (276)  \n(1)| As of March 31, 2024, we had $83.7 million principal amount of floating-rate debt obligations outstanding and $56.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company has formed a disclosure committee \n\n31\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nthat is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining the disclosure obligations of the Company on a timely basis. The disclosure committee reports directly to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the disclosure committee and other members of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) or Rule 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\n\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this quarterly report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company’s periodic reports.\n\n​\n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\nPART II.
