Year-to-date net income was $82.4 million, an $11.6 million, or 16%, increase from the same period in 2023, resulting in return on average assets (“ROA”) and return on average equity (“ROE”) of 1.60% and 11.53% for the first nine months of 2024. \n\n[Logan Pichel](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Frepublicbank.q4ir.com%2Foverview%2Fofficers-directors%2Fdefault.aspx&esheet=54137822&newsitemid=20241018102681&lan=en-US&anchor=Logan+Pichel&index=2&md5=cad91fe4f4e27db5d713789ced67cce1), President & CEO of the Republic Bank & Trust Company commented, “We are proud to report another strong performance for the third quarter. Our third quarter results reflect our on-going strategic initiatives to enhance revenue, while maintaining our expense discipline. Our success is particularly evident within our Core Bank, as our net interest margin (“NIM”) showed a marked expansion over the third quarter of 2023, while our total noninterest expenses were flat from the same period. Additionally, the diversification of our business segments remained a key component to our long-term strategy and our current success. Overall, four of our five reportable business segments produced solid increases in net income for the third quarter of 2024 versus the third quarter of 2023. \n\nThe Company’s balance sheet during the quarter continued to trend in a positive direction. Deposits grew by $33 million from June 30, 2024 to the September 30, 2024, while we prudently grew the loan portfolio during the quarter by $46 million in Warehouse lending and $9 million in Republic Credit Solutions. Within our Traditional Bank, total loans declined $22 million from June 30, 2024 to $4.6 billion as of September 30, 2024 as our focus remained on pricing discipline. This on-going focus of growing deposits, combined with selective loan portfolio growth, reduced our period-end Total Company loan-to-deposit ratio to 104% as of September 30, 2024 compared to 106% as of September 30, 2023. Steadily reducing our loan-to-deposit ratio, over time, will remain a key focus as we increase our flexibility for key strategic decisions. \n\nWe believe we are well-positioned to finish the year on a high note, as our capital levels remain strong, and our credit quality remains favorable. While we are proud of our past results, we remain optimistic about our future, given the strength of our balance sheet. We are focused on our mission of creating lasting value for our clients, our shareholders, our associates, and the communities we serve.” Pichel concluded. \n\nThe following table highlights Republic’s key metrics for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Solid increases in net interest income and noninterest income combined with flat noninterest expenses and a minimal increase in the Provision were all drivers for the growth in net income and GOP from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. \n\n_Net Interest Income_ _–_ Core Bank net interest income was $54.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, a $4.6 million, or 9%, increase from $50.0 million achieved during the third quarter of 2023. The rise in net interest income for the quarter was driven, in general, by period-over-period growth in average interest-earning assets and a higher net interest margin. The increase in the Core Bank’s total dollars of net interest income represented the second consecutive quarter-over-same-quarter-last-year increase following two consecutive quarterly declines in net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. \n\nThe Core Bank’s NIM increased from 3.43% during the third quarter of 2023 to 3.53% during the third quarter of 2024. This increase represented the first rise in the Core Bank’s quarter-over-same-quarter-last-year NIM since the second quarter of 2023. The increase in the Core Bank’s NIM occurred as the rise in its interest-earning asset yields outpaced the rise in its funding costs. While the Core Bank’s cost of interest bearing liabilities did demonstrate a notable increase of 46 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024, the pace of the increase on a linked-quarter basis began to slow meaningfully during the second quarter of 2024, growing 13 basis points from the first quarter of 2024 to the second quarter of 2024 and only 3 basis points from the second quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2024. \n\nSpecific items of note impacting the Core Bank’s change in net interest income and NIM between the third quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2024 were as follows: \n\n  * Average outstanding Warehouse balances increased from $423 million during the third quarter of 2023 to $528 million for the third quarter of 2024. Committed Warehouse lines declined from $1.0 billion to $902 million during these same periods, while an up-tick in demand caused average usage rates for Warehouse lines to increase from 42% during the third quarter of 2023 to 56% for the third quarter of 2024. \n  * Traditional Bank average loans grew from $4.4 billion with a weighted-average yield of 5.23% during the third quarter of 2023 to $4.6 billion with a weighted average yield of 5.63% during the third quarter of 2024. In general, the growth in average loan balances was primarily attributable to loan growth achieved during the last three months of 2023, as the spot balances for Traditional Bank loans decreased $52 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. \n  * Average interest-earning cash, which is managed as a separate but complementary component of the Company’s overall investment portfolio, was $458 million with a weighted-average yield of 5.36% during the third quarter of 2024 compared to $178 million with a weighted-average yield of 5.38% for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in average interest-earning cash was a strategic decision primarily resulting from the inverted yield curve as the yield for overnight cash remained a more appealing option throughout the first nine months of 2024 than longer-term investment alternatives. Additionally, management also chose to maintain supplemental on-balance sheet liquidity during the first nine months of the year, above required minimums, in response to the uncertainty of the economic environment. \n  * Average investments were $593 million with a weighted-average yield of 3.20% during the third quarter of 2024 compared to $771 million with a weighted-average yield of 2.75% for the third quarter of 2023. As noted above, the more attractive yield for cash generally led to a decrease in the Core Bank’s average investments throughout 2024. Overall, the Core Bank continued to maintain an investment portfolio with a short overall duration as part of its total balance sheet interest rate risk management strategy. \n  * Further segmenting the Core Bank’s increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities: \n    * The weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing deposits increased from 2.08% during the third quarter of 2023 to 2.77% for the third quarter of 2024, while average interest-bearing deposits grew $510 million over the same periods. Included within this growth in interest-bearing deposits was an $145 million increase in the average balances for higher-costing, short-term brokered deposits and third-party listing service deposits, which the Company utilized for excess liquidity purposes. \n    * The average balance of FHLB borrowings decreased from $442 million for the third quarter of 2023 to $388 million for the third quarter of 2024. In addition, the weighted-average cost of these borrowings decreased from 4.85% to 4.41% for the same time periods. The decrease in the average balance of borrowings was driven primarily by the above noted growth in period-to-period average interest-bearing deposits, while the decrease in the overall weighted-average cost of FHLB borrowings resulted from term-extension strategies to take advantage of the inverted yield curve. \n  * Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $176 million from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. The decline in noninterest-bearing deposits continued a trend dating back to the fourth quarter of 2022, as the inverted yield curve and competition for deposits continued to make interest-bearing deposits a more attractive on-going alternative for consumer and business deposit accounts. \n\n\n\nThe following tables present by reportable segment the overall changes in the Core Bank’s net interest income, net interest margin, as well as average and period-end loan balances: \n\n**Net Interest Income** |  **Net Interest Margin**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended Sep. 30,** |  **Three Months Ended Sep. 30,**  \n**Reportable Segment** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change**  \nTraditional Banking  |  $  |  51,023  |  $  |  47,493  |  $  |  3,530  |  3.61  |  %  |  3.52  |  %  |  0.09  |  %   \nWarehouse Lending  |  3,580  |  2,467  |  1,113  |  2.70  |  2.33  |  0.37   \nTotal Core Bank  |  $  |  54,603  |  $  |  49,960  |  $  |  4,643  |  3.53  |  3.43  |  0.10   \n  \n**Average Loan Balances** |  **Period-End Loan Balances**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended Sep. 30,** |  **Sep. 30,** |  **Sep. 30,**  \n**Reportable Segment** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **$ Change** |  **% Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **$ Change** |  **% Change**  \nTraditional Banking  |  $  |  4,579,371  |  $  |  4,446,585  |  $  |  132,786  |  3  |  %  |  $  |  4,566,896  |  $  |  4,496,743  |  $  |  70,153  |  2  |  %   \nWarehouse Lending  |  528,363  |  423,141  |  105,222  |  25  |  595,163  |  457,033  |  138,130  |  30   \nTotal Core Bank  |  $  |  5,107,734  |  $  |  4,869,726  |  $  |  238,008  |  5  |  $  |  5,162,059  |  $  |  4,953,776  |  $  |  208,283  |  4   \n  \n_Provision for Expected Credit Loss Expense_ – The Core Bank’s Provision  (2) was a net charge of $1.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a net charge of $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n\nThe net charge of $1.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 was driven, primarily, by the following: \n\n  * The Core Bank recorded a net credit to the Provision of $442,000 during the third quarter of 2024 primarily related to a decline in Traditional Bank loan balances, which decreased by $22 million for the quarter. \n  * The Core Bank recorded a loan loss Provision of $1.9 million for the charge-off of three linked, marine-related consumer loans. \n  * The Core Bank recorded a net charge to the Provision of $116,000 resulting from general formula reserves applied to an $46 million increase in outstanding Warehouse balances during the quarter. \n\n\n\nThe net charge during the third quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by the following: \n\n  * The Core Bank recorded a net charge to the Provision of $1.6 million during the third quarter of 2023 related to general formula reserves applied to $101 million of Traditional Bank loan growth for the quarter. \n  * The Core Bank recorded a net credit to the Provision of $203,000 resulting from general formula reserves applied to an $82 million decline in outstanding Warehouse balances for the quarter. \n\n\n\nAs a percentage of total loans, the Core Bank’s Allowance (2) increased 1 basis point from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024.

The increase in noninterest income was primarily driven by a $1.2 million increase in mortgage banking income, which resulted from a reduction in long-term interest rates during the third quarter of 2024 leading to an up-tick in consumer loan demand for 15-and 30-year fixed rate mortgage loans. Altogether, the Core Bank experienced a $47.5 million, or 99%, increase in fixed-rate, secondary market loan rate-lock applications from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. \n\n_Noninterest Expense_ – The Core Bank’s noninterest expenses were essentially flat at $42.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of only $15,000 over the third quarter of 2023. Notable line-item variances within the noninterest expense category included: \n\n  * Salaries and benefits were flat as a 41-count reduction in Core Bank FTEs from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was able to substantially offset the increase in salaries over the same periods resulting from annual merit increases. \n  * Technology expenses declined $358,000 from period-to-period, primarily the result of a $450,000 credit the Core Bank received during the third quarter of 2024 for a contract billing dispute with one of its technology providers. \n\n\n\n**Republic Processing Group(3) **\n\nRPG reported net income of $9.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, a $1.0 million, or 12% increase over the $8.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. RPG’s performance for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, by operating segment, was as follows: \n\n**_ Tax Refund Solutions _ **\n\nTRS recorded net income of $919,000 during the third quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $418,000 for the third quarter of 2023. The overall increase in TRS net income for the quarter was driven primarily by a $387,000 increase in recoveries of prior period charge-offs for Refund Advances (“RAs”) and a $340,000 increase in net refund transfer fees. Both of these increases were the positive result of a pick-up in the pace of tax refund payments received from the federal government as compared to third quarter of 2023. \n\n**_ Republic Payment Solutions _ **\n\nNet income at RPS was $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, a $917,000 decrease from the third quarter of 2023. During the quarter, RPS earned a slightly lower yield of 4.91% applied to the $351 million average of prepaid program balances for the third quarter of 2024 compared to a yield of 4.97% for the $343 million in average prepaid card balances for the third quarter of 2023. In addition, net interest income at RPS was also negatively impacted by a $1.3 million charge to interest expense for a revenue sharing arrangement that began in January 2024. \n\n**_ Republic Credit Solutions _ **\n\nNet income at RCS increased $1.4 million, or 29% from $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 to $6.3 million for the third quarter of 2024. The increase in RCS net income was primarily due to growth in profitability of one of its Line-of-Credit (“LOC”) products, which had an increase in net income of $959,000 from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024. The rise in net income for this LOC product was driven primarily by a period-to-period increase in average outstanding loan balances of approximately $8 million. \n\n_Republic Bancorp, Inc.

We strive to create a workplace where everyone feels valued and supported, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, race, age, religion or physical ability.”\n\nRepublic was recognized on Sept. 12 during the virtual [2024 ABA DEI Summit](https://www.aba.com/training-events/conferences/diversity-equity-inclusion-summit), cohosted with Virginia Bankers Association and Maryland Bankers Association.\n\n\"These financial institutions and individuals have worked to create a more inclusive and equitable environment for their employees, customers and communities every day,\" said Cathy Nestrick, ABA’s VP of Women’s Leadership & Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\n\nLed by Duncan, the Republic Bank I&D program enhances the wellbeing of associates, clients and the community through various measures, including developing engaging educational resources and learning opportunities, and actively creating spaces that empower everyone to be their authentic selves. \n\nRepublic’s I&D program leverages data and increases Business Resource Group (BRG) engagement opportunities. The Bank’s BRGs are associate-led, voluntary groups that foster networking, attract diverse talent and contribute ideas and solutions. These groups bring together associates who share common interests, experiences or backgrounds, along with allies who support them. \n\nTo gauge success of the program, Duncan and her team developed the I&D Snapshot Dashboard, an innovative tool that was implemented to bring multiple datapoints together to tell the story of progress, success and accountability. When paired with leadership development opportunities, the tool can enhance a bank leader’s expertise and model behavior to other executive leaders, as well as identify areas of possible implicit bias within the organization.\n\n**About the ABA Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Awards**\n\nThe ABA DEI Awards honor achievement in three categories: the Outstanding Overall DEI Program Award, DEI Outstanding Leader Award and Innovation Incentive Award.

Our strong NPS Score further affirms our passion for delivering exceptional customer experiences across all channels and all parts of the Bank. \n\nWe also had another positive quarter in moderating our operating costs as our Total Company noninterest expenses declined nearly 4% from the second quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2024. We are reporting this reduction in our noninterest expenses despite recent investments we’ve made in new banking centers, the hiring of new talent, and the on-going enhancement of our technology and digital capabilities. We are very proud of the progress we’ve made in our efficiency gains and look forward to building on this progress in the future. \n\nSome of our additional highlights for the second quarter of 2024 include: \n\n  1. Core Bank asset quality remained excellent, with net charge-offs to average loans of only 0.­­­­02% for the quarter and nonperforming loans to total loans of 0.39% as of June 30, 2024. \n  2. We completed the sale of $67 million of lower-yielding mortgage loans during the quarter. We executed this sale as we see opportunities to increase our future earnings through recycling the proceeds from this transaction into other higher yielding loan opportunities. \n  3. Our Traditional Bank loan portfolio grew by $16 million during the second quarter. As expected, our new loan production at the Traditional Bank has been slower during the first six months of 2024 compared to previous periods as we continued to exercise strong pricing discipline for new loan opportunities. While this pricing discipline contributed to the rising yields for the Traditional Bank’s overall loan portfolio, it also reduced the Traditional Bank’s new loan volume, and as a result, the overall opportunity for growth in the Traditional Bank’s loan portfolio since year-end. While this strategy will likely make growing the Traditional Bank’s overall loan portfolio more difficult in the near term, we will continue to make pricing decisions with the long-term future of the Company in mind. \n  4. To take advantage of the currently inverted yield curve and lower our overall borrowing costs during the second quarter of 2024, we borrowed $100 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) on a five-year basis. As a result of this strategy, the Company was able to lock in an annualized cost of 4.42% for these borrowings over the five-year term compared to an annualized cost of 5.55% for overnight borrowings. \n\n\n\nAs it relates to our diversification of revenue streams, our Republic Processing Group (“RPG) continued to produce positive results during the second quarter of 2024. While Republic Payment Solutions (“RPS”) was down slightly for the quarter due to a revenue share arrangement implemented during the first quarter of 2024, both Republic Credit Solutions (“RCS”) and Tax Refund Solutions (“TRS”) had solid increases in net income contributing to a 14% increase in net income for RPG, in total, for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023. \n\nAs we look ahead to the second half of 2024, achieving moderately priced deposit growth will remain a major focus. With our superior customer service, competitive products, convenient locations, and solid digital capabilities, we believe we are well-armed to effectively and efficiently grow our loyal customer base. I am optimistic about our future and the potential for us to create long-term value for our shareholders, our clients, our associates, and the communities we serve,” Pichel concluded. \n\nThe following table highlights Republic’s key metrics for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

Favorable variances across net interest income, Provision, and noninterest expenses, were all drivers for the increase in net income from the second quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2024. \n\n_Net Interest Income_ _–_ Core Bank net interest income was $52.8 million for the second quarter of 2024, a $1.4 million, or 3%, increase from $51.4 million during the second quarter of 2023 and was driven, in general, by period-over-period growth in average interest-earning assets. The quarter-over-same-quarter-last-year increase in net interest income for the Core Bank reversed a negative trend of two consecutive quarterly declines in net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. \n\nWhile net interest income did increase in terms of overall dollars, the Core Bank’s net interest margin (“NIM”) decreased from 3.65% during the second quarter of 2023 to 3.46% during the second quarter of 2024. As with the previous quarters over the past year, the primary driver of the decrease in the net interest margin at the Core Bank was a shift in funding mix away from noninterest-bearing deposit balances into higher-costing, interest-bearing deposits and FHLB borrowings. Overall, the Core Bank’s average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased from $1.5 billion during the second quarter of 2023 to $1.2 billion for the second quarter of 2024. In addition to this change in funding mix, the Core Bank’s cost of interest-bearing liabilities also increased 103 basis points from the second quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2024, outpacing the 60-basis-point increase to its yield on interest-earning assets over the same periods. \n\nAdditional items of note impacting the Core Bank’s change in net interest income and NIM between the second quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2024 were as follows: \n\n  * Average outstanding Warehouse balances decreased from $462 million during the second quarter of 2023 to $457 million for the second quarter of 2024. Committed Warehouse lines declined from $980 million to $957 million during these same periods, while an up-tick in demand caused average usage rates for Warehouse lines to increase from 47% during the second quarter of 2023 to 49% for the second quarter of 2024. \n  * Traditional Bank average loans grew from $4.3 billion with a weighted-average yield of 4.98% during the second quarter of 2023 to $4.6 billion with a weighted average yield of 5.57% during the second quarter of 2024. In general, the growth in average loan balances was primarily attributable to loan growth achieved during the last six months of 2023, as the spot balances for Traditional Bank loans decreased $29 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2023 to June 30, 2024. \n  * Average interest-earning cash, which is managed as a separate but complementary component of the Company’s overall investment portfolio, was $393 million with a weighted-average yield of 5.46% during the second quarter of 2024 compared to $115 million with a weighted-average yield of 5.43% for the second quarter of 2023. The increase in average interest-earning cash balances was the continuance of a strategic decision over the past year for additional on-balance sheet liquidity above required minimums in response to the uncertainty of the economic environment. \n  * Average investments were $670 million with a weighted-average yield of 3.09% during the second quarter of 2024 compared to $775 million with a weighted-average yield of 2.73% for the second quarter of 2023. The Core Bank continued to maintain an investment portfolio during the second quarter of 2024 with a short overall duration as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. As a result of this short duration, the Core Bank has approximately $111 million of investment securities as of June 30, 2024 that are scheduled to mature over the remaining six months of 2024 with a weighted-average yield of 3.69%. \n  * Further segmenting the Core Bank’s increased cost of interest-bearing liabilities: \n    * The weighted-average cost of total interest-bearing deposits increased from 1.59% during the second quarter of 2023 to 2.79% for the second quarter of 2024, while average interest-bearing deposits grew $668 million over the same periods. Included within this $668 million of growth in interest-bearing deposits was a $251 million increase in the average balances for higher-costing, short-term brokered deposits and third-party listing service deposits, which the Company utilized for excess liquidity purposes. \n    * The average balance of FHLB borrowings increased from $256 million for the second quarter of 2023 to $306 million for the second quarter of 2024. Conversely, the weighted-average cost of these borrowings decreased from 4.90% to 4.29% for the same time periods. The increase in the average balance of borrowings was driven, in general, by the above noted growth in period-to-period average loans, while the decrease in the overall weighted-average cost of FHLB borrowings resulted from term-extension strategies to take advantage of the currently inverted yield curve. \n\n\n\nThe following tables present by reportable segment the overall changes in the Core Bank’s net interest income, net interest margin, as well as average and period-end loan balances: \n\n**Net Interest Income** |  **Net Interest Margin**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended Jun. 30,** |  **Three Months Ended Jun. 30,**  \n**Reportable Segment** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **Change**  \nTraditional Banking  |  $  |  49,915  |  $  |  48,743  |  $  |  1,172  |  3.53  |  %  |  3.77  |  %  |  (0.24)  |  %   \nWarehouse Lending  |  2,914  |  2,642  |  272  |  2.57  |  2.28  |  0.29   \nTotal Core Bank  |  $  |  52,829  |  $  |  51,385  |  $  |  1,444  |  3.46  |  3.65  |  (0.19)   \n  \n**Average Loan Balances** |  **Period-End Loan Balances**  \n---|---  \n_(dollars in thousands)_ |  **Three Months Ended Jun. 30,** |  **Jun. 30,** |  **Jun. 30,**  \n**Reportable Segment** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **$ Change** |  **% Change** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **$ Change** |  **% Change**  \nTraditional Banking  |  $  |  4,622,655  |  $  |  4,279,373  |  $  |  343,282  |  8  |  %  |  $  |  4,589,167  |  $  |  4,394,668  |  $  |  194,499  |  4  |  %   \nWarehouse Lending  |  456,908  |  462,755  |  (5,847  |  )  |  (1  |  )  |  549,011  |  539,560  |  9,451  |  2   \nTotal Core Bank  |  $  |  5,079,563  |  $  |  4,742,128  |  $  |  337,435  |  7  |  $  |  5,138,178  |  $  |  4,934,228  |  $  |  203,950  |  4   \n*_Includes loans held for sale_  \n_NM – Not meaningful_  \n  \n_Provision for Expected Credit Loss Expense_ – The Core Bank’s Provision (2) was a net charge of $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to a net charge of $2.1 million for the second quarter of 2023. \n\nThe net charge of $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2024 was driven, primarily, by the following: \n\n  * The Core Bank recorded a net charge to the Provision of $681,000 during the second quarter of 2024 substantially related to general formula reserves applied to Traditional Bank loans. While loan balances at the Traditional Bank only slightly increased by $16 million during the second quarter, the segment continued to experience a change in loan mix, growing in categories such as construction and land development, with higher loan loss reserve requirements thus driving its higher Provision for the quarter. \n\n\n  * The Core Bank recorded a net charge to the Provision of $214,000 resulting from general formula reserves applied to an $86 million increase in outstanding Warehouse balances during the quarter. \n\n\n\nThe net charge of $2.1 million during the second quarter of 2023 was driven, primarily, by the following: \n\n  * The Core Bank recorded a net charge to the Provision of $3.9 million during the second quarter of 2023 substantially related to general formula reserves applied to $229 million of Traditional Bank loan growth for the quarter. \n\n\n  * Offsetting the above, the Core Bank recognized a $2.0 million credit to the Provision during the second quarter of 2023 driven primarily by the release of $1.5 million in COVID-related reserves as the federal government declared an official end to the COVID pandemic effective May 2023. \n\n\n  * The Core Bank recorded a net charge to the Provision of $202,000 resulting from general formula reserves applied to an $81 million increase in outstanding Warehouse balances during the quarter. \n\n\n\nAs a percentage of total loans, the Core Bank’s Allowance(2) increased 4 basis points from June 30, 2023 to June 30, 2024.

The decrease in noninterest income was driven by a $1.7 payment received in June 2023 in the “other” category related to the payout of Bank Owned Life Insurance (“BOLI”). Partially offsetting the decline in noninterest income related to BOLI, mortgage banking income increased $705,000 driven by an up-tick in consumer demand for home purchases. \n\n_Noninterest Expense_ – The Core Bank’s noninterest expenses were $42.6 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $45.5 million for the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of $2.8 million, or 6% for the quarter. The primary driver for the lower noninterest expenses for the second quarter of 2024 was lower salaries and associated estimated incentive compensation accruals, which decreased $1.9 million, or 7%, compared to the second quarter of 2023. This overall decline was driven primarily by a 42-count reduction in the number of Core Bank FTEs from June 30, 2023 to June 30, 2024. \n\n**Republic Processing Group(3) **\n\nRPG reported net income of $10.2 million for the second quarter of 2024, a $1.3 million, or 14% increase over the $8.9 million for the second quarter of 2023. RPG’s performance for the second quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2023, by operating segment, was as follows: \n\n**_ Tax Refund Solutions _ **\n\nTRS recorded net income of $3.1 million during the second quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $2.2 million for the second quarter of 2023. The overall increase in TRS net income for the quarter was driven primarily by a $963,000 decrease in Provision, as net charge-offs for Refund Advances (“RAs”) during the quarter were favorably lower than the Company’s preliminary estimated loan loss reserves as of March 31, 2024. In addition, the Company also received a $560,000 payment during the second quarter of 2024 representing a Tax Provider yield enhancement for the RA program to help offset the Company’s higher funding costs. This yield enhancement was new for the 2024 tax season. \n\n**_ Republic Payment Solutions _ **\n\nNet income at RPS was $2.1 million for the second quarter of 2024, a $759,000 decrease from the second quarter of 2023. While RPS earned a higher yield of 5.03% applied to the $360 million average of prepaid program balances for the second quarter of 2024 compared to a yield of 4.52% for the $364 million in average prepaid card balances for the second quarter of 2023, the higher yield was substantially offset by a $1.3 million charge to interest expense for a revenue sharing arrangement that was new for 2024. \n\n**_ Republic Credit Solutions _ **\n\nNet income at RCS increased $1.1 million, or 29% from $3.9 million for the second quarter of 2023 to $5.0 million for the second quarter of 2024. The increase in RCS net income was primarily due to growth in profitability of one of its Line-of-Credit (“LOC”) products, which had an increase in net income of $938,000 from the second quarter of 2023 to the second quarter of 2024. The rise in net income for this LOC product was driven primarily by a period-to-period increase in average outstanding loan balances of $8.8 million. \n\n_Republic Bancorp, Inc.
