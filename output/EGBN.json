Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nCompany Release - 10/23/2024 4:15 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nEagle grows book value per share by $1.86; Common Equity Tier 1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital leverage ratio to 14.5% and 10.9%, respectively\n\nBETHESDA, Md., Oct. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eagle Bancorp, Inc. (\"Eagle\", the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: EGBN), the Bethesda-based holding company for EagleBank, one of the largest community banks in the Washington D.C. area, reported its unaudited results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nEagle reported net income of $21.8 million or $0.72 per share for the third quarter 2024, compared to a net loss of $83.8 million during the second quarter in which the Company recorded a $104.2 million impairment in the value of goodwill. Operating net income1 in the second quarter, adjusted to exclude the impairment charge on goodwill, was $20.4 million or $0.67 per share per diluted share. Pre-provision net revenue (\"PPNR\")1 in the third quarter was $35.2 million compared to a pre-provision net loss of $69.8 million for the prior quarter, or $34.4 million of PPNR when adjusted to exclude the impairment charge on goodwill1.\n\nThe $1.4 million increase in operating net income1 over the prior quarter is attributed to a positive variance of $2.2 million related to the change in provision for unfunded commitments; $1.6 million increase in non-interest income; and a $490 thousand increase in net interest income, offset by a $1.3 million increase in operating non-interest expense, adjusted to exclude the impairment charge on goodwill, and a $1.1 million increase in provision for credit losses.\n\n\"We continue to strategically position the Company for future growth as evidenced by actions taken during the quarter with the refinancing of our maturing subordinated debt and the recalibration of our common dividend strategy,\" said Susan G. Riel, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. \"We announced the addition of Evelyn Lee to our senior leadership as our Chief Lending Officer for our commercial lending team. As a 25 year banker in the Washington D.C. market, I am excited about accomplishing our strategic goal of continuing to build out our commercial banker group and pursuing diversification of the loan portfolio and growing our relationship deposits,\" added Ms. Riel.\n\nEric R. Newell, Chief Financial Officer of the Company said, \"Raising senior debt in the third quarter demonstrates the confidence debt investors have in our vision and the future of the Company. Operating performance was stable from last quarter evidenced by operating net income1 increasing $1.4 million to $21.8 million in the third quarter. We continued to build our reserve for credit losses, with coverage as a percentage of total held for investment loans at 1.40% increasing 7 basis points from last quarter. Common equity tier one capital increased to 14.5% and our tangible common equity1 ratio exceeds 10%.\"\n\nMs. Riel added, \"I thank all of our employees for their hard work and their commitment to a culture of respect, diversity and inclusion in both the workplace and the communities we serve.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * The Company repaid $70 million of maturing subordinated debt and issued $77.7 million of 10% unsecured senior debt maturing September 30, 2029.\n  * During the quarter, the Company announced a recalibration of the common stock dividend to $0.165 per share from $0.45 per share in the second quarter an action estimated to retain an additional $32 million of capital annually to meet growth and investment objectives.\n  * The ACL as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 1.40% at quarter-end; up from 1.33% at the prior quarter-end. Performing office coverage2 was 4.55% at quarter-end; as compared to 4.05% at the prior quarter-end.\n  * Nonperforming assets increased $38.2 million to $137.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and were 1.22% of total assets compared to 0.88% as of June 30, 2024. Inflows to non-performing loans in the quarter totaled $45.5 million offset by $9 million of outflows, of which $5 million was the loan held for sale at June 30, 2024 and an increase of other real estate owned of $2.0 million. The inflows were predominantly associated with $27.3 million in mixed use land loans and $17.9 million in an assisted living facility loan.\n  * Substandard loans declined $17.0 million to $391.3 million and special mention loans increased $57.1 million to $365.0 million at September 30, 2024.\n  * Net charge-offs for the third quarter were 0.26% compared to 0.11% for the second quarter 2024. Of the total $5.3 million of net charge offs in the quarter, $3.8 million is associated with a senior living property that has not stabilized.\n  * The net interest margin (\"NIM\") decreased slightly to 2.37% for the third quarter 2024, compared to 2.40% for the prior quarter, primarily due to continued decline in average non-interest bearing deposits. Net interest income increased $490 thousand from the second quarter to $71.8 million in the third quarter.\n  * At quarter-end, the common equity ratio, tangible common equity ratio1, and common equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets) ratio were 10.86%, 10.86%, and 14.54%, respectively.\n  * Total estimated insured deposits at quarter-end were $6.4 billion, or 74.5% of deposits, stable from the second quarter total of 72.5% of deposits.\n  * Total on-balance sheet liquidity and available capacity was $4.6 billion at quarter-end compared to $4.0 billion at June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n  * **Net interest income** was $71.8 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to $71.4 million for the prior quarter. The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by an increase in the average balances of deposits held with other banks and average loans partially offset by higher average interest-bearing deposits and higher rates paid on those deposits in the third quarter from the prior quarter.\n  * **Provision for credit losses** was $10.1 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to $9.0 million for the prior quarter. The increase in the provision quarter over quarter reflects higher net charge-offs in the third quarter from the prior quarter. Reserve for unfunded commitments was a reversal of $1.6 million due to lower unfunded commitments in our construction portfolio. This compared to a reserve for unfunded commitments in the prior quarter of $0.6 million.\n  * **Noninterest income** was $6.95 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to $5.33 million for the prior quarter. The primary driver for the increase was higher swap fee income.\n  * **Noninterest expense** was $43.6 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to $146.5 million for the prior quarter. The decrease over the comparative quarters was primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of $104.2 million in the second quarter 2024. When excluding the goodwill impairment charge, the increase quarter over quarter was associated with increased FDIC insurance expense.\n\n\n\n**Loans and Funding**\n\n  * **Total loans** were $8.0 billion at September 30, 2024, down 0.4% from the prior quarter-end. The decrease in total loans was driven by a reduction in commercial loans and income producing commercial real estate loans from the prior quarter-end, partially offset by increased fundings of ongoing construction projects for commercial and residential properties.At September 30, 2024, income-producing commercial real estate loans secured by office properties other than owner-occupied properties were 10.8% of the total loan portfolio, down from 11.3% at the prior quarter-end.\n\n\n  * **Total deposits** at quarter-end were $8.5 billion, up $273.5 million, or 3.3%, from the prior quarter-end. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in time deposits from the company's digital acquisition channel. Period end deposits have increased $165 million when compared to prior year comparable period end of September 30, 2023.\n  * **Other short-term borrowings** were $1.2 billion at September 30, 2024, down 25.3% from the prior quarter-end as maturing FHLB borrowings were paid down with increased cash from deposits.\n\n\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\n  * **Allowance for credit losses** was 1.40% of total loans held for investment at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.33% at the prior quarter-end. Performing office coverage was 4.55% at quarter-end; as compared to 4.05% at the prior quarter-end.\n  * **Net charge-offs** were $5.3 million for the quarter compared to $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2024.\n  * **Nonperforming assets** were $137.1 million at September 30, 2024. \n    * NPAs as a percentage of assets were 1.22% at September 30, 2024, compared to 0.88% at the prior quarter-end. At September 30, 2024, other real estate owned consisted of four properties with an aggregate carrying value of $2.7 million. The increase in NPAs was predominantly associated with $27.3 million in mixed use land loans and $17.9 million in an assisted living facility loan.\n    * Loans 30-89 days past due were $56.3 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $8.4 million at the prior quarter-end. Of the total increase, $25 million was brought current subsequent to quarter-end.\n\n\n\n**Capital**\n\n  * **Total shareholders' equity** was $1.2 billion at September 30, 2024, up 4.8% from the prior quarter-end. The increase in shareholders' equity of $56.0 million was primarily due to increased valuations of available-for-sale securities and an increase in retained earnings.\n  * **Book value per share and Tangible book value per share****3** was $40.61, up $1.86 from the prior quarter-end.\n\n\n\n**Additional financial information:** The financial information that follows provides more detail on the Company's financial performance for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, as well as eight quarters of trend data.

The Company calculates the tangible common equity ratio by excluding the balance of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity, or tangible common equity, and dividing by tangible assets. The Company calculates tangible book value per common share by dividing tangible common equity by common shares outstanding, as compared to book value per common share, which the Company calculates by dividing common shareholders' equity by common shares outstanding. The Company calculates the annualized return on average tangible common equity ratio by dividing net income available to common shareholders by average tangible common equity, which is calculated by excluding the average balance of intangible assets from the average common shareholders' equity. The Company calculates the operating annualized return on average tangible common equity ratio by dividing operating net income available to common shareholders, which adds back the goodwill impairment, by average tangible common equity, which is calculated by excluding the average balance of intangible assets from the average common shareholders' equity. The Company considers this information important to shareholders as the significant impact of the goodwill impairment is a one-time event that obscures the operating performance of the company. Further related to other measures, tangible equity is a measure that is consistent with the calculation of capital for bank regulatory purposes, which excludes intangible assets from the calculation of risk based ratios, and as such is useful for investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate capital adequacy and to compare against other financial institutions.\n\nThe efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing GAAP noninterest expense by the sum of GAAP net interest income and GAAP noninterest income. The efficiency ratio measures a bank's overhead as a percentage of its revenue. The Company believes that reporting the non-GAAP efficiency ratio more closely measures its effectiveness of controlling operational activities. Further, the operating efficiency ratio is measured by dividing non-GAAP noninterest expense, which excludes the goodwill impairment, by the sum of GAAP net interest income and GAAP noninterest income. The Company considers this information important to shareholders as the significant impact of the goodwill impairment is a one-time event that obscures the operating performance of the company.\n\nPre-provision net revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting noninterest expenses from the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. The Company considers this information important to shareholders because it illustrates revenue excluding the impact of provisions and reversals to the allowance for credit losses on loans. Operating pre-provision net revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting noninterest expenses with the impact of the goodwill impairment added back from the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. The Company considers this information important to shareholders as the significant impact of the goodwill impairment is a one-time event that obscures the operating performance of the company.\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30,**| **June 30,**| **September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Net (loss) income**|  $| 21,815| $| (83,802| )| $| 27,383  \nAdd back of goodwill impairment| —| 104,168| —  \nOperating Net (loss) income (Non-GAAP)| $| 21,815| $| 20,366| $| 27,383  \n**(Loss) earnings per share (diluted)****4**|  $| 0.72| $| (2.78| )| $| 0.91  \nAdd back of goodwill impairment per share (diluted)| —| 3.45| —  \nOperating earnings (loss) per share (diluted) (Non-GAAP)| $| 0.72| $| 0.67| $| 0.91  \n  \nOperating net (loss) income and operating (loss) earnings per share (diluted) are non-GAAP financial measures derived from GAAP based amounts. The Company calculates operating net (loss) income by excluding from net (loss) income the one-time goodwill impairment of $104.2 million. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company performed an annual impairment test as a result of management's evaluation of current economic conditions, and concluded that goodwill had become impaired, which resulted in an impairment charge of $104.2 million to reduce the carrying value of the Company's goodwill to zero. The Company calculates operating earnings (loss) per share (diluted) by dividing the one-time goodwill impairment of $104.2 million by the weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. The Company considers this information important to shareholders because operating net (loss) income and operating (loss) earnings per share (diluted) provides investors insight into how Company earnings changed exclusive of the impairment charge to allow investors to better compare the Company's performance against historical periods. The table above provides a reconciliation of operating net income (loss) and operating earnings (loss) per share (diluted) to the nearest GAAP measure.\n\n_______________1 A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and the nearest GAAP measures is provided in the GAAP Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Measure that accompany this document.2 Calculated as the ACL attributable to loans collateralized by performing office properties as a percentage of total loans.3 A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and the nearest GAAP measures is provided in the GAAP Reconciliation to Non-GAAP Financial Measure that accompany this document.4 For periods ended with a net loss, anti-dilutive financial instruments have been excluded from the calculation of GAAP diluted EPS. Operating diluted EPS calculations include the impact of outstanding equity-based awards for all periods.\n\n**EAGLE BANCORP, INC.****CONTACT:** Eric R.
