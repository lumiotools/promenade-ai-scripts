Because the global fleet of commercial airliners has never been older, and carriers are under pressure to modernize.\n\nThat should be music to Boeing shareholders’ ears, but it’s also a positive indicator for the entire industry, which looks poised for a record-shattering 2025. With passenger numbers expected to hit record highs and airlines lifting their guidance, the tailwinds are undeniable.\n\n### An Aging Fleet Amid Soaring Demand\n\nAccording to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the average age of the global fleet of commercial aircraft [now stands at 14.8 years](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2024-releases/2024-12-10-02/)—the highest on record. Compare that to the average long-term age of 13.6 years, and it’s clear that airlines are flying older planes for longer periods. These aging aircraft require more maintenance, more fuel and more repairs, all of which weigh on airlines’ bottom lines.\n\n![Average Age of Global Commercial Airline Fleet at a Record High](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/COMM-average-age-12132024.png)\n\nThe silver lining? This presents a massive opportunity for new aircraft deliveries, and Boeing’s production restart couldn’t come at a better time. The IATA estimates that 1,254 new planes will be delivered this year, potentially followed by 1,802 deliveries in 2025. That would be just shy of the record 1,813 aircraft that were delivered in 2018.\n\n### Boeing’s Bumpy Road to Recovery\n\nBoeing’s journey back to full production has had its challenges. The recent strike by workers halted operations for more than 12 weeks, adding to the planemaker’s headaches. According to Reuters, U.S. regulators capped Boeing’s production at 38 jets per month following the midair blowout incident on an Alaska Air flight earlier this year.\n\nBut Boeing is resilient. With production resuming, analysts at Jefferies predict the company will average 29 737 MAX deliveries per month in 2025. That’s still below Boeing’s target of 56 per month, but it represents solid progress for the manufacturer.\n\nAirline executives are taking notice. Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci [recently acknowledged](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/alaska-air-ceo-says-boeing-quality-is-improving-under-new-leader) that while Boeing’s comeback is still a work-in-progress, he’s seeing “an improving trend” under the company’s new leadership.\n\n### A Billion-Dollar Vote of Confidence\n\nAirlines themselves are brimming with optimism. Alaska, fresh off its acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines, recently announced a [$1 billion share buyback program](https://www.barrons.com/articles/alaska-air-stock-earnings-guidance-buybacks-927afce1) and issued strong financial guidance. The Seattle-based airline—one of the top performers of 2024, gaining 64% year-to-date—expects to post full-year adjusted earnings of at least $5.75 per share in 2025, exceeding Wall Street’s estimates.\n\n![Alaska Has Been One of the Top Performing Airline Stocks of 2024](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/COMM-alaska-airlines-12132024.png)\n\nOther major carriers are singing a similarly bullish tune. American Airlines [raised its profit expectations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-05/american-airlines-boosts-profit-outlook-heading-into-holidays?sref=1pPyLRr7) for the final months of 2024, thanks to robust holiday demand, higher fares and lower fuel costs.\n\nSouthwest Airlines also [lifted its revenue outlook,](https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/southwest-airlines-lifts-revenue-outlook-on-resilient-travel-demand-75ac8b67) citing resilient travel demand and changes to its revenue management practices.\n\n### Record Revenues on the Horizon?\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, the IATA projects total industry revenues to top [$1 trillion for the first time in aviation history.](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/2024-releases/2024-12-10-01/) Passenger numbers are expected to soar to 5.2 billion, a 6.7% increase from 2024 and another all-time high.\n\n![Record-Breaking Projections for Global Airlines in 2025](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/COMM-global-airlines-12132024.png)\n\nA recent Bloomberg Intelligence survey found that 36% of U.S. travelers plan to take vacations in 2025, up from 28% the previous year. High-income households are leading the charge, with 65% of those earning over $150,000 prioritizing vacations. This is a critical demographic for airlines, as premium travelers generate a disproportionate share of profits.\n\n![U.S. Travelers Ready to Splurge on Vacations on 2025](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/COMM-us-travelers-splurge-12132024.png)\n\n### Wheel’s Up!\n\nBoeing’s production restart is a signal that the industry’s supply-side challenges are being addressed.\n\nMeanwhile, surging demand and record-breaking projections for 2025 suggest that airlines are on the cusp of a new era of profitability.\n\nFor investors, travelers and industry stakeholders, we believe the outlook is undeniably bright. The sky’s the limit!\n\n[![7 Airline Investing Terms You need to know - Video](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/07/7-airline-investing-terms-1024x576.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ulHNcnJHr6Y?si=Bk-ZwE8zLs8-PSQN)\n\n### Index Summary\n\n  * The major market indices finished mixed this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.82%. The S&P 500 Stock Index fell 0.64%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.34%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index lost 2.58% this week.\n  * The Hang Seng Composite lost 4.95% this week; while Taiwan was down 0.75% and the KOSPI rose 2.73%.\n  * The 10-year Treasury bond yield rose 24 basis points to 4.4%.\n\n\n\n### Airlines and Shipping\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing airline stock for the week was Alaska Air, up 15.2%. Boeing restarted production of its best-selling 737 MAX jetliner, about a month after the end of a seven-week strike by 33,000 factory workers, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Getting the 737 MAX production line moving again is essential to the heavily debt-burdened plane maker’s recovery, and Boeing has about 4,200 orders for the jetliner from airlines eager to meet growing global demand for air travel, according to Reuters.\n  * Air cargo on the major east-west trade lanes is seeing demand exceed capacity, and this is driving freight rates to 2024 highs on Asian export routes and the transatlantic. The average Shanghai to North Europe spot rate of $5.07/ kg is the highest in almost two years, while the Shanghai-North America rate of $6.61/kg is the highest so far this year, CIBC reports.\n  * Singapore Air has successfully reinstated its post-pandemic capacity and is now focusing on growth, with a projected 5% increase in Available Seat Kilometers (ASK) in the coming years, according to JP Morgan. The airline’s outbound seats for all regions, excluding Northeast Asia, have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Management expects strong air travel demand in the second half of fiscal year 2024 and into 2025.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing airline stock for the week was United Air, down 5.2%. JetBlue lowered its system capacity by 140 basis points (bps) in May. The greatest change was driven by Atlantic capacity, lower by 10%, as the airline lowers frequency between New York-JFK and Paris to once-daily, according to Bank of America.\n  * Iron ore ocean freight rates for the Australia-China and Brazil-China routes have fallen over 30% since the recent mid-November peak, reports Morgan Stanley, with Brazil-China reaching a 20-month low of $17.50 per ton. This weakness likely reflects the slowing pace of export shipments from Australia and Brazil in recent weeks.\n  * Canadian airline web traffic was down 6% year-over-year, on average, in October and November, with October coming in up 6% and November down 18%. Non-mainline web traffic was up 1.2% compared to mainline down 7.5%, suggesting a potential trade down to lower-cost carriers, according to RBC.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * As reported by Goldman, higher Chinese airline stock prices is driven by a potential under-supply scenario driven by a tighter supply, slower new aircraft delivery, and improvement in demand benefiting from China’s macro policy stimulus. Goldman believes that Air China can benefit most from a potentially improved macro environment given its high exposure to business routes.\n\n![Chinese Airline Stocks Are Taking Off](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/AIR-chinese-airline-stocks-12132024.png)\n\n  * Following weeks of sequential decline, UBS expects more meaningful upward pressure on Far East-U.S. spot rates. On Far East-U.S., following the mid-December rate increase, quotes are settling around $6,000-7,500 per container.\n  * The board of Alaska Air Group approved a share repurchase program authorizing the company to buy back up to $1 billion of its common stock. The program will begin after the existing repurchase program is complete. Alaska will launch a premium credit card built for the global traveler, including a Global Companion Award Certificate, 3x miles on all eligible foreign and 3x miles on all dining purchases.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * According to Raymond James, JetBlue believes there is a 5–8-year shortage of MRO capacity. The forecast reflects average aircraft on the ground stepping up from 11 in 2024 to 17/15 in 2025/2026. Based on what Raymond James believes P&W compensation to be, the group estimates at least $0.30-0.35 of missing earnings per share (EPS) in 2025/2026.\n  * Goldman’s baseline forecast sees moderate downside to oil tanker freight rates, although still well above long-term averages. The bank sees significant downside should the present tanker redirections unwind, as this would reduce the inorganic tanker demand support.\n  * According to Morgan Stanley, commercial aircraft retirements remain relatively low and have decreased 23% from an average of 584 retirements per year during 2012-2018 to an average of 450 retirements per year during 2020-2024. The average age of total in-service commercial aircraft has increased from 9.9 years old during 2012-2018 to 11.7 years old today.\n\n\n\n### Luxury Goods and International Markets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Tesla shares reached a new all-time high this week, up 70% year-to-date, with most of the gains occurring since mid-October. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become the first person in history to reach a net worth of $400 billion, surpassing the second richest individual, Jeff Bezos, by approximately $200 billion.\n\n![Tesla Shares Continue To Climb](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/LUX-tesla-shares-12132024.png)\n\n  * U.S. household wealth reached a record high in the third quarter, driven by a stock market rally ahead of the presidential election. The Federal Reserve reported on Thursday that household net worth rose by nearly $4.8 trillion, or 2.9%, from the previous quarter, reaching a total of $168.8 trillion. Continued strong household spending may provide ongoing support for discretionary equities.\n  * Real Real, an online marketplace for the sale of luxury goods in the United States, was the top-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury sector, gaining 36.26% in the past five days. Wells Fargo said the company’s share could double due to structural changes.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Inditex (ITX), best known for its Zara brand, reported weaker-than-expected profits after tax. The company posted a record quarterly profit of €1.68 billion on Wednesday, falling short of the expected €1.77 billion, while shares declined this week.\n  * China reported weaker-than-expected data this week for exports, imports, and money supply. The country is expected to continue its stimulus measures and increase its budget deficit to the highest level in three decades, with the fiscal deficit target potentially reaching 4% of GDP, the largest since 1994.\n  * Cettire, an Australian online marketplace for the sale of luxury goods to customers worldwide, was the worst-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury Index, falling 14.5%. Shares declined on little news. \n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * On Monday, Hong Kong stocks experienced gains following the readout from the Chinese Politburo meeting, which indicated a shift toward a more dovish monetary policy. The key points from the meeting highlighted China’s intention to stimulate consumption, enhance investment efficiency, and expand domestic demand. Furthermore, there was a focus on stabilizing both the stock and property markets. This shift is expected to have positive implications for sectors such as luxury goods, which could see continued growth, especially as China plays a pivotal role in the recovery and turnaround of the luxury market.\n  * Brunello Cucinelli raised its sales forecast for the year, now expecting growth of 11-12%, up from the previously projected 10%. The company revised its outlook as demand for its 2025 collections continues to drive orders. Its strong high-end branding and appeal to ultra-high-net-worth clients are likely to contribute to this growth.\n  * LVMH acquired a minority stake in the boutique hotel group Les Domaines de Fontenille, expanding its travel and experiential offerings to capitalize on the rising demand for luxury travel experiences. The luxury giant already owns the Cheval Blanc and Belmond hotel chains, as well as Bulgari Hotels & Resorts.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * An annual report from Scottish financial advisory firm Noble & Co reveals that the rare and fine whisky market is experiencing a downturn. This decline is attributed to reduced sales volumes, falling prices, and a more cautious consumer outlook. Demand in Asia has significantly weakened, and the market is still adjusting to the post-pandemic period, following a sharp surge in demand during COVID-19.\n  * As educated young Chinese face shrinking white-collar job opportunities, many are turning to lower-paying gig roles like tour guiding, signaling a shift in discretionary spending power. This trend highlights a potential threat to the luxury market, as reduced earnings among this demographic could curb demand for premium goods and experiences, echoing broader economic concerns in a slowing domestic economy, Bloomberg reports.\n  * Lucid, a luxury car maker and distributor, faces a significant challenge in securing an additional $4 billion in funding, which is essential for its next phase of growth. Despite a $4.2 billion investment in 2024, demand for its expensive luxury SUVs in the U.S. has been sluggish. Without this funding, the company risks delaying the launch of a more affordable midsize vehicle that is critical for its long-term financial health.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/09/frank-on-seekingalpha-twt-1024x512.jpg)](https://seekingalpha.com/author/frank-holmes)\n\n### Energy and Natural Resources\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing commodity for the week was natural gas, rising 6.53%. Natural gas climbed as speculators continue to pile into instruments that track the commodity benefiting from supply shocks stemming from Russian LNG disconnect and demand from lower winter temperatures. Natural gas prices have become less about real market fundamentals and more about financial players playing with the system, as policymakers side with risk takers within the industry over the end users, Euractiv reports.\n  * Average U.S. gasoline prices fell below $3 a gallon for the first time in over three years on Monday, extending a run of bargains at the pump for consumers who have faced soaring inflation in recent years. The national average price for regular gasoline fell to $2.97 per gallon, the lowest since May 2021, according GasBuddy.com.\n  * Global liquefied natural gas supply is set to reach 37.3 million metric tons in December, up 7% from last month, Bloomberg NEF estimates. U.S. exports will expand as two new projects are likely to load their first cargoes. Cheniere Energy’s Corpus Christi Stage 3 in Texas could come online this month, while Venture Global’s Plaquemines in Louisiana could start in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\n#### **Weaknesses**\n\n  * The worst performing commodity for the week was sugar, dropping 5.00%. Sugar has entered oversupply territory as Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of sugar, has extended their production season past typical halt periods (December/ January) to attempt to make up for the loss experienced in the first half of November from torrential rains which paused production.\n  * According to Bloomberg, forecasts for both 2024 and 2025 have been cut repeatedly by the International Energy Agency and analysts at OPEC. Since the start of the year, the IEA has reduced its 2024 demand growth forecast by 320,000 barrels a day, to just 920,000. OPEC has lowered its forecast by 430,000 barrels a day. \n  * The world’s largest commodity trading house, Trafigura, took a $1.1 billion loss on employee misconduct in their Mongolian oil business. Their profit dropped 62% on the write-off. Trafigura had flagged in February that they were facing a sizable loss in that business unit. The company – which is entirely owned by its employees – reported net profit of $2.8 billion for its 2024 financial year that ended in September, down 62% from the previous year and the lowest in four years, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * According to CLSA, global lithium markets are finding their footing, with production cuts equivalent to 5% of global supply. CLSA estimates global supply at 1.4 million tons in 2025, with 15% (210 kt) coming from loss-making operations. As project commissioning is deferred and shutdowns occur, oversupply should moderate over the coming years.\n\n![Lithium Prices Appear To Be Bottoming](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/ENGY-lithium-prices-12132024.png)\n\n  * President-elect Trump’s promise to expedite permits for $1 billion investments in the U.S. could revitalize the energy sector, including nuclear power, by removing bureaucratic barriers and accelerating project timelines. This presents an opportunity for the U.S. to strengthen its energy independence, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and modernize its energy infrastructure through a renewed focus on nuclear power and other clean energy sources, Bloomberg reports.\n  * Codelco and Enami, Chile’s two state copper companies, are discussing the possibility of combining their respective efforts to expand smelting capacity into a single project, according to people with knowledge of the matter and Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * According to Morgan Stanley, China’s November net steel exports pulled back by 17% sequentially, declining toward an annualized run-rate of 106 million tons, potentially sending a sigh of relief across seaborne steel markets. A reversal of year-to-date export trends may underpin a normalization in European HRC margins.\n  * China’s oil demand may peak in 2025, reports Bloomberg, five years earlier than expected, as the shift away from gasoline and diesel accelerates, according to a report from the nation’s largest energy producer. Earlier this year, an official with the group said overall demand was not expected to peak until 2030.\n  * Post election political violence in Mozambique is bucking its economy and has forced Syrah Resources to declare force majeure. Syrah, which mines graphite in Mozambique to be processed in the U.S., has been sending samples to Tesla for testing ahead of commercial sales starting in 2025. The revolt is the latest instance of a resurgence of unrest in sub-Saharan Africa, where gaping inequality and perceptions of exclusion have provided fertile ground this year in Kenya, Nigeria and elsewhere, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n### Bitcoin and Digital Assets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performer for the week was Bitget, rising 34.28%.\n  * Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy checks all the boxes for inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 Index, writes Bloomberg, a development that would trigger purchases of the shares by the $451 billion worth of ETFs around the world that directly track the benchmark.\n  * The world’s largest asset manager says that Bitcoin does have a place in multi-asset portfolios. According to Blackrock a 1-2% weighting would produce a similar risk profile to the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks in a standard 60/40 portfolio, writes Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performer for the week was World Coin, down 22.36%.\n  * Bitcoin fell to as low as $92,144 before rebounding to $99,500, as it appears to have been a mini flash crash of the token on December 5. Although it feels like there is still room to run, investors are taking profits, said Josh Gilbert, a market analyst at eToro.\n\n![A Mini-Crash Pulled Bitcoin Toward $92,000](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/CRYP-mini-btc-crash-12132024.png)\n\n  * Thomas Peterffy, the billionaire founder of retail brokerage Interactive Brokers, said investors should own some Bitcoin but not too much. He commented, “For example, we will not allow anyone to invest more than 10% of their assets into Bitcoin because I think that would be very dangerous,” according to a Bloomberg article.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * MicroStrategy purchased an additional $2.1 billion in Bitcoin, financing these acquisitions through a combination of equity and fixed-income securities sales. This marks the fifth consecutive Monday the company has announced Bitcoin purchases. According to Bloomberg, Michael Saylor has accumulated Bitcoin valued at over $41 billion over the past four years.\n  * Hong Kong has pledged to speed up the licensing process for crypto trading platforms, reports Bloomberg, as the region continues its drive to become a cryptocurrency hub. Joseph Chan, acting secretary for financial services and the Treasury, said at the parliament today that the SEC will facilitate a “swift licensing process” and establish a consultative panel that’s expected to commence early next year for licensed trading platforms.\n  * Coincheck, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in Japan, is listing on Nasdaq this Wednesday, reports Bloomberg. The firm is merging with Thunder Bridge Capital to become the second crypto exchange to go public in the U.S. Coincheck reportedly began working on its public listing in 2022 through a de-spac merger deal that valued the exchange at $1.25 billion.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Australian operator of the Kraken crypto exchange, Bit Trade, has been ordered to pay A$8 million for unlawfully issuing a credit facility to more than 1,100 Australian customers, according to the Australian Securities & Investments commission.\n  * Crypto liquidations broke past $1.5 billion within the past 24 hours, Bloomberg writes, as the price of bitcoin retreated from the $100,000 level. Nearly 514,400 traders experienced liquidations, among them $1.38 billion were long positions with $137.7 million in short positions liquidated.\n  * An Austin, Texas, man received a two-year sentence for falsely under reporting capital gains earned from selling $3.7 million in bitcoin, marking the first criminal tax evasion prosecution centered entirely on cryptocurrency, according to Bloomberg.\n\n[![How Different Countries Celebrate Christmas](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2022/12/christmas-around-the-world-twitter-1024x576.jpg)](https://youtu.be/pUvvzYzL-EU?si=B7ywGbpPb0VUimIP)\n\n### Defense and Cybersecurity\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * BAE Systems has signed $2.5 billion contracts with Sweden and Denmark for the delivery of new CV90 combat vehicles, including 115 units for Denmark, 50 for Sweden, and additional vehicles for Ukraine funded jointly by both nations. The contracts cover spares, logistics, training and the latest CV90 version, which incorporates advanced features and lessons from previous deployments.\n  * Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing reported November net revenue of $8.49 billion, a 34% year-over-year increase. The report comes despite a 12.2% decline from October, with January-November revenue up 31.8% compared to 2023.\n\n![Taiwan Semiconductor Has Seen a Steady Rise](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/WAR-taiwan-semiconductor-12132024.png)\n\n  * The best performing stock in the XAR ETF this week was Boeing, rising 10.21%, after investing $1 billion to expand its South Carolina 787 Dreamliner plant, creating 500 jobs and upgrading infrastructure to boost production after a challenging year.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Russia’s military has circumvented Western sanctions to acquire American semiconductors. This includes Texas Instruments components, via shadowy distributors, shell companies and intermediaries in Hong Kong, fueling its war efforts despite U.S. restrictions and monitoring challenges.\n  * Russia is close to securing an agreement with Syria’s new leadership to maintain its military bases at Tartus and Khmeimim, ensuring its strategic presence in the Middle East despite the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad.\n  * The worst performing stock in the XAR ETF this week was Loar Holdings, falling 13.98%. The company announced the launch of a public offering of 4,750,000 shares of its common stock, with proceeds intended for debt repayment and general corporate purposes, subject to market conditions.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Ayar Labs, a San Jose-based semiconductor startup, raised $155 million in funding, boosting its valuation to over $1 billion, to advance its optical I/O technology aimed at improving AI infrastructure with faster data transfer, lower power consumption, and reduced costs.\n  * Apple Inc., in collaboration with Broadcom Inc., is developing a custom AI server chip, code-named Baltra, slated for mass production by 2026. The goal is to expand its silicon capabilities and reduce reliance on Nvidia processors.\n  * Palantir Technologies and Anduril Industries are partnering to accelerate the integration of AI in U.S. military operations, utilizing Anduril’s Lattice software and Palantir’s secure data platform, while inviting other companies to join their effort.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Russian forces have advanced within six kilometers of the strategic city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk, escalating their costly offensive against outnumbered Ukrainian defenders who are fiercely resisting.\n  * The fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria after rebel advances has created a power vacuum, raising fears of chaos and competition among factions as regional and global powers navigate the uncertain transition.\n  * NASA’s Artemis moon missions have been delayed to 2026 and 2027 due to technical issues, cost overruns, and shifting priorities, with potential program changes under the new Trump administration\n\n\n\n### Gold Market\n\nThis week gold futures closed at $2,666.90, up $7.90 per ounce, or 0.27%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week lower by 0.17%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in off 0.39%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar rose 0.88%.\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing precious metal for the week was gold, up 0.27%. According to Bank of America, central bank gold inflows totaled 2,575 tons over the past five years, with the largest buyers being China (+412 tons, a 22% increase in holdings), Türkiye (+359 tons or +141%), Poland (+299 tons, or +232%), India (+280 tons, or +47%) and Russia (+223 tons, or +11%). \n  * Gold rose after China’s central bank added bullion to its reserves for the first time in seven months. That was the first addition since April, which was the end of an 18-month run of purchases that had helped underpin prices, according to Bloomberg.\n  * Premiums for gold and silver futures in New York swelled as traders weighed the possibility of precious metals being included in sweeping tariff measures proposed by President-elect Donald Trump. The price moves have been fueled by short covering by banks and funds who are buying Comex futures and selling contracts in London, said Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at MKS Pamp SA.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing precious metal for the week was silver, down 2.05% with its higher beta to gold’s volatility. According to Morgan Stanley, the November month-over-month (MoM) import value of lab-grown diamonds fell by-30% MoM/28% year-over-year (YoY), while export value fell by a steeper 54% MoM/42% YoY. This also points to some inventory build-up. The trend of market-share gains vs. natural stones appears to have paused in November as both markets declined sequentially by a similar order of magnitude.\n  * Torex Gold Resources announced it has received a notification from the Director General of Mines under the Federal Ministry of Economy that all activities within its Morelos Property are to be suspended to support their inspection associated with the fatal incident at the ELG Underground on December 5, according to Scotia.\n  * Lundin Gold shares fell Tuesday after the company reported higher costs projections from its operations as part of its guidance. The Canadian gold miner said late Monday that it expects to produce about 475,000 to 525,000 ounces of gold from its operations in 2025, according to Dow Jones.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Gold may get a modest setback from the Federal Reserve this month, but options traders are optimistic this will just be a blip in the road higher. More broadly, gold found a new lease on life this year, with investors moving away from swaying to the tune of real rates and, instead, finding inspiration from market pricing for the Fed funds rate, according to Bloomberg.\n  * Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently commented that Bitcoin was like “digital gold,” and he did not see it as a threat to the dominance of the U.S. dollar. However, some might interpret that Powell just said that Bitcoin is just as good as gold, or in fact it has been better than gold in price appreciation under current economic conditions! Stifel Equity Strategy team led by Barry Bannister presented the argument that makes gold and Bitcoin look like polar opposites when you consider the conditions what drives their respective asset values. Barry contends that Bitcoin needs a dovish Fed coupled with low inflation and sold economic growth as it primary price driver. Gold is more defensive and tends to perform better in an inflationary environment. Tariffs could be the first disruption to reset core inflation closer to 3% by the second half of 2025, trigger higher interest rates and risk an economic slowdown.\n\n![Bitcoin Relative to Gold](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/GLD-bitcoin-relative-gold-12132024.png)\n\n  * Gold prices can break through the $3,000 barrier by the end of next year—even if the dollar stays high, Goldman Sachs said, pushing back on recent commentary. The team advises investors to watch the Federal Reserve’s actions, not the dollar, to determine how high gold prices can go in 2025. \n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * On a recent episode of MSNBC’s All In, host Chris Hayes said that a Senate bill could potentially result in a $100 billion transfer from taxpayers to Bitcoin owners. The bill, proposed by Sen. Cynthia Lummis, calls for the U.S. Treasury to acquire 1 million Bitcoins over a span of five years, with a holding period of at least 20 years.\n  * Bitcoin has soared more than 50% since Nov. 4, topping $100,000 in part on hopes that crypto advocate—having donated some $135 million to Trump and dozens of successful congressional campaigns—will persuade Trump to make the crypto reserve a reality, according to Bloomberg.\n  * Zimbabwe is planning to hold 26% of new mining projects on a free carry basis and will also negotiate with existing operators to acquire a similar stake. “We need to move to a level where we reach 26% shareholding in most of the big projects,” Zimbabwe’s Secretary for Mines Pfungwa Kunaka told Bloomberg in an interview.\n\n[![Stay Empowered With Valuable Insights - Subscribe to the Frank Talk Blog!](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/10/stay-empowered-ft-twt-2023-1024x512.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/frank-talk-subscribe/) [![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/01/lL-files-1.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/LLFiles-12132024.pdf)\n\nU.S. Global Investors, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

But it happened: Bitcoin has traded above $100,000 for the first time ever.\n\nGlobal adoption of the world’s largest digital asset by market cap is getting harder to ignore. We’re no longer talking about magic internet money favored by tech enthusiasts. We’re talking about a serious financial asset that central banks, corporations and even national governments are now paying close attention to.\n\nConsider the most recent developments: President Nayib Bukele’s El Salvador, the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, has [reported more than $333 million in Bitcoin profits.](https://x.com/nayibbukele/status/1864506095131144278)\n\nAnd here in the U.S., everyone’s talking about the incoming Trump administration’s plans to establish its own strategic Bitcoin reserve.\n\n### **More Than Digital Gold**\n\nPart of Bitcoin’s allure is that it shares many characteristics with gold. This week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he believes Bitcoin is a [competitor to gold rather than the U.S. dollar.](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fed-chair-jerome-powell-is-correct-bitcoin-is-in-competition-with-gold-not-the-dollar)\n\n“It’s just like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital,” Powell told the audience at the _New York Times’_ s DealBook Summit.\n\nI believe this comparison says a lot. Gold has been a trusted store of value for thousands of years, prized for its scarcity and global liquidity. Central banks just reported buying 60 metric tons of the precious metal in October, the [most in a single month this year.](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/gold-focus/2024/12/central-bank-gold-statistics-october-2024)\n\n![October Marked 2024's Highest Monthly Central Bank in Gold Buying](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/COMM-october-highest-central-bank-gold-buying-12062024.png)\n\nBitcoin shares these attributes in a modern, digital form. Unlike fiat currencies, there’s a fixed supply of Bitcoin, capped at 21 million coins. That scarcity, combined with growing trust and acceptance, has helped it ascend to this six-figure milestone.\n\nFor the record, I don’t believe gold is going anywhere. It’s been around for over 5,000 years and is deeply ingrained in global commerce and traditions. Gold trades over [$160 billion every day,](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/gold-trading-volumes) second only to the S&P 500, according to the World Gold Council (WGC). Plus, unlike Bitcoin, gold has many practical use cases, from jewelry to electronics.\n\nBut Bitcoin is carving out its own path, proving it can also serve as a store of value in turbulent times. The chart below shows the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio, which tells you how many ounces of gold it takes to buy one Bitcoin. This week, the ratio surpassed 38, a new all-time high.\n\n![Bitcoin Priced in Gold at an All-Time High as the Digital Asset Exceeds $100,000](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/COMM-bitcoin-priced-in-gold-12062024.png)\n\n### **Political Winds Shifting in Bitcoin’s Favor**\n\nIt’s not just Wall Street that is warming to Bitcoin. The political climate appears to be shifting as well.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump—a former crypto skeptic turned fan—recently nominated Paul Atkins, a conservative and crypto-friendly lawyer, to replace Gary Gensler as the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). During his tenure at the SEC from 2002 to 2008, Atkins fought for balanced, innovation-friendly policies. His return could pave the way for more regulatory clarity, attracting even more institutional capital into the crypto space.\n\nTrump also just named billionaire venture capitalist David Sacks as his “AI and crypto czar.” Sacks, a member of the so-called PayPal Mafia, is another strong advocate for clear regulations in cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. His leadership, I believe, could help position the U.S. as a global leader in emerging technologies, including Bitcoin, blockchain and AI.\n\nAnd on Capitol Hill, Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, a longtime Bitcoin advocate, has proposed the BITCOIN Act, which, if passed, would lead to the creation of a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. Just as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) ensures a steady supply of oil in times of emergency, a Bitcoin reserve could serve as a digital financial backstop, a buffer against economic shocks and runaway inflation.\n\n### **Analysts’ Forecasts Turn (Even More) Bullish**\n\nMajor financial institutions and research firms aren’t sitting idle. Bernstein Private Wealth Management projects Bitcoin could [reach $200,000 by late 2025,](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/gold-trading-volumes) a forecast [echoed by Standard Chartered.](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/05/bitcoin-will-double-to-200000-by-the-end-of-2025-says-standard-chartered.html)\n\nOne of the key drivers of these higher forecasts is the inflow of institutional money. Big investors—[corporations,](https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/innovation/companies-holding-bitcoin-on-their-balance-sheets-a-strategic-investment-) [pension funds,](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/11/04/first-uk-pension-fund-invests-in-bitcoin) [endowments](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-03/bari-weiss-university-is-creating-a-bitcoin-fund-for-endowment)—are starting to treat Bitcoin as a legitimate part of a diversified portfolio. According to analysts, if U.S. retirement funds or a proposed U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve started accumulating even a small percentage of their assets in Bitcoin, demand could skyrocket.\n\nMicroStrategy, a publicly traded company, has shown leadership in this area. Its aggressive three-year Bitcoin purchasing plan has already exceeded expectations. Its strategy? Treat Bitcoin like a corporate treasury reserve asset.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/COMM-publicy-traded-companies-largest-hodl-12062024.png)\n\n### **Allocate Responsibly**\n\nSo, what does all this mean for investors?\n\nFirst, it means that Bitcoin is no longer a fringe phenomenon. At over $100,000 per coin, it’s a force to be reckoned with, attracting serious interest from global institutions and governments.\n\nThat said, investing in Bitcoin should still be approached thoughtfully. Volatility remains high. While gold typically moves at a measured pace, Bitcoin’s price can swing more dramatically. Proper allocation could provide exposure to Bitcoin’s growth potential without taking on excessive risk.\n\nAs regulators become more crypto-friendly, and as the U.S. government considers strategic reserves, Bitcoin’s credibility and staying power have only grown. This isn’t to say Bitcoin will replace gold overnight or that it comes without risks. But after crossing the psychologically important $100,000 mark, it’s clear that the world’s largest cryptocurrency is maturing into a bona fide financial instrument worthy of consideration.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/gold-bitcoin-YT-1024x576.jpg)](https://youtu.be/sB690WrZjGc?si=K-MEODaVR2KALeTC)\n\n### Index Summary\n\n  * The major market indices finished mixed this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.60%. The S&P 500 Stock Index rose 0.96%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 3.34%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index lost 1.06% this week.\n  * The Hang Seng Composite lost 2.62% this week; while Taiwan was up 4.18% and the KOSPI fell 1.13%.\n  * The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell 2 basis points to 4.15%.\n\n\n\n### Airlines and Shipping\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing airline stock for the week was American Air, up 19.8%. Air Canada, once again, is very active on its share buyback, repurchasing the daily maximum every day. The company has now repurchased 9.6 million shares at an average price of $23.86 since the start of the program. Total authorization is for 35.8 million shares and runs to November 4, 2025. The stock has been up 32% since reporting third quarter results at the beginning of November.\n\n![Air Canada Skyrockets Due to Share Repurchse Program](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/AIR-air-canada-skyrockets-12062024.png)\n\n  * U.S. container volumes grew 15-20% year-over-year in November, showing unseasonally strong demand during the slack season. This is led by pre-shipping ahead of tariffs and another potential U.S. East Coast port strike from January 15, 2025, according to Bank of America.\n  * On a trailing seven-day basis, TSA throughput rose 14.3%, well ahead of last week’s -1.9%, reports Bank of America. This year’s Thanksgiving week throughput was up 3.1% ahead of 2023, with Sunday, December 1, seeing the highest single-day throughput since the TSA began publishing data in 2019.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing airline stock for the week was Skywest, down 4.5%. According to Bank of America, domestic Japan airline profits are trending below pre-COVID levels with limited pricing power given price sensitive demand and elevated unit costs on the weaker Yen and higher jet fuel. JAL and ANA are focused on boosting load factors for now with second half 2025-unit prices trending slightly down year-over-year. \n  * According to Stifel, the market has already softened in the tanker, dry bulk, and LNG markets, although thus far very little in any of those categories has been scrapped. This year, tanker scrapping is 88% below normal levels, dry bulk is 66% below, and LNG is roughly in line. However, very little scrapping in almost every category has been done in many years. Currently, 17% of the tanker fleet is above 20 years old, 13% of dry bulk vessels, and 11% of container ships.\n  * Chinese domestic air travel spending declined 10% year-over-year in November 2024 with domestic yields almost -20% year-over-year, suggesting earnings pressure in the fourth quarter, according to Bank of America. \n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * American Airlines expects cash remuneration from the new co-brand credit card and other partners to increase 10% per annum, reports Goldman. American’s last twelve-month remuneration is $5.6 billion, with management noting that as this figure approaches $10 billion it will drive an incremental $1.5 billion in pretax income versus expected 2024 results.\n  * According to Stifel, on January 1, the first wave of Fuel EU Maritime regulations take effect, which requires ships calling on EU ports to have an increasing component of low carbon fuel/reduced emissions. Ultimately, the plan calls for an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 but starts with a 2% change in 2025.\n  * Honeywell and Bombardier announced an agreement that includes collaborative research and development centered on Honeywell Anthem avionics, selection of more powerful engines, and next-generation satellite communications technologies for Bombardier aircraft. After-market offerings and new technologies provide Honeywell revenue potential of up to $17 billion over the life of the agreement.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Bank of America estimates that Airbus delivered 76 aircraft in November versus 61 last year. If correct, this would bring the total to 635 aircraft year-to-date and requires 115 aircraft to meet the low estimate of expectations at 750 aircraft. This compares to 112 last year in December.\n  * Looking ahead to January through March, JPMorgan thinks shipping share prices might weaken because: 1) expectations for upward revisions to guidance in the third quarter may already be priced in to an extent, 2) sentiment might deteriorate as cargo movement and freight rates decline due to seasonal factors in January through March, and 3) cargo movement could slow down if the U.S. hikes tariffs.\n  * According to UBS, next year Frontier is likely to face meaningful cost pressures from lower sale leaseback gains as well as higher rent expenses. The group calculates that these factors together could drive 700-800 basis points of CASM-ex increase in 2025. As such, for the company to expand its margins, they think it is imperative that it drives a strong RASM increase.\n\n\n\n### Luxury Goods and International Markets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The final Eurozone Services PMI for November was reported at 49.5, slightly above the preliminary reading of 49.2. In China, the Caixin Services PMI remains in expansionary territory, reported at 51.5. Additionally, China surprised investors with a stronger-than-expected Manufacturing PMI, which stood at 50.3 in November.\n  * This week, the S&P 500 Index reached a new high, while equities in Germany, Europe’s strongest economy, also hit a record. U.S. stocks, as measured by the S&P 500, have gained 29% in 2024, while the Deutsche Börse AG Germany Stock Index (DAX) has surged 21% year-to-date.\n  * Hugo Boss was the top-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury sector, gaining 23.6% in the past five days. Share gained after UBS raised its rating for the company.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * In the United States, ISM’s Services PMI fell a greater-than-expected 3.9% in November, to 52.1. The final November reading for S&P Global U.S. Service PMI was reported at 56.1, below the preliminary reading of 57.0. The U.S. Services PMI and the S&P Global U.S. Services PMI are both economic indicators that measure the health of the U.S. services sector, but they are based on different methodologies and are published by different organizations.\n  * The U.S. November unemployment rate unxepectatdly increaed to 4.2%, from 4.1% in the prior month. Expectations for the Fed to cut interest rates later this month increaed to 87% from 70%.\n  * Segnet Jewelers was the worst-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury Index, falling 9.1%. Shares declined after the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results amid Noth American weakness.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * This week, HSBC upgraded its ratings for Hermes, Louis Vuitton and Burberry while Goldman Sachs raised its ratings for Prada and Moncler. UBS raised its ratings for Hugo Boss and Ferragamo, while brokers increased price targets for Richemont and Swatch, citing reduced downside risk for the sector after this year’s selloff. Despite the recent market downturn, stock picking remains crucial, as luxury stocks are expected to continue diverging based on each company’s ability to generate strong sales.\n  * The recent start to the holiday shopping season, with Black Friday specials and Cyber Monday deals, highlights consumers’ continued resilience. According to NRF data, shoppers spent an average of $235 during the five-day shopping period from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, up slightly from $227 last year.\n  * Two European cities, Zurich and Vienna, were voted the best cities for expats in a Mercer report, with western European cities dominating. Boston was the highest ranked city in the United States, ranked number 32, and New York city was ranked 45.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * France joined Germany in political turbulence due to disagreement over the country’s budget proposal. French borrowing costs have surged due to concerns of a political showdown in Parliament over spending cuts and tax increases. France’s fiscal situation is worse than that of Greece, Spain, and Italy, with its deficit rising to 6.1% of GDP, up from 5.5% last year, and debt exceeding €3.2 trillion, over 112% of GDP.\n\n![French Debt Levels Are Expected To Continue To Rise Amid Large Budget Deficit](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/LUX-french-debt-levels-12062024.png)\n\n  * General Motors recorded over $5 billion in impaired charges and write-downs on its joint venture in China, as the company faces market challenges and increased competition. The Chinese car market has shifted toward electric vehicles, leaving less room for traditional cars. According to Citi analyst Jeff Chung, Chinese car buyers are expected to purchase around 23 million new vehicles in 2024, up from 20 million five years ago. Of these, only 12 million will be gasoline-powered, down from 20 million, while all-electric and plug-in hybrid sales have surged to 6 million and nearly 5 million, respectively.\n  * Kering issued another warning about its 2024 financial outlook due to weak China demand, expecting the operating income to nearly halve. The company reported a 16% drop in revenue in the third quarter.\n\n[![Invest in your future with the ABC Investment Plan](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/02/be-savvy-USGI-1-1024x512.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/invest-with-us/)\n\n### Energy and Natural Resources\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing commodities for the week were cocoa, up 4.54%, followed by coffee, rising 3.84% and then sugar up 3.46%. Life’s pathway to indulgence is getting more expensive. Incidentally, these are all equatorial crops that could be impacted by climate change. According to JP Morgan, Chinese steel demand has rebounded and is now down just 1% year-over-year in October; output has recovered rapidly through October and into November as steel margins improve, and steel inventory remains below seasonal average levels.\n  * Zinc could see more sharp price swings as growing tightness along the metal’s supply chain leaves buyers exposed to sudden changes in availability. The spike was fueled by the withdrawal of huge volumes from LME warehouses, which stoked speculation of a potential squeeze on short-position holders, according to Bloomberg.\n\n![Zinc Prices Have Risen Sharply In 2024](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/ENGY-zinc-prices-12062024.png)\n\n  * Canada now has some leeway with the expansion their Trans Mountain pipeline to redirect oil exports away from US markets directly to their west coast for international export, and thus could potentially blunt some of Trump’s tariffs. A substantial amount of Canadian oil goes to US refiners on the west coast, so plants operated by Chevron, Marathon Petroleum and Valero Energy could be forced to more expensive oil purchases.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing commodity for the week was natural gas, dropping 8.33%. on mild weather forecast and a lower-than-expected drop in inventories, as reported by _Bloomberg_. According to Morgan Stanley, oil exports from Iran appear to have started declining in late October and early November. Vortexa data indicates that recent exports have averaged just 1 million barrels per day, down from 1.5 million barrels per day for much of the year.\n  * UBS’s weekly refining margins tracker shows a significant decline. The average refining margin for the week fell by $2.48 per barrel to $3.89 per barrel. The largest drop was in middle distillates: diesel decreased by $3.61 per barrel to $15.28 per barrel, while jet fuel dropped $3.47 per barrel to $13.26 per barrel. Gasoline margins also declined, falling $2.19 per barrel to $7.01 per barrel.\n  * According to BMO, average cobalt standard-grade metal prices in 2024 are projected to range between $12.10 and $12.30 per pound. When compared to historical annual average prices adjusted for inflation dating back to the early 1900s, 2024 is on track to be the worst year on record for cobalt prices.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * According to Bank of America, exploration is technically challenging, expensive and risky. Historically, it has a low “hit” rate with only 1 target out of 1,000 delivering a potentially economic deposit. By applying AI to early-stage target identification, and exploration processes, innovators are trying to improve these odds. Should the approaches prove viable, there is great opportunity for disruption.\n  * APA Corp. says gas will always be an essential part of the energy mix for miners in the iron ore-rich Pilbara, where it has a $3 billion growth strategy linked to the big miners with ambitious decarbonization targets. APA plans to build solar farms and battery storage on big tracts of land it picked up in the $1.7-billion acquisition of Alinta Energy’s Pilbara power network as miners like BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue grapple with how best to secure renewable energy supplies, according to The Australian.\n  * Meta Platforms Inc. is seeking as much as 4 gigawatts of new nuclear energy to run data centers and support the U.S. electric grid, starting in the early 2030s. The Facebook parent is asking developers to submit proposals to deliver 1 gigawatt to 4 gigawatts of reactor capacity, according to a statement Tuesday.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * According to Bloomberg, the copper pipeline for the period 2024–2033 includes 51 projects, of which 11 are new, according to data released Wednesday by Chilean copper agency Cochilco. The updated investment estimate is 27% higher than a previous projection for 2023-2032, according to a presentation at the mining ministry in Santiago.\n  * China announced an outright ban on exports of several materials with high-tech and military applications, in a tit-for-tat move after President Joe Biden’s government escalated technology curbs on Beijing. Gallium, germanium, antimony and superhard materials are no longer allowed to be shipped to America, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement Tuesday.\n  * Many Chinese metal importers have stopped buying U.S. copper scrap in anticipation of tariffs when Donald Trump assumes the presidency, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. The purchases were halted from mid-November because those cargoes are likely to arrive around the time Trump takes office on Jan. 20, the state-owned researcher said in a note, citing its survey of traders.\n\n\n\n### Bitcoin and Digital Assets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performer for the week was Curve DAO, rising 144.31%.\n  * Crypto trading volume climbed to an all-time high in November, with more than $10 trillion of digital assets changing hands for the first time on centralized spot and derivatives exchanges. Crypto markets have surged amid optimism for a friendlier regulatory environment for the industry under the newly elected Trump administration, according to Bloomberg. \n  * Cryptocurrency speculators kept Bitcoin in sight of the landmark $100,000 after digital-asset proponent Paul Atkins was selected by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to lead the SEC, writes Bloomberg. The original digital asset erased earlier losses to trade about 1% higher at around $97,300 on Wednesday following a more than 40% advance since Trumps decisive election victory.\n\n![Bitcoin Eyes $100,00 Mark](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/CRYP-bitcoin-eyes-100k-11222024.png)\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performer for the week was RAY, down 15.03%.\n  * Options suggest that some traders may have already started to hedge against a potential pullback in Bitcoin after the original cryptocurrency surged to more than $100,000 for the first time. There has been an uptick in demand for puts with strike prices of $95,000, and $100,000 has seen the largest open interest position over the last 24 hours. \n  * Crypto traders have triggered vertiginous jumps in digital assets beyond Bitcoin, stirring up memories of a buying frenzy that swept the market during the pandemic before giving way to an epic bust. Unsung tokens such as CRV, TRX and IOTA from the digital ledger of the same name have jumped over 40% in the past five days, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * President-elect Donald Trump’s pick of a crypto proponent to be the next head of the U.S. securities regulator lifted Bitcoin to $100,000 for the first time, reports Bloomberg, as traders warmed to the prospect of relaxed regulations. Bitcoin rose as much as 6.1% to $103,801 on Thursday.\n  * Etoro is working with Goldman Sachs group on a potential initial public offering in the U.S. The trading and investment platform is considering going public as soon as the second quarter though that timeline is subject to change. The company is seeking a valuation above the $3.5 billion figure, writes Bloomberg. \n  * Donald Trump says he is selecting venture capitalist David Sacks of Craft ventures LLC to serve as his artificial intelligence and crypto czar, a newly created position that underscores the president-elect’s intent to boost two rapidly developing industries, Bloomberg reports. \n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * The UK police said they have shut down Russian networks that were moving billions of dollars for oligarchs, street gangs and spies by swapping cash for cryptocurrency across Europe, the Middle East and South America, Bloomberg writes. Officers at the National Crime Agency unveiled a complex laundromat that they said could support almost any crime, the article continues.\n  * Bitcoin and the broader crypto market are witnessing strong demand for bullish leveraged plays, a sign the market is overheated. While market makers hedging is likely to keep BTC supported at around $100,000, the heightened activity raises the risk of pullbacks for other cryptocurrencies. \n  * Despite online backlash, Solana memecoin Hawk has dropped over 90% in market cap. The token was launched by Hailey Welch who went viral earlier this year for her quote “Hawk Tuah” in a street interview video posted on YouTube, according to Bloomberg.\n\n[![How Well Do You Know Bitcoin History? - Test Your Knowledge!](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/11/bitcoin-history-quiz-twt-2023-1024x512.png)](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/how-well-do-you-know-bitcoin-history/)\n\n### Defense and Cybersecurity\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Rheinmetall AG has strengthened its position in the U.S. defense market by acquiring Loc Performance Products for $950 million, gaining expanded production capacity, workforce, and capabilities to support military programs like the XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle.\n  * Honeywell has signed a strategic $17 billion aviation technology deal with Bombardier, settled pending litigation, and revised its 2024 earnings and sales guidance downward, impacting its stock price.\n\n![Honeywell Stock Edges Higher](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/WAR-honeywell-edges-higher-12062024.png)\n\n  * The best performing defense stock this week was National Presto INDS, rising 11.06% after trading volume increased as much as seven times the 20-day average, making it the top performer among peers.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * French President Emmanuel Macron’s government collapsed amid Marine Le Pen’s rising influence, deepening political deadlock, economic uncertainty, and increasing public frustration. This comes as France edges closer to a far-right administration.\n  * Airbus plans to cut 2,043 jobs in its Defense and Space division by mid-2026, focusing on combat aircraft, connected intelligence, and headquarters roles. The cuts come amid heavy losses and increased competition in the U.S. satellite market.\n  * The worst performing defense stock this week was Aerovirnment, falling 16.03%, after second-quarter earnings missed expectations due to higher spending, with analysts citing weaker profits, increased operating expenses and softer revenue guidance.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * TSMC is reportedly in talks with Nvidia to produce its Blackwell AI chips at a new plant in Arizona.\n  * Huntington Ingalls announced its acquisition of South Carolina-based W International’s assets, integrating advanced metal fabrication facilities and skilled workers into its Newport News Shipbuilding division to support U.S. Navy programs. This includes nuclear-powered submarine and aircraft carrier production, with the transaction expected to close by the end of 2024.\n  * The UK plans to “war-game” its defense supply chain resilience while developing a new strategy to boost local industries and raise defense spending to 2.5% of GDP amid growing geopolitical threats.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Russian tycoon Konstantin Malofeev predicts Moscow will reject a Ukraine ceasefire proposed by Donald Trump, insisting a truce offers “zero benefits” as Russia believes it is winning and seeks further concessions.\n  * Syrian insurgents led by HTS and Turkish-backed militias captured the city of Hama in a significant setback for President Assad after taking Aleppo. Ongoing offensives target Homs, as regional and international dynamics complicate support for the Syrian government.\n  * Iran plans to begin enriching uranium to 5% purity using thousands of advanced centrifuges at its Fordo and Natanz facilities, signaling potential leverage in negotiations with the West despite ongoing regional tensions and its previous near weapons-grade enrichment activities.\n\n\n\n### Gold Market\n\nThis week, gold futures closed at $2,654.80, down $26.20 per ounce, or 0.98%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week lower by 1.64%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in off 0.66%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar rose 0.25%.\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best-performing precious metal for the week was silver, up 1.26%. According to BMO, the first silver pour at Aya’s Zgounder expansion was achieved, in line with previous commentary after ore processing in the new plant commenced. The plant reached nameplate capacity of 2ktpd, and commercial production continues to be targeted for year-end.\n  * Australia’s biggest gold miner, Northern Star, has agreed to buy smaller rival De Grey Mining for $3.3 billion, as the soaring value of the precious metal bankrolls the highest price ever offered for an undeveloped Australian gold project, according to the Financial Review. On Friday, SSR Mining agreed to buy the Cripple Creek and Victor gold mines in Colorado from Newmont Corp. for an upfront cash payment of $100 million.\n  * Gold buying by central banks surged to 60 tons in October, mainly led by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which added 27 tons of the precious metal to its reserves, the World Gold Council (WGC) said on Thursday. India added 27 tons of gold in October, bringing its total gold purchases to 77 tons from January to October, according to WGC data based on reported monthly data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing precious metal for the week was palladium, down 3.11%. According to Scotia, B2Gold announced that a strike has begun at the company’s Fekola mine in Mali with the Fekola workers union giving notice that the strike will last until December 5. BTO continues to process ore through the Fekola mill during this period and noted that it still expects fiscal year 2024 production to be toward the lower end of its 420-450k ounce guidance. Additionally, Mali issued an arrest warrant for Barrick Gold’s CEO Mark Bristow as they have not settled their tax dispute with the company.\n  * De Beers has cut diamond prices by more than 10% across the board as the world’s biggest producer abandons attempts to put a floor under the slumping market. The diamond industry has been struck by one of its deepest and most prolonged slumps in decades, according to Bloomberg.\n  * The day after De Beers’ announcement, Chinese lab-grown diamond companies saw their share prices surge 9% to as high as 30%. The price cut instituted by De Beers may stimulate more diamond sales, but this shows the eroding future outlook for natural stones to be undercut by synthetic stones.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * For two years, J.P. Morgan strategists have urged investors to buy gold, and for two years they have been right. On Tuesday, the bank predicted a triple crown, saying gold is once again the top commodity to buy. “Gold still looks well situated to hedge the elevated levels of uncertainty around the macro landscape heading into the initial stages of the Trump administration in 2025,” wrote a team led by Natasha Kaneva, head of J.P.Morgan’s global commodities strategy. Gold’s extended rally is reminiscent of the late 1970s, another period when inflation was a persistent problem. The price has risen 29% this year to a recent $2,667 per ounce.\n  * Gold versus copper and the ramification of China’s strength versus the U.S., (as proxied by the Hang Seng Index divided by the S&P 500 Index) points more toward gold as the best opportunity in this macro backdrop. Copper typically outperforms gold when economic demand forces are predominant. The graphic created by Bloomberg shows the opposite, and with good reason, China is in decline. A roughly 50-year low in the Hang Seng Index versus the S&P 500 may suggest the potential for reversion, but with new U.S. leadership focused on correcting trade imbalances with China, the enduring uptrend in gold/copper could be gaining more fuel. The red shaded areas indicate recessions.\n\n![Gold/Copper Ratio and Market Divergence: Recession Signals Over Time](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/GLD-gold-copper-ratio-12062024.png)\n\n  * Montage Gold has entered a strategic partnership with Sanu Gold Corporation, given its highly attractive exploration properties in Guinea, obtaining a 19.9% interest in Sanu through the issuance of 2.3 million basic shares of Montage equating to C$5.5 million. The company is joining existing strategic investor AngloGold Ashanti who acquired a 14.0% stake in Sanu in September 2024.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * A group of Indigenous tribes in Alaska have launched a legal challenge of a gold mine in northwest B.C., a project the group says threatens the Nass and Unuk rivers. Ecojustice, a Canadian environmental law charity, on behalf of a consortium of 15 Alaskan tribes called the Southeast Alaska Indigenous Transboundary Commission (SEITC), has applied to B.C.’s Supreme Court for judicial review of the Environmental Assessment Office’s decision that Seabridge Gold’s KSM mine near Stewart, B.C., according to CBC.\n  * Gold’s year-end outlook faces risks from a resurgent dollar, challenging the seasonal tailwinds that typically support the metal this time of the year. The precious metal typically sees its highest returns in December and January, with average gains of 2.4% and 3.5%, respectively, over the past 10 years. But after dropping 4% in November, its worst month in more than a year, gold has also started off December on the back foot, according to Bloomberg.\n  * Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was speaking at the New York Times Dealbook Summit and compared Bitcoin to gold. “People use Bitcoin as a speculative asset. It’s like gold, it’s just like gold —- only it’s digital. People are not using it as a form of payment or a store of value,” he said. “It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold. That’s how I think about it.”\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/07/follow-frank-twt-2023-1024x512.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/frank-talk-subscribe/) [![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/01/lL-files-1.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/LLFiles-12062024.pdf)\n\nU.S. Global Investors, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Regular market insight and analysis by our portfolio management team will return next week. Please enjoy the special commentary by Frank Holmes, and we wish everyone a happy, healthy and relaxing weekend._**\n\nAs families gather to celebrate Thanksgiving this year, there’s a morsel of good news for consumers: the cost of the traditional feast fell for the second year in a row. A classic Turkey Day dinner for 10 cost $58.08, down 5% from last year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s (AFBF) [annual survey.](https://www.fb.org/market-intel/thanksgiving-dinner-costs-are-down-again)\n\nThat should come as welcome relief, but before we raise a toast to declining prices, keep in mind that costs are still nearly 20% higher than they were just five years ago.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-thanksgving-dinner-11292024.png)\n\nCould we be on the cusp of another wave of rising costs? If President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and other key trade partners come to fruition, the answer may well be yes.\n\nHistory teaches us that tariffs—while well-intentioned as tools for protectionist policies—tend to raise consumer prices. And the American dinner table may once again feel the squeeze.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-CIP-11012024.png)\n\n### **Are Tariffs a Recipe for Higher Costs?**\n\nAmong Trump’s proposals is a sweeping 60% tariff on all goods imported from China and a [25%-tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada.](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-promises-25-tariff-products-mexico-canada-2024-11-25/) The tariffs will remain on Mexican and Canadian goods until the two countries crack down on their “ridiculous Open Borders,” Trump says.\n\nMost economists agree that these policies, if enacted, would result in higher costs for U.S. consumers. After all, tariffs are essentially taxes on imports, and the importing businesses typically pass those costs on to the end consumer.\n\nThe size of the impact would depend on the specifics. A hypothetical 10% tariff on all goods entering the U.S. would increase overall prices by an [estimated 1.3% annually,](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealthmanagement/insights/marketnews/article.1677851.html) according to UBS. Selective tariffs targeting specific goods or countries could be even more disruptive, especially if supply chains can’t adjust quickly enough to avoid the additional costs.\n\nConsider the washing machine tariffs imposed during Trump’s first term. From February to May 2018, the price of laundry equipment in the U.S. [rose a massive 16.4%](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/washing-machine-tariffs-started-trumps-trade-war-result-historic-3-month-increase-in-washing-machine-prices/)—the largest three-month price jump in 40 years of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. Twelve months after the tariffs were in place, Americans were paying roughly [$100 more per washing machine and dryer.](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190611)\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-trump-tariffs-washing-machines-11292024.png)\n\nSimilarly, the broader trade war with China raised costs for everything from electronics to furniture, adding an estimated [$3.2 billion per month in additional taxes](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.4.187) for American consumers.\n\nThe same could happen again, but on an even more dramatic scale. Under Trump’s trade policies, a pair of $80 jeans could cost between $10 and $16 extra, while a $50 tricycle could cost an additional $18-$28 more, according to a [new report](https://nrf.com/research/estimated-impacts-proposed-tariffs-imports-apparel-toys-furniture-household-appliances) by the National Retail Federation (NRF).\n\n### **What It Means for Consumers and Investors**\n\nTrump’s proposed tariffs have significant implications for much more than just Thanksgiving dinners. If you believe tariffs are going to drive up prices on imported goods, consider stocking up now on items likely to be affected: toys, household appliances, apparel and even travel goods.\n\nInvestors should watch this space closely. Industries with lots of exposure to imported goods—retail, electronics and even agriculture—could face significant headwinds. China, Mexico and Canada are three of the U.S.’s largest trading partners, and disrupting these relationships could lead to ripple effects across commodities markets, manufacturing and technology sectors.\n\nOn the other hand, companies that produce goods domestically or operate in sectors less sensitive to global trade could find opportunities in a high-tariff climate. U.S. manufacturers that compete with imports could see increased demand due to higher prices on foreign alternatives.\n\nAmong steel producers, for instance, think Nucor or U.S. Steel. Higher material costs could also encourage more recycling, potentially boosting profits for scrap metal firms such as Radius Recycling (formerly Schnitzer Steel Industries) and Steel Dynamics.\n\n### **Happy Thanksgiving!**\n\nTrump’s tariff proposals will likely dominate headlines in the New Year. Whether they are implemented in full, selectively or through compromise remains to be seen. What should be clear, though, is that these policies will carry costs—not just for consumers but for the economy as a whole.\n\nAt U.S. Global Investors, we’re keeping a close eye on these developments. Tariffs may put a damper on personal finances, but smart planning and diversification can help ensure investors are prepared for whatever comes next.

In his 2018 book [_Right Here, Right Now,_](https://www.amazon.com/Right-Here-Now-Leadership-Disruption/dp/0771038623) the prime minister urged fellow conservatives to focus on pragmatic solutions to everyday problems faced by the middle class. That was the key to winning elected office, he said.\n\nHe’s absolutely right. Here in the U.S., the middle class drove much of the enthusiasm for President-elect Donald Trump and his “America First” policies. [Exit polls](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/exit-polls) show that Trump overwhelmingly won the vote of those without a college education and those making between $30,000 and $49,000.\n\n### A Tale of Two Prime Ministers\n\nHarper also spoke of his commonsense, fiscally conservative approach to dealing with the 2008–2009 global financial crisis. Canada, believe it or not, was [the only G7 country](https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/41-1/PACP/report-10/response-8512-411-167) that fully regained and even surpassed the business investment that was lost during the recession.\n\nUnfortunately, my dear home country’s economy has struggled greatly under current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has prioritized social issues over solutions to middle-class problems. During Trudeau’s administration, annual GDP-per-capita growth has [averaged just 0.3%.](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/blogs/canadas-economic-stagnation-a-big-problem-for-canadians) Canadians are now [significantly poorer than their U.S. counterparts.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-gdp-per-capita-rich-1.7318989)\n\n![Canada's Economy Has Not Kept Pace with the U.S. Under Trudeau](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-canada-trudeau-11222024.png)\n\n### The DOGE Initiative: Cutting Costs and Regulations\n\nHarper’s insights tie directly into the economic anxieties felt by many working-class Americans. U.S. national debt now tops $36 trillion. Federal regulations cost approximately $2.1 trillion every year, representing around 7% of the country’s GDP, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI).\n\nThis places a significant strain on middle-class households. The CEI estimates that the average American household pays over $14,500 annually in “hidden” regulatory taxes, exceeding what they spend on nearly every other expense except housing.\n\n![The Hidden Cost of Regulations in The U.S.](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-hidden-costs-11222024.png)\n\nTrump’s decision to form the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), co-chaired by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, aims to alleviate this burden. In a [WSJ op-ed](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020) this week, Musk and Ramaswamy describe their mission to cut wasteful government spending and regulations and massively deduce headcount:\n\n“DOGE intends to work with embedded appointees in agencies to identify the minimum number of employees required at an agency for it to perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions.”\n\nThis reminds me of how Musk addressed runaway spending at Twitter, now rebranded as X, after he acquired the platform in April 2022. The Tesla chief reduced the company’s workforce [by about 80%,](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/elon-musk-confirms-he-has-fired-over-80-of-twitter-employees-so-far-377045-2023-04-12) yet X continues to operate just as well as ever.\n\n### Gold and Bitcoin\n\nEconomic uncertainty has led investors to seek safe havens. Gold has been one of the strongest-performing commodities in 2024, rising more than 31%. As you can see in the chart, the yellow metal took a hit after the election when the U.S. dollar rallied, weighing on commodities priced in the greenback.\n\n![Strong U.S. Dollar Post-Election Has Weighed on Gold](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-stong-dollar-11222024.png)\n\nThis week, Goldman Sachs forecast that gold could reach [$3,000 an ounce by the end of 2025,](https://www.kitco.com/news/article/2024-11-19/go-gold-says-goldman-sachs-prices-still-track-hit-3000-year-end-2025) supported by demand from central banks, geopolitical tensions and investors hedging against economic volatility.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin continues to hover near the historic $100,000 level as Trump’s promise to turn the U.S. into the world’s [“Bitcoin superpower”](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/president-trump-wants-america-to-become-the-worlds-bitcoin-superpower/) lights a fire under investors.\n\nSenator Cynthia Lummis’s recent proposal to [sell federal gold reserves to purchase Bitcoin](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-14/trump-s-ally-lummis-pushes-to-sell-some-of-the-fed-s-gold-to-buy-bitcoin?embedded-checkout=true&sref=1pPyLRr7) has sparked debate. While Bitcoin’s potential is undeniable, I believe the U.S. would be unwise to abandon its gold, a cornerstone of financial stability for over 5,000 years. \n\nGoing forward, I believe that diversification remains key, especially as geopolitical tensions support the need for safe-haven assets like gold and Bitcoin.\n\n![Happy Thanksgiving](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/thanksgiving-2024-1024x512.jpg)\n\n### Index Summary\n\n  * The major market indices finished down this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.24%. The S&P 500 Stock Index fell 2.08%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.15%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index lost 3.99% this week.\n  * The Hang Seng Composite lost 8.43% this week; while Taiwan was down 3.44% and the KOSPI fell 5.63%.\n  * The 10-year Treasury bond yield rose 13 basis points to 4.44%.\n\n\n\n### Airlines and Shipping\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing airline stock for the week was Bombardier, up 15.0%. Embraer held its annual Investor Day where the company noted its backlog is $22.9 billion, up 30% year-over-year and at a record. Embraer is investment grade by Fitch and S&P – Moody’s may be there soon. Its net debt/EBITDA is 1.3X this year and down to 0.5X next year.\n\n![Embraer's stock looks Positioned to run higher](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/AIR-embaer-stock-11222024.png)\n\n  * According to UBS, global new ship orders slowed to 5.1M tons (-41% year-over-year), which is not surprising given strong year-to-date orders and capacity constraints. 10M24 orders are now at 136.1M tons (up 30% year-over-year), already achieving 107% of its 2024E forecast.\n  * The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that airline fares were up 3.2% month-over-month, ticking up sequentially for the third month in a row. September airfares inflected positively year-over-year for the first time since March 2023 and October airfares continued to tick up positively, up 4.1% year-over-year.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing airline stock for the week was Frontier, down 17.7%. According to Bank of America, Boeing’s 737 production remains sluggish, with no rollout activity reported so far in November. Boeing has begun implementing layoffs, starting with over 400 employees as part of its plan to cut 10% of its workforce, equivalent to 17,000 jobs.\n\n\n  * It has been a rough few months for tanker equities, reports Stifel. Since the beginning of the quarter, the S&P has been up 1.9%. However, in that time, average U.S.-listed tanker stocks are down, on average, 22.6%. Specifically, product tanker names are down 29.8%, crude tanker names are down 16.6%, and companies with mixed tanker fleets are down 19.8%.\n  * Spirit has commenced a prearranged chapter 11 process. As a result of the chapter 11 filing, Spirit was delisted from the NYSE. The company expects that its common stock will continue to trade in the over-the-counter marketplace through the chapter 11 process. The shares are expected to be cancelled and have no value as part of Spirit’s restructuring.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * JetBlue management is looking at Spirit planes when they become available. Spirit has taken out 20% of capacity from hubs and are talking to American Airlines about rekindling a business relationship. Crack spreads are similar among regions (New York versus Gulf Coast), which minimizes a disadvantage they had.\n  * According to the Financial Times, air freight players are scrambling to reroute planes and cash in on elevated freight rates out of China ahead of Black Friday and the Christmas shopping season. The freight rate for flying goods from Asia to the U.S. has surged, with the average spot price in October up 49% from a year ago to $5.46 a kilogram, according to market analytics firm Xeneta.\n  * Brazilian Airlines will boost capacity during summer peak season,focusing on international routes. According to the Brazilian Airlines Association (Abear), the three main carriers will offer 29.8 million seats in the period extending from December 28 to February 28, increasing seats offered by 12% year-over-year and flights by 11% year-over-year. \n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Frontier lowered system capacity by 460 basis points (bps) and 180bps in February and March, respectively, reports Bank of America. The cuts follow several weeks of reductions to fourth quarter 2024/first quarter 2025 capacity as the airline moderates its growth rate. First quarter 2025 capacity growth is currently tracking toward 7.9% year-over-year.\n  * Global air cargo demand slowed to mid-single digit year-over-year growth, reports Bank of America. The slowdown appears to be driven by tougher comps with checks suggesting eCommerce demand out of China and semiconductor/electronics exports from Taiwan and Korea remain strong.\n  * According to RBC, WestJet’s announcement of 10% seat capacity growth for the summer of 2025 as a negative for Air Canada, given its view that meaningful capacity increases across the industry will apply pressure to yields into next year. Domestic capacity at WestJet is expected to increase 12% with double-digit increases in total seat capacity across 10 major Canadian airports, including Montreal and Ottawa.\n\n\n\n### Luxury Goods and International Markets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Viking Holdings Ltd. reported significant financial growth in the third quarter of 2024, with total revenue increasing by 11.4% to almost $1.7 billion, adjusted gross margin growing by 12% to $1.1 billion, and net income turning from a loss of $1.2 billion in 2023 to a profit of $375 million in 2024.\n  * Year-to-date, stocks listed in the United States, as measured by the S&P 500 Index, have significantly outperformed those in Europe, as reflected by the STOXX Europe 600 Index. The S&P 500 has risen by more than 24% so far, driven by strong performance expectations in financials and industrials, fueled by economic growth and deregulation.\n  * Williams-Sonoma was the top-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury sector, gaining 31.6% in the past five days. The home furnishing company reported a strong third quarter with a 7% earnings-per-share increase, a 17.8% operating margin, and executed a $533 million stock buyback, indicating robust financial performance and market confidence. Shares gained almost 28% in a single day of trading on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * All luxury companies have now reported their third-quarter earnings and the the luxury sector saw a 3% decline in revenue in the third quarter, a drop from a 1% increase in the second quarter of this year. Prada and Hermes delivered the strongest results, while Kering and Burberry were the weakest performers.\n\n![Luxury Companies' Year-Over-Year Revenue Growth For Q3 2024](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/LUX-luxury-companies-11222024.png)\n\n  * Apple experienced a double-digit, year-over-year drop in iPhone sales in China due to increased local brand competition. Huawei, Apple’s local compettitor, saw a 7% increase in sales, driven by price reductions on its Pura 70 and Mate 60 models.\n  * Cettire, the Australian online apparel retailer, was the worst-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury Index, dropping by 20%. The decline followed Citibank’s analyst initiating coverage of the company with a sell rating. The analyst at Citi believes that tighter distribution channels among luxury brands, combined with overall weaker demand for luxury goods, led to the Sell recommendation.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * This week, news surfaced that the incoming administration at the White House plans to introduce federal regulations for fully self-driving vehicles. This move would mark a significant step toward easing U.S. rules for autonomous cars, with Tesla likely to benefit the most. As a result, shares of the electric vehicle maker saw an increase.\n  * For the first time, Milan’s Via Monte Napoleone has surpassed New York and London to become the world’s most expensive shopping street. This rise is fueled by a surge in wealthy tourists and intense competition among luxury brands for upscale retail spaces.\n  * In the United States, the busy holiday shopping season is kicking off with two major holidays: Thanksgiving and Christmas. Amazon has announced that its Black Friday Week event will begin on November 21, 2024, featuring millions of deals across over 35 categories, including electronics and home goods. The event will run through Cyber Monday on December 2.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Last week, Bank of America hosted its annual Consumer Discretionary Conference in the heart of Paris, held at a luxury hotel. While the venue was fitting, the mood at the event was far less upbeat. Presenting companies expressed concerns over the uncertain pace of recovery in China and raised questions about the potential for a trade war between Europe and the United States under the new administration.\n  * European stocks, home to many luxury companies, declined following America’s decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles for strikes on Russia. Geopolitical tensions escalated as the Russia-Ukraine conflict intensified. Additionally, the President of Russia signed a decree permitting the use of nuclear weapons in the event of a large-scale attack on the country.\n  * Back in 2023, Bain-Altagamma Luxury Goods Company was projecting mid-single-digit growth in 2024, after a 12% rise in 2023. However, China will end this year down between 20% to 22%. The results in 2024 will be weaker than expected with only about a third of luxury brands growing revenues in 2024, which compares to 66% that showed positive revenue growth in 2023. Bain predicts 4% growth in 2025.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/07/follow-frank-twt-2023-1024x512.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/frank-talk-subscribe/)\n\n### Energy and Natural Resources\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing commodity for the week was natural gas, rising 11.09%. Natural gas futures surged to their highest price in a year, as traders anticipate a shift from unusually warm autumn weather to colder temperatures in the coming weeks. December futures closed at $3.193 per million BTU, about twice the low reached in late March, after a warm winter left a surplus of unburned heating fuel, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n  * According to Morgan Stanley, the near-term outlook for the European gas market has tightened further. Storage levels are dropping quickly, demand remains strong, and LNG imports are still down year-over-year. The increased likelihood of no Russian gas flows next year is putting additional pressure on the market.\n  * Aluminum resumed gains amid concerns that global supplies will tighten following China’s removal of an export tax rebate, while a weaker dollar supported metals overall. Beijing’s overhaul of tax relief for overseas shipments aims to ease industrial overcapacity and reduce trade tensions with the U.S. and Europe. Aluminum, given China’s dominance in exports, has been the most affected, according to Bloomberg.\n\n![Aluminum Prices Continue To Trend Higher](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/ENGY-aluminium-prices-11222024.png)\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing commodity for the week was crude palm oil, dropping 8.13%, as demand in India, the largest importer of edible oils, is expected to drop over the winter season, Bloomberg reports. Oil edged higher on the heighted conflict in Ukraine but there are concerns about excess supply and weak Chinese demand. A slower-than-usual selling pace for Angolan crude was the latest signal of weak Chinese demand, and the International Energy Agency has warned that global oil markets face a sizeable surplus next year, the article explains.\n  * At least three Russian refineries have halted processing or reduced operations due to heavy losses from export curbs, rising crude prices, and high borrowing costs, according to five industry sources. The closures highlight the challenges facing Russia’s refining industry, including Ukrainian drone attacks, Western sanctions forcing discounted fuel sales, and high interest rates, according to Reuters.\n  * Most steel sheet prices resumed the downward trend over the past week, according to BMO, with market participants attributing the softness to persistent demand weakness, increased supply, and flat scrap prices.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * The uranium spot price is down 15% year-to-date to $77 per pound, but risk-reward may be starting to turn more positive as supply challenges mount. The supply side is tightening up, with challenges at Niger and junior miners ramping up more slowly than expected. Russia’s export restrictions to the U.S. should support contracting activity, although they see the ban as manageable with redirection of trade flows, according to Morgan Stanley.\n  * Exxon Mobil Corp. has signed a preliminary agreement to provide battery metal lithium to an LG Chem Ltd. plant in the U.S., strengthening the oil major’s role in the domestic critical minerals supply chain. The multiyear deal will cover the supply of as much as 100,000 tons of lithium carbonate from Exxon’s planned project in the US to the South Korean company’s cathode plant in Tennessee, which broke ground last December, Exxon said in a statement. \n  * The decline in activity at Russia’s Belokamenka LNG production facility due to Western sanctions presents an opportunity for other LNG-producing nations to fill the gap in global supply and capture a larger share of the market. Novatek PJSC’s LNG production facility appears to be mothballed with nighttime light intensity at its lowest level since 2019. With Russia’s LNG expansion plans stalled, countries with established or emerging LNG capabilities can leverage this disruption to increase exports and strengthen their position in the energy market, Bloomberg writes.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Lithium production in Zimbabwe has increased from 1Kt in 2020 to 150Kt this year (the global market is 1.2Mt), one reason the raw material is oversupplied and has been under pressure. Zimbabwe has a relatively complex royalty system, and miners are now looking to change this to profit-based payments, with the Chamber of Mines highlighting that“the government captures a higher share of revenue when lithium prices are high, while providing relief when prices drop,” Bank of America writes.\n  * Bank of America also sees rising iron ore surpluses potentially reaching 190Mt next year. Hence, the bank keeps its cautious view on iron ore in 2025. Should high-cost miners fail to cut production, they see a risk of prices dropping to $75 per ton next year.\n  * Northvolt AB, with just one week of cash on its balance sheet, has filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. after being unable to secure new funding. Northvolt’s filing showed $5.84 billion in debt and about $30 million in available cash. The company’s biggest shareholder is Volkswagen, where Northvolt was seen as the new independent supply chain for EVs in Europe to counter the dominance of the well-established Chinese and South Korean battery companies, as reported by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n### Bitcoin and Digital Assets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performer for the week was Mantra, rising 121%.\n  * Cryptonews.com reported that Mastercard and JPMorgan’s integration of the Multi-Token Network (MTN) with the Kinexys platform highlights a significant advancement in blockchain technology, enabling faster and more transparent cross-border payments. This collaboration demonstrates the power of blockchain solutions in improving settlement efficiency and addressing time zone challenges for global businesses.\n  * The recent surge in Bitcoin prices, driven by supportive regulatory expectations under the incoming Trump administration and increased corporate adoption, highlights the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency. With Bitcoin nearing $100,000 and major firms like Charles Schwab preparing to offer spot crypto trading, the market is poised for further expansion and mainstream acceptance, Barron’s writes.\n\n![Bitcoin Eyes $100,00 Mark](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/CRYP-bitcoin-eyes-100k-11222024.png)\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performer for the week was Peanut the Squirrel, falling 41%.\n  * The rise of memecoins, like Quant and Just a Chill Guy, while generating substantial returns, exposes the crypto industry’s darker side, including speculative behavior, harassment and negative optics that undermine trust and mass adoption. These incidents risk fueling regulatory scrutiny and damaging the public perception of crypto, potentially hindering the industry’s broader growth and adoption, the DailyCoin advises.\n  * The BIS report highlights a significant weakness in the DeFi ecosystem, as institutional players dominate liquidity provision on platforms like Uniswap, leveraging advanced strategies that outmaneuver retail participants. This institutional edge undermines DeFi’s promise of inclusivity, leaving retail traders with lower profitability and raising questions about whether decentralized exchanges truly level the playing field.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Bloomberg reports Charles Schwab’s plan to offer spot cryptocurrency trading once U.S. regulations ease, presents a significant growth opportunity, aligning the firm with increasing demand for crypto investments among retail investors. This move would enhance Schwab’s competitive positioning against newer platforms like Robinhood and Webull, while tapping into the rapidly expanding crypto market.\n  * Gary Gensler’s departure as SEC Chair in January 2025 opens the door for potential regulatory reforms that could be more favorable to the crypto industry. This transition creates an opportunity for the industry to advocate for clearer, less restrictive regulations and foster growth under new leadership, according to Bloomberg.\n  * Goldman Sachs’ plan to spin out its digital-assets platform offers an opportunity to revolutionize financial markets by leveraging blockchain technology for faster, more efficient, and secure trading and settlement processes. With the backing of major financial institutions and potential regulatory support under the incoming Trump administration, this innovation could drive widespread adoption of distributed ledger technology across the global derivatives economy.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * MicroStrategy’s stock plummeted 30% from its recent record high following bearish comments from Citron Research, citing overvaluation and detachment from Bitcoin fundamentals. The company’s reliance on maintaining a lofty premium to Bitcoin for stock performance poses a significant risk, especially with alternative Bitcoin investment options like ETFs gaining traction, reports Barron’s.\n  * The theft of 342,000 Ether by North Korean-affiliated hacker groups Lazarus and Andariel, highlights the ongoing threat of cyberattacks targeting cryptocurrency exchanges, undermining trust and security in the digital asset market. Such high-profile incidents risk deterring institutional adoption and exposing vulnerabilities that could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and compliance challenges for the crypto industry, Bloomberg reports.\n  * Barron’s writes the extreme volatility in MicroStrategy stock, with gains of nearly 700% this year before sharp pullbacks, highlights its dependence on Bitcoin’s price and signals the potential for a speculative bubble. Such dramatic swings evoke parallels to the Dotcom bust, raising broader concerns about market instability and the risks of a sharp correction impacting investor confidence.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/01/safest-airlines-twitter-1024x576.jpg)](https://youtu.be/yagLBFMM4zk?si=tQIanH-2E4BKeueT)\n\n### Defense and Cybersecurity\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace, a unit of Kongsberg Gruppen, secured a NOK 12 billion contract with the Dutch government to deliver air defense systems starting in 2028.\n  * Rheinmetall projects €20 billion in sales by 2027, driven by increasing Western defense budgets, U.S. market expansion, and innovation in air defense and land systems. This positive forecast all comes while targeting an 18% operating margin and significant contract wins.\n\n![Rheinmetall Projects Significant Sales Growth By 2027](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/WAR-rheinmetall-performs-11222024.png)\n\n  * The best performing stock in the XAR ETF this week was Archer Aviation Inc., rising 46.96%, after presenting promising commercial opportunities and addressing FAA concerns at the Barclays Global Auto and Mobility Conference.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Russia has used, for the first time, the newest intercontinental ballistic missile called “Oreshnik” in Ukraine. This missile has the capability to carry explosive fragmentation charges as high as a nuclear weapon and can attack a target with a speed of 1.2-1.8 miles per second. This makes the weapon hard to capture by any modern air defense systems. \n  * Two undersea Internet cables in the Baltic Sea were damaged, sparking European investigations into possible sabotage linked to Russian hybrid warfare. Attention is focused on a Chinese cargo ship near the area, while officials and companies cited physical damage and raised concerns over recent infrastructure attacks.\n  * The worst performing stock in the XAR ETF this week was General Dynamics, falling 2.15%, after little to no news.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Lockheed Martin, in collaboration with the U.S. Army, successfully completed a production qualification flight test for the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), confirming its readiness for large-scale production and its role in modernizing long-range precision strike capabilities.\n  * AeroVironment agreed to acquire BlueHalo in an all-stock deal worth $4.1 billion, creating a combined defense technology company expected to significantly expand its market and generate over $1.7 billion in revenue annually.\n  * Northrop Grumman’s delivery of the Stand-in Attack Weapon test missile to the U.S. Air Force marks a major milestone in its development, leveraging advanced technologies like AARGM-ER and F-35 integration to address Anti-Access/Area Denial challenges. This highlights its potential for future defense contracts and rapid deployment by 2026.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Ukraine conducted its first missile strike on Russian territory using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles, targeting a military warehouse in Bryansk. This comes as Russia expands its nuclear doctrine to include responses to conventional attacks, signaling escalating tensions amidst the ongoing conflict.\n  * Russia’s updated nuclear doctrine under President Vladimir Putin lowers the threshold for using tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, shifting the policy to respond to conventional attacks on Russian territory or allies. This signals a deterrence strategy aimed at limiting Western support for Ukraine and asserting Russia’s power.\n  * The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity related to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\n\n\n\n### Gold Market\n\nThis week gold futures closed at $2,733.80, up $140.20 per ounce, or 5.41%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week higher by 8.13%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in up 2.53%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar rose 0.79%.\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing precious metal for the week was palladium, up 6.96% after getting shellacked 13% in the prior week’s election turmoil. In the prior week, gold posted its biggest weekly drop since 2021, only to have its biggest weekly surge this week since March of this year as tensions escalate around the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Longer-range missiles are now being deployed, with Russia asserting that countries that supply these long-range missiles are fair targets for Russia to attack.\n\n![Gold Set For Best Week Since October 2023](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/GLD-gold-set-best-week-11222024.png)\n\n  * Pan African Resources was the best performing gold stock in the major gold stock indexes with European buyers bidding up the stock over 22% this week on the risk of elevated conflict with Russia. OceanaGold and IAMGOLD both gained more than 15% with the rebound in gold stocks.\n  * According to Bank of America, the increase in gold of over $450 per ounce over just a six-month period is historically rare and is, in their view, emblematic of the importance of investment buying, particularly by western investors, which they think is very well captured by global gold ETF holdings of gold.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing precious metal for the week was platinum, but still up 2.62%. According to Bank of America, 10 of the 17 precious metals stocks covered underperformed the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index, despite most delivering solid Q3’24 numbers. Helping to explain the average underperformance, those that missed or reduced guidance experienced more significant underperformance than those that beat or improved guidance experienced outperformance. \n  * Ramelius Resources COO Duncan Coutts stepped down to pursue other opportunities, but he will remain at the company until early December.Peter Ganza has been appointed acting COO.\n  * Resolute Mining said Chief Executive Officer Terry Holohan and two other employees have been released from detention in Mali, just days after the gold mining company agreed to pay about $160 million to resolve a tax dispute with the government. Holohan and his colleagues were detained more than a week ago after he traveled to the country for meetings with tax and mining authorities, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * MicroStrategy shares tumbled after Andrew Left’s Citron Research said in a post on X that it’s betting against the software company, which has effectively transformed itself into a Bitcoin investment fund. The stock fell as much as 10% in intraday trading Thursday, reversing a gain of nearly 15% from earlier in the session, according to Bloomberg. The company has become a serial issuer of debt and now equity to buy more Bitcoin. With each equity issue the price of Bitcoin gets bid up to higher levels and then the cycle is repeated. Also, short interest is rising in this name, and this will eventually be an opportunity for gold.\n  * Newmont agreed to sell its Musselwhite gold mine in Ontario to Orla Mining for up to $850 million as part of a divestment campaign designed to boost shareholder returns. The deal will raise Newmont’s gross proceeds from sales of non-core assets to more than $2 billion, it said in a statement on Monday. \n  * Silver presents a compelling opportunity as resilient ETF holdings signal strong investor confidence, despite recent price volatility. With bullish outlooks for gold and increasing ETF inflows during price pullbacks, silver appears poised for further gains, building on its impressive 30% year-to-date growth.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Bank of America notes the 1.1-million-ounce decline in global gold ETF holdings of gold since the recent peak of 84.1 million ounces, a decline that accelerated with the conclusion of the U.S. election.\n  * According to Bloomberg, hedge fund managers have cut their bullish bets on gold to a 15-week low in light how resilient stock markets and in particular Bitcoin have performed as of late.\n  * The discovery of a massive gold deposit in China’s Hunan province could poses a potential threat to global gold markets as the discovery is estimated at 300 tons but is at a depth of around 2,000 meters. It could disrupt supply dynamics if China is able to produce more gold domestically, especially if development proves feasible. Three hundred tons of gold is roughly 9.6 million ounces which is slightly more that 1/10 of the all the gold held in ETFs.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/india-gold-video-twt-1024x576.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ekhIBnNHiFo?si=nJsxHh242T6lu6Va) [![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/01/lL-files-1.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/LLFiles-11222024.pdf)\n\nU.S. Global Investors, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

For investors, these trends highlight two critical sectors poised for growth: traditional defense and the emerging field of cyber defense.\n\n### **The State of U.S. Defense Spending**\n\nIn 2023, U.S. military expenditure reached $916 billion, representing a staggering 40% of global military spending. As I shared with you earlier in the year, that’s more than the [next 10 countries combined.](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/nato-at-75-the-new-age-of-warfare-and-rising-defense-spending/)\n\nDespite this eye-popping figure, U.S. defense spending as a share of GDP has been falling steadily for decades and recently hit an historic low, a function of the [U.S. economy growing faster than military spending.](https://econofact.org/u-s-defense-spending-in-historical-and-international-context)\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-national-defense-down-11152024.png)\n\nI believe this highlights an important point: While the U.S. spends more on defense than any other nation, there’s still room for growth, particularly as new threats emerge on both physical and virtual battlefields.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that military spending [will increase 10% between 2028 and 2038,](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59511) adjusted for inflation. But Republicans could accelerate this timeline, with bold initiatives like the proposed Iron Dome-style missile defense system.\n\n### **NATO Members Expected to Boost Expenditures**\n\nThe potential for increased defense budgets isn’t limited to the U.S. NATO allies, under renewed pressure from an incoming Trump administration, are likely to ramp up their own spending.\n\nGermany, for example, has already met NATO’s 2% GDP defense target for the first time in decades, and public opinion now supports [raising it even further to between 3% and 3.5%.](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/2024-11-12/germany-defense-spending-trump-15822029.html) Poland currently leads the alliance by spending a whopping 4.12% of GDP on defense, and next year, that figure is [expected to rise to 5%.](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/poland-spend-5-gdp-defence-2025-says-foreign-minister-2024-07-13/)\n\n### **Cybersecurity: The New Frontline**\n\nWhile traditional military spending captures the headlines, the cybersecurity sector represents an equally important—and arguably more urgent, I think—investment opportunity. Recent data by Check Point Software Technologies reveals that cyberattacks have skyrocketed, with the average number of weekly attacks climbing 75% globally year-over-year, to hit a record high of 1,876 per organization. In the U.S., attacks are up 56% from 2023 levels, averaging 1,300 per organization weekly.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-cyber-attackes-11152024.png)\n\nThe culprits aren’t just rogue hackers but state-sponsored actors from powerful nations like China, Russia and Iran, according to Microsoft’s [Digital Defense Report 2024.](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/10/15/escalating-cyber-threats-demand-stronger-global-defense-and-cooperation/)\n\nThese adversaries are no longer content with merely breaching corporate networks. They target critical infrastructure, telecommunications and even political figures. A recent campaign by [Chinese state-sponsored hackers](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/us-accuses-china-of-broad-and-significant-cyber-spying-effort?sref=1pPyLRr7) infiltrated the phones of Trump, Vice President-elect JD Vance and Vice President Kamala Harris, underscoring the growing national security implications of these attacks.\n\nAs businesses, governments and individuals race to protect themselves from these threats, the need for robust cybersecurity will only increase. For investors, this means that companies developing cutting-edge technology to secure networks and data could be positioned for explosive growth.\n\n### **Challenges and Opportunities**\n\nDefense and cybersecurity budgets tend to receive bipartisan support, but Trump’s return could supercharge growth. His track record—and his recent, controversial nomination of Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary—suggests a willingness to take bold steps to reshape the U.S. military and strengthen the nation’s defenses against 21st-century threats.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2024 and beyond, it’s clear that military and cybersecurity spending are on an upward trajectory. The challenges of tomorrow—whether they come in the form of hypersonic missiles or sophisticated cyberattacks—require innovative solutions and significant investment. For investors, this represents not just a challenge but an opportunity.\n\n[![How Much is The World Spending on Defense? - Watch the Video](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/war-twitter-defense-spending.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YV2r0FLGekw?si=BfbtecNA8FnNTL51)\n\n### Index Summary\n\n  * The major market indices finished down this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.24%. The S&P 500 Stock Index fell 2.08%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.15%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index lost 3.99% this week.\n  * The Hang Seng Composite lost 8.43% this week; while Taiwan was down 3.44% and the KOSPI fell 5.63%.\n  * The 10-year Treasury bond yield rose 13 basis points to 4.44%.\n\n\n\n### Airlines and Shipping\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing airline stock for the week was JetBlue, up 11.4%. According to Bank of America, IAG’s third-quarter 2024 EBIT of €2,013 million (+15% year-over-year) was 13% above consensus on better-than-expected unit revenue and costs. This was the largest EBIT beat among European airlines this quarter. Strong travel demand continues across IAG’s core markets, with weakness in China.\n  * Canada’s Federal Labor Minister has ordered the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) to intervene in labor disputes at Canadian ports in a move to impose binding arbitration. The decision will affect four BC ports, the Port of Montreal, and the Port of Quebec. The Canadian government has directed the CIRB to extend the term of the existing collective agreements until new ones are reached, according to CIBC.\n  * International travel demand has remained resilient, reports Morgan Stanley, as the number of U.S. citizen departures to international regions has continued to trend above both 2019 and 2023 levels. U.S. departures came in up 8% year-over-year and up 23% vs. 2019 in the month of October.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing airline stock for the week was Spirit, down 60%. According to CLSA, Singapore Airlines’ second-quarter fiscal 2025 results suggest non-fuel cost headwinds are becoming more prominent, with yield still under pressure. As they raise cost assumptions, they lowered the underlying profit forecast by 12-15% over the forecast period.\n  * The container shipping orderbook-to-fleet ratio continues to build, now 26% with a recent Hapag-Lloyd order for deliveries in 2027-2029, adding an incremental 1%. Nominal capacity growth in October was up 10%, according to JPMorgan.\n  * Spirit Airlines is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection after merger talks with Frontier Airlines broke down, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter. The ultra-low-cost carrier is in advanced discussions with bondholders to hammer out a bankruptcy plan that would have support from most creditors, the report said. Spirit is reportedly preparing for a bankruptcy filing within weeks.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Bank of America highlights that airline stocks have performed well since last week’s election, with the Dow Jones U.S. Total Market Airlines Index up 12% compared to the S&P 500 5% gain. Looking back at returns during the 2016 election, the best performance period for airlines was the month immediately following the election (up 21% vs. the S&P 500 up 6%). \n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/AIR-nyse-arca-index11132024.png)\n\n  * Over 70% of shippers did not see the election as a restocking catalyst, with the rest almost equally split between pulling forward and pushing back. 48% of total responses are looking to modestly or significantly ramp up ordering ahead of potential tariff risk. Another 24% are considering/undecided on their future course of action with only 28% of respondents not concerned about tariffs either way, according to Morgan Stanley.\n  * Cathay Pacific announced its proposal to repurchase the remaining convertible bonds, reports JPMorgan, totaling HK$6.74 billion. The convertible bonds have been a key overhang, capping Cathay’s share price performance within a narrow trading range over the past two years.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * AAP/AIR has shared insights regarding the potential sale of Boeing’s Jeppesen business. While AAP/AIR views the sale as beneficial in the near term – providing Boeing with needed cash as it ramps up deliveries following the IAM strike – it also notes potential downsides. Selling a profitable unit could be a missed opportunity, especially since Boeing may later need to acquire new software and technology for future aircraft at potentially higher prices.\n  * Express freight capacity is up 4.4% year-over-year, reports UBS, as the freight market gears up toward peak season. The divergence on intercontinental between air freight and Express growth may indicate some downtrading to deferred products away from Express.\n  * According to RBC, the 14 deliveries in the month are down 60% year-over-year, although the weak deliveries were expected given the strike. RBC believes investors were less focused on deliveries for October and instead focused on the production rate into 2025 (and the pace at which Boeing can ramp to pre-strike production levels). However, near-term cash expectations around remaining fourth quarter deliveries could be negatively impactful to the balance sheet.\n\n\n\n### Luxury Goods and International Markets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * In a remarkable display of resilience, Royal Caribbean Cruises stock, one of the top holdings in U.S. Global’s luxury-focused fund, has charted a course to an all-time high, reaching a price level of $237.69, reports Investing.com. The company has been experiencing a surge in demand, leading to a significant 17.8% year-over-year increase in third-quarter 2024 revenue, reaching a record $4.9 billion.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/LUX-royal-caribbean-cruise-11152024.png)\n\n  * Reliance, one of India’s largest retailers, has opened a new luxury beauty store at Jio World Plaza in Mumbai under its chain, Tira. The store features 15 exclusive boutiques, including brands like Dior, Estée Lauder, Yves Saint Laurent, La Mer, Prada, and Valentino, with Augustinus Bader available exclusively in India. Executive Director Isha Ambani said the store aims to redefine luxury beauty in the country.\n  * Burberry was the top-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury sector, gaining 10.24% in the past five days. The performance came after its first-half retail sales exceeded expectations and analysts highlighted the new CEO’s strategy to refocus on the brand’s heritage and stabilize its performance despite ongoing challenges.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * According to Bloomberg, JPMorgan increased its net short position in Salvatore Ferragamo, a popular Italian luxury brand, by 10% to 1.37 million shares. This highlights the group’s bearish stance on the stock, expecting its price to decrease.\n  * The Swiss luxury group Richemont, whose brands include names like Cartier, reported a decrease of 1% in its six-month revenue, missing analyst estimates. Its sales in China fell 27%, and watch sales slowed, reports Business of Fashion. \n  * Amorepacific was the worst-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury sector, falling 12.14%, after it faced disappointing revenue growth in the third quarter 2024, with a 7% year-over-year decline when excluding COSRX. The move was driven by a 32% drop in domestic duty-free revenue and slower-than-expected growth in the U.S. market for COSRX.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * LVMH has named one of its billionaire owner’s sons as deputy chief of its wine and spirits division as part of a leadership reshuffle at the French luxury group, reports the Financial Times. Alexandre Arnault, the 32-year-old son of Bernard Arnault, will take up the role at Moët Hennessy in February after four years at New York-based jeweler Tiffany, which LVMH bought for $15.8 billion in 2021.\n  * Amazon’s telehealth service, One Medical, is adding a new option that will put it in direct competition with digital health company Hims & Hers, reports TipRanks.com, which offers medications and treatments for weight loss, mental health, and hair loss. The new Amazon One Medical service offers a subscription plan with low, upfront monthly pricing for a clinical visit, treatment plan, and free medication delivery. The service initially focuses on five conditions: anti-aging skin care treatment, men’s hair loss, erectile dysfunction, eyelash growth, and motion sickness.\n  * According to consulting firm Bain, the personal luxury goods market could gain 4% in 2025. The positive outlook comes on the back of reactions to the U.S. presidential elections, which could help stabilize the U.S. market in addition to the last stimulus launched by the Chinese government.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Industry organizations like the Global Fashion Agenda and Fashion Revolution are not attending this year’s COP29 (the UN’s annual climate talks), focusing instead on other initiatives and urging brands to take more urgent action on sustainability, reports Yahoo! Finance. Kering, LVMH, and other luxury brands, including Stella McCartney, are also sitting out, with some calling for stronger commitments to renewable energy and cleaner supply chains. Fashion Revolution is advocating for brands to invest 2% of their revenue in sustainability efforts, the article continues.\n  * According to Bain & Company, sales of personal luxury goods could fall 2% this year due to a steep price hike and global economic uncertainty. It would be the first slowdown in demand in 15 years, excluding the Covid-19 lockdown period.\n  * Based on the last Oliver Wymar survey results, Chinese shoppers (especially millennials) are spending less on luxury goods and turning to more affordable options. In fact, 57% of respondents indicated their intentions to reduce international shopping budgets in 2025.\n\n[![famous american inventions and innovations](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2022/08/famous-american-inventions-1.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/famous-american-inventions-and-innovations/)\n\n### Energy and Natural Resources\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing commodity for the week was coffee, rising 11.93%. Both coffee and cocoa surged this week as the European Parliament considers changes to its deforestation regulations that raise supply concerns. Aluminum prices jumped on Friday after China announce it would cancel a tax rebate on the metal that has fueled excess exports to world markets. This move will curtail China’s exports of aluminum and could be seen as a strategic trade to counter new tariffs.\n  * According to RBC, fertilizer equities were up along with broad market strength and a bump to potash equities, prompted by news that Belarusian President Lukashenko proposed a 10% production cut in coordination with Russia. Mr. Lukashenko made these statements in a meeting with potash-producer Belaruskali President Rybakov, but there have been no further details on a production cut or comments from Russian producers Uralkali and EuroChem.\n  * According to JP Morgan, energy stocks have been big beneficiaries of the U.S. election results, with a number of energy indices beating the S&P 500 since November 5. However, copper miners have declined by more than 10%. While the market seemed to be pricing in a Trump 2.0 outcome over the past few weeks, many election observers were calling for a tight race as well as a split Congress.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/ENGY-energy-sector-11152024.png)\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing commodity for the week was cotton, dropping 5.92% as better weather in key growing regions boosts the outlook for stronger exports. Oil extended declines on a softer outlook for demand in China, the world’s largest crude importer. Recent data showed anemic Chinese consumer inflation in October and another decline in factory-gate prices, reflecting weak economic growth, according to Bloomberg.\n  * According to Reuters, more than a quarter of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and 16% of natural gas output remained offline in the aftermath of storm Rafael. There were over 480,000 barrels of oil and 310 million cubic feet of natural gas production shut-in, offshore regulator Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) reported.\n  * Copper declined with other commodities after China’s debt swap plan disappointed investors. The world’s largest importer of the red metal announced a 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) program to refinance local government debt that will be provided through 2028, but stopped short of unleashing new stimulus, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Although economic growth in China has been near anemic, India has now surfaced at the leading source of oil demand growth in Asia, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast. Liquid fuel consumption for transportation in India is expected to grow to 300,000 barrels a day while China’s growth has been revised to grow at less than 100,000 barrels a day. Rising electric vehicle (EV) ownership in China is also a factor in China’s reduced growth.\n  * Russia’s temporary restriction on enriched uranium exports to the U.S. creates an opportunity for American uranium miners to fill the supply gap and capitalize on reduced competition. This move could also support higher uranium prices as the market adjusts to the decreased availability of a major global supplier.\n  * American mining billionaire Robert Friedland plans to list his African iron ore company on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) next year and will use it to raise funds to acquire local critical minerals projects left unloved by the industry downturn. Mr. Friedland hopes to float Ivanhoe Atlantic before June, giving Australian investors exposure to Guinea’s Nimba iron ore project, according to Financial Review.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Bank of America highlights several factors that could impact base metals. Ahead of the elections, President Trump signaled plans for a significant realignment of global trade through tariffs, which would likely pressure base metals prices. However, this impact could be partially offset if China ramps up its stimulus efforts. Additionally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened alongside higher interest rates, contributing to the underperformance of material stocks.\n  * A key segment of the U.S. crude oil market is indicating oversupply, hinting that a potential oil glut could arrive earlier than anticipated. The November-to-December WTI cash roll, which shows traders’ willingness to pay to extend positions into the next month, has shifted into a bearish contango structure for the first time since January, according to Bloomberg.\n  * The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported they expect global oil markets to face a surplus of move than 1 million barrels a day next year as Chinese demand remains lackluster. Toril Bosoni was interviewed on Bloomberg TV and noted that it’s possible that Chinese oil demand has peaked. Toril further noted that it’s not just a slowdown in the construction sector but a fundamental shift to electric vehicles and high-speed rail to move consumers throughout the country that is undermining demand growth.\n\n\n\n### Bitcoin and Digital Assets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performer for the week was Peanut the Squirrel, rising 1,517%.\n  * Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally took the digital asset to $90,000 for the first time this week and lifted the overall value of the crypto market above its pandemic-era peak, writes Bloomberg. This comes as traders bet on a boom under President-elect Donald Trump. Bitcoin jumped about 32% since the election as Trump vowed friendlier crypto rules.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/CRYP-bitcoin-90k-11152024.png)\n\n  * Billionaire Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), reports Bloomberg, tasked to “dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies,” President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performing for the week was Monero, down 13.09%.\n  * Bitcoin’s stellar run is finally showing signs of losing steam. The cryptocurrency looks set to head lower as momentum players see similarities with the bearish setup from early August. The trigger looks to be Jerome Powell’s comment that the Fed doesn’t need to hurry to cut interest rates, according to an article published by Bloomberg. \n  * Michael Novogratz said there is a low likelihood that the U.S. will set up a Bitcoin strategic reserve as proposed by President-elect Donald Trump. “I still think it’s low probability,” Novogratz said during an interview Wednesday on Bloomberg Television.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Bitcoin options traders buoyed by Donald Trump’s election victory are already eyeing a landmark price of $100,000 for the popular cryptocurrency. Investors are lining up bets that Bitcoin will pass the milestone as soon as the end of the year, writes Bloomberg. \n  * Intesa Sanpaola SpA is expanding the remit of its digital assets desk to handle spot trades with cryptocurrencies, the latest move deeper into the new market by a traditional bank. While the spot trading isn’t yet up and running, the desk has had the necessary internal approval and technical systems in place for about a month, Bloomberg reports. \n  * An ally of Donald Trump in the U.S. Senate has a plan for filling up the president-elect’s proposed strategic Bitcoin stockpile without adding to the government deficit, reports Bloomberg. The plan: Sell some of the Federal Reserve’s gold. Republican senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming plans to push forward with a bill to do exactly that when the new Congress is seated next year.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Sam Trabucco, one of Sam Bankman-Fried’s inner circle friends, has agreed to hand over properties, including his yacht, to creditors of the FTX exchange. The former co-CEO of Alameda purchased the 53-foot boat for $2.51 million just before leaving the hedge fund in March 2022, Bloomberg writes. He has also agreed to give up legal title of his two apartments in San Fransisco that he purchased for $8.7 million.\n  * Roger Ver AKA Bitcoin Jesus is charged with evading more than $48 million in taxes for selling $240 million in tokens. It’s the most prominent case dealing solely with tax fraud and digital-asset sales, according to Bloomberg. \n  * An Ohio man who laundered more than $300 million of Bitcoin on behalf of drug traffickers and other criminals was sentenced to three years in prison after a judge granted him leniency for helping the U.S. prosecute other cryptocurrency cases. His helix services helped hundreds of drug dealers to operate for years with greater impunity and eased the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars, writes Bloomberg.\n\n[![How Well Do You Know Bitcoin History? - Test Your Knowledge!](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/11/bitcoin-history-quiz-twt-2023-1024x512.png)](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/how-well-do-you-know-bitcoin-history/)\n\n### Defense and Cybersecurity\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * General Dynamics won a $5.57 billion contract with the U.S. Air Force for operations, maintenance and sustainment of mission partner environments, with completion expected by December 2035.\n  * The Missile Defense Agency awarded Northrop Grumman a $541 million contract modification to advance the development of the Glide Phase Interceptor, a U.S.-Japan partnership technology designed to detect and intercept hypersonic weapons, with work continuing in Arizona until 2029.\n  * The best performing stock in the XAR ETF this week was Rocket Lab USA, rising 40.64%, after third quarter revenue surged 55% to $104.8 million, beating expectations amid strong demand.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The U.S. has accused China of conducting a massive cyber-espionage campaign that compromised multiple telecommunications companies to target the phones of prominent political figures. This means the potential access of systems used for wiretapping, with the breach under ongoing investigation.\n  * The CEOs of European chipmakers NXP, Infineon and STMicroelectronics warn that increasing nationalistic industrial policies and fragmentation of chip production across regions will drive up costs, hinder global cooperation, and potentially make devices unaffordable. This is a concern heightened by Donald Trump’s re-election and the risk of import tariffs.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/WAR-npx-semiconducter-stock-11152024.png)\n\n  * The worst performing stock in the XAR ETF this week was V2X Inc., falling 14.37%, after a secondary public offering was priced at $61 per share, driven by growing concerns over the company’s reliance on government contracts. This negative impact on share price was amplified by Donald Trump’s announcement of the “DOGE Agency,” sparking speculation about stricter oversight and tighter controls, which adversely affected companies dependent on federal funding.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * L3Harris has partnered with the U.S. Navy to deliver the first Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (AUVs) powered by advanced lithium-ion batteries approved for submarine use, enhancing endurance, operational flexibility, and safety for undersea missions.\n  * Thales targets robust growth through 2028, aiming for 5-7% annual sales increases and higher EBIT margins across defense, cybersecurity, avionics, and space sectors. The growth target is driven by heightened global security demands.\n  * Donald Trump is expected to increase support for Israel, confront Iran, and expand the Abraham Accords, while his new administration signals a shift in U.S. Middle East policy with key pro-Israel appointments.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon believes that the biggest threat facing the economy is not financial but geopolitical, warning that conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could spiral into World War III. Dimon says Russia, North Korea, Iran, and China are challenging post-WWII systems like NATO, and placing nuclear proliferation as a more immediate risk than climate change, though he holds out some hope that peace could still prevail.\n  * Russia has introduced a tiered payment system to increase compensation for soldiers wounded in the Ukraine war, with President Putin raising the one-time payment for those disabled by injuries to 4 million rubles, retroactive to the invasion’s start. This comes while also cutting benefits for lighter injuries amid rising defense costs and avoiding further mobilization.\n  * China’s sixth-generation fighter jet aims to close the technological gap with advanced stealth, AI, networked operations, and enhanced maneuverability, positioning it as a significant future force in air combat by 2035, with a prototype expected by 2028.\n\n\n\n### Gold Market\n\nThis week gold futures closed the week at $2,567.00, down $127.80 per ounce, or 4.74%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week lower by 9.28%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in off 2.96%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar surged 1.68%.\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing precious metal for the week was silver, but still down 3.56%. According to JPMorgan, Harmony published its first quarter 2025 operating update: 422,000 ounces of production is a beat and AISC is a beat (R1,026,137/kg). The company reiterated its fiscal year 2025 guidance across all metrics (production, AISC & grade). “We are well-positioned to execute our various life-of-mine extension projects and take our transformational international copper-gold projects up the value curve,” it said.\n  * The Silver Institute notes that, “The global silver market is set to record a physical deficit in 2024 for the fourth consecutive year. Record industrial demand and a recovery in jewelry and silverware will lift demand to 1.21 billion ounces in 2024, while mine supply will rise by just 1%.” The report went on to explain that exchange-traded products are on track for their first annual inflows in three years as expectations of Fed rate cuts, periods of dollar weakness and falling yields have raised silver’s investment appeal.\n  * Newcore Gold reported that it intersected 204 g/t over 1-meter, the highest-grade interval to date, and a second intercept of 3.36 g/t over 28 meters at its Enchi Gold Project in Ghana. There is currently a 10,000-meter program underway. The drill program will move inferred to indicated resources and likely expand the footprint of the deposit. Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire are two of the most favorable West African mining jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing precious metal for the week was palladium, down 4.51%. The world’s largest gold-backed ETF recorded its biggest weekly outflow in more than two years last week as Donald Trump’s decisive election win prompted traders to book profits. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) saw an outflow of over $1 billion, the largest weekly fund outflow since July 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n  * Despite the cut in interest rates last week, gold still slid back again this week on the comments from Jerome Powell that the Fed will be in no rush to cut rates given the strong performance of the economy. According to JPMorgan, COMEX Non-Commercial Gold positioning has fallen to 255,000 lots net long, which is the lowest since early August. Longs fell by 30,000 lots this week while shorts also moderated slightly.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/GLD-gold-set-biggest-loss-11152024.png)\n\n  * According to the Financial Times, shares of gold producer Resolute Mining plunged more than 30% on Monday after the company announced its chief executive Terence Holohan and two other employees had been detained in Mali. The executives were in the capital Bamako to discuss with officials “open claims made against Resolute” that the group “maintains are unsubstantiated,” said Resolute, which is listed in Sydney and London. $160 million dollars to resolve the tax dispute is the number that seems to be the price of their “bail.”\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Canaccord notes that following Trump’s 2016 win, the gold price corrected 12% in the first 45 days after the election, before going on to gain 68% over the remainder of his term (41% before COVID started). This next month-and-a-half or so is likely to present the market with a new entry point into gold, as the new Trump administration begins to implement policies that likely will disrupt the economic plans of some industries that are reliant upon imports and could heighten the inflation risks for the U.S.\n  * Silver was the best performer of the precious metals this week but still down. The silver market is expected to experience its fourth year of deficit production, but demand is still expected to grow. China started generating power from its first gigawatt-level offshore solar project. The project is about 5 miles off the coast of Shandong. By the end of 2025, Shandong plans to add more than 11 gigawatts of offshore solar with a goal of 42 gigawatts of ultimate capacity.\n  * Westgold Resources has materially increased its Starlight Mine Resource by 91%, including declaring a maiden open pit Resource. The increase has the potential to lift both: 1) the sustainable rate of site production, and 2) substantially extend mine life beyond five years, according to RBC.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * China’s Zijin Mining says the Buritica gold mine in Colombia suffers losses due to illegal mining, according to a statement. The losses are estimated to be around 3.2 tons of gold, valued around $200 million. The perpetrator of this seizure has been chalked up as the “Gulf Clan” – armed Colombian drug cartel. On another continent, the South African government has said it will not help thousands of illegal miners inside a closed mine. The illegal miners are said to be running out of food, water and supplies after local police closed off entrances that were used to transport these necessities forcing them to come to surface and be apprehended.\n  * Fresnillo shares dropped after the gold and silver miner warned the Sabinas mine is experiencing “operational difficulties” that are affecting production. Analysts note this is likely to lead to a lower contribution from the Silverstream agreement, which entitles Fresnillo to a portion of the mine’s silver output from its owner Industrias Peñoles, according to Bloomberg.\n  * The rise of electric vehicles is poised to shake up demand for platinum group metals that are used in auto catalysts to reduce pollutants from car exhaust fumes. Palladium will be the hardest hit among the PGMs as catalytic converters are its main demand driver. Given its limited applications beyond transport, palladium is expected to start to see surplus volumes in the market beyond 2030, according to Bloomberg NEF analysis.\n\n[![Can You Guess Which Movies Feature Gold?](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/03/goldin-the-movies-Quiz.gif)](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/can-you-guess-which-movies-feature-gold-2/) [![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/01/lL-files-1.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/LLFiles-11152024.pdf)\n\nU.S. Global Investors, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

American psychologist Abraham Maslow argued that certain basic needs—food, water, shelter, etc.—must be met before a person can move on to higher levels of self-worth and fulfillment.\n\n![Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-maslows-hierarchy-needs-11082024.png)\n\nSafety is another important, fundamental human need, one that I believe played a major role in this week’s election outcome. People want to feel safe, physically as well as financially. They want to feel protected in their homes and communities, and when they don’t, they take their outrage to the ballot box.\n\nI wrote about this [a little over a year ago.](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/investor-considerations-in-the-era-of-weaponized-migration/) I believed then that the record numbers of illegal immigrants pouring across the Southern Border would end up hurting President Joe Biden’s then-reelection bid.\n\nIt appears that’s precisely what happened, based on the theory of wisdom of crowds. When Kamala Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee in August, she failed to convince voters that the problem would be fixed. Meanwhile, President-Elect Donald Trump aggressively ran on the issue of illegal immigration and border security, and he turned out the victor.\n\n![Number of Nationwide Border Encounters Spiked During the Biden administration](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-immigration-biden-11082024.png)\n\nIn hindsight, the writing was on the wall all along. A Gallup poll conducted back in February found that [immigration was Americans’ number one concern.](https://news.gallup.com/poll/611135/immigration-surges-top-important-problem-list.aspx) Over a quarter of people (28%) cited immigration as the most important problem facing the country, topping other issues like the government (20%), the economy (12%) and even inflation (11%).\n\n### **Perceptions of Safety Are Shaping Spending and Policy**\n\nI’m aware of the many studies that show that [immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than U.S. citizens.](https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/undocumented-immigrant-offending-rate-lower-us-born-citizen-rate) But as we all know, politics is perception, and the prevailing perception is that American towns and cities have become less safe due to an influx of unvetted, undocumented migrants.\n\nThis perception has grown strong enough to affect people’s spending behavior. On my early morning jogs through my neighborhood, I’ve noticed more and more families putting up fences, indicating a heightened sense of insecurity.\n\nVoters are likewise telling elected officials they’re done playing nice with those who commit crime. This week, California voters approved a measure that would [impose harsher penalties for theft and drug trafficking,](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-05/california-election-night-proposition-36) reversing “woke” criminal justice policies that have the perception of coddling criminals.\n\n### **“America First” Policies to Support Domestic Corporations**\n\nMoving on, I’d like to highlight some areas that I think could see a tailwind under a second Trump presidency.\n\nAs was the case during his first term, Trump is expected to prioritize business-friendly policies that especially favor companies that generate most of the revenue from domestic, rather than international, sales. Think small- to mid-cap stocks, many of which could be in a good position to benefit from lower income taxes and relaxed regulations.\n\nTake a look at Trump’s favorability among small business leaders during his first term. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Optimism Index remained at historically elevated levels, scoring an average monthly reading of 103.4—even when you factor in the pandemic months.\n\n![Small Business Leaders Favor Trump's Economic Policies](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-small-business-trump-11082024.png)\n\nThe average reading under Biden has been about 10 points lower, indicating that entrepreneurs have lacked confidence in the country’s business climate. The NFIB reported last month that uncertainty was at its [highest reading ever,](https://www.nfib.com/surveys/small-business-economic-trends/) due in large part to the upcoming election.\n\nBut what about tariffs? Throughout his campaign, Trump touted the economic benefits of tariffs, claiming they will help ease deficit spending, not to mention protect domestic industries from lower-cost competition abroad. Economists warn that tariffs will [lead to another spike in inflation,](https://www.ft.com/content/97aad07b-1c1f-4ff3-8294-a76f57568f85) since U.S. companies are responsible for paying these import taxes. But if you recall, Trump had tariffs on billions of dollars’ worth of goods during his first term, and headline inflation remained anemic.\n\n### **Bitcoin Stands to Benefit**\n\nSoon after it was clear that Trump won reelection, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high price on hopes that the president-elect will make good on his promise to [transform the U.S. into the world’s “Bitcoin superpower.”](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/president-trump-wants-america-to-become-the-worlds-bitcoin-superpower/)\n\nSenator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, perhaps the Senate’s most vocal Bitcoin advocate, [declared on X](https://x.com/SenLummis/status/1854208373740458432) that the U.S. would be “GOING TO BUILD A STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE.” According to Lummis’s plan, the U.S. will incrementally buy up to 1 million BTC, roughly 5% of total supply.\n\nAt today’s prices, that’s approximately $76 billion. For comparison’s sake, the value of the country’s gold reserve was [over $540 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/188843/united-states-official-reserve-assets-held-in-gold-since-1990/) at the end of last year.\n\nIt’s believed that if the U.S. ends up establishing a Bitcoin reserve, it might encourage other nations to follow suit [in a fit of FOMO (fear of missing out).](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/2024-11-08-german-lawmaker-suggests-u-s-bitcoin-reserves-could-influence-europe-15970218517802)\n\nOn the investing side, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) is now larger than its gold ETF (IAU). Launched in early 2024, IBIT had over $34 billion in assets as of Thursday, compared to IAU’s approximately $33 billion. IBIT launched earlier this year, while IAU launched nearly 20 years ago, in 2005.\n\n![BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF Now Larger Than Its Gold ETF](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-bitcoin-etf-blackrock-11082024.png)\n\n### **Gold’s Fear Trade & Love Trade**\n\nGold dropped more than 3% the day after the election as the U.S. dollar surged as much as 1.6%, its biggest one-day jump in about two years. During Trump’s first term, the yellow metal gained 55.4%, underperforming the S&P 500, which rose 83.8% over the same period.\n\nRemember, gold can be divided into the Fear Trade and the Love Trade. Whereas the former is more associated with auspicious gold-buying in India and China, the latter has to do with buying physical gold in an effort to hedge against inflation, interest rates, bad fiscal policies, general uncertainty and the like?\n\nWill the Trump 2.0 era ignite the Fear Trade or the Love Trade? Time will tell, but to prepare, I always recommend a 10% weighting in gold, with 5% in physical bullion and the other 5% in gold stocks and ETFs. Remember to rebalance every year.\n\n[![famous american inventions and innovations](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2022/08/famous-american-inventions-1.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/famous-american-inventions-and-innovations/)\n\n### Index Summary\n\n  * The major market indices finished up this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4.61%. The S&P 500 Stock Index rose 4.66%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 5.74%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index gained 8.57% this week.\n  * The Hang Seng Composite lost 6.78% this week; while Taiwan was up 3.40% and the KOSPI rose 0.74%.\n  * The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell 8 basis points to 4.303%.\n\n\n\n### Airlines and Shipping\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * United Airlines’ stock surged by 37% in October, outpacing industry rivals and driven by strong earnings, subdued fuel costs, and strategic investments, according to Bloomberg. Market analysts remain optimistic about further growth despite potential risks from fuel price swings and aircraft shortages.\n\n![United Airlines Posted Its Best Month Since February 2010](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/AIR-united-airlines-11052024.png)\n\n  * Ethiopian Airlines has become the first African carrier to operate the Airbus A350-1000, reports the Global Times. This expands the carrier’s global reach with this advanced, fuel-efficient aircraft featuring 395 seats while simultaneously reinforcing its leadership in the African aviation sector.\n  * The best performing airline stock this week was Air Transport Services Group, rising 26.49%, after announcing that Stonepeak is acquiring Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) for $3.1 billion. This offers a 29% premium per share, with the deal set to close in early 2025, after which ATSG will go private.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Severe storms and unprecedented flooding in Spain have disrupted daily life, reports Yahoo! News. Over 200 deaths have been reported along with significant damage to infrastructure, including airports like Barcelona-El Prat and Valencia. The storms have also caused widespread flight cancellations, delays and access issues for travelers.\n  * Ryanair’s profit fell 18%, the company reported, due to lower ticket prices and Boeing delivery delays, prompting the airline to reduce its passenger growth forecast.\n  * The worst performing airline stock this week was Air France KLM, falling 12.73%, after third-quarter earnings missed forecasts due to rising labor and maintenance costs, leading the airline to increase its full-year unit cost projections.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * The Cayman Islands have become the first Caribbean destination to launch an omnichannel marketing campaign on United Airlines’ Kinective Media platform, reports TravelDailyNews. The campaign should enhance its tourism strategy to reach millions of travelers through various media channels and solidify its position as a premier travel destination.\n  * Nashville International Airport (BNA) announced that starting May 1, 2025, Air Canada will expand its service by introducing a new seasonal route to Vancouver. This will increase flights to Montreal to twice daily, while maintaining year-round flights to Toronto and enhancing connectivity between Nashville and Canada for travelers.\n  * London Luton Airport has made significant investments in sustainable vehicle technology, transitioning its operational fleet to low-carbon options to support its goal of achieving Net Zero emissions by 2040.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Negotiations between Lufthansa and the Italian government over the purchase of Ita Airways have stalled due to disagreements on the pricing, with the Italian Finance Ministry rejecting Lufthansa’s proposed price reduction after the airline’s value declined.\n  * American Airlines has extended its suspension of flights to Israel until September 2025, joining other carriers in delaying their return due to security concerns. This makes El Al the only airline currently offering direct flights between the U.S. and Israel.\n  * A 47-year-old Senior First Officer for British Airways tragically collapsed and died at a luxury hotel before a scheduled flight from the Caribbean to London, leaving onlookers and his crew devastated, resulting in the flight’s cancellation and prompting the airline to express condolences and support for affected staff.\n\n\n\n### Luxury Goods and International Markets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * In the United States, financial stocks led the market following Trump’s victory this week, surging more than 6%, while industrial stocks were the second-best performers, rising nearly 4%. The real estate sector, however, recorded the largest losses.\n\n![Market Response to Trump's 2024 Victory: Financial Sector Outperformed](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/LUX-market-response-trump-11082024.png)\n\n  * China reported a stronger-than-expected trade balance this week. Year-over-year exports rose by 12.7%, well above the anticipated 5% increase, while imports fell by 2.3%, exceeding expectations. The trade balance came in at $95.72 billion, significantly higher than the expected $75 billion.\n  * Tesla was the top-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury sector, gaining 26.2% in the past five days. This surge followed the recent presidential election, where Donald Trump secured victory. Tesla’s stock increased by nearly 15% on Wednesday while its capitalization has reached $1 trillion for the first time since April 2022.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Richmont sales missed expectations. Sales growth in the United States, Europe and Japan were offset by an 18% drop in the Asia Pacific Region, which included China, where sales fell 27%. Chairman Johann Rupert said Chinese demand for luxury goods “will take longer to recover.”\n  * European markets reacted negatively to Trump’s victory in the United States, with carmakers particularly impacted by expectations of higher tariffs and a potential new phase of trade tensions between the U.S. and the Eurozone. On November 6, shares of Mercedes fell 8.2%, BMW dropped 6.6% and Volkswagen declined 4%.\n  * Wynn Resorts, which operates hotels and casinos, was the worst-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury Index, falling 11.3%. Shares declined after company reported weaker-than-expexted quarterly results. Gaming revenue in the third quarter from the Las Vegas strip declined 7.2% year-over-year.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * China has been reporting stronger economic data, suggesting that government measures to support growth may be gaining traction with potential for further improvement. Recently, the country reported better-than-expected manufacturing activity, and this week, exports also exceeded expectations. The luxury sector will benefit from the improving growth and consumer sentiment in the mainland.\n  * Financial companies and those driving innovation and growth are likely to continue performing well in the United States, supported by reduced regulations and Trump’s efforts to stimulate economic growth. Leading up to the elections, Trump has consistently criticized excessive government regulation, emphasizing its negative impact on businesses and overall economic progress.\n  * On Friday, China announed a $1.4 trillion program to allow local governments to refinance debt. China’s top lawmakers have approved a proposal to increase the debt ceiling for local governments by $840 billion, described as China’s most powerful debt reduction measure in recent years. The finance chief promised more measures next year.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * According to HSBC research, the average luxury item now costs 60% more than it did in 2019. For instance, a simple cotton T-shirt featuring the Christian Dior logo is priced at $1,000. Wealthy consumers remain largely unaffected by these steep price tags, allowing companies to raise prices consistently. However, with demand for luxury items—particularly in China—starting to decline, it is uncertain if these price hikes can continue.\n  * Some experts suggest that Trump’s victory may drive higher inflation and postpone interest rate cuts. Elevated Fed rates would likely keep mortgage rates high, discouraging real estate buyers from pursuing new deals. Following Trump’s win, real estate stocks have underperformed.\n  * In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, the political situation deteriorated after Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats. In response, the three remaining ministers from the party resigned, causing the collapse of the governing coalition. Scholz is expected to lead the country with a minority government, but the opposition is calling for a no-confidence vote.\n\n[![How Well Do You Know Bitcoin History? - Test Your Knowledge!](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/11/bitcoin-history-quiz-twt-2023-1024x512.png)](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/how-well-do-you-know-bitcoin-history/)\n\n### Energy and Natural Resources\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing commodity for the week was palm oil, rising 4.79%. Palm oil prices have surged to a two-year high due to supply concerns and increased soybean oil prices, driven by aging trees in key production areas that are limiting output. This tight supply outlook supports a robust palm oil market, with prices likely to remain elevated in the medium-term, Bloomberg cites.\n  * The surge in AI-driven data centers and computer-chip factories is fueling unprecedented demand for natural gas, presenting a major growth opportunity for pipeline companies like Energy Transfer, Williams and Kinder Morgan. This increased demand is expected to drive the largest power demand boost in a generation, strengthening the role of gas in the energy mix alongside renewables.\n  * Ingredion hit an all-time high this week. The company, which operates in the food and beverage industry, reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.05, beating out the consensus estimate of $2.60 by 17%. Management also raised guidance on forecasts, including an upward revision $10.35 to $10.65 from $9.70 to $10.20. The earnings estimates referenced were published by Bloomberg.\n\n![Ingredion Stock hits Record High Following Earnings Outlook](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/ENGY-indredion-stock-11082024.png)\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing commodity for the week was palladium, dropping 10.44%. Bloomberg reports that hedge fund managers have increased their bearish bets on palladium, with net short positions rising by 988 to 2,696. This trend highlights weak investor sentiment in the palladium market, which could pressure prices and indicate limited demand expectations. Clean energy stocks also dropped starkly after the U.S. presidential election ended with Donald Trump coming out on top.\n  * Crude oil inventories have risen to their highest levels since August due to slumping exports and unexpected builds in fuel stocks, signaling an oversupply in the market. Meanwhile, weakening diesel demand in India—attributed to slower economic growth and shifting consumption patterns—along with signs of reduced buying in China and Europe, highlights a global softening in crude oil demand, according to Bloomberg.\n  * Declining coal and iron ore prices have significantly dented the profits of major Japanese trading firms backed by Warren Buffett, reports Bloomberg, with most firms missing analyst earnings estimates due to these drops. This weakness highlights their heavy reliance on commodity markets, exposing them to financial risks when commodity prices fall despite efforts to diversify their business portfolios.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * According to BMO, the International Tin Association’s latest survey—which covers companies representing 42% of global refined tin usage—forecasts a 3% increase in tin demand this year after a 5% decline last year, with consumer stockpiles expected to drop to 3.4 weeks of supply. The survey also notes that solar ribbon now accounts for about 20% of solder production (though efforts to reduce tin usage are starting), and tin use in chemicals and tinplate is projected to rise by 4.9% and 12%, respectively.\n  * BMO also reports that nuclear energy is gaining renewed support in the U.S., with a Bisconti Research poll indicating 77% public approval, and despite expressing some concerns, former President Trump has pledged to expand nuclear capacity. However, since the U.S. isn’t expected to be a significant growth market for nuclear energy, this is unlikely to substantially impact supply-demand forecasts until the end of the decade, with China remaining the primary driver of future demand growth.\n  * Rio Tinto Group is launching a two-year trial at its Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia, reports Bloomberg, using battery-swapping technology from China’s State Power Investment Corp. to power eight electric haul trucks capable of carrying 91 tons each. Aiming to decarbonize its global fleet of approximately 700 haul trucks, this initiative complements similar electrification trials in Western Australia’s Pilbara region and a positive advancement in clean energy resources.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * According to Bloomberg, CMOC Group Ltd., the world’s largest cobalt miner, is warning that the metal’s significance in electric vehicle batteries is rapidly diminishing due to the growing adoption of cobalt-free lithium iron phosphate batteries; in China, the share of EV batteries containing cobalt is expected to drop from 44% in 2022 to 31% in 2024. Despite aggressively increasing production and surpassing Glencore as the top supplier, CMOC faces shrinking profits as cobalt prices fall amid oversupply, Bloomberg continues, acknowledging that cobalt may eventually play only a minimal role in the EV industry.\n  * Based on an article from the Australian Financial Review, brokers believe that Mineral Resources’ decision to give Managing Director Chris Ellison up to 18 months to depart will negatively impact the company’s undervalued share price due to potential ongoing volatility and uncertainty. They warn that this prolonged exit could result in the company trading at a discount, making it vulnerable to mergers and acquisitions or a potential take-private scenario.\n  * U.S. shale drillers risk oversupplying the market in 2025, with companies like ConocoPhillips and Matador Resources increasing production guidance despite potential market pressures. Diamondback Energy cautions that this growth trend could repeat past mistakes, jeopardizing oil prices and industry profitability if an oil glut materializes.\n\n\n\n### Bitcoin and Digital Assets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performer for the week was Cronos, rising 53.51%.\n  * Bitcoin jumped to a record high as global markets responded to Donald Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris in the U.S. presidential election. Bitcoin jumped 9% as early results showed Trump barreling toward a win.\n\n![Bitcoin Surges To Record High as U.S. Votes Counted](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/CRYP-bitcoin-surges-11082024.png)\n\n  * Blackrock’s spot Bitcoin ETF has surpassed the size of its gold fund amid record demand for ETFs that invest in the original cryptocurrency. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF surpassed the $33 billion iShares Gold Trust in total assets, reaching $34.3 billion after a record inflow of $1.1 billion on Thursday, writes Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performing for the week was Kaia, down 11.25%.\n  * U.S. exchange-traded funds investing in Bitcoin recorded their highest daily net outflow to date as markets braced for Election Day. The group of 12 funds managed by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity shed $579.5 million on Monday, November 4, according to Bloomberg. \n  * QNB, one of Turkey’s largest banks, abruptly ended its crypto asset service operations as of November 7, reports Bloomberg. According to a post on its website, the firm will no longer be accepting any new customers.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * The government of Indonesia is allowing businesses to invest in crypto in a new Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency. Under previous rules, only individuals are allowed to invest in digital currencies and the regulation reiterates that crypto is only allowed as an investment asset and cannot be used as payment in transactions, writes Bloomberg. \n  * They crypto industry poured millions of dollars into the presidential and congressional races, but its most salient election victory is likely to be the departure of U.S. SEC chair Gary Gensler, explains Bloomberg. President Donald Trump’s decisive victory all but ensures a pullback on crypto-related enforcement once he take office.\n  * UBS developed a piloted blockchain-based, multi-currency payment solution with UBS Digital Cash. The solution aims to increase efficiency, transparency, and to enable programmability, writes Bloomberg. \n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * An exploiter managed to steal a significant number of tokens from crypto casino Metawin’s Ethereum and Solana hot wallets by exploiting the protocol’s frictionless withdrawal system, Bloomberg reports. Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT pegged the amount stolen to over $4 million with 115 theft addresses tied to the exploit.\n  * The CEO of WondeFi, a publicly listed crypto holding company that owns one of Canada’s largest crypto exchanges, has been safely released after he was kidnapped, according to Bloomberg. \n  * Coinbase Global executives and directors recently adopted trading plans to sell more than $900 million of shares of the crypto-trading platform, writes Bloomberg. Three Coinbase executives and two directors will sell as many as five million shares.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/spooky-markets-1024x576.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RvKRo3sa6rA?si=jo67GmiG0PVYELJD)\n\n### Defense and Cybersecurity\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Rheinmetall reported a 39.5% year-on-year increase in third-quarter sales to €2.45 billion. Sales were driven by strong demand for ammunition and weapons in Europe and globally. The company maintained its full-year guidance with expectations of reaching €10 billion in sales and a boosted operating margin of around 15%.\n  * Howmet Aerospace Inc. achieved record EBITDA, strong revenue growth, and strategic advancements in the third quarter of 2024. This was further highlighted by a 54% year-over-year earnings per share (EPS) increase and notable debt reduction, despite supply chain and market challenges.\n\n![Shares of Howmet Aerospace Have Rallied On Record EBITDA, Strong Revenue Growth](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/WAR-howmet-aerospace-11082024.png)\n\n  * The best performing stock in the XAR ETF this week was AXON Enterprise Inc., rising 41.64%, after raising its full-year forecast, predicting adjusted EBITDA of $510 million and revenue of $2.07 billion, exceeding analyst estimates. While third-quarter results showed a 32% revenue increase year-over-year to $544.3 million, driven by strong performance in its Taser and Software & Sensors segments.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that Russia has significantly escalated its war against Ukraine since July and emphasized the urgent need for sufficient weapons, not just diplomatic support, to achieve a just peace.\n  * The FAA plans to intensify its oversight of Boeing’s production processes following a recent strike, emphasizing the use of Boeing’s Safety Management System as workers return to their roles, according to a recent conversation between FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker and Boeing’s CEO.\n  * The worst performing stock in the XAR ETF this week was Spirit Aerosystems, falling 5.32%, after it was warned of significant financial strain due to cash burn and reduced deliveries to Boeing. This has raised doubts about its future viability ahead of Boeing’s planned acquisition in 2025.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Investors may be prematurely boosting defense stocks based on expectations that president-elect Donald Trump’s policies will push NATO allies to increase defense spending. This comes despite his stance on avoiding foreign wars and potential budget cuts could limit gains.\n  * Next Hydrogen Solutions (NXHSF) and Pratt & Whitney Canada are collaborating on a project to demonstrate hydrogen combustion technology for the aviation industry. Canada’s Initiative for Sustainable Aviation Technology is supporting the development of high efficiency electrolyzers and hydrogen fuel testing on Pratt & Whitney’s advanced PW127XT regional turboprop engine.\n  * NASA recently began testing the engine of the X-59, an experimental supersonic aircraft designed to create quieter sonic booms. This marks a key milestone in its Quest mission toward achieving quieter commercial supersonic flight over land, with the first flight expected in early 2025 and data collection flights to follow across U.S. cities.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy congratulated Donald Trump on his re-election and expressed hope for a “just peace” in Ukraine under Trump’s leadership. His comments come despite concerns that Trump’s approach may pressure Ukraine into a conflict freeze while Russian forces advance.\n  * Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have intensified, hitting sites near Baalbek and Beirut and killing dozens of people as the conflict with Hezbollah escalates, displacing over 1 million Lebanese and affecting humanitarian efforts in both Lebanon and Gaza.\n  * Ukraine engaged North Korean troops stationed in Russia’s Kursk region, marking the first confrontation as concerns grow over Moscow and Pyongyang’s military ties, which NATO calls a significant escalation.\n\n\n\n### Gold Market\n\nThis week gold futures closed at $2,694.30, down $54.90 per ounce, or 2.00%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week lower by 2.68%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in off 2.26%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar rose 0.64%.\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Triple Flag reported earnings this week, which topped earnings per share (EPS) overestimates given by analysts covering the company. Triple Flag also beat revenue estimates of $67.18M with actual $73.7M in revenue reported.\n  * Pandora A/S, the world’s largest jewelry maker, is raising prices and cutting costs due to a significant surge in silver prices, which have risen by roughly a third this year. This sharp increase highlights the strength of silver in the market, as its growing value impacts on major industry players and underscores its robust demand, reports Bloomberg.\n  * National Bank of Canada released an analysis on Kinross Gold Corp. which reported strong third quarter 2024 results, exceeding expectations in adjusted EPS and production, with focused cost control driving robust free cash flow and positioning the company to fully repay its term loan by year-end. These operational efficiencies and financial strengths not only enhance Kinross’s gold operations but also indicate potential positive impacts on its silver activities, highlighting significant growth opportunities within North America.\n\n![Kinross Gold Reports Strong Third-Quarter Results](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/GLD-kinross-gold-11082024.png)\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * SSR Mining reported a big miss on earnings due to higher-than-expected care and maintenance costs at its idled Copler mine due to the heap leach failure.\n  * The Treasury yield curve surged with Donald Trump’s decisive election victory which pulled up the dollar and conversely, gold slid back on higher inflation expectations. The surge in interest rates and reduced political uncertainty weakened gold’s appeal with the shifting market sentiments, according to Bloomberg.\n  * Hecla Mining reduced its full-year silver production guidance, missing analyst estimates, after reporting lower-than-expected third-quarter silver output due to unplanned mill maintenance, Bloomberg reports. This operational setback highlights weaknesses in silver production capabilities, potentially impacting the silver market negatively.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Fitch Ratings indicates that gold miners have strong credit outlooks supported by balanced capital deployment, healthy balance sheets, and stable-to-improving mining profiles. This presents an opportunity for investors, as gold miners are poised to benefit from heightened gold prices and receding inflationary pressures, leading to stronger margins, increased free cash flow, and potential deleveraging—making them attractive prospects in the precious metals market.\n  * Exchange-traded funds have been reducing their holdings in gold and silver while increasing investments in platinum and palladium, indicating a shift in investor focus within the precious metals market. This trend highlights an opportunity to spread out investment flows across all precious metals, allowing investors to diversify portfolios and potentially capitalize on the varying performance of gold, silver, platinum and palladium.\n  * Bloomberg reports that G Mining Ventures is investing $936 million to develop the Oko West Gold Mine in Guyana, aiming to begin production in 2028 with an annual output of 353,000 ounces of gold. This significant project represents an opportunity in the gold sector, highlighting potential growth in gold production and investment prospects in emerging markets.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * B2Gold reported a significant 26% year-over-year decline in third-quarter gold production and anticipates full-year output at the low end of its forecasted range, highlighting operational challenges. This production shortfall, especially considering the company’s operations in jurisdictions with potential geopolitical and operational risks, poses a threat to B2Gold’s future production stability and financial performance while giving warnings to investors and operators alike of the risks taken in less appealing jurisdictions.\n  * FXStreet shares some technical insight into silver as exhibiting a negative bias and technical indicators point to further declines, with the price potentially breaking below key support levels like the 100-day moving average as well as the psychological $30 mark. This downward trajectory poses a threat to silver investors, signaling a bearish outlook for the precious metal in the near term.\n  * Australia Broadcasting Corp. has reported that Regis Resources’ McPhillamys Gold Project in New South Wales has been halted due to a federal Aboriginal protection order over the site, leading the company to launch a legal challenge. This situation highlights the threat of jurisdictional risk, as regulatory and legal obstacles imposed by government decisions can render mining projects unviable and cause significant delays.\n\n[![Subscribe to the Frank Talk Blog!](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2022/01/frank-mine-tw-08-2020.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/frank-talk-subscribe/) [![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/01/lL-files-1.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/LLFiles-11082024.pdf)\n\nU.S. Global Investors, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

With just days remaining before the presidential election, history shows that regardless of who’s in power, the U.S. has consistently outperformed its global peers and rewarded those who stayed the course.\n\nThat’s why we made the tough yet necessary decision two years ago to close our Emerging Europe fund. Why? Because, compared to the opportunities here at home, Europe just isn’t competitive.\n\nSluggish growth and regulatory hurdles weigh heavily on the continent’s economic potential. Outside of its massive luxury market, Europe is a cautionary tale, reminding us of the risks of over-regulation and slow-moving policy.\n\n### **America Remains the Innovation Leader**\n\nDespite all the predictions of a recession, the U.S. economy is leading the pack. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s [most recent projection,](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2024/10/22/world-economic-outlook-october-2024) the country is on track for 2.8% growth this year, outpacing every other G7 economy.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-g7-country-11012024.png)\n\nJust look at the tech sector: The vast majority of the world’s leading tech companies are based in the U.S., benefitting from robust early- and late-stage financing, an unmatched talent pool and a regulatory environment that—while imperfect—allows businesses to grow and thrive. Over the past few decades, America’s ability to foster true innovation giants—like Apple, Google and Amazon—has only strengthened.\n\nEurope, by contrast, lags behind, shackled by red tape and an over-cautious approach to investing in new technologies. This past summer, in fact, Meta (Facebook) and Apple [pulled back from rolling out key products in Europe](https://fortune.com/2024/06/17/antitrust-meta-apple-dma-gdpr-europe/) due to regulatory hurdles. To be clear, Europe has plenty of strong universities and bright minds, but its draconian laws stifle its own growth.\n\n### **The U.S. Markets: Built to Grow**\n\nIn the past two decades, the U.S. stock market has been a powerhouse. Just before the 2008 financial crisis, the market cap of the S&P 500 was marginally higher than that of the STOXX Europe 600. Since then, the U.S. market has expanded eightfold while the European market has barely budged.\n\nCompanies across the Atlantic are now [listing on U.S. exchanges,](https://www.euronews.com/business/2023/11/23/the-great-delisting-why-european-companies-are-moving-to-us-exchanges) drawn to our more dynamic financial markets.\n\nWhen I look at Europe’s economic trajectory, I can see why many people are hesitant to invest there. Again, we closed our Emerging Europe fund because of these same issues. While America innovates, Europe regulates. And as more businesses gravitate toward the NYSE and NASDAQ, the reality is clear: America remains the best place to invest, even in times of political change.\n\nI’m not alone in believing that. According to the Conference Board’s most recent survey of investors, a record 51.4% of respondents said they expected the current stock market rally to [continue over the next year.](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/consumer-confidence/press/CCI-Oct-2024)\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-american-stocks-boom-11012024.png)\n\n### **The Challenges Here Are Real but Manageable**\n\nTo be fair, the U.S. isn’t without its own set of challenges. National debt has climbed to $35.8 trillion, and consumer credit card debt is [at a 20-year high.](https://www.moneygeek.com/credit-cards/average-credit-card-debt/)\n\nInflation may be down from its peak, but the risk of a resurgence remains. Many remember the double-digit inflation spikes of the 1970s, fueled by government spending, an oil crisis and a weakening dollar after the collapse of Bretton Woods. Some fear a repeat scenario today as debt continues to climb. But let’s remember that even during the 1970s—one of the most volatile decades for the U.S. economy—investors who stayed the course were ultimately rewarded.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-CIP-11012024.png)\n\n### **The Case for Staying Invested in America**\n\nMany readers may be concerned about the upcoming election and the policy shifts it could bring, but betting against America is not a winning strategy. In boom times as well as bust, the U.S. has outperformed. Our economy is innovative, and our financial systems are built to withstand change.\n\nPolitical cycles come and go, yet America continues to lead the world in growth and opportunity.\n\nRemember Buffett’s words: Betting on America has historically paid off. And with the right strategies in place—like a healthy allocation to gold—you can continue to build and hold your wealth for generations to come.\n\n[![How Well Do You Know Bitcoin History? - Test Your Knowledge!](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/11/bitcoin-history-quiz-twt-2023-1024x512.png)]( https://www.usfunds.com/resource/how-well-do-you-know-bitcoin-history/)\n\n### Index Summary\n\n  * The major market indices finished down this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.15%. The S&P 500 Stock Index fell 1.33%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.50%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index lost 0.01% this week.\n  * The Hang Seng Composite lost 7.34% this week; while Taiwan was down 2.43% and the KOSPI fell 1.58%.\n  * The 10-year Treasury bond yield rose 13 basis points to 4.379%.\n\n\n\n### Airlines and Shipping\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing airline stock for the week was xxxx, up xx.x%. According to TD, Alaska Air reported solid third quarter 2024 results with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.25, hitting the high end of the guide and beating consensus of $2.22. Revenue beat consensus by 2.2%. Holiday bookings were cited as being strong as well.\n  * Mitsui O.S.K. Lines announced a share buyback (up to 30 million shares/¥100 billion, 8.28% of shares outstanding, to be repurchased by October 2025), reports JPMorgan. This highlights its undervalued share price versus peers as well as capital efficiency.\n  * According to BMO, Air Canada’s third quarter 2024 results were ahead of expectations on all key metrics, including RASM and adjusted CASM. 2024 guidance was revised higher. The company announced a buyback program for about 10% of its public float.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing airline stock for the week was xxxx, down xx.x%. IndiGo’s second quarter net loss of Rs-10BN missed consensus, reports Bank of America. Second quarter passenger unit revenues were slightly ahead, but second quarter ex-fuel unit costs were worse than expected on higher grounding mitigation costs and airport fee inflation. \n  * According to Bank of America, Asia to Europe volumes are solid despite the Golden Week holidays indicating a strong peak season. However, China-USA volumes remain low (-18% year-over-year) due to tighter customs rules and checks since July due to the De Minimis change Executive Order.\n  * U.S. airlines are now required to give passengers an automatic refund for canceled or significantly delayed flights and for services that were paid for but not provided, such as Wi-Fi or entertainment, reports The Hill. “Passengers deserve to get their money back when an airline owes them—without headaches or haggling. Today, our automatic refund rule goes into full effect. Airlines are required to provide prompt cash refunds without passengers having to ask,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wrote Monday.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * China has agreed to allow more flights between Canada and China. Today, Air Canada operates just four weekly flights between Vancouver and Shanghai and Chinese airlines only operate a handful of weekly flights. According to the report, AC will ramp up Vancouver-Shanghai flights to seven per week and will add daily Vancouver to Beijing.\n  * In the last Trump term, the U.S. reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 39% to 21% and announced tariffs on goods from China in May 2018, which took effect in September. Between May and September of his term, U.S. West and East Cost Ocean freight rates rose 18% year-over-year on average, while imports into the Ports of LA / LB decreased 2%, according to Bank of America. Should President Trump be elected, this could happen again.\n  * Spirit cut its first quarter 2025 schedule by 19%, reports TD. Frontier also pulled out 3.6% ASMs from its March quarter schedule. Both airlines will fly with significantly less capacity in Orlando this quarter and next than they did in the year prior. Southwest, the carrier with the largest share of capacity in Orlando, will keep capacity flat yar-over-year in the March quarter. This should create a nice opportunity for an airline like United that has a smaller presence in the Southeast but had a lot of success in Florida in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/AIR-united-airlines-11012024.png)\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * The U.S. Department of Transportation has launched a public inquiry into the state of competition in the air travel industry, alongside the DOJ, with the comment period to close on December 23.\n  * According to Bank of America, given longer sailing times to Europe, the bank expects some pull-forward of demand. However, this may be insufficient for liners to successfully maintain higher rates due to continued fleet expansion (1.6% increase by year-end) and no signs of capacity rationalization.\n  * Spirit Airlines lowered Jan/Feb/Mar system capacity by -19.5%/-21.6%/-16.9% after last week’s announcement of the sale of 23 aircraft, reports Bank of America. This continues the trend of double-digit capacity contraction into 2025 as the fleet reduction compounds engine availability issues with SAVE’s GTF-powered aircraft.\n\n\n\n### Luxury Goods and International Markets\n\n#### Strength\n\n  * Royal Caribbean reported strong quarterly results, and the company raised its earnings forecast for a fourth time this year. The company expects the demand for cruises to remain strong. Royal Caribbean is the best performing stock among the members of the S&P Global Luxury Index, gaining more than 60% year-to-date.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/LUX-royal-caribbean-11012024.png)\n\n  * The United States consumer confidence recorded its largest monthly gain in over three and a half years in October. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index jumped sharply to 108.7 in October, up from a revised 99.2 last month.\n  * Norwegian Crusie Line Holdings was the top-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury sector, gaining 7.4% in the past five days. Shares gained after the company reported earnings beat.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Moncler faced a setback as shares declined following the company’s third-quarter revenue miss. The Italian maker of high-end puffer jackets is struggling with weaker demand, which is a concern for its overall growth. While the growth in China remained positive during the quarter, it slowed, highlighting potential challenges in maintaining momentum in a key market.\n  * Estée Lauder shares dropped over 20% on Thursday after the company withdrew its fiscal year guidance, citing uncertainty surrounding a new CEO and weak demand in China, according to Bloomberg. L’Oréal shares also fell following the negative news from its competitor.\n  * Cettire, an online marketplace for apparel, was the worst-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury Index, falling 30.8%. The decline followed the release of weak financial results. The company was projected to generate $413.2 million in revenue for the first half of the fiscal year but reported only $155 million in revenue for the three months ending in September.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * In October, China’s manufacturing sector showed signs of recovery, with the official China Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rising to 50.1 from September’s 49.8, surpassing expectations of 49.9. A PMI above 50 indicates expansion, marking the first growth in six months. Similarly, the Caixin PMI increased to 50.3 from 49.3 in September, also indicating expansion. Stronger results may suggest that recent fiscal stimulus measures by Beijing are beginning to positively impact the economy.\n  * Healthy consumer spending in the United States may continue to help offset weakness in the Chinese market. In the third quarter of 2024, optimism in the U.S. economy grew to its highest level in a year, boosting willingness to spend. According to ConsumerWise report, once again high-income consumers were more optimistic about the economy in the third quarter than middle- and low-income consumers.\n  * Prada shares surged 8% on Thursday following the company’s stronger-than-expected quarterly results. Group revenue increased by 18%, driven by the impressive performance of its Miu Miu brand, which saw net sales jump 91% year-over-year. In Japan, retail sales grew by 40%, while the American market showed more modest growth at 7.5%.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * The U.S. presidential election will take place on November 5, but the winner of the very close race between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump may not be known for days after the polls close. As ballots are counted, one candidate may appear to be leading based on early returns, only for a rival to close the gap as more votes are tallied, Routers explained.\n  * The European Union announced it will impose duties on electric vehicle (EV) imports from China. Chinese manufacturers will face tariffs of 17% on BYD vehicles, 18.8% on Geely cars, and 35.3% on vehicles exported by state-owned SAIC. Other EV manufacturers operating in China, including Western companies like Volkswagen and BMW, will be subject to a 20.7% duty. Tesla will face a lower, individually calculated rate of 7.8%. China has strongly opposed the EU’s decision and indicated it may implement retaliatory measures in response.\n  * Mercedes and Porsche are implementing cost reductions in response to significant sales decline in China. Porche’s car deliveries in China have hit a decade low. Mercedes reported its lowest automaking margins in nearly three years after selling fewer expensive models. Volkswagen reported earning miss this week.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/spooky-markets-1024x576.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RvKRo3sa6rA?si=jo67GmiG0PVYELJD)\n\n### Energy and Natural Resources\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing commodity for the week was crude palm oil, rising 7.32%. Demand for palm oil has been strong, coupled with supply woes in part due to aging trees in Indonesia and Malaysia which collectively account for more than 80% of global production. This has pushed palm oil up more than 30% so far this year, as reported by Bloomberg.\n  * Shares of Waaree Energies Ltd. jumped almost 56% in its trading debut after a $514 million initial public offering by India’s largest solar-panel maker, bringing back optimism for the market after the nation’s biggest IPO disappointed investors last week, Bloomberg reports.\n  * According to RBC, total U.S. scrap steel export volumes in August rose 19% year-over-year. The August print is the strongest for total U.S. exports in calendar year 2024, up 30% month-over-month. Total exports have had positive momentum, with the three-month rolling average up21% year-over-year vs. CYTD up 5%.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing commodity for the week was natural gas, dropping 13.81%, with weekly stockpile injections taking stockpiles above the five-year average. Warmer weather is also in the forecast, which will dampen demand. Oil tumbled more than 6% at the start of the week after Israeli strikes against targets in Iran avoided the OPEC member’s crude facilities, writes Bloomberg, raising the prospect for easing hostilities in the region. Brent fell below $72 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate was near $68.\n  * Spot steel index prices declined a bit over the past two weeks, with prices down 2.1% to $710 per ton. The recent decline has primarily been attributed to ongoing spot market weakness in part driven by current uncertainty surrounding economic policy in the U.S.\n  * Per Benchmark, Lithium prices fell this week, now in the $9,500-$11,000 range as prices fell in a lagged response to lower pricing in China, and Hydroxide fell back below the $10,000 mark. Mineral Resources announced this week that it will cut 570 jobs and slow construction at the Mt. Marion lithium project. Management at Mineral Resources is also facing an investor revolt over its deteriorating balance sheet and allegations that management was involved in a tax evasion scheme that is now under investigation.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Koch, Inc. signed a deal with a U.S. lithium venture to provide technology that includes an industry-first guarantee of recovering at least 95% of the metal from salty water using its new extraction methods. The company’s Koch Technology Solutions unit agreed to license its so-called direct lithium extraction process to a joint venture of Standard Lithium Ltd. and Equinor ASA for use in a planned commercial plant in southwest Arkansas, the firms said Monday in a statement.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/ENGY-standard-lithium-11012024.png)\n\n  * Fortescue Ltd. said the iron ore market may have misjudged fundamentals for the key steelmaking ingredient due to the hurdles involved in ramping up overall supplies, as output from existing mines wanes. “There are some supply challenges,” Fortescue’s metals chief Dino Otranto said in an interview at the International Mining and Resources Conference in Sydney on Tuesday. “People are under-appreciating that mines do run out and these huge iron ore deposits that we saw 50, 60 years ago just don’t exist anymore.”\n  * TerraPower LLC, the nuclear energy company backed by billionaire Bill Gates, agreed to invest in construction of a uranium enrichment facility in South Africa to support its own U.S. reactor project. The company also agreed to buy enriched uranium from the facility being built by ASP Isotopes Inc. to help fuel its future reactor in Wyoming.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * China’s copper demand will peak around the end of this decade, according to a state-backed government researcher, offering a potential counterpoint to bullish views on the metal’s prospects. China’s demand growth in the five years up to 2030 will average 1.1%, reports Bloomberg, down from 3.9% in the five years to 2025. The copper intensity of renewables investment is falling as industries bid to reduce usage or find alternative materials.\n  * China’s largest oil and gas companies continue to heed Beijing’s call for more supply. Now, they need the government to ensure there’s sufficient demand for their products. The authorities are belatedly getting to grips with a post- pandemic slowdown that has hobbled profits across Chinese industry. Oil and gas businesses, particularly the operations that refine crude into fuels and make chemicals for items like plastics, are among the worst casualties, according to Bloomberg.\n  * BP Plc raised the possibility that its share buybacks could slow next year from the $1.75 billion quarterly pace seen in 2024, as weaker oil prices push its debt higher. The British oil major’s net debt increased in the third quarter by $1.7 billion to $24.27 billion, reports Bloomberg, the highest since the start of 2022. While that helped the company maintain its buyback for now, BP suggested the level could change in February, when it will review its strategy and financial guidance\n\n\n\n### Bitcoin and Digital Assets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performer for the week was Dogecoin, rising 18.45%.\n  * U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) investing in Bitcoin saw an $870 million net inflow, their third-highest daily haul, as the digital asset flirts with a record high amid speculation about potential outcomes of the U.S. election. Some analysts cite Republican nominee Donald Trump’s elevated odds in election betting markets for the growing demand for Bitcoin exposure, writes Bloomberg.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/CRYP-bitcoin-all-time-high-11012024.png)\n\n  * MicroStrategy Inc. has hired banks to help it raise $42 billion through the sale of new shares and fixed income to buy more Bitcoin after a flurry of deals over the past year. The company hired a handful of banks to sell stock through a so-called at the market offering that could net it $21 billion, reports Bloomberg, while lining up potential sales of fixed-income securities that could bring in the same amount.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performer for the week was IMX, down 20.07%.\n  * Shares of Coinbase Global fell the most in more than two years after the largest U.S. crypto exchange posted results late Wednesday that were below Wall Street expectations. Total revenue increased to $1.21 billion, writes Bloomberg, less than analysts’ forecast of $1.25 billion.\n  * The U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is laying off workers as part of organizational changes following the appointment of a new co-chief executive. Kraken wants to become leaner and faster while streamlining operations. \n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Visa customers with eligible debit cards will be able to deposit funds into their Coinbase Global accounts via a partnership announced by the payments giant and crypto exchange. Coinbase already has millions of connections to customers’ debit cards, but this new development allows for the real-time flow of funds for customers, writes Bloomberg. \n  * The crypto prime brokerage market is booming, and new firms are popping up to get a share of the growth. Growing institutional interest from hedge funds, family offices, and sovereign wealth funds is pushing the valuation of crypto prime brokerages higher, and the bull market is helping the cause, writes Bloomberg. \n  * Superscrypt, a blockchain venture capital company backed by Temasek Holdings, plans to raise up to $100 million for its second investment fund, according to people familiar with the matter. Singapore’s state-owned investment company Temasek has been lined up as an anchor investor in the new fund alongside the New York-based fintech firm Republic, writes Bloomberg. \n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Consensys, a software provider for the Ethereum network being sued by the SEC, blamed regulatory uncertainty caused by the agency in part for its decision to eliminate 162 positions or 20% of its workforce, Bloomberg reports. Consensys operates the popular crypto wallet MetaMask as well as provides a slew of blockchain tools and products.\n  * A cryptocurrency investment scam using the same acronym as the New York Stock Exchange defrauded victims after luring them in with online dating apps. Trading platform NYSE.LPQV.Live solicits inexperienced investors through apps like Tinder, and then directs them to open legitimate cryptocurrency accounts to fund the investments in NYSE, according to Bloomberg. \n  * Citadel securities lawsuit accusing Portofino Technologies AG of trade-secrets thefts can largely move forward against the high-frequency crypto trading startup but not a seed investor in the firm. Citadel securities claimed two former London-based employees secured funding from investors to launch Portofino in Switzerland with trade secrets stolen from the market-making firm, writes Bloomberg.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/07/follow-frank-twt-2023-1024x512.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/frank-talk-subscribe/)\n\n### Defense and Cybersecurity\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) has secured a $3 billion contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to support the LOGIX initiative. This is part of the DoD’s Joint All-Domain Command and Control strategy aimed at enhancing national security through advanced technological solutions.\n  * The United States has approved a $2 billion arms sale to Taiwan, including advanced air defense missile systems that have been battle tested in Ukraine. The goal is to enhance Taiwan’s defense against growing Chinese military pressure. Despite China’s objections, the U.S. is committed by law to support Taiwan’s defense, aiming to maintain regional stability and security.\n  * The best performing stock in the XAR ETF this week was Leonardo DRS Inc., rising 8.74%, after being awarded a $235 million contract by the U.S. Navy to produce AN/SPQ-9B ship protection radars. This will enhance air and surface target detection capabilities.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The Columbia-class nuclear submarines, set to replace the aging Ohio-class and crucial for U.S. naval deterrence, face significant delays and contractor setbacks, escalating lifecycle costs to $348 billion and risking extended service for older submarines. This has prompted concerns from lawmakers and military leaders about reliability and strategic capability.\n  * Oshkosh has lowered its fiscal year 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) forecast to $11.35 from $11.75, citing a softening access equipment market in North America. Expected net sales have been reduced to $10.6 billion from $10.7 billion.\n  * The worst performing stock in the XAR ETF this week was Huntington Ingalls, falling 25.45%, after the company cut its cash-flow forecast and faced delays in securing a Navy submarine contract, alongside supply chain issues and workforce challenges.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Poland is set to begin negotiations for purchasing over 100 HIMARS rocket launchers from Lockheed Martin as part of a broader arms deal. This comes amidst ongoing debates over military procurement policies and a strong defense budget commitment, while also planning for domestic production and concurrent contracts with South Korea for similar systems.\n  * Broadcom shares rose 4% after a report that OpenAI is collaborating with the company and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to develop a new AI chip to meet its growing computing needs.\n  * The LITENING targeting pod, equipped with advanced electro-optical and infrared sensors, has proven itself a game-changing tool for the U.S. Navy’s F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet. It enhances situational awareness and mission effectiveness during combat by enabling precise target identification and rapid response, as demonstrated during initial flight tests and real-world operations.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * European defense stocks have declined, with companies like Rheinmetall and Saab seeing drops after Ukraine indicated that it might consider incorporating peace initiatives from countries such as China, Brazil and South Africa into its own peace proposal.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/WAR-sp-aerospace-index-11012024.png)\n\n  * Iranian officials vowed to retaliate against recent Israeli attacks, escalating tensions that risk further conflict in the region.\n  * Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that a new Rheinmetall military factory in Ukraine, opened in late October, could become a legitimate target for Russian attacks. Rheinmetall continues its plans to establish multiple defense plants in Ukraine despite previous threats from Moscow.\n\n\n\n### Gold Market\n\nThis week gold futures closed at $2,754.60, down $10.50 per ounce, or 0.38%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week lower by 4.12%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in off 2.57%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar rose 0.05%.\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing precious metal for the week was gold, but still down 0.38%. According to Bloomberg, bullion retains a clear upward bias. With wider markets bracing for the potential prospect of Trump 2.0, a poll showed most investors reckoned such an outcome would be bullion positive. A second Trump presidency could bring greater policy disruption, trade tariffs and enhanced geopolitical risks. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, will likely deliver another rate cut next week, which also aids gold’s cause.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/GLD-gold-all-time-highs-11012024.png)\n\n  * Global gold demand swelled about 5% in the third quarter, setting a record for the period and lifting consumption above $100 billion for the first time, according to the World Gold Council. The increase — which saw volumes climb to 1,313 tons — was underpinned by stronger investment flows from the West, including more high-net-worth individuals, that helped offset waning appetite from Asia, the industry-funded group said in a report on Wednesday. \n  * Agnico Eagle Mines reported adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter that beat the average analyst estimate, according to Bloomberg. Adjusted EPS was $1.14 versus $1.01 consensus. Revenue from mining operations $2.16 billion (estimate $2.11 billion).\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing precious metal for the week was palladium, down 7.87% following last week’s surge on western proposal to stop buying certain Russian sourced metals. Gold demand in China — the world’s biggest consumer — plunged by more than a fifth in the third quarter as record prices and a sluggish economy dented consumption, especially for jewelry. Total demand fell by 22% to 218 tons in the three months to September, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from the China Gold Council on Monday.\n  * Gold retreated as some investors booked profit after the metal’s rally to a fresh record. Bullion fell by as much as 2% after earlier reaching a fresh record of $2,790.10. The drop followed the release of strong economic data, which boosts the chance of a cautious approach to interest-rate cuts in the months ahead. Lower borrowing costs tend to benefit the precious metal, as it does not pay interest, according to Bloomberg.\n  * Eldorado Gold Corp. reported on Friday that its share price dropped as much as 6% after the company adjusted its production guidance for the year. The revised guidance places production at the lower end of previous estimates, while cash costs are expected to be at the higher end.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * According to Canaccord, gold valuations remain attractive with the senior producers trading at 0.69x NAV, up from a recent low of 0.57x but below the historical average of 0.81x and at the lower end of the 0.65-1.0x range. \n  * According to RBC, junior gold valuations have started to move higher along with metal prices, but remain depressed versus historical levels and prior peaks. They continue to see significant value in the group at spot metal prices and strong potential for re-rating versus producers on increased appetite for new projects with better economics at higher prices. Costs have capped upside as well as a weak M&A market.\n  * According to Bank of America, silver net non-commercial long positions on the CME have risen but are still below all-time highs. Investor interest has also been inconsistent across other segments, with a gap emerging between silver prices and risk reversals. Inflows into physically backed ETFs remain relatively low. However, with strong demand for silver from the EV sector and the potential for accelerated industrial production in the coming quarters, there is room for silver prices to rally further.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * According to RBC, Gold Road Resources’ Q3 gold production fell 9% below estimates, while all-in sustaining costs (AISC) rose by 17%, increasing the risk of meeting the revised guidance for calendar year 2024. The guidance remains unchanged at 290-305K ounces, but a strong Q4 performance will be essential to achieve this target.\n  * According to RBC, Ramelius Resources had a weak Q1, with gold production down 15%, all-in sustaining costs (AISC) up 11%, and tax-adjusted cash flow down by A$32 million—all below estimates. The production shortfall was primarily driven by the Mt Magnet site, raising concerns that these issues may persist throughout the year.\n  * After Newmont reported disappointing earnings on October 23, its stock price has fallen lower in price each day for the past eight days, posting its longest losing streak in five years. Generalist investors who may have played Newmont as their liquid gold stock exposure were negatively rewarded for stepping back into gold.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/which-ferrari-IA-1024x512.png)](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/which-ferrari-matches-your-personality/) [![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/01/lL-files-1.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/LLFiles-11012024.pdf)\n\nU.S. Global Investors, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Investors are wondering how to position their money, bracing for the possibility of significant volatility and market shifts.\n\nWhile some hedge funds are making bold moves on so-called “Trump trades,” we at U.S. Global Investors see things differently.\n\nIn fact, I share billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones’ recent outlook on gold and Bitcoin (which validates what I have been writing about for many years). Like him, we currently favor alternative assets as the smart play going forward.\n\nIt’s not that we’re betting against stocks or the economy, which we believe will do well over time no matter who wins the White House next month. Nevertheless, the writing is clearly on the wall: Ballooning U.S. debt and geopolitical tensions all point to the need for a strong hedge.\n\n### The Ballooning U.S. Debt Problem\n\nYou won’t be surprised to read that the U.S. debt situation has spiraled out of control. Just 25 years ago, the national debt was a little under 60% of GDP. Today, that rate has doubled to 120%.\n\nAccording to Paul Tudor Jones, founder and CEO of Tudor Investment Corp., this puts the U.S. in a precarious position—one that’s unsustainable in the long run unless serious action is taken to rein in government spending.\n\nWe all know that politicians have a knack for promising more spending (in the Democrats’ case) or tax cuts (in the Republicans’ case) to keep voters happy. It’s easy to see why Jones is concerned that either approach will only exacerbate the debt problem. As he [pointed out,](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/22/tudor-jones-is-long-gold-and-bitcoin-as-hedge-fund-titan-believes-all-roads-lead-to-inflation.html) the U.S. is “going to be broke really quick unless we get serious about dealing with our spending issues.”\n\nThat’s not just a dramatic soundbite—it’s a reality check. The federal deficit for 2024 soared above $1.8 trillion, up 8% from the previous year. Meanwhile, the debt burden, which is rapidly nearing $36 trillion, shows no signs of easing.\n\n![U.S. Deficit Spending Continues to Spiral Out of Control](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-deficit-10242024.png)\n\n### All Roads Lead to Inflation\n\nWhen the government keeps printing money to finance its spending, the [inevitable result is inflation.](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/federal-spending-was-responsible-2022-spike-inflation-research-shows) And in times of inflation, the purchasing power of traditional assets like bonds erodes. That’s why Jones favors assets that perform well in inflationary environments such as gold, silver, commodities and Bitcoin. I agree wholeheartedly with this assessment.\n\nThink about it: Why would you want to own fixed-income assets when interest rates are being adjusted and are likely to be lower than the inflation rate? Long-dated bonds are particularly vulnerable. U.S. banks, remember, are still dealing with billions of dollars in unrealized losses on their fixed-income positions. According to [Florida Atlantic University’s bank screener,](https://business.fau.edu/departments/finance/banking-initiative/unrealized-losses-investment-securities/) Bank of America’s unrealized losses on held-to-maturity investments in the first quarter were a staggering $110 billion, more than any other U.S. institution by far.\n\nThe Fed will likely try to “inflate” its way out of this mess, meaning it will keep nominal interest rates lower than inflation to support economic growth. For investors, this means that preserving wealth will require smart positioning in alternative assets.\n\nJones is already betting against the bond market— “I am clearly not going to own any fixed-income,” he told CNBC this week—and I believe many investors would be wise to take a similar approach.\n\n### The Case for Gold and Silver\n\nLet’s start with gold and silver. Both have been go-to haven assets for centuries, and for good reason. When geopolitical tensions have risen, when inflation has reared its ugly head and/or when there’s been uncertainty in the markets, investors have flocked to gold and silver.\n\nThis year is no exception. We’ve seen gold shatter records multiple times in 2024, with prices rising more than 32% year-to-date, the metal’s best annual growth since 1979.\n\nAccording to data from the [World Gold Council,](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/golds-long-term-expected-return) gold has consistently outperformed both inflation and the growth rate of the world economy. From 1971 to 2023, gold’s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) was 8%, compared to 4% for the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) and 7.8% for global GDP growth.\n\n![Gold Has Kept Pace with Global GDP and Exceeded Inflation](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-gold-inflation-10242024.png)\n\nSilver, often dubbed the “poor man’s gold,” is another asset that deserves attention. With its industrial applications, especially in the green energy sector, silver has strong potential for future growth. According to one projection, the clean energy transition could dramatically increase the demand for silver in photovoltaic (PV) technology, potentially consuming [between 85% and a jaw-dropping 98% ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pip.3661)of current global silver reserves by 2050.\n\n### Bitcoin: The Digital Gold\n\nNow, let’s talk about Bitcoin. The world’s largest digital asset has quickly become a preferred store of value for many investors, especially those looking to hedge against fiat currency depreciation. Nearly half of all traditional hedge funds currently [maintain exposure to cryptos, ](https://cointelegraph.com/news/hedge-funds-increase-crypto-investment-2024)including Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutions are also backing Bitcoin with the same enthusiasm. Just look at BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. It’s one of the fastest-growing ETFs in financial history, with assets under management now over $26 billion. That’s no small feat.\n\nBitcoin’s decentralized nature, capped supply and growing institutional acceptance make it an attractive asset in times of uncertainty. Like gold, it’s a hedge against inflation, but it also offers the potential for significant upside as more investors and institutions recognize its value.\n\n### Don’t Get Distracted by the Election Noise\n\nNow, I know many of you are wondering: “What about the election? What if Trump wins? What if Harris wins?”\n\nHere’s a news flash for you: Over the long run, it may not matter as much as you think. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, [made a great point](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrocks-larry-fink-says-us-143857961.html) recently when he said that he’s “tired of hearing this is the biggest election in your lifetime. The reality is over time, it doesn’t matter.”\n\nWhile hedge funds are taking positions in “Trump trades” like private prisons and fossil fuels, we believe that trying to time the market based on election outcomes is a risky game. Yes, the election will cause short-term volatility, but if you’re in the right assets—like gold, silver and Bitcoin—I believe you’ll be well-positioned to weather the storm.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/spooky-markets-1024x576.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RvKRo3sa6rA?si=jo67GmiG0PVYELJD)\n\n### Index Summary\n\n  * The major market indices finished mostly down this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.68%. The S&P 500 Stock Index fell 0.98%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.16%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index fell 2.94% this week.\n  * The Hang Seng Composite lost 8.21% this week; while Taiwan was down 0.59% and the KOSPI fell 0.41%.\n  * The 10-year Treasury bond yield gained 15 basis points to 4.24%.\n\n\n\n### Airlines and Shipping\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing airline stock for the week was Spirit, up 89.9%. Alaska Air expects its third quarter 2024 combined results to be on the better end of its previously guided earnings per share (EPS) range, inclusive of 13 days of Hawaiian’s results. The carrier expects to report the industry’s best adjusted pre-tax margin performance for the quarter, with positive revenue and cost performance in the quarter. Revenue trends experienced throughout the third quarter are continuing into the fourth quarter, with strong advanced booking performance for both the Alaska and Hawaiian networks.\n\n![Alaska Airlines Has Been Doing Well After Hawaiian Approval](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/AIR-alaska-airlines-10242024.png)\n\n  * According to Shippingwatch, the major container port of Los Angeles had its busiest quarter to date. A total of 954,706 containers passed through the West Coast port in September, according to an update from the Port of Los Angeles. This represents a 27% increase compared to the same month last year, making the period from July through September the busiest ever for the port, with a total of 2.58 million TEU.\n  * Volaris reported solid third quarter results, reports JPMorgan, above Bloomberg consensus from top to bottom line. EBITDAR was at $315 million and EBITDA at $274 million, both including the compensation from Pratt & Whitney. The positive surprise was led by a combination of 2% higher than anticipated yield and 5% lower than anticipated fuel costs.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing airline stock for the week was Norwegian Air Shuttle, down 17.4%. According to RBC, the Boeing vote against the agreement was 64%. The latest offer would have increased wages by 35% over four years and included a $7,000 ratification bonus as well as a $5,000 contribution into a retirement plan. The latest offer did not include a re-instatement of the company’s pension plan. The initial contract offer was rejected by 96% of the union members, so it appears that Boeing is getting closer.\n  * According to Morgan Stanley, freight rates are continuing their downward correction following the premature peak season and front-loading of volumes, leaving shipping lines facing an underwhelming winter. The Drewry World Container Index (WCI) continued its drastic downward trajectory, established in July, reaching $3,216 per container.\n  * Airbus deliveries continue to trend at a slow pace, reports Bank of America, with 35 aircraft delivered month-to-date versus 71 last year. First flights indicate better underlying production but there remains a lot to do in the last 10 weeks of the year. The bank continues to expect Airbus to come in below the 770-delivery guidance with the firm estimating 760 in fiscal year 2024.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * According to TD, United Airlines has an immense lead in international travel due to management’s prudent decision not to retire widebodies during the pandemic. Cirium data shows that United currently has 220 widebodies in service. This compares to 168 at Delta and 126 at American.\n  * Goldman has reported that the number of container ships waiting to dock and unload goods along the West Coast remained at two, but East Coast backlogs declined significantly from 27 to 10, likely reflecting improving port throughput post the recent East/Gulf coast port strikes.\n  * Frontier Airlines is in the early stages of a renewed bid for Spirit Airlines, reports the Wall St. Journal. The combination would create a national ULCC better able to compete for price conscious traffic and should be easy to approve by the DOJ and DOT.\n\n![Spirit Shareholders Have Doubled Their Money In Three Days - Potential Frontier Takeout On The Way](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/AIR-spirit-shareholders-have-doubled-10242024.png)\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * According to TD, Frontier/Spirit certainly changes the calculus for the industry. A national high utilization ultra-low-cost carrier takes away the dynamic of two carriers chasing the same cost-conscious traffic. The combined entity will likely be in a stronger position to compete in the Southeast and Caribbean which is negative for American, Southwest, and JetBlue.\n  * The past two winters have been particularly mild, reports Stifel, and the possibility of energy shortages never materialized. With relatively heathy current storage levels and after two years of not needing the extra gas, there is very little in the way of floating storage now. The number of ships used has peaked around two dozen in late October to mid-November, but now storage is only about half a dozen vessels.\n  * Frontier Airlines lowered its January system capacity by 940 basis points (bps), according to Bank of America. The cuts follow similar reductions in recent weeks. This week, Latin American cuts (-15.6%) were greater than domestic cuts (-8.0%). First quarter 2025 system capacity is tracking toward +11.3% from flat to down in the fourth quarter of 2024, but they expect more meaningful cuts to the first quarter over the coming weeks.\n\n\n\n### Luxury Goods and International Markets\n\n#### Strength\n\n  * Tesla reported better-than-anticipated results, earning $0.72 per share compared to the expected $0.63. The company generated $25.2 billion in revenue, reflecting a 7% increase from the same period last year. Additionally, it announced plans to launch a more affordable electric vehicle in the first half of next year.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/LUX-tesla-shares-surge-10252024-1.png)\n\n  * Hermès reported a rise in sales for the third quarter, achieving quarterly sales of $3.9 billion, representing 11% growth. Sales in Japan were particularly strong, increasing by about 23%. However, the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan) experienced weaker performance, largely due to subdued demand in China.\n  * Tesla was the top-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury sector, gaining 21.4% in the past five days. Shares surged after the company reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Loreal posted disappointing sales last quarter, as the beauty company saw much wekeaer demand in China. “In mainland China, the beauty market, which was already negative in the second quarter, contuned to detoriorate impacted ny low consumer confidence,” Loreal said.\n  * The Eurozone Services PMI, which measure the activity level of purchasing managers in the services sector, eased to 51.2 in October of 2024 from 51.4 in the previous month. New orders decreased for the second consecutive month, and at the fastest pace since January.\n  * Capri Holdings was the worst-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury index, losing 49%. Shares declined after a jugde blocked the purcahse of the company by Tapestry. \n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Tesla reported higher profits due to lower costs and increased sales. They noted that the Cybertruck became profitable within a year of its launch. The company’s battery and solar operations grew by 52% year-over-year, while services and other revenue increased by 29% compared to Q3 2023. CEO Elon Musk said on the earnings call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, due to “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.”\n  * Estée Lauder has partnered with Amazon to launch its products on the Amazon Premium Beauty store, introducing a Virtual Foundation Tool for customers. This move could enhance Estee Lauder’s market reach and potentially influence its stock performance.\n  * The Chinese government’s plan to nearly double spending on housing projects to $562 billion could stimulate economic activity and consumer confidence. This may lead to a rebound in luxury spending, benefiting companies within the ETF that are heavily reliant on Chinese markets.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Barclays has lowered its sales and earnings per share estimates for LVMH for this year and next. The broker noted that a recent miss in the Fashion & Leather Goods division indicates weaker-than-expected demand from Chinese customers, suggesting that recovery may take longer than anticipated.\n  * Brokers continue to downgrade luxury brands, particularly those heavily reliant on Chinese customers. Citibank downgraded Kering to neutral, removing a buy rating it had maintained for over a decade. As a result, Kering shares fell by as much as 1.8% on Monday and are on track for their worst year since the Global Financial Crisis, down approximately 40%.\n  * Pre-owned home sales in the U.S. for the first nine months of the year were lower than in the same period last year. Elevated real estate prices and high mortgage rates may be keeping potential buyers on the sidelines. While mortgage rates declined around the time of the Federal Reserve’s initial rate cut, they have recently risen back above the 6% level.\n\n[![Stay Empowered With Valuable Insights - Subscribe to the Frank Talk Blog!](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/10/stay-empowered-ft-twt-2023-1024x512.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/frank-talk-subscribe/)\n\n### Energy and Natural Resources\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing commodity for the week was natural gas, rising 12.84% after what might be a bottom in the market, which has fallen for nearly three weeks. India’s largest solar-panel producer’s $514 million initial public offering (IPO) was fully subscribed in the first few hours of opening, benefiting from the world-beating rally in the nation’s renewable energy stocks this year, according to Bloomberg. \n  * Investors are upbeat on nuclear power following news that Amazon signed several agreements to support funding and development of the X-energy Xe-100 SMR, and an agreement with U.S. utility Dominion to explore SMR deployment in Virginia. This adds to increasing momentum behind growth in nuclear energy and potential for new nuclear builds in the U.S., which RBC views as positive long-term drivers for the sector.\n\n![Uranium Prices Are Starting To Rally](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/ENGY-uranium-prices-rally-10252024.png)\n\n  * Zinc is rapidly moving deeper into a market structure that suggests supply of the metal used to galvanize steel is tightening. The cash price is at a $24.09 premium to three-month contracts on the London Metal Exchange, a pattern known as backwardation where near-term prices are higher than those further out, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing commodity for the week was uranium, as proxied by the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, dropping 5.06% with the surge in momentum over the past several weeks tapering off from the price. UBS’s weekly refining margins tracker points to a further decline in UBS European composite refining margin. The average refining margin for the week was down $0.23 per barrel to $4.61 per barrel.\n  * Global steel production has declined by 5%, primarily due to a 6% year-over-year drop in China. Production outside of China fell by a smaller margin, down 3%, with Russia and Iran contributing to the decrease. This was partially balanced by steady growth in countries like Brazil, Turkey, Mexico and Ukraine, according to Morgan Stanley.\n  * Iron ore fell as traders weighed prospects for rising supplies against China’s efforts to put a floor under the economic slowdown in the top importer. Futures dipped briefly below $100 a ton in Singapore, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Saudi Aramco is bullish on China’s oil consumption after the government introduced a raft of stimulus measures aimed at reviving Asia’s biggest economy, CEO Amin H. Nasser said. Demand for jet fuel is a bright spot for the nation, said Nasser, who was speaking at the Singapore International Energy Week conference on Monday, according to Bloomberg.\n  * Lundin Mining heirs Adam and Jack Lundin are betting big on Argentina’s copper potential as they lead the company into the country’s volatile landscape. This ambitious move aligns with the family’s legacy of taking risks in underexplored regions, but also highlights the challenges of operating in politically unstable and economically uncertain areas. With Argentina’s government backing resource extraction, the Lundins hope to capitalize on the global demand for copper essential for clean energy, though success hinges on navigating the country’s unpredictable future, reports mining.com.\n  * According to Bloomberg, Mitsubishi Power Ltd. sees the world ordering 50% more gas turbines annually through 2026, compared with the past three years, driven in part by data center growth. Globally, there will be 60 gigawatts worth of equipment orders every year from 2024 through 2026, up from an average annual capacity of 40 gigawatts sold between 2021 and 2023, said Takao Tsukui, executive vice president of international sales at Mitsubishi Power, the world’s top supplier of gas turbines. \n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Almost nine years after a devastating dam collapse at a Brazilian iron ore mine, BHP Group Ltd. is set to defend allegations at a London trial that it is “cynically and doggedly” trying to avoid its liability to pay billions in compensation to the communities hit hardest. The collapse of Fundão Dam at an iron ore joint venture between Vale SA and BHP is at the heart of one of the largest UK class actions of its kind starting Monday, according to Bloomberg.\n  * Morgan Stanley says that oil demand is down from a peak of 1.5 million barrels per day (mb/d) earlier this year, but this has continued to fall, even in the last two weeks. The average forecast now stands at just 870,000 b/d. Growth in refined product demand is now estimated at just 455,000b/d. Notably, the average forecast now sees China’s oil demand growth at close to zero this year.\n  * The key raw material needed to make aluminum is tearing toward a record high as buyers race to secure supplies, following an export disruption in top-miner Guinea that has rippled through to China. Prices for alumina have surged by more than 20% so far this month and are now within striking distance of the record of $707.75 set in 2018, according to pricing agency Fastmarkets Ltd. \n\n\n\n### Bitcoin and Digital Assets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performer for the week was Safe (SAFE), rising 62.99%.\n  * Options traders are increasing bets that Bitcoin will reach a record high of $80,000 by the end of November no matter who wins the U.S. presidential election. The IV for Bitcoin options coming due around the November 5 election day is elevated, writes Bloomberg, with the wagers skewed toward call options that give the buyer the right to buy the cryptocurrency at new highs.\n\n![Prospect of Friendlier U.S. Crypto Rules Boosts Bitcoin](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/CRYP-crypto-rules-boosts-bitcoin-10242024.png)\n\n  * Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones said he is long gold and Bitcoin in an interview with CNBC this week. He expects that the path forward will be inflationary regardless of who lands in the White House – though he has started positioning for a Trump victory, according to an article published by Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performer for the week was Aerodrome Finance (AERO), down 22.23%.\n  * Portofino Technologies, a Switzerland-based crypto market making firm that was given the nod earlier this year form the FCA to serve institutional crypto clients in the UK, has seen an exodus of staff in recent months, following the sacking of the firm’s co-founder and its head of finance, writes Bloomberg. \n  * India is considering banning cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in favor of its own central bank digital currency, according to Bloomberg, with key regulatory institutions advocating for the move. This comes as the government is preparing a discussion paper on the future of crypto regulation in the country.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Bitcoin came close to $70,000 on Monday after a spurt of inflows into ETFs for the largest digital asset as well as optimism about the outlook for the U.S. regulation supported sentiment. Bitcoin rose 1% before paring some of gains to trade at $68,252, writes Bloomberg. \n  * Nimbus Capital is investing $10 million in Alvara Protocol to revolutionize asset management in Defi. Alvara is a transformative platform aimed at democratizing asset management within the DeFi space. Built on the newly developed ERC-7621 token standard, Alvara introduces an innovative tokenized basket factory that streamlines and simplifies basket management, making it more accessible for all users, writes Bloomberg.\n  * Crypto hedge fund managers JellyC and Trovio Asset Management have merged as part of an effort to attract allocations from institutions such as pension funds. Australia-based JellyC will be the majority shareholder of the combined operation, company executives said in interviews. \n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin continued his recent series of blog posts addressing Ethereum’s future in a new post which outlines possible approaches the blockchain’s community can take to mitigate proof-of-stake centralization risks as part of the planned “Scourge” upgrade, The Block reports. \n  * Last week’s roundup of crypto promoters and traders, following an elaborate string operation by federal prosecutors, served as a reminder that fake trades used to inflate prices continue to be a lingering issue in the digital asset world, Bloomberg reports. The wash trading strategy used to boost the FBI-created token NexFundAI remains a common practice on decentralized-finance exchanges and can be encountered on certain centralized exchanges as well.\n  * Valeria “Bitmama” Fedyakina, a Russian influencer, faces 10 years in prison for $22 million crypto fraud. Law enforcement previously suspected her of treason but recently charged her with economic crimes alone, writes Bloomberg. Fedyakina allegedly defrauded at least four Russian businessmen with a phony cross-border payment scheme.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/which-ferrari-IA-1024x512.png)](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/which-ferrari-matches-your-personality/)\n\n### Defense and Cybersecurity\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * MTU Aero Engines’ military business drove a 14% rise in revenue and an increase in adjusted net profit to €541 million in the first nine months of the year.\n  * RTX announced that its Raytheon unit secured $676 million in U.S. Army contracts to continue producing the TOW missile system, with production set for Tucson, Arizona.\n  * The best performing stock this week was LOAR Holdings, rising 7.76%, following Honeywell’s earnings report on October 24, with Loar historically showing an average one-day move of 39% compared to Honeywell’s 2.5%, according to Bloomberg’s supply chain analysis.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Chinese President Xi Jinping urged the military to intensify war preparedness and ensure strong combat capabilities during a visit to the People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force, following large-scale drills around Taiwan.\n  * Turkey launched airstrikes on Kurdish militant targets in Iraq and Syria in response to a deadly attack on a state-owned defense firm in Ankara, killing five people, with officials attributing the assault to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the The People’s Defense Units (YPG).\n  * Textron Inc. was the worst-performing stock this week, dropping 8.55% after reporting third-quarter earnings and revenue below analyst expectations. The company’s aviation segment was affected by a labor strike, and its earnings per share (EPS) forecast for 2024 was subsequently downgraded.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Palantir announced a strategic partnership with L3Harris to advance U.S. defense technology by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with L3Harris’ cutting-edge hardware. The collaboration aims to improve situational awareness, target identification and communication through joint efforts in U.S. Army programs and enterprise-wide digital transformation initiatives.\n\n![Planantir Stock Price Rises Following Strategic Partnership With L3Harris](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/WAR-palantir-rises-10242024.png)\n\n  * Saab expects its 2023 sales to reach the upper end of its 15-20% growth guidance, driven by increased defense spending and significant orders, including a $600 million contract and a $123 million order from Lithuania. In the third quarter, Saab’s order bookings rose 41% to $2 billion, net profit increased to 966 million kronor, and sales grew 18% to 13.55 billion kronor.\n  * Hensoldt and Raytheon have partnered to enhance electro-optical and infrared systems for NATO forces, establishing a maintenance facility in Germany by early 2025, with plans to expand their collaboration to both airborne and land-based defense programs.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing suspended shipments to a client after discovering a Huawei product contained a chip supplied by the company, prompting an investigation and notification of U.S. and Taiwan governments.\n  * The FBI has launched an investigation into the leak of classified U.S. intelligence documents, which detail Israel’s potential plans for a retaliatory strike against Iran, after the material was posted to the Telegram messaging app, reportedly from a Tehran-based channel.\n  * ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet anticipates growing pressure from the U.S. to further limit semiconductor technology sales to China, highlighting geopolitical tensions and questioning the best approach for the Netherlands and Europe amid these restrictions.\n\n\n\n### Gold Market\n\nThis week gold futures closed the week at $2,754.90, up $24.90 per ounce, or 0.91%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week lower by x.97%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in off 0.28%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar rose 0.83%.\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing precious metal for the week was palladium, up 10.10%. Palladium surged after the U.S. asked G7 allies to consider sanctions on Russian exports of the metal. The Biden administration floated potential restrictions during a meeting of G-7 finance officials in Washington this week as it mulls fresh ways to squeeze President Vladimir Putin’s war efforts, according to Bloomberg.\n  * Wheaton Precious Metals’ unit has entered a definitive pact with Montage Gold in respect to its Kone Gold Project, according to a statement. They will pay Montage total upfront cash of $625 million in four equal installments during construction. This project is expected to have a 16-year mine life based on reserves, with first production anticipated in early 2027, according to Bloomberg.\n  * Gold extended its rally to a fresh record high, amid tensions in the Middle East and as traders looked toward the U.S. presidential election. Bullion rose higher — having breached the $2,700- an-ounce threshold — with analysts attributing gains to haven demand amid uncertainty around, according to Bloomberg.\n\n![Gold Soars To Record Highs](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/GLD-gold-soars-record-highs-10242024.png)\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Gold was the weakest-performing precious metal this week, though it still managed a slight gain of 0.91%. RBC reports that Newmont’s third-quarter results fell below expectations, with EBITDA -16% under consensus. Key factors included significantly higher third-quarter costs and a revised full-year cost increase of 9% over previous guidance. Generalist investors, who had bought Newmont shares following a strong second-quarter report, sold off the stock, leading to a 16% decline over the week.\n  * RBC reports that Calibre Mining announced third-quarter 2024 gold sales of 46,100 ounces, falling short of both consensus estimates of 74,000 ounces and RBC’s own estimate of 76,500 ounces. Due to these lower-than-expected results, Calibre reduced its annual production guidance from 275,000–300,000 ounces to 230,000–240,000 ounces and raised its cost guidance. Production delays were attributed to adjustments needed for newly opened underground workings.\n  * BMO reports that Petra Diamonds released its first-quarter fiscal 2025 operating results, along with sales outcomes from its combined Tenders 1 and 2, held after the quarter ended. Diamond production fell short of BMO’s estimates due to operational adjustments at the Finsch mine. First-quarter revenue was affected by Petra’s decision to postpone Tender 1 in response to weaker market demand.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * RBC reports that Bellevue Gold posted a first-quarter cash flow beat of A$40 million above consensus, driven by lower costs, while production and growth capital expenditures aligned with expectations. Bellevue achieved strong cash flow and unit costs of A$1,892 per ounce (against a fiscal 2025 guidance of A$1,750–1,850 per ounce), despite processing more lower-grade tons than anticipated in the first quarter. RBC expects grades to improve throughout fiscal 2025, along with a steady increase in mine tonnage.\n  * According to Scotia, silver is currently trading near $34 per ounce, up 42% year-to-date, having broken above the prior resistance in the mid $32-per-ounce level, though still below the all-time highs near $50 per oz reached on two prior occasions in 1980 and 2011. The Silver Institute has also noted that the physical silver market recorded a deficit in each of the last two years, with another deficit forecast for 2024. Furthermore, they continue to see silver supply growth challenged in jurisdictions such as Mexico in particular.\n  * Shares in Chow Tai Fook, one of China’s biggest gold retailers, rose as much as 10% as Morgan Stanley noted the retailer’s sales were showing signs of recovery. Gold’s momentum in China had slowed such that domestic prices were trading at a discount to international prices. If this is a real change in sentiment for gold as proxied by jewelry-buying, this could be a renewed catalyst to take prices higher.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * A ruby smuggling syndicate circulated a disinformation campaign that the Gemfields ruby mine was opening its mine to anyone that wanted to mine. Thus, about 300 people on Sunday invaded a pit at Gemfields Group Ltd.’s ruby mine in Mozambique, which accounts for about half the world’s supply of the stones, CEO Sean Gilbertson said. Two people were shot and injured by police, he said. A crowd of about 500 people later gathered at a village near the Montepuez ruby mine in northeastern Mozambique intending to enter the mine.\n  * Newmont’s recent earnings call revealed operational challenges, with a downward revision in production due to underperformance at key mines, leading to a 16% share drop for the week. This, alongside Barrick’s disputes with the Malian government over profit sharing, highlights the increasing geopolitical and operational risks in the gold industry. These pressures threaten the ability of major miners to meet growth targets, suggesting a need for potential M&A as reserves dwindle.\n  * Morgan Stanley indicates mining companies have cut production and cancelled rough sales, such as Petra Diamonds and De Beers, to reduce historically high inventories. Prices also remain under pressure, with implied September rough prices decreasing 27% month-over-month and 32% year-over-year.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/gold-bitcoin-YT-1024x576.jpg)](https://youtu.be/sB690WrZjGc?si=sA4c_slvFVzYOWgQ) [![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/01/lL-files-1.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/LLFiles-10252024.pdf)\n\nU.S. Global Investors, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

The stock closed up more than 12% on Wednesday, making it the day’s best-performing S&P 500 stock.\n\nI believe United’s buyback program makes a lot of sense. It highlights executives’ confidence in the company’s future growth, for one.\n\nAirline stocks also remain cheap relative to the market, presenting an incredible value opportunity. As of this month, the S&P 500 Airlines Index had a low price-to-earnings (P/E) of 9.92. Compared to the S&P 500, airline stocks are 2.5 times cheaper. Compared to transportation stocks—which include not just commercial jets but also rail, trucks, logistics and ride-hailing services—airline names are about five times cheaper.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/AIR-airline-stocks-cheap-10182024.png)\n\nKeep in mind that the second half of the year has historically been a strong period for airline stocks. According to Bank of America’s analysis, the industry has outperformed the S&P 500 in the months of September, October, and November in recent years.\n\n### **Nuclear Energy Stocks Surge as Tech Giants Invest in the Future**\n\nIf you’ve been paying attention to the markets, especially in recent months, you’ve likely noticed something interesting happening with nuclear energy stocks. Shares of companies involved in uranium and nuclear, like NuScale Power, Oklo, Cameco and Centrus Energy, have been surging, driven in large part by groundbreaking nuclear energy deals with major tech firms.\n\nThis trend isn’t just another market blip—it’s part of a larger movement that has far-reaching implications for investors, especially as we enter the age of artificial intelligence (AI). Nuclear energy truly appears to be staging a major comeback.\n\n### **The AI Boom and the Need for Power**\n\nYou don’t have to be a tech expert to know that AI is changing everything. From self-driving cars to advanced data analytics, artificial intelligence is quickly becoming a key part of our modern economy, valued at [$184 billion today.](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1474143/global-ai-market-size) But what many people don’t realize is just how much electricity is required to power the data centers that make AI possible.\n\nCompanies like Microsoft, Amazon and Google are racing to build out data centers capable of handling this incredible demand, and they need a lot of energy to do it. By one estimate, data centers could consume up to [9% of the United States’ electricity by 2030,](https://www.epri.com/about/media-resources/press-release/q5vU86fr8TKxATfX8IHf1U48Vw4r1DZF) more than double what they’re using today. That’s a staggering amount of power, and it raises serious questions about how we’re going to meet that demand in a way that’s both reliable and sustainable.\n\nHere’s the thing: Renewable energy sources like wind and solar, as popular as they are, simply aren’t enough to get the job done. They’re intermittent, meaning they can’t provide electricity 24/7. That’s where nuclear comes in.\n\n### **The Nuclear Renaissance**\n\nFor years, nuclear power has been out of favor in the U.S. High costs, regulatory hurdles and the public’s lingering fears from accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima have kept many from embracing it.\n\nBut times are changing. This week alone, we saw two major announcements that signal what I believe is a new era for nuclear energy in the U.S.\n\nAmazon [signed agreements](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/amazon-nuclear-small-modular-reactor-net-carbon-zero) to support the construction of several new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) in the Pacific Northwest. These reactors, owned and operated by Energy Northwest, will eventually generate enough power to serve the needs of over 770,000 U.S. homes. Meanwhile, Google [announced](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-kairos-power-nuclear-energy-agreement/) a partnership with Kairos Power to bring 500 megawatts of SMRs online by 2035.\n\nPerhaps the most eye-catching deal came from Microsoft, which made headlines for partnering with Constellation Energy to [revive the Three Mile Island nuclear plant](https://www.constellationenergy.com/newsroom/2024/Constellation-to-Launch-Crane-Clean-Energy-Center-Restoring-Jobs-and-Carbon-Free-Power-to-The-Grid.html)—yes, _that_ Three Mile Island, renamed as Crane Clean Energy Center. Microsoft is betting $1.6 billion to restore the plant by 2028 and secure carbon-free energy for the next 20 years.\n\nAdd all this up, and 2025 is expected to usher in a [record amount of nuclear generation,](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/6b2fd954-2017-408e-bf08-952fdd62118a/Electricity2024-Analysisandforecastto2026.pdf) with more than half of it coming from China and India, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-nuclear-generation-expected-10182024.png)\n\n### **A Golden Opportunity for Investors**\n\nWhat’s driving these tech giants to invest in nuclear? Simple: Nuclear power offers reliable, clean energy 24/7, making it potentially capable of meeting the enormous demands of AI-driven data centers. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) recently released a report showing that data centers’ electricity consumption could more than double by 2030. As demand skyrockets, traditional renewables like solar and wind won’t be able to provide the uninterrupted power that companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google require.\n\nIn the long run, these tech companies are likely making smart bets. Bain & Co. forecasts that U.S. energy demand could outstrip supply in just a few short years. By 2028, utilities will need to increase annual electricity generation [by up to 26%](https://www.bain.com/insights/utilities-must-reinvent-themselves-to-harness-the-ai-driven-data-center-boom/) to keep pace with projected demand. Nuclear power is uniquely positioned to fill the gap, and it’s no wonder Wall Street has started to take notice.\n\nSince Microsoft’s nuclear deal with Constellation was announced, stocks in companies like Oklo have skyrocketed. Oklo, which is backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has surged more than 166% in the month through mid-October. Other nuclear stocks, including NuScale and Centrus Energy, have also seen impressive gains. For investors looking for exposure to the energy sources that will power the AI age, nuclear might just be the next big thing.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-us-uranium-nuclear-stocks-10182024.png)\n\n### **The Long Road Ahead**\n\nNuclear power is not without its challenges. Building new plants is still incredibly expensive, and the industry has been plagued by cost overruns for years. Just look at Microsoft’s deal with Constellation—according to Morgan Stanley, Microsoft is paying at least 100% over market rates for the power they’ll get from Three Mile Island.\n\nBut given the powerful demand trends we’re seeing, this could actually turn out to be a bargain a few years down the road. Nuclear energy provides reliable, carbon-free power at a scale that renewables simply can’t match, and with global data center energy consumption expected to double by 2027, we believe that the value proposition for nuclear is only going to grow stronger.\n\n### **What This Means for You**\n\nSo what does all of this mean for investors? With the AI revolution driving massive demand for electricity, nuclear power is well-positioned to be a major player in the energy market for decades to come. The entire U.S. energy sector, in fact, is going to need a significant overhaul to meet future demand. The U.S. operates the largest nuclear fleet in the world with 94 reactors, but that’s not going to be enough. To ensure our energy security and to meet our carbon reduction goals, I believe we should significantly expand the current fleet.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/07/follow-frank-twt-2023-1024x512.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/frank-talk-subscribe/)\n\n### Index Summary\n\n  * The major market indices finished up this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.96%. The S&P 500 Stock Index rose 0.85%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.80%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index gained 1.87% this week.\n  * The Hang Seng Composite lost 10.14% this week; while Taiwan was up 2.56% and the KOSPI fell 0.12%.\n  * The 10-year Treasury bond yield fell 3 basis points to 4.10%.\n\n\n\n### Airlines and Shipping\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The top-performing airline stock for the week was Frontier, rising by 21.1%. According to Bank of America, Boeing has issued an S-3 registration statement worth up to $25 billion, which includes senior and subordinated debt, common and preferred stock, depository shares, stock purchase contracts, and stock purchase units. Additionally, as part of this shelf offering, Boeing secured a $10 billion credit agreement with a consortium of banks.\n  * Between January and September this year, Chinese shipyards signed 52% more orders year-on-year for green vessels, reports Morgan Stanley. According to China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the volume of orders accounted for 75% of all orders globally for ships able to run on alternative fuels.\n  * United Airlines reported third quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $3.33, which came in ahead of consensus of $3.17. According to Morgan Stanley, cargo revenue was well ahead, up 25% year-over-year, and on the expense side, better-than-expected fuel and other operating expenses drove most of the outperformance versus estimates. Management announced a new share repurchase program for up to $1.5 billion.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/AIR-united-airlines-rise-10182024.png)\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing airline stock for the week was Spirit, down 8.7%. According to Bank of America, TSA throughput decelerated to -3.1% on a trailing seven-day basis from -0.8% last week. October’s average TSA throughput growth is tracking -2.5%, below October domestic capacity growth of 1.4%. \n  * According to Stifel, since the beginning of 2021, the cost to build a tanker has risen 54%, while five-year-old ships have seen 92% inflation. In dry bulk, newbuldings are 49% higher with five-year-olds up 84%. Newbuild containers are up 56% and secondhand ships are up 66%, while the prices of new LNG carriers are up 41% and VLGC gas carriers are up 73%.\n  * Allegiant Air had the highest percentage of cancelations occurring over the past week, reports Morgan Stanley, at nearly 23% of captured flights, as Hurricane Milton significantly impacted Florida. JetBlue had the second highest percentage of cancelations at nearly 9% of captured flights, followed by Spirit Airlines at 7.5% of captured flights. \n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * United Airlines will fly its largest ever Transatlantic schedule in Summer 2025, according to Morgan Stanley. Last week the carrier announced 760+ weekly flights to over 40 destinations across the Atlantic, in addition to servicing eight new cities, marking the largest international expansion in its history.\n  * According to Bank of America, air cargo demand remains strong at 10% year-over-year for October. Air cargo freight rates have also started October strong, tracking at up 6% year-over-year so far, with North Asia continuing to lead with rates up 11%/16% year-over-year, respectively.\n  * Indian airlines should remain in a good spot from a demand-supply point of view for the next four to six quarters, says JPMorgan. Industry consolidation as well as supply tightness should keep industry load factors elevated at 87-88% until fiscal year 2025. This should drive a healthy yield environment, and even crude prices are starting to ease.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * “More and more airlines are avoiding German airports or canceling important connections,” Lufthansa CEO Spohr said in an interview with Bild am Sonntag. “I am very worried about the connection of our business location.” Spohr criticized additional planned regulations, such as a quota for e-fuels that are meant to lower carbon dioxide emissions but are not yet available in sufficient quantities. As a result of the regulations, “the quality of connections to many important economic regions is declining,” the CEO explained.\n  * According to Morgan Stanley, container spot freight rates on the main trades out of Asia continued to fall this week, as the resumption of operations at U.S. East and Gulf coast ports have eased industry congestion fears. “Ocean freight rates to both coasts had been easing in the lead up to the strike, continued to do so during the closures, with rates more than 30% below highs reached in July, and should continue to ease now that the strike is over,” said Freightos lead analyst Judah Levine.\n  * As reported by Aero Analysis Partners/AIR (AAP/AIR), 737 production remains at a standstill, with deliveries declining sharply, as only one 737 has been delivered as of mid-October. Shifting to inventory levels, this week saw a decrease to 146 undelivered 737s from the 158 reported during the same period last month.\n\n\n\n### Luxury Goods and International Markets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing commodity for the week was uranium, as proxied by the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, rising 2.31%. This boost was largely driven by Alphabet’s Google noting that nuclear power is a key part of their strategy to get 24/7 clean energy to operate their artificial intelligence (AI) centers and had made an investment into Kairos Power for the development of several small modular reactors. Elsewhere, Japan’s Chugoku Electric Power is planning to restart its nuclear reactor in early December, which will help increase the nation’s power supply during the winter months, according to Bloomberg News.\n  * Alumina prices have taken a significant upward swing, driven by Chinese futures climbing above RMB4,500/ton. This marks the highest point since the 2018 Alunorte outage, signaling strong demand in both domestic and international markets, as noted by analysts from BMO.\n  * In a landslide shift in domestic mineral investments, GM announced they will acquire a 38% asset level ownership in the Thacker Pass lithium deposit in Nevada for $625 million in cash and letters of credit. Just as Rio Tinto’s takeover of Arcadium Lithium secures their supply link for the future, GM has made the same move.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing commodity for the week was natural gas, dropping 13.72%. The decrease in prices was largely driven by an oversupply resulting from the expansion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects and weak global demand, as the world shifts toward greater electricity usage, highlighted by the International Energy Agency’s forecast, reported by Bloomberg.\n  * Iron ore and base metals like copper, aluminum and zinc experienced significant selling pressure as Chinese risk assets faced market doubts about the effectiveness of pro-growth measures. Copper prices are approaching their lowest levels since late September, a period marked by China’s announcement of stimulus measures aimed at boosting the economy, according to Bloomberg News.\n  * Oil prices plummeted by as much as 5%, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) nearing $70 a barrel. This decline came after reports that Israel may avoid targeting Iran’s oil infrastructure, easing concerns over potential supply disruptions, while the International Energy Agency projected a supply glut in the early part of next year, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Japan is poised to increase its purchases of LNG for emergency reserves, raising annual purchases from three to 12 cargoes. This move is seen as a strategic measure to protect against unexpected supply disruptions, as reported by Reuters, positioning Japan to play a larger role in global LNG trade.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/ENGY-LNG-breakout-10182024.png)\n\n  * Germany has allocated €2.8 billion ($3.1 billion) in subsidies through its climate protection contracts to support industries like chemicals, metals and glass in transitioning to greener energy. This funding is part of a broader strategy to help energy-intensive industries adopt cleaner technologies and meet the country’s climate goals, according to Bloomberg News.\n  * Electricity demand in the U.S. is expected to surge over the next five years, with some regions seeing growth as high as 15%. This increase will be driven by factors such as manufacturing in the Southeast, data centers in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic and the electrification of transportation and heating in New England, as detailed in a report by Wood Mackenzie, Bloomberg notes.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Indonesia’s government has placed restrictions on nickel production at the Weda Bay mine, the world’s largest nickel mine. Despite the mine operator Eramet seeking to increase production to 60 million tons in the coming years, the Mines Ministry has limited output to 32 million tons annually for the next two years, creating potential supply shortages, as reported by Bank of America.\n  * Copper treatment and refining charges remain very low, barely covering the cost of processing concentrates, with current quotations at $7.50/mt and 0.75 cent/pound. This has discouraged smelters from securing additional supply from mines, which could lead to supply bottlenecks if prices don’t improve, according to Bank of America.\n  * Although oil prices have been volatile due to turmoil in the Middle East, many traders remain bearish on the market’s outlook for 2025. Concerns are growing that global oil supply will exceed demand, particularly with increases in production from countries outside OPEC, Bloomberg reports.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/which-ferrari-IA-1024x512.png)](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/which-ferrari-matches-your-personality/)\n\n### Energy and Natural Resources\n\n### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing commodity for the week was uranium, as proxied by the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust, rising 2.31%.

The digital asset is up about 13% in the past seven days, well ahead of a global stock gauge and gold. Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller cited crypto as among the indicators that markets are pricing in a win for the former president, the article continues.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/CRYP-trump-betting-odds-10182024.png)\n\n  * Crypto enthusiasts sent another $7.5 million in digital currencies to President Donald Trump’s campaign between July and the end of September, Bloomberg reports. The numbers show momentum among Trump supporters to part with their crypto holdings and send them to the Republican presidential nominee.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performer for the week was MANTRA, still up 6.30%.\n  * FTX’s former engineering chief asked a judge not to send him to prison for the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange. Nishad Singh’s lawyers told a Manhattan federal judge in a memo filed that he deserves leniency in light of his limited role in FTX’s implosion, according to an article written by Bloomberg.\n  * Italy plans to raise the capital gains tax on Bitcoin to 42% from 26%, writes Bloomberg, part of efforts to finance expensive election promises while cutting the fiscal deficit. Italy’s announcement come as the EU is preparing to fully implement the bloc’s sweeping crypto regulations, a package known as MiCA, at the end of the year.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Stripe Inc., the payments company founded by billionaire brothers Patrick and John Collison, is in advanced talks to acquire venture-backed fintech platform Bridge. Stripe has been in talks to acquire the San Antonio, Texas-based company, which is designed to allow businesses to create, store, send and accept stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s UDSC, writes Bloomberg. \n  * Bitcoin bulls are setting their sights again on the record highs reached in March with optimism building around riskier assets and the looming U.S. elections. Bitcoin gained as much as 2.9% to $68,376 on Wednesday before paring the increase to trade around $67,800, writes Bloomberg. \n  * Crypto exchange Kraken launched its wrapped bitcoin token kBTC. The token will be available on both Ethereum and OP Mainnet and will be backed 1:1 with bitcoin. The bitcoin token will be custodied in Kraken Financial the exchange’s U.S.-qualified custody solution, writes Bloomberg. \n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Video-game developer FractureLabs filed a lawsuit against Jump Trading, accusing one of the cryptocurrency industry’s biggest market makers of “fraud and deceit” by manipulating the price of a token used in an online game. According to the suit, Jump concealed its true intent to use the initial offering of DIO as an opportunity to “pump and dump” the token along with HTX, writes Bloomberg. \n  * Bitcoin miner MARA is warning that AI mirrors 2000s Internet boom. In a recent interview with analyst at research and brokerage firm Bernstein, Fred Thiel the CEO of the bitcoin miner, said the current AI environment resembles the early 2000s internet boom, and many companies, particularly smaller players, risk overbuilding infrastructure without sufficient demand, Bloomberg reports. \n  * DeFi infrastructure must undergo significant evolution to effectively compete with traditional financial systems and achieve widespread adoption. Although decentralized finance holds great potential, current platforms lag in critical aspects such as liquidity, speed, and cross-chain compatibility, according to Bloomberg.\n\n[![How Much is The World Spending on Defense? - Watch the Video](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/war-twitter-defense-spending-1024x576.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YV2r0FLGekw?si=_TcMNfAukcbks4dg)\n\n### Defense and Cybersecurity\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * At the Association of the United States Army’s (AUSA) annual meeting this month, Elbit Systems of America announced the upcoming completion of its SIGMA 155mm/52 caliber self-propelled artillery system, designed to fill a critical gap in U.S. Army’s artillery capability, with enhanced range and mobility compared to the aging M109 platform.\n  * AMD is positioning itself as a key competitor to Nvidia in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, showcasing its Instinct MI300X and new MI325X chips, which offer a balance of performance and cost-effectiveness for AI infrastructure. While Nvidia’s Blackwell chip still dominates in flagship performance, AMD’s strength in “performance-per-dollar per watt” is attracting hyperscalers and data centers, giving it potential to capture a larger market share.\n  * The best performing stock this week was Rocket Lab, rising 11.44%, after it added a new mission to its 2024 launch schedule, marking its fastest contract-to-launch turnaround with a commercial mission set to launch within three days.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Defense contractor RTX, formerly known as Raytheon, agreed to pay over $950 million and undergo three years of independent monitoring to settle U.S. Justice Department charges related to inflated federal contracts and foreign bribery involving a Qatari official.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/WAR-rtx-problems-10182024.png)\n\n  * North Korea blew up parts of inter-Korean roads in a symbolic defiance after accusing South Korea of flying drones over Pyongyang. This prompted South Korea to fire warning shots and designate border cities as a risk zone. Pyongyang mobilized 1.4 million people last week.\n  * The worst performing stock this week was Astronics Corp, falling 6.81%. Current CFO David Burney will retire on January 3, 2025, and Nancy Hedges will take over as CFO starting January 4, 2025.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * The U.S. has deployed a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery, produced by Lockheed Martin, to Israel along with 100 troops, as part of its efforts to bolster Israel’s missile defense amid rising tensions with Iran. This deployment underscores the U.S.’s commitment to defending Israel and will enhance the country’s missile-defense shield alongside systems like David’s Sling and the Arrow interceptors.\n  * Thales SA has successfully tested an AI-powered autonomous drone swarm, capable of operating without a continuous datalink, enhancing its drone warfare capabilities.\n  * NATO’s new chief, Mark Rutte, called for increased defense production among member states and confirmed that the alliance is on track to meet a €40 billion spending goal for Ukraine this year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy presented his “victory plan” to lawmakers, reaffirming his stance on not conceding territory and pushing for Ukraine’s future membership in NATO.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Labour MPs have called for the party to return a £4 million donation from hedge fund Quadrature Capital, which holds shares in companies linked to Israel’s military actions in Gaza, sparking controversy over the party’s funding sources.\n  * The Biden administration is discussing imposing country-specific limits on the sale of advanced AI chips by Nvidia and other American companies, particularly focusing on Persian Gulf nations, to address national security concerns.\n  * Israel is weighing U.S. concerns regarding a planned strike on Iran, focusing on military targets and avoiding nuclear and energy facilities, but maintains its right to act independently to address the Iranian threat.\n\n\n\n### Gold Market\n\nThis week, gold futures closed at $2,734.20, up $57.90 per ounce, or 2.16%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week higher by 7.70%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in up 2.68%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar rose 0.59%.\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing precious metal for the week was silver, up 6.63%. A survey conducted during the London Bullion Market Association’s conference in Miami revealed that participants expect gold prices to increase by 10% over the next 12 months, with silver expected to gain over 40%, which indicates a stronger outlook for silver, according to Bloomberg. Gold hit a new record high on Friday, while silver is still significantly below its previous all-time highs on near $50 per ounce.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/GLD-gold-hits-record-10182024.png)\n\n  * Central bank gold purchases have been a key driver of the metal’s record-breaking rally this year. In a rare move, central bank officials from Mexico, Mongolia and the Czech Republic openly praised the value of increasing gold holdings, signaling their growing interest in bullion, Bloomberg reported.\n  * The World Gold Council (WGC) noted that global physically backed gold ETFs attracted $1.4 billion in inflows during September. This marked a reversal of the outflow trend seen throughout 2024, with Europe being the only region still showing year-to-date outflows, according to Bank of America.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing precious metal for the week was palladium, but still up 1.37%. Silvercorp’s Q2 production for fiscal year 2024 was 1.66 million ounces, slightly below BMO’s forecast of 1.84 million ounces. Lower throughput at Ying and reduced silver grades, alongside weaker lead and zinc output due to lower grades, negatively impacted overall production, according to BMO.\n  * Equinox Gold reduced its 2024 production guidance for the Greenstone project from 175-205K ounces to 110-130K ounces. The company’s Q3 production of 42.5K ounces was well below CIBC’s estimate of 58.3K ounces, largely due to lower-than-expected average processed grades, according to CIBC.\n  * Calibre Mining’s share price took a hit, dropping as much as 13%, on Friday when they reported lower-than-expected gold production, due to higher-than-expected historical artisanal mining on the initial benches of the Volcan open pit. Calibre also lowered their production guidance for 2024.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Spot gold prices are projected to hit all-time highs of approximately $3,000 per ounce by 2025. This bullish outlook is supported by potential interest rate cuts, growing geopolitical concerns and a rise in portfolio diversification, as suggested by a report by consultancy Metals Focus.\n  * According to RBC, silver has matched gold’s year-to-date gains of +30%, despite experiencing higher volatility. With the gold/silver ratio currently over 85:1—well above the 10-year average of 65:1—silver has room to rise further, potentially pushing the price over $40/oz if it reaches the 2020 ratio peak, according to RBC.\n  * Gold is expected to break out of its recent slump and move higher, fueled by central bank demand and increasing political uncertainty in the U.S. A 5.2% jump in September marked the largest monthly gain since March, largely due to the Federal Reserve’s surprise 50-basis-point rate cut, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * U.S. coin sales have been hovering near multi-year lows, with investors selling off coins as gold prices rise.

RBC noted that the company’s all-in sustaining cost (AISC) midpoint was 6% above consensus, and achieving full-year gold production guidance may prove difficult without significant Q4 output increases, according to RBC.\n  * China’s non-monetary gold imports dropped from an all-time high in Q1 2024 to multi-year lows over the summer. This decline followed government signals of another round of monetary and fiscal stimulus, which lifted equity markets and may limit gold’s near-term upside potential, according to Bank of America, though prices are still expected to hold above $2,000/ oz.\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/youtube-english-spanish-twt-1024x614.png)](https://www.youtube.com/@USGlobalInvestors?sub_confirmation=1) [![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/01/lL-files-1.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/LLFiles-10182024.pdf)\n\nU.S. Global Investors, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Since 2009, these institutions have been net buyers of the precious metal, and in the past decade alone, they’ve scooped up [one out of every eight ounces produced globally.](https://www.bullionvault.com/gold-news/infographics/central-bank-gold-biggest-smallest-change)\n\n![Central Banks Have Been Net Buyers of Gold Since 2009](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-central-banks-net-buyers-10112024.png)\n\nIf these guys are loading up on gold, shouldn’t that tell you something about where your own portfolio should be?\n\nWhile fiat currencies can be printed at will (and we’ve seen plenty of that lately), gold remains a finite resource. That makes it the go-to asset when economic uncertainty rears its head. Countries all over the globe have realized this, and they’ve been buying gold in bulk.\n\nHere’s a look at the top 10 nations that have been piling up the most gold in the last decade:\n\n### 10. Hungary | 91.4 metric tons\n\nThe Hungarian National Bank has been holdings gold since it was created in 1924. Lately, it’s been serious about adding to its stockpile. With 110 metric tons in reserves, Hungary now boasts the highest per capita gold holdings in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\n![10. Hungary | 91.4 metric tons](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-hungary-10112024.png)\n\n### 9. Qatar | 96.3 metric tons\n\nQatar views gold as a safe investment, especially during times of economic uncertainty. In recent years, Qatar’s gold purchases have soared, with holdings over 100 tons by the end of 2023. For a nation built on oil and gas wealth, it’s clear they see gold as a reliable backup plan.\n\n![9. Qatar | 96.3 metric tons](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-qatar-10112024.png)\n\n### 8. Singapore | 101.5 metric tons\n\nSingapore is no stranger to gold, even if it has to import every ounce. This year, it made a historic move, bringing its gold reserves to 236 metric tons, the highest level since the city-state gained independence in 1965. A savvy play for a global financial hub like Singapore!\n\n![8. Singapore | 101.5 metric tons](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-singapore-10112024.png)\n\n### 7. Uzbekistan | 126.3 metric tons\n\nUzbekistan has been a quiet yet powerful player in the gold market. Its reserves have grown steadily, hitting 373 tons in 2024. Almost 80% of Uzbekistan’s total international assets are now in gold—a solid choice, we believe.\n\n![Uzbekistan | 126.3 metric tons](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-uzbekistan-10112024.png)\n\n### 6. Kazakhstan | 132.6 metric tons\n\nKazakhstan, a top global gold producer, has steadily increased its reserves, which now stand at a combined $23 billion. The country plans to reduce gold’s share of its reserves slightly but remains a major player in the global market, accounting for 2% of global gold production.\n\n![6. Kazakhstan | 132.6 metric tons](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-kazakhstan-10112024.png)\n\n### 5. India | 291.4 metric tons\n\nIndia’s Reserve Bank has been making some big moves in the gold market. Its purchases in the first half of 2024 were the highest since 2013, surpassing the previous two years combined. For India, where gold holds deep cultural significance, the metal remains central to its economic strategy.\n\n![5. India | 291.4 metric tons](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-india-10112024.png)\n\n### 4. Poland | 295.0 metric tons\n\nPoland’s National Bank has been one of the most aggressive gold buyers this year, tying with India for the largest purchase in the second quarter of 2024. With current holdings at 16%, Poland is on a mission to have the precious metal make up 20% of its reserves.\n\n![4. Poland | 295.0 metric tons](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-poland-10112024.png)\n\n### 3. Türkiye | 475.6 metric tons\n\nOver the past decade, Türkiye has grown its gold reserves from 116 metric tons to over 584 tons today. With nearly 20% of its reserves in gold, Türkiye is one of the top buyers, thanks to its long history of domestic gold ownership and investment.\n\n![3. Türkiye | 475.6 metric tons](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-turkey-10112024.png)\n\n### 2. China | 1,210.2 metric tons\n\nChina is always one to watch, and it’s been no slouch in the gold department. Having added over 1,200 metric tons in the past 10 years, the People’s Bank of China sits just behind the U.S. in total global rankings. However, it hit pause on new purchases in recent months as gold prices surged.\n\n![2. China | 1,210.2 metric tons](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-china-10112024.png)\n\n### 1. Russia | 1,230.6 metric tons\n\nTaking the top spot, Russia has added more than 1,200 tons of gold to its reserves over the last decade. With sanctions from the West in mind, Russia has been preparing, even going as far as to peg its currency, the ruble, to gold—a strategy we haven’t seen since the days of the Bretton Woods system.\n\n![1. Russia | 1,230.6 metric tons](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/COMM-russia-10112024.png)\n\nAt U.S. Global Investors, we’ve always seen gold as a key part of a diversified portfolio, and we believe our gold-focused funds offer an excellent way to participate in this time-tested asset. After all, if it’s good enough for central banks, shouldn’t it be good enough for you?\n\n**If you’d like more information on ways to invest in the yellow metal, send us a note at _info@usfunds.com_!**\n\n[![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/youtube-english-spanish-twt-1024x614.png)](https://www.youtube.com/@USGlobalInvestors?sub_confirmation=1)\n\n### Index Summary\n\n  * The major market indices finished up this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.21%. The S&P 500 Stock Index rose 1.11%, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.13%. The Russell 2000 small capitalization index gained 0.98% this week.\n  * The Hang Seng Composite lost 16.33% this week; while Taiwan was up 2.69% and the KOSPI rose 1.06%.\n  * The 10-year Treasury bond yield rose 12 basis points to 4.093%.\n\n\n\n### Airlines and Shipping\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing airline stock for the week was Air Transport Services, up 9.4%. According to JPMorgan, Latam has raised $1.4 billion to prepay a portion of its Chapter 11 debt due in 2027. The new loan was issued at a 7.8% rate and matures in 2030. This is its first debt issuance since exiting its Chapter 11 process.\n  * According to the TAC, air freight rates on Asia-outbound are 80% above 2019 levels. In recent weeks, the sequential increase in spot rates on China-Europe may indicate the start to the peak season – the spot rate on the lane is now 11% above November 2023 levels.\n  * Chinese airlines A/H shares rallied 25/60% over the past two weeks, then slowing down again, on the back of optimism for robust travel traffic during National Day Golden Week break, reports JPMorgan, along with expectations for third-quarter 2024 profitability.\n\n![Chinese Airlines Spike In Recent Days](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/AIR-airchine-spike-10112024.png)\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing airline stock for the week was Tongcheng Travel Holdings, down 12.0%. According to CIBC, the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority saw 5.5 million passengers through Canada’s largest 17 airports. This is down 17% month-over-month but up 2% year-over-year.\n  * The three-day strike that closed ports on the U.S. East and Gulf coasts last week could result in a 10% to 20% reduction in capacity on the transatlantic and Asia-U.S. East Coast routes, according to the latest report from Sea-Intelligence. Depending on the route, the three-day shutdown has resulted in around 50 container ships sitting idle outside the ports awaiting reopening.\n  * Qantas has been ordered by the Federal Court to pay A$100 million in penalties for misleading consumers by offering and selling tickets for flights it had already decided to cancel, and by failing to promptly tell existing ticketholders of its decision, in a case brought by the ACCC. These penalties were imposed after Qantas admitted that it had contravened the Australian Consumer Law.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * According to TD, Spirit Airlines owns five A319 outright and has equity in a combined 51 A320/A321. The other 161 aircraft are leased. TD expects most of the aircraft to eventually leave the U.S. should they be repossessed, which could tighten the U.S. market.\n  * Following last week’s 5.0 point increase the Evercore ISI Shipping Cos. Survey rose for a second straight week, increasing from 77.8 to 78.3 as participants highlighted improvement in tanker activity. Reduced capacity in the Panama Canal, rerouting of ships due to attacks in the Red Sea, as well as the war in Ukraine and in the Middle East, have all extended routes and boosted rates. These factors appear to be the primary drivers of the strength in the survey as opposed to final demand for the products.\n  * Delta’s third-quarter earnings and revenues were in line with consensus. According to management, the industry backdrop is improving as it relates to capacity in both the fourth quarter and the beginning of 2025. In addition, bookings into the holiday season and even into January look good.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * According to Bank of America, Frontier Airlines lowered system capacity by 910 basis points (bps) in December, following a similar reduction. Cuts were domestic-focused, lowered by 13.0%, while Latin American capacity was raised by 12.4%. Frontier’s first quarter 2025 capacity is currently tracking higher by 15.4%.\n  * The parked freighters fleet was 19.4%, exceeding the last 10-year peak of 16.9% reached in mid-2023, reports Bank of America. Parked freighters are up 3.8ppts year-over-year, 13.0ppts versus 2019 levels, and 10.0ppts since the COVID peak in April 2020 of 9.1%. In the bank’s view, this indicates the risk of an oversupply of freighters in the market.\n  * Azul’s lessors and OEMs agreed to exchange their stake of 3 billion Brazilian real in the equity instrument for up to 100 million new preferred shares of Azul, in a one-time issuance. Azul noted this is subject to certain conditions and corporate approvals. Per Goldman’s estimates, post issuance, the lessors and OEMs would hold up to a 22% stake in the company.\n\n\n\n### Luxury Goods and International Markets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Tesla unveiled its highly anticipated Robotaxi, a two-seater sedan named Cybercab, which is expected to begin production in 2026 and be priced below $30,000. Elon Musk also introduced the Robovan, designed to accommodate up to 20 passengers, and provided updates on Tesla’s humanoid robot, Optimus. There was a lack of technical and regulatory details on the upcoming releases.\n  * Carnival reported record-breaking quarterly results and raised its annual profit forecast for the third time, driven by strong demand for cruise vacations, controlled spending, and increased onboard guest spending. Citigroup raised its price targets for Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line, boosting the share prices of both companies.\n  * Cettire, an online apparel retailer, was the top-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury sector, rising by 26.1%. On Friday, shares surged over 10%, despite minimal news coverage.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Deliveries of BMW cars have fallen by 30%, marking the steepest decline in over four years. Sales have dropped across all regions, with the exception of electric vehicles, which saw an increase. Similarly, Mercedes experienced a 13% sales decline in China; however, its electric vehicle sales plummeted, while hybrid car sales rose by 10%. Volkswagen’s sales in China declined 13%.\n  * Remy Cointreau and Pernod Ricard experienced a sell-off this week after China announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of brandy from Europe. Starting October 11, importers of EU brandy will face tariffs as high as 39%.\n  * Tesla was the worst-performing stock in the S&P Global Luxury Index, losing 12.8% this week. Shares declined on Friday after investor disappointment with the Robotaxi event.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Kering has appointed Stefano Cantino as the new CEO of Gucci, which contributes approximately two-thirds of the company’s operating profits. Kering has faced challenges, particularly with Gucci’s performance, leading to a downturn. As a former LVMH executive, Cantino is expected to revitalize the brand, potentially paving the way for a turnaround in performance and price recovery.\n\n![Kering vs S&P Global Luxury Index](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/LUX-kering-10112024.png)\n\n  * Zuzanne Push from UBS highlights that the significance of Chinese customers as a driver of luxury industry growth has been diminishing over the years. According to UBS analysts, Chinese consumers have contributed about 25% of growth since 2015, and around 10% growth from 2019 to 2023. In contrast, American consumers have taken the lead, accounting for approximately 30% of growth since 2019.\n  * The optimism surrounding the recently announced Chinese stimulus quickly faded due to a lack of updates on the implementation process and the absence of further specific measures targeting the troubled economy. However, if the government takes further action and introduces more targeted measures, the market is likely to react positively, which could boost consumer sentiment. The finance minister is scheduled to hold a press conference this Saturday.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * In the United States, September’s core inflation increased by 0.31% month-over-month, surpassing the consensus estimate of 0.2% and aligning with August’s rise. On an annual basis, core inflation reached 3.3%, marking the first increase since March 2023. While experts anticipate that the Federal Reserve may soon be in a position to cut rates again, persistent inflation could hinder the Fed’s decision-making.\n  * Germany’s economy, Europe’s largest, is expected to shrink by 0.2% this year, revising an earlier prediction of a 0.3% expansion and marking a second consecutive year of contraction. This is due to weak domestic and foreign demand, high interest rates and costly energy. However, the economy is expected to return to growth of 1.1% in 2025.\n  * According to China’s culture and tourism ministry, the number of domestic trips and total travel expenditure during the week-long National Day Golden Week holiday surpassed last year’s figures. However, per capita spending remained below pre-pandemic levels, coming in 2.09% lower than the same period in 2019, based on Reuters’ calculations. Despite the optimism surrounding stimulus measures ahead of the Golden Week holiday, consumer spending remained cautious.\n\n[![How Much is The World Spending on Defense? - Watch the Video](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/war-twitter-defense-spending-1024x576.jpg)](https://youtu.be/YV2r0FLGekw?si=_TcMNfAukcbks4dg)\n\n### Energy and Natural Resources\n\n### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing commodity for the week was wheat, rising 1.65%, as dry weather in Argentina has stimmed crop growth and Russian shelling of the Ukrainian port of Odesa has limited the ability to export wheat. Globally, wheat stockpiles are at a nine-year low, as reported by Bloomberg. In other news, Shell Plc saw continued strong performance from its natural gas and upstream businesses in the third quarter, even though oil-refining margins declined.\n  * Lithium carbonate prices have risen month-on-month for the first time since May 2024. The increase in prices in September was driven by the announcement of China’s new stimulus package aimed at aiding the recovery of its economy, alongside the impact of recent mine closures, according to Bloomberg.\n\n![Lithium Carbonate Prices May Have Bottomed](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/ENGY-lithium-10112024.png)\n\n  * Uranium purchases by the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust had been tepid year-to-date, with purchases being largely absent since mid-June. That said, buying resumed at the end of September, with 300,000 pounds of uranium purchased from the spot market since then. This, potentially, partially explains the recent stabilization in the price, which is currently at $82 per pound, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing commodity for the week was natural gas, dropping 7.85%, as power outages in Florida dented demand, along with a greater-than-expected storage add that left the market few incentives to rally. On average, stockpiles are running higher than average this year due to a no-show winter last year, Bloomberg reports.\n  * Iron ore prices continue to be hurt by weakening sentiment. While the impacts on physical demand are less clear, a weak steel market, particularly in China, will continue to impact the market.\n  * Brent oil dropped below $80 a barrel as China’s top economic planner ended a highly anticipated briefing on Tuesday without new stimulus measures, reports Bloomberg, sparking a risk-off mood across markets. West Texas Intermediate traded below $76 a barrel. \n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Voters in Kazakhstan, the world’s top uranium miner, held a referendum last weekend in which 71% of the voters backed the construction of a nuclear power plant. Kazakhstan is Central Asia’s largest oil producer and hasn’t used nuclear power since 1999 but is now grappling with power shortages due to older unreliable power stations and an energy intensive crypto industry. On Friday, Japan’s biggest business lobby Keidanren asked the government to include nuclear power in its national energy strategy, which is currently under review.\n  * According to Bloomberg, Google is working with utilities in the U.S. and other countries to assess nuclear power as a possible energy source for its data centers, underscoring surging interest in using atomic energy to feed the artificial intelligence boom. “In the U.S., in highly regulated markets where we don’t have the opportunity to directly purchase power, we are working with our utility partners and the generators to come together to figure out how we can bring these new technologies — nuclear may be one of them — to the grid,” said Amanda Peterson Corio, global head of data center energy at Alphabet Inc.’s Google. \n  * Rio Tinto Group has agreed to buy Arcadium Lithium Plc in an all-cash deal valuing the U.S.-listed miner at $6.7 billion, expanding its grip on the battery metal and stepping back into the M&A fray with its biggest deal in 17 years, writes Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Elliott Investment Management lost its UK appeal over the London Metal Exchange’s controversial decision to halt a runaway short squeeze in the nickel market, Bloomberg reports. The LME successfully saw off the appeal by the U.S. hedge fund in a ruling that backed the wide discretion offered to the exchange to suspend the market and cancel trades in 2022.\n  * Brazil’s weekly imports of LNG have soared as heat and droughts have increased the demand for air conditioning while water reservoirs have shrunk such that hydroelectric power has fallen 19% over the last 30 days. While this is an opportunity for sustained natural gas demand it’s an abrupt shock to their infrastructure needs.\n  * According to Bloomberg, global oil supplies face the highest risk in decades amid conflicts involving key producers Iran and Russia, said veteran commodities analyst Jeff Currie. Current geopolitical turmoil poses an especially dangerous scenario, he speculated.\n\n\n\n### Bitcoin and Digital Assets\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the best performer for the week was Neiro, rising 74.64%. Nearly half of hedge funds focused on traditional asset classes now have exposure to cryptocurrencies, reports Bloomberg, as increased clarity around regulations and the launch of ETFs in the U.S and Asia draw more investors into the asset class. Among hedge funds trading in traditional markets, 47% had exposure to digital assets, up from 29% in 2023 and 37% in 2022.\n  * South Korea’s top financial watchdog said it would reevaluate lifting the existing ban on local spot cryptocurrency ETFs and institutional accounts on crypto exchanges. According to local news agency News1, the FSC will review the current ban.\n  * Renowned economist Peter Schiff poked fun at Michael Saylor recommending that the MicroStrategy boss buy the huge stash of Bitcoin that the U.S government planned to sell, writes Bloomberg. Schiff took to X to express his views on the U.S. government’s decision to sell 69,370 BTC it had seized from the dark web marketplace, the Silk Road.\n\n![Peter Schiff Encourages MicroStrategy to Borrow Another $4.3 Billion](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/CRYP-peter-schiff-encourages-microstragtegy-10112024.png)\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Of the cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarketCap, the worst performer for the week was Stacks, down 11.04%.\n  * Caroline Ellison has agreed to transfer nearly all her available cash and assets to FTX trading to settle a bankruptcy court lawsuit and further extricate herself from Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire. The deal settles litigation filed last year to recover about $30 million in payments and FTX securities, writes Bloomberg. \n  * An art gallery was accused of selling over $13 million worth of NFTs showing eagles in various fashions. The proposed class of 36 plaintiffs says that Eden Gallery and Gal Yosef engaged in a “rug pull” by collecting millions from investors. The suit alleges the defendants committed common law fraud, were unjustly enriched, and violated the New York business code, reports Bloomberg.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * The German investment outfit Lennertz & Co. is set to become one of the largest fund of funds operating in the blockchain space as the firm seeks to raise $165 million for its third crypto-focused vehicle, according to Bloomberg. As a fund of funds, rather than investing directly in portfolio companies or token deals, Lennertz invests in other firms including well-known crypto venture capitals, writes Bloomberg. \n  * Bitwise Asset Management said Friday that it filed to convert three of its crypto futures ETFs to a rotation strategy based on market trends. The conversion involves shifting exposure between cryptocurrencies and U.S. Treasuries, according to Bloomberg. \n  * Crypto exchange Binance is set to list Ethereum Layer 2 network Scrolls’s native token SCR for pre-market trading, writes Bloomberg, claiming to be the first platform to do so in an announcement earlier this week. Prior to the pre-market listing, the project will also be added to Binance Launchpool.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Three market making firms allegedly promised to gin up an avalanche of fake trades to boost the value of NexFundAI’s cryptocurrency token, according to Bloomberg. Representatives of ZM Quant, CLS Global and MyTrade, were among 15 crypto promoters and trades charged with market manipulation and fraud in a wide-ranging probe prompted by a tip from the U.S. SEC.\n  * The U.S. SEC has accused Chicago-based Cumberland DRW LLC with operating as an unregistered dealer in over $2 billion of crypto assets offered and sold as securities, according to an article published by Bloomberg. \n  * The U.S. asked that a Wall Street rapper who pleaded guilty to a money-laundering conspiracy in one of the biggest crypto heists ever spend 18 months in prison after she provided “substantial assistance” to the government. Prosecutors recommended the sentence after Heather Morgan, who dubbed herself the “Crocodile of Wall Street,” helped investigators as part of a plea agreement last year, writes Bloomberg.\n\n[![Follow Frank Holmes' Insights On Seeking Alpha](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2022/04/frank-seeking-alpha-1024x576.png)](https://seekingalpha.com/author/frank-holmes)\n\n### Defense and Cybersecurity\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace received a €193 million order from Lithuania’s Ministry of National Defense to supply additional NASAMS air defense systems as part of Lithuania’s ongoing equipment upgrade.\n  * BAE Systems received a $184 million contract modification from the U.S. Army to produce 48 additional Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles.\n  * The best performing stock in the XAR ETF this week was Triumph Group Inc., an aircraft components maker, rising 19.14%. The company is exploring a potential sale with interest from strategic buyers and private equity firms, amid rising aerospace industry dealmaking, while its shares surged following the news.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * Defense stocks in Europe fell as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy presented his “victory” plan to EU leaders, signaling potential flexibility on ending the war, while companies like Rheinmetall, BAE Systems, Saab and Dassault Aviation saw notable declines.\n  * U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris declined to commit to supporting Ukraine’s bid to join NATO. This emphasizes that any negotiations with Putin must include Ukraine, while the Biden administration views Ukraine’s membership as a longer-term possibility.\n  * The worst performing stock in the XAR ETF this week was AAR Corp., falling 6.06%. AAR Corp. and other suppliers of United Airlines may see stock movement after United’s earnings report on October 15.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Northrop Grumman has integrated AI into its FAAD ABM air defense system, enhancing its capability to counter UAS threats by streamlining decision-making and enabling real-time weapon-target pairings. The system allows operators to engage UAS swarms more efficiently with a single click on a mobile tablet, improving response during high-stress, multi-target scenarios.\n\n![Northrop Grumman Drops Slightly, But Still Positive Year-to-Date](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/WAR-northrop-grumman-drops-10112024.png)\n\n  * Lockheed Martin has appointed Chauncey McIntosh as vice president and general manager of the F-35 Lightning II Program, succeeding Bridget Lauderdale, who will retire after 38 years with the company. McIntosh brings over 20 years of experience in program management, engineering and business leadership to the role starting December 1.\n  * Thales has secured a contract with the Canadian government to supply its Sophie Ultima Handheld Thermal Imager to the Canadian military, with the equipment being manufactured and maintained in Canada to enhance the local supply chain.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * Iran and Oman have begun their first-ever joint military drills, focusing on counterterrorism and urban warfare, involving ground forces, police and air units from both countries.\n  * Amid growing tensions between Israel and Iran, President Biden is urging restraint, while Israel prepares for a potential surprise strike in response to a recent missile attack. This comes despite U.S. concerns over escalating the conflict.\n  * South Korea’s defense chief has indicated that North Korea is likely to send troops to Ukraine in support of Russia, further solidifying its alliance with Moscow and distancing itself from South Korea. Meanwhile, tensions continue to rise between the two Koreas.\n\n\n\n### Gold Market\n\nThis week gold futures closed the week at $2,673.10, up $5.30 per ounce, or 0.20%. Gold stocks, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, ended the week higher by 0.68%. The S&P/TSX Venture Index came in up 1.71%. The U.S. Trade-Weighted Dollar rose 0.42%.\n\n#### Strengths\n\n  * The best performing precious metal for the week was palladium, up 7.31%, perhaps on continued accumulation by the palladium ETFs. For instance, the abrdn Physical Palladium Shares ETF has seen its shares outstanding increase by 72% in 2024. Despite a slight fall in the price of palladium since the start of the year, money is flowing into this fund.\n  * According to Business Times, global central banks currently hold some 1.16 billion ounces of gold that are collectively worth more than $3 trillion, according to new data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The yellow metal now accounts for just under one-fifth of the $15.45 trillion worth of foreign exchange reserves held by the world’s central banks.\n  * K92 Mining delivered one of the strongest operational results in its history, reports Stifel. Production of 44,300 ounces gold was a strong beat to the estimated 31,600 ounces gold. Positive grade reconciliation and higher-grade stopes mined in the third quarter were the reasons for the strongest gold head grade since the fourth quarter of 2020. The share price rose nearly 16% on the production beat.\n\n\n\n#### Weaknesses\n\n  * The worst performing precious metal for the week was silver, down 1.93%, after four weeks of consecutive gains. Gold fell early in the week as the dollar continued to push higher and U.S. inflation came in hotter than expected. Despite the negative print, gold pushed higher on Thursday and even more so on Friday. The yellow metal essentially ended the week flat, unfazed by the headlines as the market seems to be anticipating higher prices.\n\n![Gold retraces Losses](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/GLD-retraces-losses-10112024-1.png)\n\n  * Dundee Precious Metals’ third quarter production results came in below RBC’s estimates, driven by operational challenges at Ada Tepe. Full-year guidance was reiterated, with increased production at Ada Tepe anticipated in the fourth quarter on higher grades and improved fleet availability.\n  * Aris Mining reported third quarter 2024 gold production of 54,000 ounces, which missed expectations. Due to the lower-than-expected production, the company decreased the 2024 production guidance at Segovia to 185,000-195,000 ounces from 200,000-220,000 ounces.\n\n\n\n#### Opportunities\n\n  * Over the weekend, OceanaGold revealed that its Waihi and Macraes mines have been selected as part of a list of 11 mining projects under the New Zealand Government’s Fast-Track Approvals Bill. The bill establishes a new permitting framework for major development initiatives. It is anticipated that the Fast-Track Approvals Bill will be enacted later this year and will feature an expert panel tasked with evaluating the projects and advising the joint Ministers on approval decisions, reports Scotia.\n  * Mexico’s plan for a ban on open pit mining was not included in a list of 100 pledges outlined by incoming President Claudia Sheinbaum on October 1, the day of her inauguration. Sheinbaum signaled in her campaign that she supported the policies of her predecessor, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador — also known by his initials AMLO — who took a hard line on the mining sector, including pushing for a ban in Mexico’s legislature. While analysts said they still expect Sheinbaum to hew closely to AMLO’s policies, the new president may take a different approach on certain issues, reports S&P, including her predecessor’s proposal to ban open pit mining.\n  * According to Canaccord, gold and gold equities have consistently outperformed during QE cycles. Further, supporting the gold price is the sharp increase in U.S. debt levels. The Congressional Budget Office recently raised its forecast for the U.S. deficit to $2 trillion for 2024, around 7% of GDP, with deficits expected to average 6.3% of GDP over the next decade.\n\n\n\n#### Threats\n\n  * West African Resources saw its shares plunge by as much as 25% after reports emerged that the Burkina Faso government plans to revoke mining permits. Multiple news outlets, including Reuters, cited President Traore’s recent radio address, in which he suggested that the government is targeting miners who have not complied with the Mining Code. Speaking on the two-year anniversary of his takeover, Traore stated, “We know how to mine our gold, and I don’t understand why we should let multinationals do it… We are going to withdraw mining permits.”\n  * Equinox Gold issued 24.8 million shares to satisfy the conversion of a $130 million convertible held by Ninety Fourth Investment Company. However, BMO was immediately engaged by Ninety Fourth to offer the shares in a secondary placement as they wanted cash and not shares. Equinox did not receive any proceeds from the offering.\n  * After briefly arresting four Barrick Gold employees, the government of Mali is seeking $512 million in back taxes and dividends from the company under the revised mining code. B2Gold, Resolute Mining and Allied Gold have already come to a settlement and Barrick was the only major mining company left to come to terms with the government, hence the arrest. Malian officials have said companies can accept the new law or leave the county.\n\n[![How Much Do You Know About Human Geography?](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/03/human-geography-quiz-1024x512.png)](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/how-much-do-you-know-about-human-geography/) [![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2023/01/lL-files-1.jpg)](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/10/LLFiles-10112024.pdf)\n\nU.S. Global Investors, Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

When preparing tax returns, please use the information in the tax documents that U.S. Global Investors will provide in early 2025._\n\nBased on preliminary calculations, the funds listed in the table below may have income dividend and/or capital gains distributions in December 2024. Most bond funds accrue dividends daily and distribute them on the last business day of each month.\n\n**Note:** Investing in a taxable account shortly before a fund distributes dividends and/or capital gains may result in a taxable distribution. In certain cases, particularly if that fund expects to make a large distribution, it may be advisable to delay an investment until after the fund’s dividends are distributed.\n\n### **Distribution Dates**\n\nThe following dates will apply to each U.S. Global Investors’ equity fund that will pay distributions:\n\nRecord Date| 12/18/2024  \n---|---  \nEx-Dividend Date| 12/19/2024  \nPayable Date| 12/20/2024  \n  \n**Record date** : Fund shareholders on this date will receive a distribution.\n\n**Ex-dividend date** : The date on which there will be a decrease in the net asset value per share equal to the amount of the distribution. Shareholders who have elected reinvestment will have their distributions reinvested on this date in additional shares of the fund at the day’s closing price.\n\n**Payable date** : Shareholders who have not elected reinvestment will have their distributions paid on this date.\n\n### **Q: What is a mutual fund distribution?**\n\n**A:** A mutual fund distribution is derived from net capital gains realized from the sale of a fund’s investments, and income from dividends and interest earned by a fund’s holdings less the fund’s operating expenses. By law, mutual funds must pay substantially all net investment income and net capital gains to their investors, who may elect to receive cash or reinvest in additional shares of the fund.\n\n### **Q: Why does a fund’s share price (NAV) drop when distributions are paid?**\n\n**A:** A fund’s net investment income and net capital gains contribute to the rise of the fund’s net asset value (NAV), or share price. Each fund is required to distribute nearly all of its net income and capital gains to shareholders (see above question on distributions), and the fund’s NAV is reduced by the amount of this distribution.\n\n**_Example_** _: A fund has a NAV of $10. If the fund is required to make a distribution of $2 per share during the year, $2 will be deducted from the NAV and then paid to shareholders on the specified date. On the ex-dividend date, the fund share price will decrease to $8._\n\n### **Q: Do I lose money when distributions are paid?**\n\n**A:** No. The shareholder still has $10 per share in value — $8 in the fund’s NAV and $2 per share reinvested in the fund or paid by check. For those who automatically reinvest distributions, the distribution is used to buy additional fund shares at $8 per share. These additional shares compensate for the drop in the NAV, so the total account value does not change as a result of the distribution. If there is a decline in the market at the same time as the distribution, however, there may be a drop in the account’s post-distribution value.\n\n**_Example:_**_A shareholder has 100 shares in his account. At an NAV of $10 a share, the account value is $1,000. If the fund pays a $2 per share distribution, the NAV drops to $8, making the original 100 shares worth $800. Reinvesting the $200 distribution, however, will buy an additional 25 shares. Now the shareholder’s account holds 125 shares at $8 each, for a total value of $1,000, the same as before the distribution was paid._\n\n### **Q. Why is there no breakout of qualified dividend estimates in ordinary income?**\n\n**A.** Funds that invest in stocks of U.S. and many non-U.S. corporations pay dividends that qualify for lower tax rates. However, when a fund derives a significant portion of its income from sources such as interest, short-term capital gains and dividends from certain non-U.S. corporations (passive foreign investment companies, or PFICs), a portion of its dividend does not qualify for reduced taxation. Instead, that portion is taxed at ordinary income rates. Funds that derive all of their income from investments in bonds, money market instruments and non-dividend-paying investments do not pay qualified dividends.\n\nThe calculations are complex, and usually are not finalized until shortly before the distribution record date. We provide the table below solely to give investors an estimate of the fund’s expected distributions.\n\n### **Q. How will the fund estimates differ from the final distribution to be reported?**\n\n**A.** The estimates are based on preliminary calculations as of December 5, 2024. In most cases, as required under the federal tax code, the final distributions will be based on each fund’s capital gains realized through October 31 and the net investment income expected to be earned through December 31.\n\n### **Estimated Distributions From Week Ended December 6, 2024**\n\n**_Please note: Current year income distributions have not yet been finalized. Amounts shown are estimates and based on projections through year-end. The actual per share distribution amounts will not be available until the payable date._**\n\nFund | NAV as of Dec. 5, 2024 | Estimated Income Dividend Per Share | Estimated Short-Term Capital Gain Per Share | Estimated Long-Term Capital Gain Per Share  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nGlobal Resources Fund (PSPFX) | $4.11 | $0.16 | – | –  \nGold and Precious Metals Fund (USERX) | $12.79 | $0.17 | – | –  \nGlobal Luxury Goods Fund (USLUX) | $22.41 | $0.11 | $1.06 | $0.79  \nWorld Precious Minerals Fund (UNWPX) | $1.52 | – | – | –  \n  \n### **Important Information**\n\nThe general tax information contained herein is provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as legal or tax advice.

The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.\n\nCompanies in the consumer discretionary sector are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in the performance of domestic and international economies, interest rate changes, increased competition and consumer confidence. The performance of such companies may also be affected by factors relating to levels of disposable household income, reduced consumer spending, changing demographics and consumer tastes, among others.\n\n##  Latest Resources \n\n[ View All ](https://www.usfunds.com/resource-listing/)\n\n[ ![Boeing Resumes Production as Airlines Prepare for a Record-Breaking 2025](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/Boeing-Resumes-Production-as-Airlines-Prepare-for-a-Record-Breaking-2025.gif) ](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/boeing-resumes-production-as-the-airline-industry-prepares-for-a-record-breaking-2025/)\n\nDecember 13, 2024\n\n###  [Boeing Resumes Production as the Airline Industry Prepares for a Record-Breaking 2025](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/boeing-resumes-production-as-the-airline-industry-prepares-for-a-record-breaking-2025/)\n\n[ Learn More ](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/boeing-resumes-production-as-the-airline-industry-prepares-for-a-record-breaking-2025/ \"Boeing Resumes Production as the Airline Industry Prepares for a Record-Breaking 2025\")\n\n[ ![Analysts See $200,000 Bitcoin by 2025 as Adoption Spikes](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/bitcoin-200k-2092024.jpg) ](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/analysts-see-200000-bitcoin-by-2025-as-adoption-spikes/)\n\nDecember 9, 2024\n\n###  [Analysts See $200,000 Bitcoin by 2025 as Adoption Spikes](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/analysts-see-200000-bitcoin-by-2025-as-adoption-spikes/)\n\n[ Learn More ](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/analysts-see-200000-bitcoin-by-2025-as-adoption-spikes/ \"Analysts See $200,000 Bitcoin by 2025 as Adoption Spikes\")\n\n[ ![Bitcoin’s Rise to $100,000 Signals Global Adoption Shift](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/12/COMM-bitcoins-rise-to-100k-12062024.jpg) ](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/bitcoins-rise-to-100000-signals-global-adoption-shift/)\n\nDecember 6, 2024\n\n###  [Bitcoin’s Rise to $100,000 Signals Global Adoption Shift](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/bitcoins-rise-to-100000-signals-global-adoption-shift/)\n\n[ Learn More ](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/bitcoins-rise-to-100000-signals-global-adoption-shift/ \"Bitcoin’s Rise to $100,000 Signals Global Adoption Shift\")\n\n[ ![Are Tariffs the New Inflation Trigger?

(NASDAQ: [GROW](https://www.usfunds.com)) (the “Company”), a registered investment advisory firm with longstanding experience in global markets and specialized sectors from gold mining to airlines, today reported net income of $315,000, or $0.02 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $176,000 in the same quarter a year earlier.\n\nNet income was bolstered by strong consolidated other income of $995,000, a change of approximately $1.5 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The change in other income was primarily due to net realized and unrealized gains in investment income, compared to net realized and unrealized losses in investment income in the three-month period a year ago. This helped offset lower operating revenue during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n#### **Inverted Yield Curve and U.S. Presidential Election Weighed on Investor Sentiment**\n\nAverage assets under management (AUM) for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of $640 million, or 30%, from the same quarter a year earlier. At 60 basis points, this represents about $3.8 million in annual revenue.\n\n“The challenge to turn operating income from negative back to positive, as it was last year, is simply fund flows into our thematic, cyclical products,” says Company CEO and Chief Investment Officer Frank Holmes.\n\nThe Company believes many potential investors limited their exposure to risk due to a combination of factors, including global conflicts, uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election and the inverted yield curve, which has been one of the most reliable recession indicators over the last 50 years.\n\n“An inverted yield curve, where short-term rates are higher than long-term rates, has preceded every U.S. recession since the 1970s. This occurs because market participants, anticipating future rate cuts to combat a downturn, drive long-term rates lower,” says Mr. Holmes. “Before turning positive again in early September, the yield curve had been inverted for a staggering 783 consecutive days, the longest such period in U.S. history.[[1]](#_ftn1) We believe this kept a lot of investors on the sidelines. Despite these market pressures, we have remained committed to our disciplined investment approach. Post-election, we anticipate a renewed sense of investor confidence, and we’re optimistic that industry inflows will recover.\n\n#### **Enhanced Shareholder Value Through Continued GROW Dividends and Share Repurchases**\n\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) authorized a monthly dividend of $0.0075 per share through December 2024, at which time it will be considered for continuation by the Board. The total amount of cash dividends expected to be paid to class A and class C shareholders from October to December 2024 is approximately $309,000.\n\nThe Board also approved plans to buy back up to approximately 14% of the Company’s shares outstanding. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased a total of 197,887 class A shares using cash of approximately $520,000. This is similar to the number of shares that the Company bought back during the same quarter in 2023. The repurchase program has been in place since December 2012, and the Company buys back stock on flat or down days.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/number-of-shares-purchased.png)\n\n“Similar to United Airlines, which just announced a $1.5 billion share buyback program on growing confidence,[[2]](#_ftn2) we have bolstered our own buyback program to enhance shareholder value,” says Mr. Holmes. “In September, we announced an update to the program, allowing for the repurchase of up to [$5 million of GROW stock](https://www.usfunds.com/resource/u-s-global-investors-announces-an-update-to-its-5-million-stock-buyback-program-reaffirming-commitment-to-shareholder-value-and-continuing-monthly-dividend/) through December 31, 2024. Under the plan, we will continue purchasing shares whenever the Class A shares are at or below the previous day’s closing price or fall below a specific price threshold. We may also buy a block of up to 100,000 shares, generally at or below the bid price, following Rule 10b-18 guidelines.”\n\n#### **Historically Strong Seasonality for Airline Stocks**\n\nDespite an exceptionally robust summer travel season that posted a record number of people—approximately 3 million[[3]](#_ftn3)—board commercial planes in the U.S. on a single day in July, the U.S. Global Jets ETF ([NYSE: JETS](https://usglobaletfs.com/fund/u-s-global-jets-etf/)) saw increased bets against the airline industry by short sellers.[[4]](#_ftn4) However, the Company believes inflows will return on seasonality as we head further into the fall and winter months.\n\n“Historically, airline stocks have tended to outperform in the fall,” Mr. Holmes continues. “According to Bank of America’s analysis of the Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index since 2000, the second half of the year has typically been the stronger half for airlines. The industry has outperformed the S&P 500 in three of the last six months of the year—namely September, October and November.”[[5]](#_ftn5)\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/11/COMM-airline-stocks-09132024.png)\n\n#### **U.S. Global Investors Marketing Team Recognized by IMEA**\n\nThe Company is pleased to announce that its marketing team received a STAR Award from the Investment Management Education Alliance (IMEA) at its annual awards ceremony in October. The recognition, in the category of Investor Content for a Product, was awarded to the Company for its content on the U.S. Global Jets ETF.\n\n“We continue to leverage our strong branding strategy to raise awareness of our investment products. In October, for instance, we hosted a JETS webcast for registered investment advisors (RIAs) that was well-attended,” says Mr. Holmes. \n\n#### **Healthy Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had net working capital of approximately $38.2 million. With approximately $27.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, the Company has adequate liquidity to meet its current obligations, in addition to investments in our funds and convertible notes.\n\n#### **Tune In to the Earnings Webcast**\n\nThe Company has scheduled a webcast for 7:30 a.m. Central time on Friday, November 8, 2024, to discuss the Company’s key financial results for the quarter. Frank Holmes will be accompanied on the webcast by Lisa Callicotte, chief financial officer, and Holly Schoenfeldt, marketing and public relations manager.

([NASDAQ](http://www.usfunds.com/): [GROW](http://www.usfunds.com/)) (“the Company”), a registered investment advisory firm with longstanding experience in global markets and specialized sectors, today announces an update to the stock repurchase program, allowing for the orderly and systematic repurchase of up to $5 million worth of the Company’s common stock between September 13, 2024, and December 31, 2024. This represents 14% of the Company’s market capitalization. This strategic move, combined with the ongoing monthly dividend program, reinforces the Company’s dedication to delivering shareholder value through effective capital allocation and consistent returns.\n\nThe Company’s Board of Directors (“the Board”) has approved the update to this buyback program as part of U.S. Global Investors’ strategy to return excess capital to shareholders, reflecting confidence in the Company’s long-term growth prospects and financial health. This buyback is a substantial commitment, aligning the Company with the best practices of highly successful buyback programs seen at companies like Oracle, which has been repurchasing its shares since 2012, and supported by Warren Buffett’s philosophy of returning value to shareholders.\n\n“We believe that repurchasing our shares at current levels offers a compelling opportunity to enhance shareholder value,” says Frank Holmes, CEO of U.S. Global Investors. “By reducing the number of outstanding shares, we aim to increase earnings per share (EPS) and provide greater ownership value to our shareholders. This buyback, alongside our ongoing monthly dividend, demonstrates our confidence in the company’s strong financial foundation and future potential.”\n\nUnder the repurchase plan, the Company will continue to purchase shares when the Class A shares are equal to or below the previous day’s closing price or if the stock trades below a certain amount per share. The Company may also purchase a block of up to 100,000 shares, on a downtick, usually at the bid or below, in accordance with Rule 10b-18.\n\n### **Prioritizing Shareholder Yield and Dividend Income for Sustained Stock Price Growth**\n\nThe Board approved payment of the $0.0075 per share per month dividend beginning in October 2024 and continuing through December 2024. The record dates are October 14, November 11 and December 16, and the payment dates will be October 28, November 25 and December 30.\n\nAt the September 18, closing price of $2.54, the $0.0075 monthly dividend equals a 3.54% yield on an annualized basis. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2024, the Company’s shareholder yield was 9.41%, which was higher than the yield on the 10-year Treasury that same day.[[1]](#_ftn1)\n\n“We understand that having a strong shareholder yield is important for stock growth,” Mr. Holmes says. “It measures how much value a company returns to its shareholders through dividends, buybacks and debt reduction. We believe that by focusing on these items, we can create a more attractive investment proposition.”\n\n### **Gold’s Surge Above $2,500 an Ounce as Interest Rates Set to Fall**\n\nThe Company would also like to take this opportunity to note the positive performance of gold, an important asset to many of the Company’s investments.\n\n“On September 16, gold recorded a new all-time high intraday price of nearly $2,590 per ounce on geopolitical tensions and anticipation that the Federal Reserve was set to cut interest rates, which it did on Wednesday, September 18, 2024. The yellow metal is trading above its 50-day moving average, which we consider to be a bullish signal and which many trend investors follow,” says Mr. Holmes.\n\n![](https://www.usfunds.com/app/uploads/2024/09/Inverse-Relationship-Between-Gold-and-Bond-Yields-09162024.png)\n\n“As many readers are aware, the price of gold has historically shared an inverse relationship with Treasury yields. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, now below its 200-day moving average, has fallen to a 52-week low of 3.6%. This decline is attributed to the ongoing decrease in the annual inflation rate and the increased probability that the Fed will begin reducing short-term rates.”\n\n**_To sign up for news and research on a variety of asset classes, from gold to airlines to digital assets, please_**[** _click here._**](https://www.usfunds.com/subscribe/)\n\n**About U.S. Global Investors, Inc.** The story of U.S. Global Investors goes back more than 50 years when it began as an investment club.

The shareholder yield is a ratio that shows how much money the company is sending back to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\n\nHoldings may change daily.
