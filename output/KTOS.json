(Nasdaq: KTOS), a technology company in the defense, national security and global markets, announced today that it has been awarded a contract valued at a maximum of $116.7 million over five years to create and operate an Advanced Fire Control Ground Infrastructure (AFCGI) for the U.S. Space Development Agency’s (SDA) Advanced Fire Control (AFC) program. The AFC will deliver integrated space and ground elements to demonstrate advanced fire control missions for missile defense.\n\nAdvanced fire control brings highly sophisticated systems for space-based sensing. These systems enable precise, real-time coordination for tracking operations in space for effective responses to threats. Among its applications, the AFCGI will support SDA’s Fire-control On Orbit-support-to-the-war Fighter program, also known as FOO Fighter or F2, which is tasked with detecting and tracking advanced missile threats, including hypersonic missiles.\n\nAs the AFCGI prime contractor, Kratos will lead a team of partner companies to:\n\n  * Deliver and manage ground segment resources, including ground entry points and terrestrial network connections;\n  * Fit-out and manage a government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facility called the Demonstration Operations Center;\n  * Manage a government-procured, contractor-operated cloud environment to provide cloud services, including hosting space vehicle mission operations center software and interfacing with mission partner systems; and,\n  * Provide program management, systems engineering, integration, verification, and operations and maintenance of the AFC ground infrastructure.\n\n\n\nMembers of the Kratos-led team include ASRC Federal Systems Solutions, LLC, Peraton, Inc., Sphinx Defense, Inc. and Stellar Solutions, Inc.\n\nCore to the AFCGI, Kratos will provide a Ground Resource Manager (GRM) which will be built for the FOO Fighter program and designed to support any future fire control demonstrations. Built upon Kratos’s OpenSpace Ground Platform, the GRM will ensure interoperability to support new space vehicles built by multiple manufacturers from multiple AFC constellations. OpenSpace is an orchestrated, software-defined and cloud-native platform based on accepted industry standards. With it, these satellite manufacturers will be able to synchronize their Command and Control (C2) missions into the AFCGI infrastructure, and new network elements and software applications will integrate seamlessly into the AFCGI. The GRM will act as the hub for the AFC constellations, serving to demonstrate modern capabilities as they evolve to support increasingly sophisticated operational programs.\n\nPhil Carrai, President of Kratos’ Space Division stated, “Advancements in missile technology and hypersonics that can travel at more than 3000 mph present new adversarial threats and will require new defensive capabilities to identify, track and respond to them rapidly. The AFCGI will serve as a standing sandbox for exploring and validating new technologies, solutions and techniques to address these threats with commensurate speed and agility. The GRM will enable the Space Force to capitalize on best of breed technologies from across the most advanced developers, and seamlessly integrate and orchestrate their operations.”\n\n**About Kratos OpenSpace** Kratos’ OpenSpace family of solutions enables the digital transformation of satellite ground systems to become a more dynamic and powerful part of the space network. The family consists of three product lines: OpenSpace SpectralNet for converting satellite RF signals to be used in digital environments; OpenSpace quantum products, which are virtual versions of traditional hardware components; and the OpenSpace Platform, the first commercially available, fully orchestrated, software-defined ground system. These three OpenSpace lines enable government agencies, commercial satellite operators and other service providers to implement digital operations at their own pace and in ways that meet their unique mission goals and business models.

(Nasdaq: KTOS), a technology company in Defense, National Security and Global Markets, today announced that its Zeus 1 and Zeus 2 Solid Rocket Motors (SRMs) completed their first successful flight on October 24, 2024, from the NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. This milestone launch provides the qualifications necessary to transition the Zeus SRMs to test programs supporting the U.S. Department of Defense, Foreign Allies, NASA, and commercial launch sponsors.\n\n![Kratos Zeus Solid Rocket Motors Complete Successful First Flight at Wallops](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/be014809-090a-41a1-8cc5-e1c999c67dfd/image2.jpeg)\n\nKratos Zeus Solid Rocket Motors Complete Successful First Flight at Wallops\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at [https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/be014809-090a-41a1-8cc5-e1c999c67dfd](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=obqgYFWx5UjEPbGK8Al3AZnNAyN5sd4SFioibqmo2zdizhOBhSIXQ7FqKnzhtu_lg-eP2ADex-jlebS36HM2wjfLwzV_-9ANyXMUxLEJpLChrN8W0kMpdEZMSALVDz7Q1hDTzMKPNdYHPcbN4vta617wiy9puIdX2NUwLjCxGRrgxUlERyn_SdtYinUnPeKYTQyBh_T6M5fRs5_FjgBi50M2WtrzTfQ9lp1z5fg3IY56j9jhrZhpoRzBsiPEyA_2vs9Q0wP3AvyMVV6U8Z2Scg==)\n\nThe flight test featured a Kratos two-stage Zeus 1 – Zeus 2 suborbital launch vehicle and provided substantial data to support rocket motor evaluation for use by future customers and sponsors who have baselined the Zeus rocket motors as part of their future test plans. Kratos expects to have production motors ready in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nKratos developed the Zeus family of SRMs in direct response to the need for affordable commercial launch vehicle stages for hypersonic test, ballistic missile targets, scientific research, sounding rocket and special customer missions. Kratos applied its significant rocket launch experience to establish the Zeus 1 and Zeus 2 motor specifications in close coordination with respective customer and user communities. Kratos internally funded development of the Zeus SRMs which are designed and manufactured to Kratos’ specifications by key merchant supplier and partner, L3Harris Technologies. L3Harris is on contract to begin delivering production motors to Kratos in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n**George Rumford , Director of the Department of Defense Test Resource Management Center,** said, “Advancements in solid rocket motor development are critical to achieving rapid, affordable hypersonic testing.”\n\n**Dave Carter , President of Kratos’ Defense & Rocket Support Services Division**, said, “I couldn’t be prouder of our whole team. They met the challenge to deliver these robust motors to market as fast as possible and meet the growing demand for rapid, reliable testing. The motors performed exceptionally well against predictions and are ready for immediate use by the broader test and research community.”\n\nThe Zeus 1 and Zeus 2 are high-performance, 32.5-inch diameter SRMs providing substantial performance improvements over similar legacy rockets. They are purposely designed to be fully compatible with existing payloads and launch infrastructure to enable rapid integration of new technologies and advanced payloads, including those currently under development by Kratos. These and other key attributes will provide Kratos and our customers with opportunities to fly more often, faster and farther, using fewer stages, and at a substantially reduced cost.\n\nThe Zeus SRM family is designed with versatility and affordability in mind as a complement to Kratos’ other internally funded investments such as the Erinyes hypersonic test “flyer” that debuted in June of this year. Kratos’ investments in the hypersonic and other relevant areas create a versatile family of test and evaluation products that offer complete systems. With the Zeus SRMs, the Erinyes, and other Kratos front end systems, Kratos is one of the only companies boasting both launcher and flyer systems within one organization, providing unmatched innovation, disruptive capabilities, mission responsiveness and affordability to the customer.\n\n**Eric DeMarco , President & CEO of Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc., **said, “Kratos is laser focused on supporting the Department of Defense, U.S. National Security requirements and working with our government partners to reinvigorate our country’s defense industrial base. Zeus’ successful mission is representative of the value Kratos’ strategy delivers to our stakeholders, with Kratos’ internally funded investments allowing us to rapidly develop and be first to market with affordable relevant systems for our partners and customers.”\n\n**About Kratos Defense & Security Solutions**Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc.
