Retail Media Contribution ex-TAC increased 23%, or 23% at constant currency, driven by continued strength in Retail Media onsite, new client integrations and growing network effects of the platform.\n  * Performance Media revenue decreased (5)%, or (5)% at constant currency, and Performance Media Contribution ex-TAC increased 5%, or 5% at constant currency, driven by the continued traction of Commerce Audiences as more clients adopt full funnel activation and resilient Retargeting, partially offset by lower AdTech services and supply.\n\n\n\n**Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income**\n\nNet income was $6 million in Q3 2024 (Q3 2023: net income of $7 million). Net income allocated to shareholders of Criteo was $6 million, or $0.11 per share on a diluted basis (Q3 2023: net income available to shareholders of $7 million, or $0.12 per share on a diluted basis).\n\nAdjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $56 million, or $0.96 per share on a diluted basis (Q3 2023: $43 million, or $0.71 per share on a diluted basis).\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Expenses**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $82 million, representing an increase of 20% year-over-year (Q3 2023: $68 million). This primarily reflects higher Contribution ex-TAC over the period and effective cost management. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Contribution ex-TAC, or Adjusted EBITDA margin, was 31% (Q3 2023: 28%).\n\nOperating expenses increased by 15% year-over-year to $222 million (Q3 2023: $194 million), mostly driven by planned growth investments. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased by 7% year-over-year to $158 million (Q3 2023: $148 million).\n\n**Cash Flow, Cash and Financial Liquidity Position**\n\nCash flow from operating activities was $58 million in Q3 2024 (Q3 2023: $20 million).\n\nFree Cash Flow, defined as cash flow from operating activities less acquisition of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and change in accounts payable related to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, was $39 million in Q3 2024 (Q3 2023: $4 million). On a trailing 12-month basis, Free Cash Flow was $177 million.\n\nCash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities, were $237 million, a $(122) million decrease compared to December 31, 2023, after spending $157 million on share repurchases in the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had total financial liquidity of approximately $711 million, including its cash position, marketable securities, revolving credit facility and treasury shares reserved for M&A.\n\n**2024 Business Outlook**\n\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Criteo's expectations as of October 30, 2024.\n\nFiscal year 2024 guidance:\n\n  * We now expect Contribution ex-TAC to grow **+10% to 11%** at constant currency.\n  * We now expect an Adjusted EBITDA margin of **approximately 32% to 33%** of Contribution ex-TAC.\n\n\n\nFourth quarter 2024 guidance:\n\n  * We expect Contribution ex-TAC between **$327 million and $333 million**, or year-over-year growth at constant-currency of +3% to +5%.\n  * We expect Adjusted EBITDA between **$114 million and $120 million**.\n\n\n\nThe guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending December 31, 2024 assumes the following exchange rates for the main currencies impacting our business: a U.S. dollar-euro rate of 0.915, a U.S. dollar-Japanese Yen rate of 151, a U.S. dollar-British pound rate of 0.778, a U.S. dollar-Korean Won rate of 1,353 and a U.S. dollar-Brazilian real rate of 5.34.\n\nThe guidance assumes that no additional acquisitions are completed during the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nReconciliations of Contribution ex-TAC, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to the closest corresponding U.S. GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of equity awards compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our share price. The variability of the above charges could potentially have a significant impact on our future U.S. GAAP financial results.\n\n**Retail Media Investor Update**\n\nCriteo will webcast its Retail Media investor presentation **on November 18, 2024, starting at** **8:30** **AM ET, 2:30** **PM CET**. The event will be an opportunity for the Company to provide an update on its Retail Media business and opportunities ahead. It will be accessible via live webcast or on-demand via our Investor site post-event.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release and its attachments include the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"): Contribution ex-TAC, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted diluted EPS, Free Cash Flow and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses. These measures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nContribution ex-TAC is a profitability measure akin to gross profit. It is calculated by deducting traffic acquisition costs from revenue and reconciled to gross profit through the exclusion of other costs of revenue. Contribution ex-TAC is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included Contribution ex-TAC because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions. In particular, we believe that this measure can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Contribution ex-TAC provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors _._\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is our consolidated earnings before financial income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, certain restructuring, integration and transformation costs, and certain acquisition costs. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and the market generally in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\n\nAdjusted Net Income is our net income adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related assets, certain restructuring, integration and transformation costs, certain acquisition costs, and the tax impact of these adjustments. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted diluted EPS are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted diluted EPS can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted diluted EPS provide useful information to investors and the market generally in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\n\nFree Cash Flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less acquisition of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and change in accounts payable related to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment. Free Cash Flow Conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash. Accordingly, we believe that Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion permit a more complete and comprehensive analysis of our available cash flows.\n\nNon-GAAP Operating Expenses are our consolidated operating expenses adjusted to eliminate equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, certain restructuring, integration and transformation costs, and certain acquisition and integration costs. The Company uses Non-GAAP Operating Expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short-term and long-term operational plans, and to assess and measure our financial performance and the ability of our operations to generate cash. We believe Non-GAAP Operating Expenses reflects our ongoing operating expenses in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. As a result, we believe that Non-GAAP Operating Expenses provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our core operating performance and trends in the same manner as our management and in comparing financial results across periods. In addition, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses is a key component in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, which is one of the key measures the Company uses to provide its quarterly and annual business outlook to the investment community.\n\nPlease refer to the supplemental financial tables provided in the appendix of this press release for a reconciliation of Contribution ex-TAC to gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA to net income, Adjusted Net Income to net income, Free Cash Flow to cash flow from operating activities, and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses to operating expenses, in each case, the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 1) other companies, including companies in our industry which have similar business arrangements, may address the impact of TAC differently; and 2) other companies may report Contribution ex-TAC, Contribution ex-TAC margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Free Cash Flow, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently or over different regions, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider these measures alongside our U.S. GAAP financial results, including revenue and net income.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements Disclosure**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including projected financial results for the year ending December 31, 2024, our expectations regarding our market opportunity and future growth prospects and other statements that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
