(the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 4, 2012. The Company is a universal smart instrument developer\nand manufacturer, headquartered in Ontario, California, specializing in the development and commercialization of novel and proprietary universal smart technologies and\ninstruments. The Company is also a provider of patented hardware and software design technologies for Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G. The Company has developed what it\nbelieves are five disruptive patented technology platforms with 26 patents and patents pending in various phases and 8 trademarks pending in various phases to solve what it\nbelieves are the major problems facing hardware and software design and production within the industry today. These technologies combined have the potential to reduce costs,\nreduce product development timelines and energy usage while increasing range, speed, efficiency, and security of the IoT and 5G networks.\nThe Company has multiple subsidiaries, including Perfecular Inc. (“Perfecular”), Focus Universal (Shenzhen) Technology Company LTD (“Focus Shenzhen”), AVX Design &\nIntegration, Inc. (“AVX,” also doing business as Smart AVX (“Smart AVX”)), Lusher Bioscientific, Inc. (“Lusher”), and up through August 21, 2024, AT Tech Systems LLC\n(“AT Tech Systems”). Perfecular, a wholly owned subsidiary of Focus that was founded in September 2009 and is headquartered in Ontario, California, is engaged in designing\ndigital sensor products and selling a broad selection of horticultural sensors and filters in North America and Europe. AVX, incorporated on June 16, 2000, in the state of\nCalifornia, is an IoT installation and management company specializing in high performance audio/video systems, home theaters, lighting control, automation and integration.\nServices provided by AVX include full integration of houses, apartments, commercial complexes, and office spaces with audio, visual and control systems to fully integrate\ndevices in the low voltage field, specializing in high end residential smart IoT installation projects in areas throughout the Southern California area. AVX’s services also include\npartial equipment upgrade and installation. AVX also markets and sells our IoT Products, such as high-end LED, live wall panel products and cameras, under the Smart AVX\nname.\nOn December 23, 2021, Focus Shenzhen was founded as a mainland China office for manufacturing procurement expertise and research and development support activities.\nFocus Shenzhen is designed to function as a branch office accessing high level ability to source products and build relationships with manufacturers in China and as a lower\ncost form of support, research and development as engineers abound in China.\nAs of January 6, 2023, AT Tech Systems is a subsidiary of Focus specializing in commercial and industrial smart IoT installation projects in areas throughout Southern\nCalifornia. AT Tech Systems has several clients including medical/dental facilities and commercial and industrial projects, and several notable manufacturers and wholesalers,\nand provides clients with integrated network, security, and multimedia design solutions and technology systems. On August 5, 2024, the company and the segment manager of\nAT Tech Systems LLC reached a tentative oral agreement to terminate his employment and the employment of his two direct report team members. The Company discontinued\noperations of AT Tech Systems on August 21, 2024 with a termination cost of $22,000 and is now presenting these operations as discontinued. (See Note 10)\nThe Company has completed integration throughout its existing businesses, including key employees serving dual roles with its subsidiaries.\nAs of April 30, 2024, the Company founded a wholly owned subsidiary named Lusher Inc. Lusher Inc. was founded to develop, market, and commercialize automation\nsoftware, titled One Touch Financial, initially targeting the financial reporting software market sector. As of the date of this filing, the Company has solely begun ongoing\ndevelopment of the software and founded the subsidiary after board approval, as other business activities are only in the introductory phase. As of May 11, 2024, the Company\nannounced board approval for the eventual spin-off of Lusher to better prioritize the development of its SEC Financial Reporting Automation Software while also allowing the\nmanagement of Focus Universal Inc. to better prioritize its core business.\n9\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe unaudited condensed financial statements of the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Regulation S-K for\nscaled disclosures for smaller reporting companies. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.\nHowever, such information reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments), which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair\npresentation of the Company’s financial position and results of operations. Results shown for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for a full\nfiscal year. The balance sheet information as of December 31, 2023 was derived from the audited financial statements included in the Company’s financial statements as of and\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on\nApril 1, 2024. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with that report.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Focus and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Perfecular, AVX, Focus Shenzhen,\nLusher and AT Tech Systems (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. The\nCompany’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“U.S. GAAP”).\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company currently has one operating segment in addition to our corporate overhead. In accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”), the Company\nconsiders operating segments to be components of the Company’s business for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by Management in\ndeciding how to allocate resources and to assess performance. Management reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources\nand evaluating financial performance. Previously, the Company identified two operating and reportable segments: (1) the \"IoT Products\" segment, jointly operated by\nPerfecular, AVX (under the Smart AVX brand), and Lusher, which focuses on the wholesale, marketing, and production of universal smart instruments and devices for the\nhydroponic, controlled agriculture, commercial, and home automation sectors; and (2) the \"IoT Installation Services\" segment, run by AVX (excluding Smart AVX IoT\nProducts) and AT Tech Systems, specializing in IoT installation and management, including audio/video systems, home theaters, lighting control, automation, and integration.\nHowever, following the Company’s discontinued operations of AT Tech Systems in August 2024, the Company now has only one operating and reportable segment which is\n“IoT Products.”\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts,\nhistorical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the\ncarrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nThe actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the\nestimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected. Significant estimates in the accompanying financial statements include the lease term impacting\nright-of use asset and lease liability, useful lives of property and equipment, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, and the valuation allowance on deferred tax\nassets. The Company regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions.\n10\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nThe Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends and review of the current status of trade accounts receivable.

Stock-based\ncompensation to employees consist of stock options, grants, and restricted shares that are recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of\ngrant.\nThe measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest and is recognized as an expense over the period\nduring which services are received.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of option grants utilizing the Black-Scholes pricing model and estimates the fair value of the stock based upon the estimated fair value of\nthe common stock. The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest.\nThe resulting stock-based compensation expense for both employee and non-employee awards is generally recognized on a straight- line basis over the requisite service period\nof the award.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows paragraph ASC 825-10-50-10 for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph ASC 820-10-35-37 (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”)\nto measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nTo increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the\ninputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active\nmarkets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are\ndescribed below:\n· Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\n· Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\n· Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.\n12\nThe following table summarize financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 (unaudited)\nFair Value Carrying\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Value\nAssets\nMarketable securities:\nStock $ 27,043 $ – $ – $ 27,043\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 27,043 $ – $ – $ 27,043\nDecember 31, 2023\nFair Value Carrying\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Value\nAssets\nMarketable securities:\nStock $ 36,735 $ – $ – $ 36,735\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 36,735 $ – $ – $ 36,735\nThe carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts receivable, inventories, other receivable, prepaid expenses, deposit, accounts and\naccrued expenses, payable, treasury stock payable, short-term loan, other current liabilities, customer deposit, approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those\ninstruments.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income\nbut are excluded from net income (loss) as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders’ equity. The Company’s other comprehensive loss for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from the Company is recognized under Topic 606 in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of its services and products to customers in return for expected\nconsideration and includes the following elements:\n· executed contracts with the Company’s customers that it believes are legally enforceable;\n· identification of performance obligations in the respective contract;\n· determination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract;\n· Allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and\n· recognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\n13\nThese five elements, as applied to each of the Company’s revenue category, is summarized below:\n· Product sales – revenue is recognized at the time of sale upon the delivery of the equipment to the customer and completion of performance obligation.\n· Service sales – revenue is recognized based on the service been provided and the agreed upon performance obligation has been completed to the customer.\nRevenue from our project construction is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion method under the cost approach. The percentage of completion is\ndetermined by estimating stage of work completed. Under this approach, recognized contract revenue equals the total estimated contract revenue multiplied by the percentage\nof completion. Our construction contracts are unit priced, and an account receivable is recorded for amounts invoiced based on actual units produced. Due to the Company\ndiscontinuing operations of AT Tech Systems in August 2024, the Company currently only have one operating and reportable segment which is IoT Products.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of efforts to refine existing product models and develop new\nproduct models.\nBasic and Fully Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nNet income (loss) per share is computed pursuant to ASC 260-10-45. Basic net income (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted\naverage number of shares outstanding during the period.\nFully diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of stock and potentially outstanding shares of stock during the period to\nreflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants, unless these shares are\ncovered by anti-dilutive protections. The denominator comprises the Company’s weighted average number of outstanding shares to extent the related shares are dilutive and, if\ndilutive, and other contracts to issue shares of common stock and stock options. As a result, they are included in the fully diluted EPS computation to the extent that the effect\nwould be dilutive.\nAs of each period end, all potentially dilutive instruments would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss for all periods presented. The\nfollowing potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023\nStock options 626,374 497,092\n14\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe reporting and functional currency of Focus is the USD. The functional currency of Focus Universal (Shenzhen) Technology Co. LTD, a wholly owned subsidiary of Focus\nlocated in China, is the Renminbi (“RMB”).\nFor financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Company’s Chinese subsidiary, which are prepared using the RMB, are translated into the Company’s reporting\ncurrency, USD. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates\nprevailing during each reporting period. Stockholders’ equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity.\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the\ntransactions. The resulting exchange difference, presented as foreign currency transaction loss, is included in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of\noperations. The exchange rates used for unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are as follows:\nAverage Rate for the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\n(Unaudited) (Unaudited)\nChina Yuan (RMB) RMB 7.1843 RMB 7.2942\nUnited States Dollar ($) $ 1.0000 $ 1.0000\nExchange Rate at\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(Unaudited)\nChina Yuan (RMB) RMB 7.0138 RMB 7.0698\nUnited States Dollar ($) $ 1.0000 $ 1.0000\nGoing Concern\nThe Company has assessed its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has a net loss of $1,238,776 and $3,100,442 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company had an\naccumulated deficit of $23,820,946 and $22,582,170 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and negative cash flow from operating activities of\n$3,658,901 and $2,603,545 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern\nexists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due\nwithin one year from the financial statement issuance date. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which\ncontemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company currently suffered recurring loss from operations, generated negative cash flow from operating\nactivities, has an accumulated deficit and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of\ntime. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include\nadjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of reported asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company\nbe unable to continue as a going concern. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, has also expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\n15\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments, in the amount of $5,368,273. The ability to continue as a going concern is\ndependent on the Company attaining and maintaining profitable operations in the future and raising additional capital to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from\nnormal business operations when they come due. Since inception, the Company has funded its operations primarily through equity and debt financings, and it expects to\ncontinue to rely on these sources of capital in the future. In addition, before September 30, 2024, the Company has sold its land and buildings which provided additional\nworking capital to the Company. For more information on the sale of the land and buildings please see Note 5. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be\navailable or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue\nrestrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing, or grant unfavorable terms in future\nlicensing agreements.\nNote 3 – Recent Accounting Pronouncement\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosure, which is intended to improve reportable\nsegment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expense categories that are regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision maker and included in each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss. The update also requires all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss\nand assets to be provided in interim periods and for entities with a single reportable segment to provide all the disclosures required by ASC 280, Segment Reporting, including\nthe significant segment expense disclosures.

The Company will accrue a liability for such matters when it is\nprobable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonable estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the\nrange is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency might include, for example, estimates of potential damages, outside legal fees and other directly related costs\nexpected to be incurred. As of the date of this quarterly report, the Company was involved in the following material legal proceeding.\nOn August 26, 2024, a former software engineer filed an action against the Company in the Superior Court for the County of San Bernardino, State of California alleging\nwrongful termination and other violations of the California Labor Code. The complaint seeks unspecified economic and non-economic losses, as well as attorneys’ fees. The\nCompany is investigating and intends to vigorously defend itself in the foregoing matters. However, litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain. The Company does\npossess EPLI insurance, and the legal team as selected by the insurance company is currently handling the matter. The Company vigorously disputes these allegations.\n21\nNote 12 – Subsequent Events\nOn October 17, 2024, the Company repurchased 1,300,000 shares of common stock from two of the Company’s shareholders for an aggregate amount of $390,000. Documents\nhave not yet been completed to date, and the Company is currently calculating the accounting effects of this transaction.\nAs of October 30, 2024, and after September 30, 2024, the Company also repurchased an additional 409,831 common shares from the open market for consideration of\n$102,639 at an average price of $0.25 in the open window under the Company’s active 10b-18 plan. The company plans to maintain these as treasury shares until certain\nretirement.\nThe Company has evaluated all other subsequent events through the date these consolidated financial statements were issued and determined that there were no other\nsubsequent events or transactions that require recognition or disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\n22\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial\nstatements and notes thereto included in, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

(the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Nevada corporation. We believe we have developed five proprietary technologies utilizing our patent portfolio\nwhich we believe solve the most fundamental problems plaguing the internet of things (“IoT”) industry through: (1) increasing overall chip integration by shifting integration\nfrom the component level to the device level; (2) creating a faster 5G cellular technology by using ultra-narrowband technology; (3) leveraging ultra-narrowband power line\ncommunication (“PLC”) technology; (4) proprietary User Interface Machine auto generation technology; and (5) incorporating all our core technologies into a single chip. Our\nUniversal Smart Technology is designed to overcome instrumentation interoperability and interchangeability. The electronic design starts from a 90% completed common\nfoundation we call our universal smart instrumentation platform (“USIP”), instead of the current method of building each stand-alone instrument from scratch. Our method\neliminates redundant hardware and software and results in significant cost savings and production efficiency. We also provide sensor devices and are a wholesaler of various air\nfilters and digital, analog, and quantum light meter systems. The Company holds 28 patents and patents pending in various phases of the patent process.\nOur securities are currently traded on Nasdaq Capital Market effective as of September 23, 2024.\nOur Current Products Include:\nWe are a wholesaler of various digital, analog, and quantum light meters and filtration products, including fan speed adjusters, carbon filters and HEPA filtration systems.\nIn an effort to continually develop our product lines, we plan to phase out the traditional, lower-margin products, such as the first-generation digital light meter, and are\npreparing to launch a new line of products that have been in development for several years. These newer technology products will be released in phases, and we intend that\nincreasing amounts of technology will be layered upon these products. Additionally, we plan to continue to increase our efforts in protecting more intellectual property and have\ncontinued to develop technologies for long-term growth. We have developed products in both the controlled agriculture industry and home automation industries, taking\nadvantage of our existing relationships in both sectors.\n23\nWe are building a U.S.-based sales team to market our Smart AVX-branded product lines. The team has already begun marketing our current large format multimedia touch\nscreens, surveillance camera system (cameras and network video recorders (NVRs)), indoor and outdoor LED screens, and Focus Universal-branded voice over internet\nprotocol (VOIP) phone service systems for use in commercial and corporate settings.\nOur products on the home automation front are beginning the production cycle. Of note, smart wall touch light switches, digital control smart wall touch light switches, smart\ntimers, and smart controllers are ready for production. Sourcing of electronic parts for these products is completed, the cost analysis of these products is completed, and most of\nthe tooling for production has been completed.\nCurrently, our Shenzhen subsidiary mainly focuses on product development and commercialization. An important electrode with a “Total Dissolved Solids” (“TDS”) meter\ndesign, with applications in all solubility measurements, was completed and approved by our U.S. management team. The designs of our TDS sensor, carbon dioxide sensor,\nnew quantum PAR sensor and total dissolved oxygen sensors are also completed. Our testing against the state-of-the-art sensors on the market suggests to us that the new\nsensors are at least as good as the best quality sensors on the market. However, we believe that our sensors are much more cost effective.\nOur software machine auto design team has also made significant progress during the nine months ending September 30, 2024. Having the mathematical and graphical\nenvironments created, our team is focused on developing the 3D-user interface machine auto design. Our public reporting automation software is completed and currently\nundergoing extensive testing. As reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K are time-consuming, complex processes that require each company’s financial team to gather and translate\nlarge amounts of data from multiple sources, the time and expertise required to complete the process is a substantial burden for any company, large or small. Meanwhile, SEC\nreporting deadlines are firm and inflexible. This conflict can interfere with other reporting and internal timelines and leave teams time-strapped and scrambling for the resources\nneeded to meet any reporting requirements. We have developed a Microsoft®-based add-on software that aims to streamline and automate the SEC reporting preparation\nprocess. We believe the software will significantly simplify the Form 10-Q and Form 10-K preparation processes and make creating, editing and managing documents both\nsimple and accurate. We are planning to commercialize this software in the fourth quarter of 2024 or the first quarter of 2025. A cloud-based version of this software is also\nunder the development.\nBeyond IoT products, our R&D software team has developed a derivative product (i.e., our software platform for interoperability within the IoT), we have developed a\ncomplementary office automation software product. This specific software was designed to assist in completing financial reports faster, more accurately, and with greater ease\nof update, thereby eliminating the need for increased staffing especially in time sensitive projects. It is designed to save CPAs, auditors, accounting, and/or legal a significant\namount of time in the preparation of SEC financial reports and other internal financial reporting. Eighty percent of this software development has been completed and we hope\nto launch a beta version of this product.\nFan speed adjuster device. Designed specifically for centrifugal fans with brushless motors, our adjuster device helps ensure longer life by preventing damage to fan motors by\nadjusting the speed of centrifugal fans without causing the motor to hum. These devices are rated for 350 watts max, have 120VAC voltage capacity and feature an internal\nelectronic auto-resetting circuit breaker.\nCarbon filter devices. We sell two types of carbon filter devices. These carbon filter devices are professional grade filters specifically designed and used to filter the air in\ngreenhouses that might be polluted by fermenting organics. One of these filters can be attached to a centrifugal fan to scrub the air in a constant circle or can be attached to an\nexhaust line as a single-pass filter, which moves air out of the growing area, filters unwanted odors and removes pollens, dust, and other debris in the air. The other filter is\ndesigned to be used with fans from 0-6000 C.F.M.\nHEPA filtration device. We provide a high-efficiency particulate arrestance (“HEPA”) filtration device at wholesale prices to our client Hydrofarm. Manufactured, tested,\ncertified, and labeled in accordance with current HEPA filter standards, this device is targeted towards greenhouses and grow rooms and designed to keep insects, bacteria, and\nmold out of grow rooms. We sell these devices in various sizes.\n24\nQuantum par meter. We provide a handheld quantum par meter used to measure photosynthetically active radiation (“PAR”). This fully portable handheld PAR meter is\ndesigned to measure PAR flux in wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nm. It is designed to measure up to 10,000 µmol.\nFor a description of our products and services offering, please refer to Item 1. “Business” beginning on page 1 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024.\nUbiquitor Wireless Universal Sensor Device\nWe have developed a device we call the Ubiquitor, which replaces the functions of traditional digital measurement and sensing products by integrating many digital sensors and\nmeasurement tools into one single digital device. We believe the platform represents a technological advancement in the IoT marketplace by integrating large numbers of\ntechnologies, including cloud technology, wired and wireless communication technology, software programming, instrumentation technology, artificial intelligence, PLC\ntechnology, and sensor networking into a single platform. We believe the result of such integration is a smaller, cheaper, and faster circuit system design than those currently\noffered in the instrumentation market.\nOur USIP technology that will make the Ubiquitor possible is an advanced software and hardware integrated instrumentation platform that uses a large-scale modular design\napproach. The large-scale modular design approach subdivides instruments into a foundation component (a USIP) and architecture-specific components (sensor nodes), which\ntogether replaces the functions of traditional instruments at a fraction of their cost. The USIP has an open architecture, incorporating a variety of individual instrument\nfunctions, sensors, and probes from different industries and vendors. The platform features the ability to connect potentially thousands of different sensors or probes, addressing\nmajor limitations present in traditional instrumentation systems.\nThe Ubiquitor will be a general platform that collects data in real time, up to 100 Hz per second, and, thus, is intended to be adapted to many industrial uses.\nBy using the universal hardware or USIP, we believe we could achieve the following efficiencies in instrumentation systems:\n1. Cut production costs. Smartphone technology is widely used on the small sensor device market. By utilizing smartphone technology, the Ubiquitor will add superior\nfunctionality and performance, improve the product’s quality, and cut production costs.\n2. Reduce the effort required to develop a new sensor product. With the Ubiquitor, we believe that there will be no need for device manufacturers to research and\ndevelop new monitoring and operating components because they will just need to develop new sensor nodes or probes that may be integrated into our software\ntechnology.\n3. Reduce clutter. It is anticipated that the Ubiquitor could dispense with some of the hassle of connecting cables, since the Ubiquitor allows wireless transmission of\nsensor data and may allow wireless access to networks, such as a PLC network.\nAdditional Focus Universal Inc. IoT Products under Smart AVX. Focus Universal Inc. is integrating its own Smart AVX- branded IoT equipment to connect devices across\nplatform systems and to facilitate unified collaboration across audio-visual technologies, digital media technologies, security and surveillance technologies and communication\ntechnologies. This approach allows the Company to service its customers for ease of use, design and integration, and installation and maintenance by utilizing technology that\nintegrates our five core technologies.\n25\nWe have integrated our Smart AVX-branded products across the following strategic sub-sectors: LED Audio-visual Panel Products, large format Smart Multimedia Touch\nScreens, Pan Tilt Zoom (“PTZ”) Dome Cameras and Network Video Recorders (“NVRs”), and VOIP Phone Services.\n1. LED Audio-visual Panel Products. LED panel digital displays have become an integral and modern-day solution that address the communication and display demands\nof the residential and commercial customer base. Due to the flexible configuration of the LED panels, the modular design that enables the ability to incorporate a\ndesign into any size space, the flexibility of the standard size panels to accommodate curvature in the design space, the ability to address transparency in the panel\ndisplays and create new areas for delivering media to the public, our LED panel digital displays allow us to easily adapt our display design to spaces of any size and\nshape, making any customer space a customizable output and connected piece within a system. The option to create full size screens in any space, while addressing\nany environmental demands, allows us to use state-of-the-art media resulting in immersive, three-dimensional, captivating content delivery within any system.\n2. Large Format Smart Multimedia Touch Screens. Smart AVX-branded large format touch screens deliver interactive solutions for a wide variety of industries and\napplications, including education, healthcare, commercial, residential and government applications. While interacting with a touch display is commonplace in public-\nconsumer spaces, we integrate large format Smart touch screens in small business, commercial applications such as dental offices and other business scenarios. These\nmarket applications continue to be underserved with touch-enabled devices, and our installation engineers and design staff can customize solutions for unique business\nand commercial application projects. The Company, through the Smart AVX brand, offers a myriad of customized choices and a long list of options within the current\ntouch screen technology in a refined product. Our products allow future integration of our core platform technologies, such as the LED digital displays, the Ubiquitor,\nPTZ Dome Cameras and VOIP Phone Systems, allowing for pinch, zoom, scrolling, and videoconferencing within the touch screen format.\nLusher Corporate Services, One Touch Financial Software\nFinancial reporting is the process by which a company keeps investors aware of a company’s financial condition, allowing them to have the information they need\nbefore making an investment decision.\nAn annual report on Form 10-K is a comprehensive report filed annually by a publicly traded containing company information such as its history, organizational\nstructure, financial statements, earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and other relevant data.\nThe quarterly report on Form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company’s quarterly performance that must be submitted by public companies to the SEC on a\nquarterly basis. The quarterly report on Form 10-Q is generally submitted with unaudited financial statements including condensed financial statements, a management\ndiscussion and analysis on the financial condition of the company, and disclosures regarding market risk and internal controls. In the quarterly reports, companies are\nrequired to disclose additional relevant quarterly financial information regarding their financial position.\nBecause of the depth and nature of the information they contain, reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q can become time-consuming, especially given the complex\nprocesses that require a company’s internal teams to gather large amounts of data across multiple sources. The time and expertise required to complete the process is a\nsubstantial burden. SEC reporting deadlines are firm and inflexible. These reporting requirements can interfere with other reporting timelines and leave a time-strapped\nteam scrambling for the resources needed to meet mandated reporting requirements.\nDelays and mistakes in SEC financial reporting can have far-reaching consequences for companies and their shareholders including. SEC review, enforcement actions,\nand penalties. Late, inaccurate, or incomplete filings can often lead to a drop in the company’s stock price and a decrease in investor confidence.\n26\nHowever, it is critically important that the company’s financial reporting is accurate, thorough, and up to date. Office software packages are widely used in all report\npreparation. While current software can do an excellent job on word processing, it often fails in the creation of the rigorously formatted tables and spreadsheets needed\nto populate requisite financial information in report. Furthermore, because of the frequent incompatibility between programs from software packages, the formatted\ntables required by financial reporting standards that are created by spreadsheets programs are mismatched, incomplete, or even destroyed when they are transferred via\nword processing files.\nHuman data entry of hundreds or thousands of financial numbers in the financial report imposes another challenge and presented by regularly occurring human error.\nThis risk is compounded by a frequent requirement to update or revise these hundreds or thousands of numbers during the time-constrained review processes and\nauditing processes prior to submission.\nGiven the complexity and volume of data involved, companies are looking for solutions that not only save cost, and reduce the time and effort required to report in a\ntimely manner but also improve accuracy and compliance. We have developed an automated software solution to address these challenges effectively and efficiently in\nthe following ways:\nData Entry Automation: Our software’s automated data entry function reduces the risk of human errors and saves time. It can extract data from various\nsources and populate financial reports accurately.\nValidation Checks: Our One Touch Financial Software includes built-in validation checks to ensure that the data is accurate and compliant with regulatory\nrequirements. It also helps in identifying potential errors early in the reporting process.\nFormatted Table Creation: Creating formatted tables which are often required in SEC financial reports, is a time-consuming task. Our software generates\nthese tables accurately and efficiently.\nIntegration: Integration with existing financial systems and software is essential for a seamless reporting process. Our software connects with multiple data\nsources and financial software frequently used by reporting companies.\nSecurity and Compliance: Security of data is critical, especially when dealing with sensitive financial data. Our software adheres to industry standards and\nregulations to ensure data security and compliance with reporting requirements.\nThe Company plans to demo the software this month as the development for the software has progressed. The company plans for a company roadshow in 3Q of 2024\nto update the community regarding these new developments.\nResearch and Development Efforts of Power Line Communication\nPower Line Communication (“PLC”) technology is a communication technology that enables sending data over existing power cables. One advantage of this technology is that\nPLC does not require substantial new investment for its communications infrastructure. Rather, PLC utilizes existing power lines, thereby forming a distribution network that\nalready penetrates all residential, commercial and industrial premises. Accordingly, connectivity via PLC technology is potentially the most cost-effective, scalable\ninterconnectivity approach for the IoT. We believe PLC technology can be an integral part of our communication infrastructure for the IoT, which enables reliable, real-time\nmeasurements, monitoring, and control. A large variety of appliances may be interconnected by transmitting data through the same wires that provide electrical energy.\nOur patented PLC technology uses an ultra-narrowband spectrum channel of less than 1 KHz to establish a long-distance link between transmitter and receiver. Thus, we\nbelieve that our proprietary ultra-narrowband PLC technology will offer a promising alternative to wireless networks and provide the backbone communication infrastructure\nfor IoT devices.\n27\nThe primary design goal of the power line network is electric power distribution, not data transmission. The harsh electrical noise present on power lines and variations in\nequipment and standards make data transmission over the power grid difficult. These technological challenges have impeded, or even halted, progression of PLC technology.\nResearch and Development Efforts of 5G Cellular Technology\nJust like our ultra-narrowband technology can be used to effectively reduce noise in powerline communication technology, our internal research suggests that our ultra-\nnarrowband technology can be leveraged to create a type of 5G wireless communication technology that can achieve both low band 5G coverage and an estimated 1 Gbps high\nband speed. We employ an ultra-narrow spectrum channel (<1KHz) to establish an ultra-long-distance link between the 5G base station and the receiver which reduces noise\nand interference entering the bandwidth.\nFor a description of the ultra-narrowband technology and the 5G applications, see “Part I - Item 1. Business, Section 2. “Creating a faster 5G cellular technology by using ultra-\nnarrowband technology” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024.\nIntellectual Property Protection\nOn November 4, 2016, we filed U.S. patent application number 15/344,041 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The patent was issued on March 20, 2018.\nWe filed with the USPTO on June 2, 2017 a patent application regarding a process for improving a spectral response curve of a photo sensor. The resulting U.S. Patent No.\n10,251,037 was issued on February 26, 2019.\nOn March 19, 2018, we filed U.S. Patent Application No. 15/925,400. The patent title is a “Universal Smart Device,” which is a universal smart instrument that unifies\nheterogeneous measurement probes into a single device that can analyze, publish, and share the data analyzed. The resulting U.S. Patent No. 10,251,037 was issued on April 2,\n2019.\nOn November 29, 2019, the Company filed an international utility patent application through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) as International Patent Application No.\nPCT/US2019/63880. On September 6, 2022, the International Searching Authority (ISA) issued a favorable International Preliminary Report of Patentability (IPRP) regarding\nthis patent application, which describes the Company’s PLC technology. The IPRP cited only three category “A” documents, indicating that the Company’s application met\nboth the novelty and non-obviousness patentability requirements. Consequently, the Company is optimistic that a patent including claims directed to its PLC technology will be\nissued in due course and will allow the Company to protect its PLC technology.\nIn 2021, we hired the law firm of Knobbe, Martens, Olson & Bear, LLP (“Knobbe Martens”) to serve as outside intellectual property counsel for the Company. The firm is\nworking on converting the Company’s provisional patent applications to formal nonprovisional patent applications and expanding existing patent portfolios. In addition,\nKnobbe Martens is working on filing four previously unfiled patents and pursuing patent coverage in Europe and Australia. In addition, in May 2022, the Company engaged\nChang & Hale, LLP as suggested by our counsel at Knobbe Martens to assist with two new patents, noting that Knobbe Martens still remains our main IP counsel. Currently,\nthe Company has 18 pending U.S. nonprovisional patent applications and 9 issued U.S. patents. As a result of our primary IP attorney switching firms from Knobbe Martens to\nDority Manning, Focus Universal Inc, hired Dority Manning on July 16, 2024 to serve as outside intellectual property counsel for the Company.\nThe Company’s patent number 11,488,468 was allowed and subsequently issued on November 1, 2022. The patent is titled “Sensor for Detecting the Proximity of an IEEE\n802.11 Protocol Connectable Device.” On November 7, 2023, our patent application titled “Activated Carbon Air Filter” issued as U.S. Patent No. 11,806,654. We also just\nreceived an issue notification from the USPTO, indicating that our patent application titled “Electronic Lock and Method of Operation” will issue on November 21, 2023, as\nU.S. Patent No. 11,823,513. The company has begun to file omnibus patents to combine certain patents under a unified central patent.\n28\nCompetitors\nWe have identified several competitors specifically in the wireless sensor node industry, including traditional instruments or device manufacturers. Hach developed and\nlaunched the SC1000 Multi-parameter Universal Controller, a probe module for connecting up to 32 digital sensors or analyzers. However, their products are not compatible\nwith smart phones yet; and we believe their price point is still prohibitive to consumers. Monnit Corporation offers a range of wireless and remote sensors. Many of Monnit’s\nproducts are web-based wireless sensors that usually are not portable because of their power consumption. Also, the sensors’ real-time updates are slow; and we believe security\nof the web-based sensor data acquisition may also be a concern. In addition to purchasing the device, consumers usually have to pay monthly fees for using web-based services.\nWe are not trying to compete with traditional instruments or device manufacturers because we utilize our Ubiquitor device in conjunction with our smartphone application,\nwhich we believe will be a completely different product category.\nIoT Installation Industry\nThere are several companies that compete with AVX in smart home installations, including Vivint Smart Home, Savant, Crestron and Control4. However, we believe we can\ndistinguish ourselves from our competitors by offering substantially more customization and interoperability with existing platforms. While our service offerings do not rely on\nalways providing the entire installation for the end client, our Company is able to seamlessly provide accenting, replacement, or conversion home automation systems which\nare easier to use and interoperate for the end client, and with limited rewiring. Complete installation by Crestron ranges between $100,000 and $500,000 and an installation by\nControl4 ranges between $70,000 and $250,000. The cheapest competitor we can identify in this sector is Vivint Smart Home, which costs less than $50,000 to install; however,\nwe understand that the Vivint Smart Home focuses on security systems only and that users have no other smart applications, which our smart home product line would include.\nOur sales staff have encountered a growing client base of unhappy customers with the pre-existing and completely siloed platform systems that reportedly are not easy to use or\nprogram, require costly specialty service for simple operations, are subject to lengthy software and hardware backlogs, and despite being based on the same platform, fail to\noperate compatibly, possessing frequent errors and bugs.\nAir Filtration Systems and Meter Products Industry\nThe air filtration system and meter products industry is a niche industry. Air purification methods are an effective way to control contaminants and improve indoor air quality;\nand as a result, many national and local governments overseeing indoor air quality and other emissions are enacting stricter workforce health and safety regulations in this area,\nwhich drives demand.\nMarket Potential\nWe believe universal wireless smart technology will play a critical role for traditional instrument manufacturers, as currently the undertaking of an IoT project is simply too\nexpensive and difficult to develop for medium or smaller companies and carries a 75% failure rate according to Cisco Systems.1 The cost factor is the first consideration when\ndeciding whether a company wants to develop smart wireless technologies and implement them into their products or use them in their field testing. We also hope to play a role\nin academic laboratories, particularly with smaller academic laboratories that are sensitive to price. Regarding the larger IoT industry statistics, overall enterprise IoT spending\nincreased to $201 billion in 2022, an increase of 21.5%. The outlook for growth in 2023 is 18.5% from this large base of enterprise spending.2 More specifically, the IoT\nsensors market is projected to reach $26 billion by 2026 from $11.1 billion in 2022.3 The IoT marketplace size assessments usually include the hardware components and the\nsoftware components, which often contain a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. Additionally, the rising need for reliable high bandwidth communication for IoT devices is\nexpected to rise to $664.75 billion in 2028, spearheaded by the currently predominant services in the 5G category.4 We would also expect this market to grow with the addition\nof new categories of services delivering reliable high bandwidth communication for IoT devices and would cannibalize and expand the existing services where the new services\nproved to be more effective and efficient.\n________________________\n1 Cisco Systems, Connected Futures, Executive Business Insights, May 2017, The Journey to IoT Value, Challenges, Breakthroughs, and Best Practices,\nhttps://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2017/m05/cisco-survey-reveals-close-to-three-fourths-of-iot-projects-are-failing.html\n2 IoT Analytics, Market Insights for the Internet of Things, February 7, 2023, Global IoT market size to grow 19% in 2023—IoT shows resilience despite economic downturn,\nhttps://iot-analytics.com/iot-market-size/\n3 Markets and Markets, IoT Sensors Market by Sensor Type, Network Technology, Vertical, Application, and Geography – Global Forecast -2026,\nhttps://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/sensors-iot-market-26520972.html\n4 Cision PRNewswire, Research and Markets, Global $664.75 Billion 5G Services Markets to 2028: Rising Need for High Bandwidth to Provide Reliable Communication to\nIoT Devices is Expected to Boost Overall Market Growth, https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-664-75-billion-5g-services-markets-to-2028-rising-need-for-\nhigh-bandwidth-to-provide-\nreliable-communication-to-iot-devices-is-expected-to-boost-overall-market-growth-301432173.html\n29\nResults of Operations\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nRevenue, cost of revenue and gross profit\nFor the three For the three Increase\nmonths ended months ended (Decrease)\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 $\nRevenue $ 74,215 $ 71,854 $ 2,361\nCost of revenue 42,530 44,386 (1,856)\nGross Profit $ 31,685 $ 27,468 $ 4,217\nOur consolidated gross revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $74,215 and $71,854, respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had cash inflow from investing activities of $54,472. That was primarily the\nresult from the purchase of property and equipment of $20,294, purchase of marketable securities of $144,907, and proceeds from sales of marketable securities of $219,673.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had cash inflows of $1,451,000 due to proceeds from third party and related party loan amount of $1,451,000 and\nrepayment on third party and related party loan amount of $2,376,000, stock issued for placement agent of $1,086,000, and stock issued for private placement of $1,290,000.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had cash outflows of $385,686 due to proceeds from related party loan of $1,000,000 and purchase of treasury stock of\n$1,385,686.\n33\nGoing Concern\nThe Company has assessed its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has a net loss of $1,238,776 and $3,100,442 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company had an\naccumulated deficit of $23,820,946 and $22,582,170 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and negative cash flow from operating activities of\n$3,658,901 and $2,603,545 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern\nexists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the Company will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due\nwithin one year from the financial statement issuance date. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which\ncontemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company currently suffered recurring loss from operations, generated negative cash flow from operating\nactivities, has an accumulated deficit and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of\ntime. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include\nadjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of reported asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company\nbe unable to continue as a going concern. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, has also expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments, in the amount of $5,368,273. The ability to continue as a going concern is\ndependent on the Company attaining and maintaining profitable operations in the future and raising additional capital to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from\nnormal business operations when they come due. Since inception, the Company has funded its operations primarily through equity and debt financings, and it expects to\ncontinue to rely on these sources of capital in the future. In addition, before September 30, 2024, the Company has sold its land and buildings which provided additional\nworking capital to the Company. For more information on the sale of the land and buildings please see Note 5. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be\navailable or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue\nrestrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case of equity financing, or grant unfavorable terms in future\nlicensing agreements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation SK.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. We believe\nthat understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our\nfinancial statements.\n34\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and\nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOur Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other\nnew accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have conducted an evaluation\nof the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a15(e) and 15d15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of\n1934, at the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the evaluation date\nthat our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the material information required to be included in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating to our Company, particularly during the period when this report\nwas being prepared.\nOur management concluded we did not maintain effective controls over the Company’s financial reporting. The material weaknesses in our internal control over financial\nreporting, caused principally by inadequate staffing and technical expertise in key positions, resulted in overly relying on outside consultants to make numerous adjustments to\nour financial statements. Additionally, the significant deficiencies or material weaknesses could result in future material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements\nthat would not be prevented or detected. Management has concluded that the identified control deficiencies constitute a material weakness.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially\naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Controls\nDisclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving an entity's disclosure objectives. The\nlikelihood of achieving such objectives is affected by limitations inherent in disclosure controls and procedures. These include the fact that human judgment in decision-making\ncan be faulty and that breakdowns in internal control can occur because of human failures such as simple errors or mistakes or intentional circumvention of the established\nprocess.\n35\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn August 26, 2024, a former software engineer filed an action against the Company in the Superior Court for the County of San Bernardino, State of California alleging\nwrongful termination and other violations of the California Labor Code. The complaint seeks unspecified economic and non-economic losses, as well as attorneys’ fees. The\nCompany is investigating and intends to vigorously defend itself in the foregoing matters. However, litigation and investigations are inherently uncertain. The Company does\npossess EPLI insurance, and the legal team as selected by the insurance company is currently handling the matter. The Company vigorously disputes these allegations.\nITEM 1A.
