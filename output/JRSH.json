Our sportswear and outerwear product offering consists of\njackets, polo shirts, t-shirts, pants, and shorts. Our primary product offering in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 was shorts, pants, and vests, which\naccounted for approximately 49% of our total shipped pieces. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, our primary product offering was jackets, which\naccounted for approximately 35% of our total shipped pieces.\nIn response to high demand for PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we started manufacturing PPE in 2020. Our PPE product offering consists of branded\n(washable) and disposable face masks, medical scrubs, protective coveralls, and surgical gowns. In order to advance our PPE market development efforts,\nwe incorporated a new entity, Jerash The First, which received temporary permission from Jordan’s Food and Drug Administration to manufacture and\nexport non-surgical PPE. Our production facility for PPE needs to meet certain structural requirements before we can receive a permanent permission and\nwe are still planning the production facility. In September 2020, we successfully registered as a medical device manufacturing facility with the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration for the sale and export of our PPE products to the United States. We also received an ISO 13485 designation covering the\nmanufacturing, packing, and selling of medical supplies. The sale and export of PPE products did not contribute to our total revenue in the fiscal year ended\nMarch 31, 2023.\nManufacturing and Production\nOur production facilities are located in Al Tajamouat Industrial City and in Al-Hasa County in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan.\nOur production facilities in Al Tajamouat Industrial City comprise five factories and five warehouses. Effective as of January 1, 2019, the government of\nthe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan converted Al Tajamouat Industrial City into a Development Zone. Following this change, we continued to operate under\nbenefits similar to the Qualifying Industrial Zone designation, but were subject to a 10% corporate income tax plus a 1% social contribution. Starting from\nJanuary 1, 2020, the corporate income tax rate increased to 14% plus a 1% social contribution. On January 1, 2021, the corporate income tax rate increased\nto 16% plus a 1% social contribution. On January 1, 2022, the corporate income tax rate increased to 18% or 20% plus a 1% social contribution. Effective\nJanuary 1, 2023, we have been subject to a 19% or 20% corporate income tax rate plus a 1% social contribution. Currently, the first factory, which we own,\nemploys approximately 1,400 people. Its primary functions are to house our management offices, as well as production lines, trims warehouse, and\nprinting, sewing, ironing, and packaging units. The second factory, which we lease, employs approximately 1,400 people. Its primary function is to house\nour administrative and human resources personnel, merchandising and accounting departments, embroidery, printing, additional production lines, trims and\nfinished products warehouses, and sewing, ironing, packing and quality control units. The third factory, which we lease, employs approximately 200\npeople. Its primary functions are to perform the cutting for our products. The fourth factory (under Paramount), which we lease, currently employs\napproximately 1,100 people. Its primary functions are to house additional production lines. The fifth factory (under MK Garments) currently employs\napproximately 600 people. Its primary function is to manufacture garments for orders from customers.\n3\nOur production facility in Al-Hasa County in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan comprises a factory, which currently employs approximately 300 people\nand its primary functions are to manufacture garment products per customer orders. We commenced the construction of this factory in 2018 and we started\noperations in November 2019. This is a joint project with the Jordanian Ministry of Labor and the Jordanian Education and Training Department.\nAccording to our agreement with these government agencies, we used this factory without paying rent through December 2022. We have continued to use\nthe factory without paying rent since January 2023 as new arrangements with the Jordanian Ministry of Labor are still being made. See “Item 2. Properties”\nbelow for more information regarding this factory.\nIn 2015, we commenced a project to build a 4,800 square-foot workshop in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan, which was originally intended to be used as\na sewing workshop for Jerash Garments. Construction was temporarily suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was subsequently\ncompleted and ready for use as of September 30, 2021 and the building is now used as a dormitory to house management and supervisory staff who work at\nthe factory in Al-Hasa County.\nIn April 2021, we commenced a construction on a 189,000 square-foot housing facility for our multi-national workforce, situated on a 49,000 square-foot\nsite owned by us, in Al Tajamouat Industrial City. We anticipate the completion and occupancy of the new building for August 2023. To meet increasing\ndemand, we are also completing plans to construct an additional project on a nearby separate 133,000 square-foot parcel that we purchased in 2019 for $1.2\nmillion, with 2/3 of the land allocated for our seventh factory and 1/3 for housing. We have resumed our work with engineering consultants on the\narchitectural design of the building with the consideration of business growth potential bought about by the new business collaboration with Busana\nApparel Group.\nTotal annual capacity at our existing facilities was approximately 14 million pieces (average for product categories including t-shirts, polo shirts, pants,\nshorts, and jackets, and excluding PPE) as of March 31, 2023. Our production flow begins in the cutting department of our factory. Then the product is sent\nto the embroidery department for embroidery if applicable. From there, the product moves to be processed by the sewing unit, finishing department, quality\ncontrol, and finally the ironing and packing units.\nWe do not have long-term supply contracts or arrangements with our suppliers. Most of our ultimate suppliers for raw materials, such as fabric, zippers, and\nlabels, are designated by customers and we purchase such materials on a purchase order basis.\nEmployees\nAs of March 31, 2023, we had an aggregate of approximately 5,500 employees located in Jordan, Hong Kong, the People’s Republic of China, and the\nUnited States of America, all of which are full-time employees.\nCustomers\nThe following table outlines the dollar amount and percentage of total sales to our customers for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”) and\nMarch 31, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”).\nFiscal 2023 Fiscal 2022\nSales Sales\n(USD, in (USD, in\nthousands) % thousands) %\nVF Corporation(1) $ 82,661 59.9% $ 96,450 67.3%\nNew Balance 24,124 17.5% 34,506 24.1%\nJiangsu Guotai Huasheng Industrial Co (HK)., Ltd 9,454 6.8% 3,245 2.3%\nDynamic 8,175 5.9% 2,235 1.6%\nG-III 5,589 4.0% 2,758 1.9%\nClassic 1,596 1.2% - 0%\nSoriana 954 0.7% 1,487 1.0%\nOthers 5,510 4.0% 2,674 1.8%\nTotal $ 138,063 100.0% $ 143,355 100.0%\n(1) Most of our products are sold under The North Face and Timberland brands owned by VF Corporation.\n4\nIn fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, we depended on a few key customers for our sales, and most of our sales in fiscal 2023 and 2022 were to one customer, VF\nCorporation.\nWe started producing garments for VF Corporation in 2012. Most of the products we manufacture are sold under The North Face and Timberland brands\nwhich are owned by VF Corporation. Currently, we manufacture primarily outerwear for The North Face. Approximately 60% and 67% of our sales in\nfiscal 2023 and 2022 were derived from the sale of manufactured products to VF Corporation, respectively. We are not party to any long-term contracts\nwith VF Corporation or our other customers, and our sales arrangements with our customers do not have minimum purchase requirements. As is common\nin our industry, VF Corporation and our other customers place purchase orders with us after we complete detailed sample development and approval\nprocesses that we and our customers have agreed upon for their purchase of the relevant manufactured garments. It is through the sample development and\napproval processes that we and VF Corporation and our other customers agree on the purchase and manufacture of the garments. For fiscal 2023, VF\nCorporation issued approximately 10,500 purchase orders to us in amounts ranging from approximately $6 to $372,000. For fiscal 2022, VF Corporate\nissued approximately 9,500 purchase orders to us in amounts ranging from approximately $5 to $684,000.\nOur customers are in the retail industry, which is subject to substantial cyclical variations. Consequently, there can be no assurance that sales to current\ncustomers will continue at the current rate or at all. In addition, our annual and quarterly results may vary, which may cause our profits and the market price\nof our common stock to decline.\nWe continue to seek to expand and strengthen our relationship with our current customers and other brand names. However, we cannot assure you that\nthese brands will continue to buy our products in the same volumes or on the same terms as they did in the past or that we will be successful in expanding\nour relationship with other brand names.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the manufacturing of sportswear and outerwear are highly competitive. The competition in those markets is focused primarily on the price\nand quality of the product and the level of customer service. Our products compete with products of other apparel manufacturers in Asia, Israel, Europe, the\nUnited States, and South and Central America.\nCompetition with other manufacturers in the clothing industry focuses on reducing production costs, reducing supply lead time, design, product quality, and\nefficiency of supply to the customer. Since production costs depend to a large extent on labor costs, in recent years most production in the industry has been\nmoved to countries where labor costs are low. Some of our competitors have lower cost bases, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and other\nadvantages over us which allow them to compete with us. As described in more detail under “—Conditions in Jordan” below, we are able to sell our\nproducts manufactured at our facilities in Jordan to the United States free from customs duties and import quotas under certain conditions. These favorable\nterms enable us to remain competitive on the basis of price. According to the Association Agreement between the European Union (the “EU”) and Jordan,\nwhich came into force in May 2002, and the joint initiative on rules of origin reviewed and improved in December 2018 by the EU and Jordan, goods\nmanufactured by us in Jordan that are subsequently shipped to EU countries are shipped free from customs duties.\n5\nConditions in Jordan\nOur manufacturing facilities are located in Jordan. Accordingly, we are directly affected by political, security, and economic conditions in Jordan.\nFrom time to time Jordan has experienced instances of civil unrest, terrorism, and hostilities among neighboring countries, including Syria and Israel. A\npeace agreement between Israel and Jordan was signed in 1994. Terrorist attacks, military activity, rioting, or civil or political unrest in the future could\ninfluence the Jordanian economy and our operations by disrupting operations and communications and making travel within Jordan more difficult and less\ndesirable. Political or social tensions also could create a greater perception that investments in companies with Jordanian operations involve a high degree\nof risk, which could adversely affect the market and price for our common stock.\nJordan is a constitutional monarchy, but the King holds wide executive and legislative powers. The ruling family has taken initiatives that support the\neconomic growth of the country. However, there is no assurance that such initiatives will be successful or will continue. The rate of economic liberalization\ncould change, and specific laws and policies affecting manufacturing companies, foreign investments, currency exchange rates, and other matters affecting\ninvestments in Jordan could change as well.\nTrade Agreements\nBecause of the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, which came into force on December 17, 2001, and was implemented fully on January 1, 2010,\nand the Association Agreement between the EU and Jordan, which came into force in May 2002, we are able to sell our products manufactured at our\nfacilities in Jordan to the U.S. free from customs duties and import quotas under certain conditions and to EU countries free from customs duties.\nIncome Tax Incentives\nEffective January 1, 2019, Jordan’s government converted the geographical area where Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries are located from a Free Zone to\na Development Zone. Development Zones are industrial parks that house manufacturing operations in Jordan. In accordance with applicable law, Jerash\nGarments and its subsidiaries began paying corporate income tax in Jordan at a rate of 10% plus 1% social contribution. Starting from January 1, 2020, the\ncorporate income tax rate in Jordan increased to 14% plus 1% social contribution. Effective January 1, 2021, this rate increased to 16% plus 1% social\ncontribution. On January 1, 2022, this rate further increased to 18% or 20% plus 1% social contribution. On January 1, 2023, this rate further increased to\n19% or 20% plus a 1% social contribution. For more information, see “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Income and Sales Taxes.”\nIn addition, Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries are subject to local sales tax of 16%. However, Jerash Garments was granted a sales tax exemption from\nthe Jordanian Investment Commission for the period June 1, 2015 to June 1, 2018 that allowed Jerash Garments to make purchases with no sales tax\ncharge. This exemption was extended to February 5, 2024.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur manufacturing and other facilities in Jordan and our subsidiaries outside of Jordan are subject to various local regulations relating to the maintenance\nof safe working conditions and manufacturing practices. Management believes that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with all such\nregulations. We are not subject to governmental approval of our products or manufacturing process.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following are factors that could have a significant impact on our operations and financial results and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ\nmaterially from those discussed in any forward-looking statements.\n6\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe rely on one key customer for most of our revenue. We cannot assure you that this customer or any other customer will continue to buy our products\nin the same volumes or on the same terms.\nOur sales to VF Corporation (which owns brands such as The North Face, Timberland, and Vans), directly and indirectly, accounted for approximately 60%\nand 67% of our total sales in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. From an accounting perspective, we are considered the principal in our arrangement\nwith VF Corporation. We bear the inventory risk before the specified goods are transferred to a customer, and we have the right to determine the price and\nto change our product during the sample development process with customers in which we determine factors including material usage and manufacturing\ncosts before confirming orders. Therefore, we present the sales and related manufacturing activities on a gross basis.\nWe are not party to any long-term contracts with VF Corporation or our other customers, and our sales arrangements with our customers do not have\nminimum purchase requirements. As is common in our industry, VF Corporation and our other customers place purchase orders with us after we complete\ndetailed sample development and approval processes. It is through these sample development and approval processes that we and VF Corporation agree on\nthe purchase and manufacture of the garments in question. From April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022, VF Corporation issued approximately 9,500 purchase\norders to us in amounts ranging from approximately $5 to $684,000. From April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023, VF Corporation issued approximately 10,500\npurchase orders to us in amounts ranging from approximately $6 to $372,000.\nWe cannot assure you that our customers will continue to buy our products at all or in the same volumes or on the same terms as they have in the past. The\nfailure of VF Corporation to continue to buy our products in the same volumes and on the same terms as in the past may significantly reduce our sales and\nour earnings.\nA material decrease in the quantity of sales made to our principal customers, a material adverse change in the terms of such sales or a material adverse\nchange in the financial condition of our principal customers could significantly reduce our sales and our earnings.\nWe cannot assure you that VF Corporation will continue to purchase our merchandise at the same historical rate, or at all, in the future, or that we will be\nable to attract new customers. In addition, because of our reliance on VF Corporation as our key customer and their bargaining power with us, VF\nCorporation has the ability to exert significant control over our business decisions, including prices.\nAny adverse change in our relationship with VF Corporation and its The North Face and Timberland brands, or with their strategies or reputation,\nwould have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nMost of our products are sold under The North Face and Timberland brands, which are owned by VF Corporation. Any adverse change in our relationship\nwith VF Corporation would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our sales of those products could be materially and\nadversely affected if the image, reputation, or popularity of either VF Corporation, The North Face, or Timberland were to be negatively impacted.\nIf we lose our key customer and are unable to attract new customers, then our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be\nadversely affected.\nIf our key customer, VF Corporation, fails to purchase our merchandise at the same historical rate, or at all, we will need to attract new customers and we\ncannot assure you that we will be able to do so. We do not currently invest significant resources in marketing our products, and we cannot assure you that\nany new investments in sales and marketing will lead to the acquisition of additional customers or increased sales or profitability consistent with prior\nperiods. If we are unable to attract new customers or customers that generate comparable profit margins to VF Corporation, then our results of operations\nand financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we lose our larger brand name customers, or the customers fail to purchase our products at anticipated levels, our sales and operating results will be\nadversely affected.\nOur results of operations depend to a significant extent upon the commercial success of our larger brand name customers. If we lose these customers, these\ncustomers fail to purchase our products at anticipated levels, or our relationships with these customers or the brands and retailers they serve diminishes, it\nmay have an adverse effect on our results and we may lose a primary source of revenue. In addition, we may not be able to recoup development and\ninventory costs associated with these customers and we may not be able to collect our receivables from them, which would negatively impact our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n7\nIf the market share of our customers declines, our sales and earnings may decline.\nOur sales can be adversely affected in the event that our direct and indirect customers do not successfully compete in the markets in which they operate. In\nthe event that the sales of one of our major customers decline for any reason, regardless of whether it is related to us or to our products, our sales to that\ncustomer may also decline, which could reduce our overall sales and our earnings.\nOur financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in fiscal 2020 and 2021 were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China. Less than four months later, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization\ndeclared COVID-19 a pandemic—the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. The outbreak has reached more than 160 countries, including Jordan and the\nUnited States, resulting in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines, and travel bans, intended\nto control the spread of the virus. On March 17, 2020, the country of Jordan announced a shutdown of non-essential activities as part of its proactive\nnational efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19. On April 4, 2020, we resumed operations of our main production facilities in Al Tajamouat Industrial City\nunder the condition that only migrant workers, living in dormitories in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, were allowed to go to work in the factories under strict\nhygienic precautionary measures, pursuant to an approval from the Jordanian government dated April 1, 2020. Our Al-Hasa factory was also allowed to\nrestart operation on April 26, 2020. Eventually, local employees were also allowed to resume work starting June 1, 2020.\nOwing to the national shutdown in Jordan between March 18 and March 31, 2020, the shipment of approximately $1.6 million of our orders which were\nscheduled to be shipped by March 31, 2020, the end of fiscal 2020, was postponed. We shipped these orders in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. There was\nalso loss of productivity in the shutdown period which negatively impacted our first quarter and full year profitability in fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022, our\nproduction facilities resumed full operation with additional medical and hygienic measures in place. The COVID-19 pandemic did not materially adversely\naffect our business operations and condition and operating results for fiscal 2023. The Company currently expects that its operation results for the fiscal\nyear ending March 31, 2024 would not be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is still significant uncertainty around the\nbreadth and duration of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its impact on the U.S. and international economies. Given the\ndynamic nature of these circumstances, should there be resurgence of COVID-19 cases globally and should the U.S. government or the Jordan government\nimplement new restrictions to contain the spread, the Company’s business would be negatively impacted.\nWe may require additional financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures.\nAs of March 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $17.8 million and restricted cash of approximately $1.6 million. There can be no\nassurance that our available cash, together with resources from our operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures. In\naddition, our cash position may decline in the future, and we may not be successful in maintaining an adequate level of cash resources.\nPursuant to a facility letter (the “SCBHK facility”) dated June 15, 2018 issued to Treasure Success by Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited\n(“SCBHK”), SCBHK offered to provide an import facility of up to $3,000,000 to Treasure Success. The SCBHK facility covers import invoice financing\nand pre-shipment financing under export orders with a combined limit of $3,000,000. SCBHK charges interest at 1.3% per annum over SCBHK’s cost of\nfunds. In consideration for arranging the SCBHK facility, Treasure Success paid SCBHK HKD50,000. We were informed by SCBHK on January 31, 2019\nthat the SCBHK facility had been activated. As of March 31, 2022, there was no outstanding amount under the SCBHK facility. In June 2022, we were\ninformed by SCBHK that the facility was cancelled due to persistently low usage and zero loan outstanding.\n8\nPursuant to the DBS facility letter dated January 12, 2022, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited (“DBSHK”) provided a bank facility of up to $5.0 million to\nTreasure Success. Pursuant to the agreement, DBSHK agreed to finance cargo receipt, trust receipt, account payable financing, and certain type of import\ninvoice financing up to an aggregate of $5.0 million. The DBSHK facility bears interest at 1.5% per annum over Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate\n(“HIBOR”) for HKD bills and 1.3% per annum over DBSHK’s cost of funds for foreign currency bills. The facility is guaranteed by Jerash Holdings and\nbecame available to the Company on June 17, 2022.\nIn addition, we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing in order to support our growing operations. We may not be able to obtain\nadditional financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, and any new equity financing could have a substantial dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. If we\ncannot obtain additional financing, we may not be able to achieve our desired sales growth, and our results of operations would be negatively affected.\nWe may have conflicts of interest with our affiliates and related parties, and in the past we have engaged in transactions and entered into agreements\nwith affiliates that were not negotiated at arms’ length.\nWe have engaged, and may in the future engage, in transactions with affiliates and other related parties. These transactions may not have been, and may not\nbe, on terms as favorable to us as they could have been if obtained from non-affiliated persons. While an effort has been made and will continue to be made\nto obtain services from affiliated persons and other related parties at rates and on terms as favorable as would be charged by others, there will always be an\ninherent conflict of interest between our interests and those of our affiliates and related parties. Through his wholly owned entity Merlotte Enterprise\nLimited, Mr. Choi, our chairman, chief executive officer, president, treasurer, and a significant stockholder, has an indirect ownership interest in Jiangmen\nV-Apparel Manufacturing Limited, with which we have entered into, or in the future may enter into, agreements or arrangements. See also “Note 11—\nRelated Party Transactions.” If we engage in related party transactions on unfavorable terms, our operating results will be negatively impacted.\nWe are dependent on a product segment comprised of a limited number of products.\nPresently, we generate revenue primarily from manufacturing and exporting sportswear and outerwear. A shift in demand from such products may reduce\nthe growth of new business for our products, and reduce existing business in those products. If demand in sportswear and outerwear were to decline, we\nmay endeavor to expand or transition our product offerings to other segments of the clothing retail industry. There can be no assurance that we would be\nable to successfully make such an expansion or transition, or that our sales and margins would not decline in the event we made such an expansion or\ntransition.\nOur revenue and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue is received during the first six months of our fiscal year, or from April through September. A majority of our VF\nCorporation orders are derived from winter season fashions, the sales of which occur in the spring and summer and are merchandized by VF Corporation\nduring the autumn months (September through November). As such, the second half of our fiscal year reflect lower sales in anticipation of the spring and\nsummer seasons. In addition, due to the nature of our relationships with customers and our use of purchase orders to conduct our business, our revenue may\nvary from period to period.\nChanges in our product mix and the geographic destination of our products or source of our supplies may impact our cost of goods sold, net income,\nand financial position.\nFrom time to time, we experience changes in the product mix and the geographic destination of our products. To the extent our product mix shifts from\nhigher revenue items, such as jackets, to lower revenue items, such as pants, our cost of goods sold as a percentage of gross revenue will likely increase. In\naddition, if we sell a higher proportion of products in geographic regions where we do not benefit from free trade agreements or tax exemptions, our gross\nmargins will fall. If we are unable to sustain consistent product mix and geographic destinations for our products, we could experience negative impacts to\nour financial condition and results of operations.\n9\nOur direct and indirect customers are in the clothing retail industry, which is subject to substantial cyclical variations and could have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur direct and indirect customers are in the clothing retail industry, which is subject to substantial cyclical variations and is strongly affected by any\ndownturn or slowdown in the general economy. Factors in the clothing retail industry that may influence our operating results from quarter to quarter\ninclude:\n● the volume and timing of customer orders we receive during the quarter;\n● the timing and magnitude of our customers’ marketing campaigns;\n● the loss or addition of a major customer or of a major retailer nomination;\n● the availability and pricing of materials for our products;\n● the increased expenses incurred in connection with introducing new products;\n● currency fluctuations;\n● political factors that may affect the expected flow of commerce; and\n● delays caused by third parties.\nIn addition, uncertainty over future economic prospects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Many factors affect the level of\nconsumer spending in the clothing retail industry, including, among others:\n● general business conditions;\n● interest rates;\n● the availability of consumer credit;\n● taxation; and\n● consumer confidence in future economic conditions.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, may decline during recessionary periods and also may decline at other times when\ndisposable income is lower. Consequently, our customers may have larger inventories of our products than expected, and to compensate for any downturn\nthey may reduce the size of their orders, change the payment terms, limit their purchases to a lower price range, and try to change their purchase terms, all\nof which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe clothing retail industry is subject to changes in fashion preferences. If our customers misjudge a fashion trend or the price which consumers are\nwilling to pay for our products decreases, our revenue could be adversely affected.\nThe clothing retail industry is subject to changes in fashion preferences. We design and manufacture products based on our customers’ judgment as to what\nproducts will appeal to consumers and what price consumers would be willing to pay for our products. Our customers may not be successful in accurately\nanticipating consumer preferences and the prices that consumers would be willing to pay for our products. Our revenue will be reduced if our customers are\nnot successful, particularly if our customers reduce the volume of their purchases from us or require us to reduce the prices at which we sell our products.\n10\nIf we experience product quality or late delivery problems, or if we experience financial problems, our business will be negatively affected.\nWe may from time to time experience difficulties in making timely delivery of products of acceptable quality. Such difficulties may result in cancellation of\norders, customer refusal to accept deliveries, or reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nand results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties with manufacturing our products.\nWe face intense competition in the worldwide apparel manufacturing industry.\nWe compete directly with a number of manufacturers of sportswear and outerwear. Some of these manufacturers have lower cost bases, longer operating\nhistories, larger customer bases, greater geographical proximity to customers, or greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Increased\ncompetition, direct or indirect, could reduce our revenue and profitability through pricing pressure, loss of market share, and other factors. We cannot\nassure you that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors, as the market for our products evolves and the level of\ncompetition increases. We believe that our business will depend upon our ability to provide apparel products of good quality and meeting our customers’\npricing and delivery requirements, and our ability to maintain relationships with our major customers. There can be no assurance that we will be successful\nin this regard.\nWe may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses.\nOur growth and profitability could be adversely affected if we acquire businesses or assets of other businesses and are unable to integrate the business or\nassets into our current business. To grow effectively, we must find acquisition candidates that meet our criteria and successfully integrate the acquired\nbusiness into ours. If acquired businesses do not achieve expected levels of production or profitability, we are unable to integrate the business or assets into\nour business, or we are unable to adequately manage our growth following the acquisition, our results of operations and financial condition would be\nadversely affected.\nOur results of operations are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nExchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and Jordanian Dinar (“JOD”), Hong Kong dollar, or Chinese Yuan (“CNY”), as well as inflation in\nJordan, Hong Kong, or the PRC, may negatively affect our earnings. A substantial majority of our revenue and a substantial portion of our expenses are\ndenominated in U.S. dollars. However, a significant portion of the expenses associated with our Jordanian, Hong Kong, or PRC operations, including\npersonnel and facilities-related expenses, are incurred in JOD, Hong Kong dollars, or CNY, respectively. Consequently, inflation in Jordan, Hong Kong, or\nthe PRC will have the effect of increasing the dollar cost of our operations in Jordan, Hong Kong, or the PRC, respectively, unless it is offset on a timely\nbasis by a devaluation of JOD, Hong Kong dollar, or CNY, as applicable, relative to the U.S. dollar. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of\ninflation in Jordan, Hong Kong, or the PRC or the rate of devaluation of JOD, Hong Kong dollar, or CNY, as applicable, against the U.S. dollar. In addition,\nwe are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in the value of JOD, Hong Kong dollar, and CNY vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. There can be no assurance that JOD or\nHong Kong dollar will remain effectively pegged to the U.S. dollar. Any significant appreciation of JOD, Hong Kong dollar, or CNY against the U.S. dollar\nwould cause an increase in our JOD, Hong Kong dollar, or CNY expenses, as applicable, as recorded in our U.S. dollar denominated financial reports, even\nthough the expenses denominated in JOD, Hong Kong dollars, or CNY, as applicable, will remain unchanged. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates in countries other than Jordan where we operate and do business may also negatively affect our earnings.\nWe are subject to the risks of doing business abroad.\nAll of our products are manufactured outside the United States, at our subsidiaries’ production facilities in Jordan. Foreign manufacturing is subject to a\nnumber of risks, including work stoppages, transportation delays and interruptions, political instability, foreign currency fluctuations, economic disruptions,\nexpropriation, nationalization, the imposition of tariffs and import and export controls, changes in governmental policies (including U.S. policies towards\nJordan), and other factors, which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may be subject to risks associated with the availability of\nand time required for the transportation of products from foreign countries. The occurrence of certain of these factors may delay or prevent the delivery of\ngoods ordered by customers, and such delay or inability to meet delivery requirements would have a severe adverse impact on our results of operations and\ncould have an adverse effect on our relationships with our customers.\n11\nOur ability to benefit from the lower labor costs in Jordan will depend on the political, social, and economic stability of Jordan and in the Middle East in\ngeneral. We cannot assure you that the political, economic, or social situation in Jordan or in the Middle East in general will not have a material adverse\neffect on our operations, especially in light of the potential for hostilities in the Middle East. The success of the production facilities also will depend on the\nquality of the workmanship of laborers and our ability to maintain good relations with such laborers in these countries. We cannot guarantee that our\noperations in Jordan or any new locations outside of Jordan will be cost-efficient or successful.\nOur business could suffer if we violate labor laws or fail to conform to generally accepted labor standards or the ethical standards of our customers.\nWe are subject to labor laws issued by the Jordanian Ministry of Labor for our facilities in Jordan. In addition, many of our customers require their\nmanufacturing suppliers to meet their standards for working conditions and other matters. If we violate applicable labor laws or generally accepted labor\nstandards or the ethical standards of our customers by, for example, using forced or indentured labor or child labor, failing to pay compensation in\naccordance with local law, failing to operate our factories in compliance with local safety regulations, or diverging from other labor practices generally\naccepted as ethical, we could suffer a loss of sales or customers. In addition, such actions could result in negative publicity and may damage our reputation\nand discourage retail customers and consumers from buying our products.\nOur products may not comply with various industry and governmental regulations and our customers may incur losses in their products or operations\nas a consequence of our non-compliance.\nOur products are produced under strict supervision and controls to ensure that all materials and manufacturing processes comply with the industry and\ngovernmental regulations governing the markets in which these products are sold. However, if our controls fail to detect or prevent non-compliant materials\nfrom entering the manufacturing process, our products could cause damages to our customers’ products or processes and could also result in fines being\nincurred. The possible damages, replacement costs, and fines could significantly exceed the value of our products and these risks may not be covered by\nour insurance policies.\nWe depend on our suppliers for machinery and maintenance of machinery. We may experience delays or additional costs satisfying our production\nrequirements due to our reliance on these suppliers.\nWe purchase machinery and equipment used in our manufacturing process from third-party suppliers. If our suppliers are not able to provide us with\nmaintenance or additional machinery or equipment as needed, we might not be able to maintain or increase our production to meet any demand for our\nproducts, which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a holding company and rely on dividends, distributions, and other payments, advances, and transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our\nobligations.\nWe are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, we rely on cash dividends and distributions and other\ntransfers from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations. The deterioration of income from, or other available assets of, our operating subsidiaries\nfor any reason could limit or impair their ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nPeriods of sustained economic adversity and uncertainty could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDisruptions in the financial markets, such as what occurred in the global markets in 2008, may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit for our\ncustomers and prospective customers, which could result in the delay or cancellation of customer purchases. In addition, disruptions in the financial\nmarkets may have an adverse impact on regional and world economies and credit markets, which could negatively impact the availability and cost of\ncapital for us and our customers. These conditions may reduce the willingness or ability of our customers and prospective customers to commit funds to\npurchase our services or products, or their ability to pay for our services after purchase. These conditions could result in bankruptcy or insolvency for some\ncustomers, which would impact our revenue and cash collections. These conditions could also result in pricing pressure and less favorable financial terms\nto us and our ability to access capital to fund our operations.\n12\nRisks Related to Operations in Jordan\nWe are affected by conditions to, and possible reduction of, free trade agreements.\nBecause of the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement and the Association Agreement between the EU and Jordan, we are able to sell our products\nmanufactured at our facilities in Jordan to the U.S. free from customs duties and import quotas under certain conditions and to EU countries free from\ncustoms duties. If there is a change in such benefits or if any such agreements were terminated, our profitability may be reduced.\nFormer President Donald Trump expressed antipathy towards trade agreements, and took a starkly protectionist approach that included withdrawal and\nrenegotiation of trade agreements and trade wars with China and U.S. allies alike. President Joe Biden has expressed no desire to withdraw from existing\nagreements, presumably indicating that his policy will be less protectionist than former President Donald Trump’s. On the other hand, President Biden’s\nBuy American plan will make it harder for foreign manufacturers to sell goods in the U.S. and his insistence on strong labor provisions in trade agreements\nwill likely prevent them from being implemented or protect U.S. industries when they are. It remains unclear what specifically President Biden would or\nwould not do with respect to trade agreements, tariffs, and duties relating to products manufactured in Jordan. If President Biden takes action or publicly\nspeaks out about the need to terminate or re-negotiate existing free trade agreements on which we rely, or in favor of restricting free trade or increasing\ntariffs and duties applicable to our products, such actions may adversely affect our sales and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations, and cash flows.\nOur results of operations would be materially and adversely affected in the event we are unable to operate our principal production facilities in Jordan.\nAll of our manufacturing process is performed in a complex of production facilities located in Jordan. We have no effective back-up for these operations\nand, in the event that we are unable to use the production facilities located in Jordan as a result of damage or for any other reason, our ability to\nmanufacture a major portion of our products and our relationships with customers could be significantly impaired, which would materially and adversely\naffect our results of operation.\nOur operations in Jordan may be adversely affected by social and political uncertainties or change, military activity, health-related risks, or acts of\nterrorism.\nFrom time to time, Jordan has experienced instances of civil unrest, terrorism, and hostilities among neighboring countries, including Syria and Israel. A\npeace agreement between Israel and Jordan was signed in 1994. Terrorist attacks, military activity, rioting, or civil or political unrest in the future could\ninfluence the Jordanian economy and our operations by disrupting operations and communications and making travel within Jordan more difficult and less\ndesirable. In late May 2018, protests about a proposed tax bill began throughout Jordan. On June 5, 2018, King Abdullah II of Jordan responded to the\nprotests by removing and replacing Jordan’s prime minister. If political uncertainty rises in Jordan, our business, financial condition, results of operations,\nand cash flows may be negatively impacted.\nPolitical or social tensions also could create a greater perception that investments in companies with Jordanian operations involve a high degree of risk,\nwhich could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks,\nmilitary conflicts, and wars, which could subject us to significant financial losses. The realization of any of these risks could cause a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n13\nWe may face interruption of production and services due to increased security measures in response to terrorism.\nOur business depends on the free flow of products and services through the channels of commerce. In response to terrorists’ activities and threats aimed at\nthe United States, transportation, mail, financial, and other services may be slowed or stopped altogether. Extensive delays or stoppages in transportation,\nmail, financial, or other services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, we may\nexperience an increase in operating costs, such as costs for transportation, insurance, and security as a result of the activities and potential delays. We may\nalso experience delays in receiving payments from payors that have been affected by the terrorist activities. The United States economy in general may be\nadversely affected by terrorist activities and any economic downturn could adversely impact our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital, or\notherwise adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nWe are subject to regulatory and political uncertainties in Jordan.\nWe conduct substantially all of our business and operations in Jordan. Consequently, government policies and regulations, including tax policies, in Jordan\nwill impact our financial performance and the market price of our common stock.\nJordan is a constitutional monarchy, but the King holds wide executive and legislative powers. The ruling family has taken initiatives that support the\neconomic growth of the country. However, there is no assurance that such initiatives will be successful or will continue. The rate of economic liberalization\ncould change, and specific laws and policies affecting manufacturing companies, foreign investments, currency exchange rates, and other matters affecting\ninvestments in Jordan could change as well. A significant change in Jordan’s economic policy or any social or political uncertainties that impact economic\npolicy in Jordan could adversely affect business and economic conditions in Jordan generally and our business and prospects.\nIf we violate applicable anti-corruption laws or our internal policies designed to ensure ethical business practices, we could face financial penalties and\nreputational harm that would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in the United States and Jordan. Jordan’s reputation for potential corruption and the challenges\npresented by Jordan’s complex business environment, including high levels of bureaucracy, red tape, and vague regulations, may increase our risk of\nviolating applicable anti-corruption laws. We face the risk that we, our employees, or any third parties such as our sales agents and distributors that we\nengage to do work on our behalf may take action determined to be in violation of anti-corruption laws in any jurisdiction in which we conduct business,\nincluding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”). Any violation of the FCPA or any similar anti-corruption law or regulation could result\nin substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, and curtailment of operations that might harm our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations.\nOur stockholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests and exercising their rights as a stockholder of ours because we conduct substantially\nall of our operations in Jordan and certain of our officers and directors reside outside of the United States.\nCertain of our officers and directors reside outside the United States. Therefore, our stockholders may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal\nprocess, enforcing foreign judgments, or bringing original actions in any of these jurisdictions based upon U.S. laws, including the federal securities laws\nor other foreign laws against us, our officers, and directors. Furthermore, we conduct substantially all of our operations in Jordan through our operating\nsubsidiaries. Because the majority of our assets are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against us or certain of\nour directors and officers may not be collectible within the United States.\n14\nRisk Factors Relating to our Securities\nIf we fail to comply with the continuing listing standards of the Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted from the exchange.\nIf we were unable to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), our common stock could be delisted from the\nNasdaq. Any such delisting of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our\ncommon stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions\nand less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, being\ndelisted from Nasdaq could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of\nour stockholders and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may issue additional securities in the future. Pursuant to our amended and restated 2018 Stock Incentive Plan, we may issue up to 1,784,250 shares of\ncommon stock to certain members of our management and key employees.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We\nmay sell common stock, convertible securities, and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from\ntime to time. If we sell any such securities, our stockholders may be materially diluted. New investors in any future transactions could gain rights,\npreferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common\nstock, our stock price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our industry,\nand our market. If no analyst elects to cover us and publish research or reports about us, the market for our common stock could be severely limited and our\nstock price could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose\nvisibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If one or more analysts who elect to cover us\nissue negative reports or adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline.\n15\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”) and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), may strain our resources, increase\nour costs, and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nWe are required to comply with the laws, regulations, requirements, and certain corporate governance provisions under the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act. Complying with these statutes, regulations, and requirements occupies a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management,\nsignificantly increases our costs and expenses, and makes some activities more time-consuming and costly. As a reporting company, we are:\n● instituting a more comprehensive compliance function;\n● preparing and distributing periodic and current reports under the federal securities laws;\n● establishing and enforcing internal compliance policies, such as those related to insider trading; and\n● involving and retaining outside counsel and accountants to a greater degree than before we became a reporting company.\nOur ongoing compliance efforts will increase general and administrative expenses and may divert management’s time and attention from the development\nof our business, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the course of the audit of our consolidated financial statements, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial\nreporting. If we are unable to effectively implement and maintain our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud may be adversely affected, and investor confidence and the\nmarket price of our common stock may be adversely impacted.\nWe have been required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act beginning with the annual\nreport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. The process of designing and implementing internal controls over financial reporting may\ndivert our internal resources and take a significant amount of time and expense to complete.\nIn connection with the preparation and external audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, we identified\ncertain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and have formulated plans for remedial measures. See “Item 9A. Controls and\nProcedures.” Measures that we implement may not fully address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and we may not be\nable to conclude that the material weaknesses have been fully remedied.\nFailure to correct the material weaknesses and other control deficiencies or failure to discover and address any other control deficiencies could result in\ninaccuracies in our consolidated financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and make\nrelated regulatory filings on a timely basis. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, as well as the trading price of\nour common stock, may be materially and adversely affected. Due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described\nabove, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2023. This could adversely affect the\nmarket price of our common stock due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our reporting processes.\nThe reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors, which may\nlead to volatility and a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from reporting requirements that apply to other\npublic companies that are not emerging growth companies. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions,\nwhich include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure\nobligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-\nbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If investors find\nour common stock less attractive as a result of exemptions and reduced disclosure requirements, there may be a less active trading market for our common\nstock and our stock price may be more volatile or may decrease.\nWe are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty and capital market disruption, which has been significantly impacted by geopolitical\ninstability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nmaterially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy and capital markets resulting from the conflict in Ukraine or any other\ngeopolitical tensions.\nU.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the start of the military conflict\nbetween Russia and Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops was reported. Although the length and\nimpact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in\ncommodity prices, credit and capital markets, and supply chain interruptions.\n16\nThe military conflict in Ukraine has led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union, and other countries against\nRussia. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could\nadversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets, potentially making it more\ndifficult for us to obtain additional funds. In addition, in managing an organization operating globally, we are subject to the risks and challenges related to\nthe potential to subject our business to materially adverse consequences should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other\npotential impacts, the geographic proximity of the situation relative to the Middle East, where a material portion of our business is conducted.\nAlthough our business has not been materially impacted by the ongoing military conflict between Russian and Ukraine to date, it is impossible to predict\nthe extent to which our operations, or those of our suppliers and manufacturers, will be impacted in the short and long term, or the ways in which the\nconflict may impact our business. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions, and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but\ncould be substantial. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this annual report.\nWe may be adversely affected by the effects of inflation and a potential recession.\nInflation has the potential to adversely affect our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure,\nparticularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has\nresulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates and capital costs, shipping costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor, weakening\nexchange rates, and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience, cost increases. In addition, poor\neconomic and market conditions, including a potential recession, may negatively impact market sentiment, decreasing the demand for sportswear and\nouterwear, which would adversely affect our operating income and results of operations. If we are unable to take effective measures in a timely manner to\nmitigate the impact of the inflation as well as a potential recession, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem 2. Properties.\nJerash Garments owns an industrial building of approximately 89,300 square feet and two pieces of land totaling approximately 181,000 square feet in Al\nTajamouat Industrial City. We lease additional space totaling approximately 448,000 square feet in industrial buildings in Al Tajamouat Industrial City. In\naddition, we lease space for our workers in dormitories located inside and outside of Al Tajamouat Industrial City.\nTreasure Success leased its office space in Hong Kong from Ever Winland pursuant to a tenancy agreement dated February 26, 2021. The tenancy\nagreement had a term from February 26, 2021 to February 25, 2023, with a rent in the amount of HK$119,540 (approximately $15,326) per month. On\nAugust 29, 2022, Ever Winland became a subsidiary of Treasure Success. See “—Item 1. Business—Organizational Structure.”\nIn 2015, we commenced a project to build a 4,800 square-foot workshop in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan, which was previously intended to be used as\na sewing workshop for Jerash Garments, but which we now use as a dormitory to house management and supervisory staff who work at the factory in Al-\nHasa County as discussed below. Construction was temporarily suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but subsequently completed and\nready for use as of September 30, 2021.\nIn 2018, we commenced another project to build a 54,000 square-foot factory in Al-Hasa County in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan, which started\noperation in November 2019. This project is a joint project with the Jordanian Ministry of Labor and the Employment and Training Department in Jordan.\nPursuant to the agreement between these parties and us, we guaranteed up to JOD112,500 (approximately $159,000) for this project and agreed to employ\nat least 500 workers for the first 12 months following the completion of the project, which requirement we have complied with. The Ministry of Labor\nfinanced the building of the factory and the Employment and Training Department supported 50% of the workers’ salaries, as well as transportation and\nsocial security costs in the first 12 months following the completion of the project. We used the factory without paying rent through December 2022. We\nhave continued to use the factory without paying rent since January 2023 as new arrangements with the Jordanian Ministry of Labor are still being made.\n17\nIn April 2021, we commenced construction on a 189,000 square-foot housing facility for our multi-national workforce, situated on a 49,000 square-foot site\nowned by us, located in Al Tajamouat Industrial City. We anticipate the completion of the construction and the subsequent occupancy of the new building\nby August 2023. To meet increasing demand, we were also finalizing plans to construct an additional project on a nearby separate 133,000 square-foot\nparcel that we purchased in 2019 for $1.2 million, with 2/3 of the land allocated for the establishment of our seventh factory and 1/3 for housing purposes.\nWe have resumed to work with engineering consultants to proceed with the architectural design of these buildings.\nOn July 1, 2020, Jiangmen Treasure Success and Jiangmen V-Apparel Manufacturing Limited entered into a factory lease agreement, which was a\nreplacement of a previous lease agreement dated August 31, 2019. The new lease has a one-year term with monthly rent amount of CNY28,300\n(approximately $4,100) for additional office space and sample production purposes. On April 30, 2021, the factory lease agreement between Jiangmen\nTreasure Success and Jiangmen V-apparel Manufacturing Limited was terminated.\nOn January 1, 2021, Jiangmen Treasure Success entered a factory lease agreement with an independent third party. The lease has a five-year term with\nmonthly rent amount of CNY50,245 (approximately $7,300) for the first year, CNY60,270 (approximately $8,800) for the second year, and 5% further\nannual increments starting from the third year.\nOn June 24, 2021, we entered into an agreement through Jerash Garments to acquire all of the stock of an existing garment manufacturing business in order\nto operate our fifth manufacturing facility in Al Tajamouat Industrial City located in Amman, Jordan. This acquisition increased Jerash’s annual capacity\nfrom 12 million pieces to 14 million pieces. The new facilities are an existing garment manufacturing operation adjacent to Jerash’s four largest\nmanufacturing centers. Jerash assumed ownership of all of the machinery and equipment owned by MK Garments through the acquisition.\nOn July 14, 2021, Jerash Garments and the sole shareholder of Kawkab Venus entered into an agreement, pursuant to which Jerash Garments acquired all\nof the outstanding stock of Kawkab Venus. Apart from the land and factory premises, Kawkab Venus had no other significant assets or liabilities and no\noperation activities or employees at the time of acquisition, so the acquisition was accounted for an asset acquisition. As of August 21, 2022, Kawkab\nVenus became a subsidiary of Jerash Garments.\nWe believe the real property that we own and lease is sufficient to conduct our operations as they are currently conducted.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings. From time-to-time we are, and we anticipate that we will be, involved in legal\nproceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business and otherwise. The ultimate costs to resolve any such matters could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial statements. We could be forced to incur material expenses with respect to these legal proceedings, and in the event\nthat there is an outcome in any that is adverse to us, our financial position and prospects could be harmed.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\n18\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nOur common stock has been traded and quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “JRSH” since May 4, 2018. Before that, our stock was not\ntraded on any stock exchange. As of June 27, 2023, there were 12,294,840 shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by approximately 41\nstockholders of record.\nSince November 2018, the Board of Directors of Jerash Holdings has declared a quarterly cash dividend payable to holders of its common stock. Subject to\nthe discretion of the Board of Directors and applicable law, we currently expect to continue declaring comparable quarterly cash dividends in the future.\nFor information on securities authorized for issuance under our existing equity compensation plan, see Item 12 under the heading “Security Ownership of\nCertain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.”\nOn June 13, 2022, the Board of Directors of Jerash Holdings authorized a share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase up to $3.0\nmillion of its outstanding shares of common stock. The share repurchase program expired on March 31, 2023.\nTotal share repurchases under the share repurchase program for the three months ended March 31, 2023 are as follows:\nApproximate\nTotal number dollar value of\nof shares shares still\npurchased as available to be\npart of the purchased\nTotal number Average publicly under the\nof shares price paid announced program\nPeriod purchased per share program (in millions)\n01/01/2023 - 01/31/2023 - - 156,593 2.2\n02/01/2023 - 02/28/2023 29,270 4.74 185,863 2.1\n03/01/2023 - 03/31/2023 53,615 4.82 239,478 0\nTotal 82,885 4.79 239,478 0\nDuring the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have sales of unregistered securities other than those already disclosed in the quarterly\nreports on Form 10-Q in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 and current reports on Form 8-K.\nItem 6. [Reserved].\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and\nthe related notes included elsewhere in this filing.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nSeasonality of Sales\nA significant portion of our revenue is received during the first six months of our fiscal year. The majority of our VF Corporation orders are derived from\nwinter season fashions, the sales of which occur in Spring and Summer and are merchandized by VF Corporation during the months of September through\nNovember. As such, the second half of our fiscal years reflect lower sales in anticipation of the spring and summer seasons. One of our strategies is to\nincrease sales with other customers where clothing lines are stronger during the spring months. This strategy also reflects our current plan to increase our\nnumber of customers to mitigate our current concentration risk with VF Corporation.\n19\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents certain information from our statements of income and comprehensive income for fiscal 2023 and 2022 and should be read,\nalong with all of the information in this management’s discussion and analysis, in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes\nincluded elsewhere in this filing.\n(All amounts, other than percentages, in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nFiscal Years Ended March 31,\n2023 2022\nAs % of As % of Year over Year\nStatement of Income Data: Amount Sales Amount Sales Amount %\nRevenue $ 138,063 100% $ 143,355 100% $ (5,292) (4)%\nCost of goods sold 116,273 84% 116,023 81% 250 -%\nGross profit 21,790 16% 27,332 19% (5,542) (20)%\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 17,375 13% 16,843 12% 532 3%\nOther expenses, net (331) 0% (45) 0% (286) 636%\nNet income before taxation $ 4,084 3% $ 10,444 7% $ (6,360) (61)%\nIncome tax expense 1,664 1% 2,524 2% (860) (34)%\nNet income $ 2,420 2% $ 7,920 5% $ (5,500) (69)%\nRevenue. Revenue decreased by approximately $5.3 million, or 4%, to approximately $138.1 million in fiscal 2023 from approximately $143.4 million in\nfiscal 2022. This slight decrease was mainly due to a decline in export sales to two major U.S. customers. Despite receiving orders from new customers and\nobserving an increase in shipments to other existing customers, these efforts were not enough to offset the shortfall in sales.\nThe following table outlines the dollar amount and percentage of total sales to our customers for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n(All amounts, other than percentages, in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nFiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2023 2022\nSales Sales\nAmount % Amount %\nVF Corporation(1) $ 82,661 59.9% $ 96,450 67.3%\nNew Balance 24,124 17.5% 34,506 24.1%\nJiangsu Guotai Huasheng Industrial Co (HK)., Ltd 9,454 6.8% 3,245 2.3%\nDynamic Design Enterprise, Inc 8,175 5.9% 2,235 1.6%\nG-III 5,589 4.0% 2,758 1.9%\nClassic 1,596 1.2% - 0%\nSoriana 954 0.7% 1,487 1.0%\nOthers 5,510 4.0% 2,674 1.8%\nTotal $ 138,063 100.0% $ 143,355 100.0%\n(1) A large portion of our products are sold under The North Face and Timberland brands owned by VF Corporation.\n20\nRevenue by Geographic Area\n(All amounts, other than percentages, in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nFiscal Years Ended March 31,\n2023 2022 Year over Year\nRegion Amount % Amount % Amount %\nUnited States $ 122,318 89% $ 136,068 95% $ (13,750) (10)%\nHong Kong 9,474 7% 3,280 2% 6,194 189%\nJordan 4,892 3% 1,950 1% 2,942 151%\nOthers 1,379 1% 2,057 2% (678) (33)%\nTotal $ 138,063 100% $ 143,355 100% $ (5,292) (4)%\nSince January 2010, all apparel manufactured in Jordan can be exported to the U.S. without customs duty being imposed, pursuant to the United States-\nJordan Free Trade Agreement entered into in December 2001. This free trade agreement provides us with substantial competitiveness and benefit that\nallowed us to expand our garment export business in the U.S.\nThe decrease of approximately 10% in sales to the U.S. during fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 was mainly attributable to the decrease in the export sales\nto two major customers in the U.S. due to challenges related to inflation, which impacted customer demand for new orders.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, aggregate sales to Jordan, Hong Kong, and other locations, such as mainland China, increased significantly\nby 116% from approximately $7.3 million to $15.7 million. This surge in sales can be attributed to receiving more orders from these regions to fill up the\nproduction capacity released from the decrease in shipments to the aforementioned two major customers in the U.S.\nCost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold experienced a slight increase of approximately $0.3 million to approximately $116.3 million in fiscal 2023 from\napproximately $116.0 million in fiscal 2022, despite the decrease in sales. As a percentage of revenue, the cost of goods sold increased by approximately 3\npercentage points to 84% in fiscal 2023 from 81% in fiscal 2022. The increase in the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily\nattributable to a lower proportion of export orders to our two major customers in the U.S., which typically generated higher profit margin for the company.\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, we purchased approximately 11% of our garments from one major supplier. For the fiscal year ended March 31,\n2022, we purchased approximately 20% and 11% of our garments and raw materials from two major suppliers, respectively.\nGross profit margin. Our gross profit margin was approximately 16% in fiscal 2023, representing a decrease by approximately 3 percentage points from\n19% in fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily influenced by a lower proportion of export orders from our two major customers in\nthe U.S., which typically generated higher profit margin.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by approximately 3% from approximately $16.8\nmillion in fiscal 2022 to approximately $17.4 million in fiscal 2023. The increase was mainly attributable to (i) the acquisition of MK Garments, resulting\nin higher headcounts, and (ii) increased travelling costs for migrant workers.\nOther expenses, net. Other expenses, net were approximately $0.3 million in fiscal 2023 and other expenses, net was approximately $45,000 in fiscal 2022.\nThe increase in other expenses was primarily due to the increase in net interest expenses.\n21\nTaxation. Income tax expenses for the fiscal 2023 were approximately $1.7 million, compared to income tax expenses of approximately $2.5 million for\nfiscal 2022. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 increased to 40.7%, compared to 24.2% for fiscal 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate mainly\nresulted from lower operating profit in Jordanian companies, operating loss in Jerash Holdings during the fiscal year, increases in the foreign statutory tax\nrates, and prior year adjustments. In addition, the higher corporate income tax rate in Jordan, which increased from a combined rate of 17% to 20% or 21%\nsince January 1, 2023.\nNet income. Net income for fiscal 2023 decreased by 69.4% to approximately $2.4 million, compared to approximately $7.9 million for fiscal 2022. The\ndecrease in net income was mainly attributable to lower sales to two of our major export customers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJerash Holdings is a holding company incorporated in Delaware. As a holding company, we rely on dividends and other distributions from our Jordanian\nand Hong Kong subsidiaries to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Current Jordanian regulations permit our Jordanian subsidiaries to pay dividends to us\nonly out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Jordanian accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our Jordanian\nsubsidiaries are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds. These reserves are\nnot distributable as cash dividends. We have relied on direct payments of expenses by our subsidiaries (which generate revenue) to meet our obligations to\ndate. To the extent payments are due in U.S. dollars, we have occasionally paid such amounts in JOD to an entity controlled by our management capable of\npaying such amounts in U.S. dollars. Such transactions have been made at prevailing exchange rates and have resulted in immaterial losses or gains on\ncurrency exchange but no other profit.\nAs of March 31, 2023, our cash balance was approximately $17.8 million and restricted cash was approximately $1.6 million, compared to cash of\napproximately $25.2 million and restricted cash of approximately $1.4 million as of March 31, 2022. The decrease in total cash was primarily due to (i) the\nacquisition of Ever Winland and Kawkab Venus for approximately $5.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively (ii) investment in the construction of a new\ndormitory building and extension of one of our major factory buildings, and purchases of property, plant, and machinery, which amounted to a total of\napproximately $5.8 million, (iii) dividends distribution of $2.5 million, and (iv) a share repurchase program totaling $1.2 million.\nOur current assets as of March 31, 2023 were approximately $57.3 million, and our current liabilities were approximately $14.4 million, which resulted in a\ncurrent ratio of approximately 4.0:1. Our current assets as of March 31, 2022 were approximately $69.9 million, and our current liabilities were\napproximately $14.1 million, which resulted in a current ratio of approximately 4.9:1. The decrease in current assets were primarily due to (i) reduced\naccounts receivable resulting from the adoption of supply chain financing programs for two of our major customers, which shortened the payment lead time\nfrom 90 days to around 10 days, and (ii) decreased cash due to the investment in the construction of a new dormitory building, the extension in one of our\nmajor factory buildings, and the acquisition in Ever Winland and Kawkab Venus. The primary driver in the increase in current liabilities was the increased\naccounts payable due to the increase in inventory levels with credit terms from suppliers.\nWe had net working capital of $42.8 million and $55.7 million as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Based on our current operating plan, we\nbelieve that cash on hand and cash generated from operation will be sufficient to support our working capital needs for the next 12 months from the date of\nthis Annually Report.\nSince May and October 2021, we have participated in supply chain financing programs of two of our major customers, respectively. The programs allow us\nto receive early payments for approved sales invoices submitted by us through the bank the customer cooperates with. For any early payments received, we\nare subject to an early payment charge imposed by the customer’s bank, for which the rate is London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. The\narrangement allows us to have better liquidity without the need to incur administrative charges and handling fees as in bank financing.\nWe have funded our working capital needs from operations. Our working capital requirements are influenced by the level of our operations, the numerical\nand dollar volume of our sales contracts, the progress of execution on our customer contracts, and the timing of accounts receivable collections.\n22\nCredit Facilities\nDBS Facility Letter\nPursuant to the DBS facility letter dated January 12, 2022, DBSHK provided a bank facility of up to $5.0 million to Treasure Success. Pursuant to the\nagreement, DBSHK agreed to finance cargo receipt, trust receipt, account payable financing, and certain type of import invoice financing up to an\naggregate of $5.0 million, subject to certain financial covenants. The DBSHK facility bears interest at 1.5% per annum over Hong Kong Interbank Offered\nRate (“HIBOR”) for HKD bills and 1.3% per annum over DBSHK’s cost of funds for foreign currency bills. The facility is guaranteed by Jerash Holdings\nand became available to the Company on June 17, 2022. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $nil outstanding under this DBSHK facility.\nCapital Bank of Jordan Credit Facility\nJerash Garments recently received documents from Capital Bank of Jordan for a credit facility of $10 million. Our board of directors has reviewed the\ndocuments and approved to enter into the credit facility on June 1, 2023. Execution is still in process and the credit facility is not effective as of the date of\nthis annual report. Details of the credit facility will be provided after execution is complete and the facility is effective.\nFiscal Years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(All amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nFor the fiscal years ended\nMarch 31,\n2023 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 10,807 $ 8,963\nNet cash used in investing activities (13,775) (8,673)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (3,953) 3,289\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash (250) 144\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and restricted cash (7,171) 3,723\nCash and restricted cash, beginning of year 26,583 22,860\nCash and restricted cash, end of year $ 19,412 $ 26,583\nSupplemental disclosure information\nCash paid for interest $ 768 $ 211\nIncome tax paid $ 1,748 $ 1,762\nNon-cash investing and financing activities\nEquipment obtained by utilizing long-term deposit $ 237 $ 322\nAcquisition of Kawkab Venus by utilizing long-term deposit $ 500 $ -\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 191 $ 1,022\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was approximately $10.8 million in fiscal 2023, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of\napproximately $9.0 million in fiscal 2022. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the following factors:\n● an increase in inventory of $4.4 million during fiscal 2023, compared to an increase of $3.2 million during fiscal 2022;\n● a decrease in accounts receivable of $8.8 million during fiscal 2023, compared to a decrease of $0.8 million in fiscal 2022;\n● a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.3 million, compared to an increase of $0.9 million in fiscal 2022;\n● an increase in advance to suppliers of $0.2 million, compared to a decrease of $1.7 million in fiscal 2022;\n● an increase in accounts payable of $0.9 million during fiscal 2023, compared to a decrease of $3.1 million in fiscal 2022; and\n● a decrease of net income to $2.4 million during fiscal 2023 from a net income of $7.9 million in fiscal 2022.\n23\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $13.8 million and $8.7 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in net cash used\nin investing activities was mainly attributable to (i) the acquisition of Ever Winland and Kawkab Venus, amounting to $5.1 million and $2.2 million,\nrespectively, (ii) $5.1 million of payments for construction in progress, including the building of a dormitory building and an extension in one of our major\nfactory buildings, and (iii) $0.7 million used for the acquisition of plant and machinery.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was approximately $4.0 million for fiscal 2023, mainly due to dividend payments of approximately $2.5 million and\npayments for a share repurchase program of approximately $1.2 million this fiscal year. There was a net cash inflow of $3.3 million in fiscal 2022 resulting\nfrom the net proceeds of $6.3 million in a placement completed in October 2021 and outflows of dividend payments of approximately $2.4 million and\nrepayments of short-term loans of approximately $0.6 million.\nStatutory Reserves\nIn accordance with the corporate Law in Jordan, Jerash Holdings’ subsidiaries in Jordan are required to make appropriations to certain reserve funds, based\non net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of Jordan. Appropriations to the statutory reserve are required to be\n10% of net income until the reserve is equal to 100% of the entity’s share capital. Jiangmen Treasure Success is required to set aside 10% of its net income\nas statutory surplus reserve until such reserve is equal to 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not available for dividend distribution. The\nstatutory reserve was $410,847 and $379,323 as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table provides the amount of our statutory reserves, the amount of restricted net assets, consolidated net assets, and the amount of restricted\nnet assets as a percentage of consolidated net assets, as of March 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(All amounts, other than percentages, in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nAs of March 31,\n2023 2022\nStatutory Reserves $ 411 $ 379\nTotal Restricted Net Assets $ 411 $ 379\nConsolidated Net Assets $ 68,234 $ 69,304\nRestricted Net Assets as Percentage of Consolidated Net Assets 0.60% 0.55%\nTotal restricted net assets accounted for approximately 0.60% of our consolidated net assets as of March 31, 2023. As our subsidiaries in Jordan are only\nrequired to set aside 10% of net profits to fund the statutory reserves, we believe the potential impact of such restricted net assets on our liquidity is limited.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe had capital expenditures of approximately $13.8 million and $8.7 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended March 31, 2023, our\ncapital expenditures included investments in additional plant and machinery, the construction of a dormitory and factory expansion, the acquisition of\nKawkab Venus, and the acquisition of Ever Winland, which totaled approximately $0.7 million, $5.1 million, $2.2 million, and $5.1 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2022, payments for the construction of a dormitory and factory expansion amounted to $2.1 million, and payments for the\nacquisition of all the share capital of MK Garment was 2.7 million.\n24\nIn 2018, we commenced another project to build a 54,000 square-foot factory in Al-Hasa County in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan, which started\noperation in November 2019 with approximately 240 workers. This project was constructed in conjunction with the Jordanian Ministry of Labor and the\nJordanian Education and Training Department.\nOn August 7, 2019, we completed a transaction to acquire 12,340 square meters (approximately three acres) of land in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, Jordan,\nfrom a third party to construct a dormitory for our employees with aggregate purchase price JOD863,800 (approximately $1,218,303). Management has\nrevised the plan to construct both dormitory and production facilities on the land in order to capture the increasing demand for our capacity. We are\nconducting engineering design and study on this project with the business growth potential bought about by the new business collaboration with Busana\nApparel Group. On February 6, 2020, we completed a transaction to acquire 4,516 square meters (approximately 48,608 square feet) of land in Al\nTajamouat Industrial City, Jordan, from a third party to construct a dormitory for our employee with aggregate purchase price JOD313,501 (approximately\n$442,162). We expect to spend approximately $8.2 million in capital expenditures to build the dormitory. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,\nmanagement decided to put on hold the construction project in fiscal 2021 to retain financial resources to support our operations, and also to wait and see\nhow the global economy and customer demand recover after the outbreak. The preparation work resumed in early 2021 and construction work commenced\nin April 2021. The dormitory is expected to be completed and ready for use in August 2023.\nWe project that there will be an aggregate of approximately $2.6 million and $8.5 million of capital expenditures in the fiscal years ending March 31, 2024\nand 2025, respectively, for further enhancement of production capacity to meet future sales growth. We expect that our capital expenditures will increase in\nthe future as our business continues to develop and expand. We have used cash generated from operations of our subsidiaries to fund our capital\ncommitments in the past and anticipate using such funds to fund capital expenditure commitments in the future.\nOff-balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties. In addition, we\nhave not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our own shares and classified as stockholders’ equity, or that are not reflected in our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nFor Management’s Discussion and Analysis of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended March 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on June 27, 2022.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted by the United States of America, which require us to make\njudgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect our reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and any related disclosures.\nAlthough there were no material changes made to the accounting estimates and assumptions in the past two years, we continually evaluate these estimates\nand assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience, and various other assumptions that we believe to be\nreasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from\nour expectations as a result of changes in our estimates.\nWe believe that certain accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and require us to make significant\naccounting estimates. The policies that we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of\noperations are summarized in “Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to our audited financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note 3—Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in the notes to our audited financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nItem 7A.

As of August 29, 2022, Ever Winland became a subsidiary of Treasure Success.\nF-8\nNOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS (CONTINUED)\nJiangmen Treasure Success Business Consultancy Company Limited (“Jiangmen Treasure Success”) was organized on August 28, 2019 under the laws of\nChina in Guangzhou City of Guangdong Province in China with a total registered capital of 15 million Hong Kong Dollars (“HKD”) (approximately $1.9\nmillion) to provide support in sales and marketing, sample development, merchandising, procurement, and other areas. Treasure Success owns 100% of the\nequity interests in Jiangmen Treasure Success.\nJerash Supplies, LLC (“Jerash Supplies”) was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 20, 2020. Jerash Supplies is engaged in the\ntrading of personal protective equipment products and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jerash Holdings.\nThe Company is engaged primarily in the manufacturing and exporting of customized, ready-made sportwear and outerwear and personal protective\nequipment (“PPE”) produced in its facilities in Jordan and sold in the United States, Jordan, and other countries.\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America\n(“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Jerash Holdings and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements,\nand the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nCash\nThe Company’s cash consists of cash on hand and cash deposited in financial institutions. The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments\nwith an original maturity of three months or less from the original date of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company\nhad no cash equivalents.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of cash used as security deposits to obtain credit facilities from a bank and to secure customs clearance and labor import\nrequirements under the requirements of local regulations. The Company is required to keep certain amounts on deposit that are subject to withdrawal\nrestrictions. These security deposits at the bank are refundable only when the bank facilities are terminated. The restricted cash is classified as a current\nasset if the Company intends to terminate these bank facilities within one year, and as a non-current asset if otherwise.\nF-9\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable are recognized and carried at the original invoiced amount less an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts. The Company\nusually grants extended payment terms to customers with good credit standing and determines the adequacy of reserves for doubtful accounts based on\nindividual account analysis and historical collection trends. The Company establishes a provision for doubtful receivables when there is objective evidence\nthat the Company may not be able to collect amounts due. The allowance is based on management’s best estimates of specific losses on individual\nexposures, as well as a provision on historical trends of collections. The provision is recorded against accounts receivables balances, with a corresponding\ncharge recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Actual amounts received may differ from management’s estimate of\ncreditworthiness and the economic environment. Delinquent account balances are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts after management\nhas determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories include the cost of raw materials, freight, direct labor and related production\noverhead. The cost of inventories is determined using the First in, First-out method. The Company periodically reviews its inventories for excess or slow-\nmoving items and makes provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value.\nAdvance to Suppliers, Net\nAdvance to suppliers consists of balances paid to suppliers for services or materials purchased that have not been provided or received. Advance to\nsuppliers for services and materials is short-term in nature. Advance to suppliers is reviewed periodically to determine whether its carrying value has\nbecome impaired. The Company considers the assets to be impaired if the performance by the suppliers becomes doubtful. The Company uses the aging\nmethod to estimate the allowance for the questionable balances. In addition, at each reporting date, the Company generally determines the adequacy of\nallowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating all available information, and then records specific allowances for those advances based on the specific facts\nand circumstances.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost, reduced by accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense related\nto property, plant, and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, or in the case of leasehold\nimprovements, the shorter of the initial lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements. The useful life and depreciation method are reviewed\nperiodically to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from items of property,\nplant, and equipment. The estimated useful lives of depreciation and amortization of the principal classes of assets are as follows:\nUseful life\nLand Infinite\nProperty and buildings 15-25 years\nEquipment and machinery 3-5 years\nOffice and electronic equipment 3-5 years\nAutomobiles 5 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of useful life\nand lease term\nF-10\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets, are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures\nfor major renewals and betterments which substantially extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation or\namortization of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive income.\nConstruction in Progress\nConstruction in Progress (“CIP”) is recorded at cost for property, plant, and equipment where the asset is in construction or development. CIP accumulates\ncost of construction and transaction costs involved in the progress of acquiring the materials for construction or development. The Company does not\ncommence depreciating the asset in CIP account because the asset has not yet been placed in service. Once an asset is placed in service, all costs associated\nwith the asset that are recorded in the CIP account are transferred to plant, plant, and equipment for the asset.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company assesses its long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\nthe carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Factors which may indicate potential impairment include a significant underperformance\nrelative to the historical or projected future operating results or a significant negative industry or economic trend. Recoverability of assets to be held and\nused is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset. If\nimpairment is indicated, a loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. The fair value is estimated based\non the discounted future cash flows or comparable market values, if available. The Company did not record any impairment loss during the fiscal years\nended March 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAsset Acquisition\nAn asset acquisition is an acquisition of an asset, or a group of assets, that does not meet the definition of a business, as substantially all of the fair value of\nthe gross assets acquired are concentrated in a single or group of similar, identifiable assets. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by using the cost\naccumulation model, whereby the cost of the acquisition, including certain transaction costs, is allocated to the assets acquired on a relative fair value basis.\nDetermining and valuing intangible assets requires judgment.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill is not amortized. As of March 31,\n2023 and 2022, the carrying amount of goodwill was both $499,282. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or in interim periods if\nindicators of potential impairment exist, based on the one reporting unit. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine\nwhether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. When performing the quantitative impairment test, the Company compares the\nfair value of its only reporting unit with the carrying amounts. The Company would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying\namount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company concluded that no impairment of its goodwill occurred for the year ended March 31, 2023 and\n2022.\nF-11\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nRevenue Recognition\nSubstantially all of the Company’s revenue is derived from product sales, which consist of sales of the Company’s customized ready-made outerwear for\nlarge brand-name retailers and PPE. The Company considers purchase orders to be a contract with a customer. Contracts with customers are considered to\nbe short term when the time between order confirmation and satisfaction of the performance obligations is equal to or less than one year. Virtually all of the\nCompany’s contracts are short term. The Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of promised goods to customers in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods. The Company typically satisfies its performance obligations in\ncontracts with customers upon shipment of the goods. Generally, payment is due from customers within seven to 150 days of the invoice date. The\ncontracts do not have significant financing components. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight from Jordan export dock are not an\nobligation of the Company. Returns and allowances are not a significant aspect of the revenue recognition process as historically they have been\nimmaterial.\nThe Company also derives revenue rendering cutting and making services to other apparel vendors who subcontract order to the Company. Revenue is\nrecognized when the service is rendered. All of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation satisfied at a point in time and the\ntransaction price is stated in the contract, usually as a price per unit. All estimates are based on the Company’s historical experience, complete satisfaction\nof the performance obligation, and the Company’s best judgment at the time the estimate is made. Historically, sales returns have not significantly impacted\nthe Company’s revenue.\nThe Company does not have any contract assets since the Company has an unconditional right to consideration when the Company has satisfied its\nperformance obligation and payment from customers is not contingent on a future event. The Company had contract liabilities of $928,393 and $nil as of\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022. For the fiscal years ended March 31 2023 and 2022, there was no revenue recognized from performance obligations related to\nprior periods. As of March 31, 2023, $928,393 deferred revenue was expected to be recognized within fiscal 2024.\nThe Company has one revenue generating reportable geographic segment under ASC Topic 280 “Segment Reporting” and derives its sales primarily from\nits sales of customized ready-made outerwear. The Company believes disaggregation of revenue by geographic region best depicts the nature, amount,\ntiming, and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows (see “Note 14—Segment Reporting”).\nAs of March 31, 2023 and 2022, there was $928,393 and $nil receipts in advance from a customer. The Company recorded the receipts in advance as\ndeferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2023. These advances arose from early settlements from a customer’s supply chain\nprogram that arranged for payments in accordance to estimated shipment dates before March 31, 2023 while the actual shipments dates were after the fiscal\nyear end.\nShipping and Handling\nProceeds collected from customers for shipping and handling costs are included in revenue. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are\nincluded in operating expenses, as a part of selling, general, and administrative expenses. Total shipping and handling expenses were $1,856,218 and\n$1,864,202 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome and Sales Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes on an entity basis on income arising in or derived from the tax jurisdiction in which each entity is domiciled.\nJerash Holdings and Jerash Supplies are incorporated/formed in the State of Delaware and are subject to federal income tax in the United States of\nAmerica. Treasure Success and Ever Winland are registered in Hong Kong and are subject to profit tax in Hong Kong. Jiangmen Treasure Success is\nincorporated in China and is subject to corporate income tax in China. Jerash Garments, Jerash Embroidery, Chinese Garments, Paramount, Jerash The\nFirst, MK Garments, and Kawkab Venus are subject to income tax in Jordan, unless an exemption is granted. In accordance with Development Zone law,\nJerash Garments and its subsidiaries were subject to corporate income tax in Jordan at a rate of 16% plus a 1% social contribution between January 1, 2021\nand December 31, 2021. The income tax rate increased to 18% or 20% plus a 1% social contribution starting from January 1, 2022. Effective January 1,\n2023, the income tax rate increased to 19% or 20%, plus a 1% social contribution.\nF-12\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nIncome and Sales Taxes (continued)\nJerash Garments and its subsidiaries are subject to local sales tax of 16% on purchases. Jerash Garments was granted a sales tax exemption from the\nJordanian Investment Commission for the period from June 1, 2015 to June 1, 2018 that allowed Jerash Garments to make purchases with no sales tax\ncharge. The exemption has been extended to February 5, 2024.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires the Company to use the asset and liability method\nof accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary\ndifferences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases\nof existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Under this accounting standard, the effect on deferred income taxes of a\nchange in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not\nthat some portion, or all of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nASC 740 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation requires that an entity recognize in its financial statements the impact\nof a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Recognized\nincome tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are\nreflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax\nbenefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. No significant uncertainty in tax\npositions relating to income taxes were incurred during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar (“US$” or “$”). The Company uses JOD in Jordan companies, HKD in Treasure Success and\nEver Winland, and Chinese Yuan (“CNY”) in Jiangmen Treasure Success as functional currency of each above-mentioned entity. The assets and liabilities\nof the Company have been translated into US$ using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, equity accounts have been translated at historical\nrates, and revenue and expenses have been translated into US$ using average exchange rates in effect during the reporting period. Cash flows are also\ntranslated at average translation rates for the periods. Therefore, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of cash\nflows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the consolidated balance sheets. Translation adjustments arising from the\nuse of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.\nTransaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are\nincluded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as incurred, and the balance of transaction gains and losses were immaterial as of the\nyears ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe value of JOD against US$ and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in Jordan’s political and economic\nconditions. Any significant revaluation of JOD, HKD, and CNY may materially affect the Company’s financial condition in terms of US$ reporting. The\nfollowing table outlines the currency exchange rates that were used in creating the consolidated financial statements in this report:\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2023 2022\nPeriod-end spot rate US$1=JOD0.7090 US$1=JOD0.7090\nUS$1=HKD7.8496 US$1=HKD7.8325\nUS$1=CNY6.8666 US$1=CNY6.3393\nAverage rate US$1=JOD0.7090 US$1=JOD0.7090\nUS$1=HKD7.8383 US$1=HKD7.7844\nUS$1=CNY6.8506 US$1=CNY6.4180\nF-13\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based upon the awards’ initial grant-date fair value. The estimated grant-date fair\nvalue of the award is recognized as expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes model. This model is affected by the Company’s stock price on the date of the\ngrant as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include the expected term of the option,\nexpected risk-free rates of return, the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock, and expected dividend yield, each of which is more fully\ndescribed below. The assumptions for expected term and expected volatility are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value.\n● Expected Term: the expected term of a warrant or a stock option is the period of time that the warrant or a stock option is expected to be\noutstanding.\n● Risk-free Interest Rate: the Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes model on the implied yield at the grant date of the\nU.S. Treasury zero-coupon issued with an equivalent term to the stock-based award being valued. Where the expected term of a stock-based award\ndoes not correspond with the term for which a zero-coupon interest rate is quoted, the Company uses the nearest interest rate from the available\nmaturities.\n● Expected Stock Price Volatility: the Company utilizes the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock over the same period of time as the\nlife of the warrant or stock option. When the Company’s own stock volatility information is unavailable for such period of time, the Company\nutilizes comparable public company volatility.\n● Dividend Yield: Stock-based compensation awards granted prior to November 2018 assumed no dividend yield, while any subsequent stock-based\ncompensation awards will be valued using the anticipated dividend yield.\nEarnings per Share\nThe Company computes earnings per share (“EPS”) in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share” (“ASC 260”). ASC 260 requires companies with\ncomplex capital structures to present basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as net income divided by the weighted average common shares\noutstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g.,\nconvertible securities, options and warrants) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential\ncommon shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of\ndiluted EPS (See “Note 13–Earnings per Share”).\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive income (loss). The foreign currency translation gain or loss\nresulting from translation of the financial statements expressed in JOD or HKD or CNY to US$ is reported in other comprehensive income (loss) in the\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nF-14\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC 825-10 requires certain disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level fair value hierarchy\nprioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n● Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\n● Level 2 - Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either\ndirectly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n● Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities.\nThis includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\nThe Company considers the recorded value of its financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash, accounts receivable, bills receivables,\nother current assets, credit facilities, accounts payable, accrued expenses, income tax payables, other payables, amount due to a related party and operating\nlease liabilities to approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities at March 31, 2023 and 2022 based upon the short-term nature of these\nassets and liabilities.\nConcentrations and Credit Risk\nCredit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash. As of March 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, $7,264,247 and $12,735,486 of the Company’s cash was on deposit at financial institutions in Jordan, where there currently is no rule or\nregulation requiring such financial institutions to maintain insurance to cover bank deposits in the event of bank failure. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, $172,939 and $351,255 of the Company’s cash was on deposit at financial institutions in China. Cash maintained in banks within China of\nless than CNY0.5 million (equivalent to $72,815) per bank are covered by “deposit insurance regulation” promulgated by the State Council of the People’s\nRepublic of China. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, $11,700,512 and $13,311,340 of the Company’s cash was on deposit at financial\ninstitutions in Hong Kong, which are insured by the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board subject to certain limitations. While management believes that\nthese financial institutions are of high credit quality, it also continually monitors their credit worthiness. As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively,\n$171,496 and $37,342 of the Company’s cash was on deposit in the United States and are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to\n$250,000.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and derived from revenue earned from customers, and therefore are exposed to credit risk. The risk is\nmitigated by the Company’s assessment of its customers’ creditworthiness and its ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances.\nCustomer and vendor concentration risk\nThe Company’s sales are made primarily in the United States. Its operating results could be adversely affected by U.S. government policies on importing\nbusiness, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and changes in local market conditions. The Company has a concentration of its revenue and purchases with\nspecific customers and suppliers. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, two customers accounted for 60% and 17%, and 67% and 24% of the\nCompany’s total revenue, respectively. As of March 31, 2023, four end-customer accounts for 50%, 13%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, of the Company’s\ntotal accounts receivable balance. As of March 31, 2022, one end-customer accounted for 89% of the Company’s total accounts receivable balance.\nF-15\nNOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nFor the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, the Company purchased approximately 11% of its garments from one major supplier. For the fiscal year ended\nMarch 31, 2022, the Company purchased approximately 20% and 11% of its garments from two major suppliers, respectively. As of March 31, 2023,\naccounts payable to the Company’s one major supplier accounted for 36% of the total accounts payable balance. As of March 31, 2022, accounts payable to\nthe Company’s three major suppliers accounted for 11%, 11%, and 10% of the total accounts payable balance, respectively.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe principal operations of the Company are located in Jordan. Accordingly, the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations may be\ninfluenced by political, economic, and legal environments in Jordan, as well as by the general state of the Jordanian economy. The Company’s operations in\nJordan are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America. These include risks associated\nwith, among others, the political, economic, and legal environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by\nchanges in the political, regulatory, and social conditions in Jordan. Although the Company has not experienced losses from these situations and believes\nthat it is in compliance with existing laws and regulations including its organization and structure disclosed in Note 1, this may not be indicative of future\nresults.\nNOTE 3 – RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nThe Company considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standards updates (“ASUs”). Management periodically reviews new accounting\nstandards that are issued.\nIn September 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments. This ASU is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments\nheld by financial institutions and other organizations. This ASU requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the\nreporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU requires enhanced disclosures to help\ninvestors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit\nquality and underwriting standards of the Company’s portfolio. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements that provide additional\ninformation about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which amended the effective dates\nof ASU 2016-13. For public business entities that meet the definition of an SEC filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies (“SRC”)\nas defined by the SEC, ASU 2016-13 will become effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those\nfiscal years. For all other entities, ASU 2016-13 will become effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years. As an SRC, the Company plans to adopt this ASU effective April 1, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the\nadoption of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements.\nF-16\nNOTE 4 – ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET\nAccounts receivable consisted of the following:\nAs of As of\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2023 2022\nTrade accounts receivable $ 2,462,120 $ 11,270,652\nLess: allowances for doubtful accounts 221,583 221,583\nAccounts receivable, net $ 2,240,537 $ 11,049,069\nNOTE 5 – INVENTORIES\nInventories consisted of the following:\nAs of As of\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2023 2022\nRaw materials $ 15,240,198 $ 17,714,578\nWork-in-progress 2,932,519 2,010,417\nFinished goods 14,484,116 8,530,184\nTotal inventory $ 32,656,833 $ 28,255,179\nAs of March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $nil inventory valuation reserve as the Company arranged its inventory based on 93.4% and 90.0% with\nactual orders received, respectively. 6.6% and 10.0% of inventories held on hand were associated with unfulfilled sales orders, respectively.\nNOTE 6 – ADVANCE TO SUPPLIERS, NET\nAdvance to suppliers consisted of the following:\nAs of As of\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2023 2022\nAdvance to suppliers $ 1,533,091 $ 1,284,601\nLess: allowances for doubtful accounts - -\nAdvance to suppliers, net $ 1,533,091 $ 1,284,601\nNOTE 7 – LEASES\nThe Company has 48 operating leases for manufacturing facilities and offices. Some leases include one or more options to renew, which is typically at the\nCompany’s sole discretion. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options, and, when it is reasonably certain of exercise, it will include the renewal\nperiod in its lease term.

Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 15d-15(e)) are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be\ndisclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), based on their evaluation of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2023, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of that date due to\ncertain material control weaknesses, including:\n- We failed to maintain effective controls over period-end financial reporting, specifically related to income taxes and the reconciliation of account level\nbalances that resulted in errors; and\n- There were ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of privileged user access and the review of user access over certain\ninformation technology systems that support our financial reporting processes.\nWe have formulated plans to address the above weaknesses by:\n- improving multi-level checking and documentation of account level balance reconciliation;\n- working with external professional consultants to strengthen our work and review on U.S. tax issues; and\n- rolling out a password control mechanism to exercise control and checking on the work of the privileged user access for all information technology\nsystems supporting our financial reporting processes.\nWe will implement the above initiatives as soon as practicable to address the identified weaknesses.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate\ninternal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not\nprevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n26\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial\nofficer), has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used\nthe criteria set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on the assessment using those criteria, management concluded that, as of March 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not\neffective due to certain material control weaknesses, including:\n- We failed to maintain effective controls over period-end financial reporting, specifically related to income taxes and the reconciliation of account level\nbalances that resulted in errors; and\n- There were ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of privileged user access and the review of user access over certain\ninformation technology systems that support our financial reporting processes.\nWe have formulated plans to address the above weaknesses by:\n- improving the checking and documentation of account level balance reconciliation;\n- working with external professional consultant to strengthen our work and review on US tax issues; and\n- rolling out a password control mechanism to exercise control and checking on the work of the privileged user access for all information technology\nsystems supporting our financial reporting processes.\nWe will implement the above initiatives will as soon as practicable to address the identified weaknesses.\nAttestation report of the registered public accounting firm. This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public\naccounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Our management’s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered\npublic accounting firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this Annual Report.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as the term is defined in Rules\n13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.
