The podcast addition strengthens and grows PodcastOne's existing commitment to providing engaging content tailored to women.\n\nOn the _Stassi_ podcast, Stassi shares candid stories, personal reflections, and her token commentary on everything from pop culture to relationships to style, and beyond. With each episode, listeners get an intimate glimpse into Stassi's world, with her closest friends, as she navigates the highs and lows of life with humor, wit, and unapologetic honesty. Known for her candid conversations and authentic storytelling, Stassi has cultivated a devoted audience that resonates with her relatable experiences and insights.\n\n“We are excited to welcome Stassi and her podcast to our network,” said PodcastOne’s President and Co-Founder Kit Gray. “Her ability to connect with women through relatable content and genuine conversations makes her a powerful voice in the podcasting landscape. PodcastOne, with our talent-focused approach, is the perfect partner for Stassi and her team to grow the podcast’s fanbase and reach.”\n\n“I’m beyond thrilled to join the team at PodcastOne for this next chapter,” said Stassi Schroeder. “I’ve always been all about real talk and sharing life’s crazy highs and lows with you all and after almost a decade of podcasting, it’s amazing to have a committed partner that understands what makes this journey so fun. They’re all about authentic storytelling, which is exactly what I want to keep bringing to my listeners. I’m excited to show you all what we’re working on to continue to make this show and its content even more entertaining and unexpected.”\n\n_Stassi_ has captivated audiences for over nine years, remaining one of the highest-rated podcasts across platforms. Schroeder was one of the first talents to evolve her podcast into a live show in 2019, when she introduced the _Straight Up with Stassi Live_ tour, selling out shows across the U.S. within minutes. The success of her live shows resulted in the _Bougie Bus Tour_ in 2020 and the _Mommy Dearest Tour_ in 2023, which also included sold out markets. In addition to her ventures with the podcast, it was also recently announced that Schroeder will be returning to reality TV with her own half-hour docu-comedy series in the works at Hulu.\n\nThe acquisition will enhance PodcastOne’s mission to champion female voices in the podcasting space. As part of this collaboration, Stassi will also be integrated into PodcastOne's extensive promotional and marketing initiatives across a multitude of genres with plans to explore live shows, merchandising and adaptations.\n\n_Stassi_ joins PodcastOne’s full roster of top ranked podcasts which includes programming across top genres such as news, comedy, true crime and society and culture, featuring shows such as _LadyGang, Karma and Chaos_ , _Coffee Convos, Varnamtown, The Prosecutors, Court Junkie, The Jordan Harbinger Show, Off the Vine with Kaitlyn Bristowe, The Adam Carolla Show_ , _Camp Counselors,_ and _The Schaub Show._\n\n**About PodcastOne**[PodcastOne](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=x2KjW6swLEnXUk6g0qa5EoO-VA4PG57IGP8VOuvcW91Rha4Ewt4HAasgCFHjqu8vyB9UZ_HhfYwX88p3r0nCb3BgnB78bEKaFCnn4-5Zew3YAD_qTWkCU8PhPJqQF7WULJ9pw5Dgt6LLF6XUpJh0GyXfW9mP3N2dD0iJQuzhy0Z0v8nzU_ccU--zzxQyeEG2GQaI-UnOubKds3NmZQYZCwZpSB-RCEon6D0QOqITqb3lh3BRjbCyDLhpv8z8z_oLSbyh-BPnhzFk9GXN_h3l6PHSHBofJUif9zTp0RtWl7qJRcWg42nnNUJzQSlumdLwj6KvZHM0FV51MxnakW9kL0CtDahNc2YTRhTgDP7mDIWkHextL4FwzK4MfBTOwdK_U0HoULV427gis8nclrnbCHUC2a8gIV_o3sG9Ff4CTBY=) (NASDAQ: PODC) is a leading podcast platform that provides creators and advertisers with a full 360-degree solution in sales, marketing, public relations, production and distribution.

These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including: LiveOne’s reliance on its largest OEM customer for a substantial percentage of its revenue; LiveOne’s and PodcastOne’s ability to consummate any proposed financing, acquisition, special dividend, merger, distribution or transaction, including the spin-out of LiveOne’s pay-per-view business, the timing of the consummation of any such proposed event, including the risks that a condition to the consummation of any such event would not be satisfied within the expected timeframe or at all, or that the consummation of any proposed financing, acquisition, merger, special dividend, distribution or transaction will not occur or whether any such event will enhance shareholder value; PodcastOne’s ability to continue as a going concern; PodcastOne’s ability to attract, maintain and increase the number of its listeners; PodcastOne identifying, acquiring, securing and developing content; LiveOne’s intent to repurchase shares of its and/or PodcastOne’s common stock from time to time under LiveOne’s announced stock repurchase program and the timing, price, and quantity of repurchases, if any, under the program; LiveOne’s ability to maintain compliance with certain financial and other covenants; PodcastOne successfully implementing its growth strategy, including relating to its technology platforms and applications; management’s relationships with industry stakeholders; uncertain and unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings and/or PodcastOne’s or LiveOne’s ability to pay any amounts due in connection with any such legal proceedings; LiveOne’s ability to extend and/or refinance its indebtedness and/or repay its indebtedness when due; changes in economic conditions; competition; risks and uncertainties applicable to the businesses of PodcastOne, LiveOne and/or LiveOne’s other subsidiaries; and other risks, uncertainties and factors including, but not limited to, those described in PodcastOne’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on July 1, 2024, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 13, 2024, and in PodcastOne’s other filings and submissions with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and PodcastOne disclaims any obligation to update these statements, except as may be required by law. PodcastOne intends that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures***\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we present Contribution Margin (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), which are non-GAAP financial measures, as measures of our performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, or superior to, operating loss and or net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other measures of our cash flows or liquidity.\n\nWe use Contribution Margin (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of our operating segment. We believe that information about these non-GAAP financial measures assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our business separate from non-operational factors that affect operating income (loss) and net income (loss), thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP. A limitation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, this measure may vary among other companies; thus, Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nContribution Margin (Loss) is defined as Revenue less Cost of Sales. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, other (income) expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and before (a) non-cash GAAP purchase accounting adjustments for certain deferred revenue and costs, (b) legal, accounting and other professional fees directly attributable to acquisition activity, (c) employee severance payments and third party professional fees directly attributable to acquisition or corporate realignment activities, (d) certain non-recurring expenses associated with legal settlements or reserves for legal settlements in the period that pertain to historical matters that existed at acquired companies prior to their purchase date and a one-time minimum guarantee to effectively terminate a live events distribution agreement post COVID-19, and (e) certain stock-based compensation expense. Management does not consider these costs to be indicative of our core operating results.\n\nWith respect to projected full fiscal year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA, a quantitative reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related charges and legal settlement reserves excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. We expect that the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measure to GAAP Measure” included at the end of this release. \n\n**PodcastOne** **IR Contact****:** Chris DonovanManaging DirectorMZ Group - MZ North America(914) 352-5853[PODC@mzgroup.us](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fv3tfnxv0cS91XkZKiT2dSwsWSdwRHvEkUn10Bz3lhKramlP1x26QzuKG_jyOp7352YXqmdY3b77Bi-z9Hy8Mg==) [www.mzgroup.us](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3IqC708baKUNaOYf9wVv8CJ0gasxFWyJv7nm7nyc3a5wCkc14HUAnmtPvWDC4mSDU2I2-suORgJrLgBNhgZFfw==)\n\n**PodcastOne Press Contact****:**(310) 246-4600[Susan@Guttmanpr.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qtdqlh-hhIt6I65BDwzaJeDYCoSKwZcMyftw_mzhLKMZoG8pBDTFKCqdPvJzCSCoHdj2IFUT5CXpA6gaVWDvuL016zXNPWELSa2zia4x6pj6vSeDhtcRWM9qdOZSmLv0-oPMXWKhm4qLCIhgGnfzGepDX_3DZWFp-AvS3CFfxm9AG1l9A9Ri9u-WfMMfU-96dQKhBJl2BDeFlKEyGhsyJ2HaiQG5sS2mK3Nrn7ScDDiA26n4tmsCLldZmPcg4uhdS3ErsPDfrEE8_ezOAQmuwoKWLz_khp6gsA-XTGADJEsX6QqPmk0mIqEh_-DCOFVFNFmXmcWP4g3z1kWy2Tlel_2D1S7ZXGVxAKrDK2w6fgWLszrcD5zkpAzOmOfx7LtOw4xx728lM2htz1oq9AgHeac1HPlU0qTXf1kcGvC0rj7ABWMoHrEY9JgP7B_14f2CClGxy25sjrLQRQeFAx1OIEUpknJbhU7rQ4-SfaLH3YA=)\n\n**Financial Information**\n\nThe tables below present financial results for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. \n\n**PodcastOne, Inc.** **Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited)****_(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)_**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Six Months Ended**  \n**March 31,**| **September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Revenue:**|  $| 12,154| $| 10,516| $| 25,312| $| 21,153  \n**Operating expenses:**  \nCost of sales| 11,142| 9,057| 22,851| 17,279  \nSales and marketing| 877| 1,451| 1,724| 2,701  \nProduct development| 13| 28| 31| 55  \nGeneral and administrative| 1,452| 1,215| 2,850| 2,135  \nImpairment of intangible assets| -| -| 176| -  \nAmortization of intangible assets| 328| 191| 705| 216  \nTotal operating expenses| 13,812| 11,942| 28,337| 22,386  \n**Loss from operations**| (1,658| )| (1,426| )| (3,025| )| (1,233| )  \n**Other income (expense):**  \nInterest expense, net| -| (654| )| -| (2,247| )  \nChange in fair value of bifurcated embedded derivative| -| (8,793| )| -| (7,603| )  \nTotal other expense, net| -| (9,447| )| -| (9,850| )  \n**Loss before provision (benefit) for income taxes**| (1,658| )| (10,873| )| (3,025| )| (11,083| )  \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes| 11| -| 11| -  \n**Net loss**|  $| (1,669| )| $| (10,873| )| $| (3,036| )| $| (11,083| )  \n**Net loss per share** –**basic and diluted**|  $| (0.07| )| $| (0.52| )| $| (0.13| )| $| (0.54| )  \n**Weighted average common shares** –**basic and diluted**|  24,162,612| 20,714,161| 23,991,772| 20,357,080  \n  \n**PodcastOne, Inc.****Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited)****_(In thousands)_**  \n---  \n**September 30,**| **March 31,**  \n**2024**| **2024**  \n(Unaudited)| (Audited)  \n**Assets**  \n**Current Assets**  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 1,355| $| 1,445  \nAccounts receivable, net| 6,324| 6,023  \nPrepaid expense and other current assets| 661| 1,105  \n**Total Current Assets**|  8,340| 8,573  \nProperty and equipment, net| 311| 309  \nGoodwill| 12,041| 12,041  \nIntangible assets, net| 2,146| 3,145  \nRelated party receivable| 281| 57  \n**Total Assets**|  $| 23,119| $| 24,125  \n**Liabilities and Stockholders** ’**Equity**  \n**Current Liabilities**  \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities| $| 6,659| $| 7,383  \nRelated party payable| 936| 315  \n**Total Current Liabilities**|  7,595| 7,698  \nOther long term liabilities| 46| 86  \n**Total Liabilities**|  7,641| 7,784  \n**Commitments and Contingencies**  \n**Stockholders** ’**Equity**  \nCommon stock, $0.00001 par value;

Our multi-pronged growth strategy is beginning to show meaningful results, driven by acquisition of top shows and producing our own content, which generates high margins and leverages our existing infrastructure.

These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including: LiveOne’s reliance on its largest OEM customer for a substantial percentage of its revenue; LiveOne’s and PodcastOne’s ability to consummate any proposed financing, acquisition, special dividend, merger, distribution or transaction, including the spin-out of LiveOne’s pay-per-view business, the timing of the consummation of any such proposed event, including the risks that a condition to the consummation of any such event would not be satisfied within the expected timeframe or at all, or that the consummation of any proposed financing, acquisition, merger, special dividend, distribution or transaction will not occur or whether any such event will enhance shareholder value; PodcastOne’s ability to continue as a going concern; PodcastOne’s ability to attract, maintain and increase the number of its listeners; PodcastOne identifying, acquiring, securing and developing content; LiveOne’s intent to repurchase shares of its and/or PodcastOne’s common stock from time to time under LiveOne’s announced stock repurchase program and the timing, price, and quantity of repurchases, if any, under the program; LiveOne’s ability to maintain compliance with certain financial and other covenants; PodcastOne successfully implementing its growth strategy, including relating to its technology platforms and applications; management’s relationships with industry stakeholders; uncertain and unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings and/or PodcastOne’s or LiveOne’s ability to pay any amounts due in connection with any such legal proceedings; LiveOne’s ability to extend and/or refinance its indebtedness and/or repay its indebtedness when due; changes in economic conditions; competition; risks and uncertainties applicable to the businesses of PodcastOne, LiveOne and/or LiveOne’s other subsidiaries; and other risks, uncertainties and factors including, but not limited to, those described in PodcastOne’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on July 1, 2024, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 13, 2024, and in PodcastOne’s other filings and submissions with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and PodcastOne disclaims any obligation to update these statements, except as may be required by law. PodcastOne intends that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures***\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we present Contribution Margin (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), which are non-GAAP financial measures, as measures of our performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, or superior to, operating loss and or net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other measures of our cash flows or liquidity.\n\nWe use Contribution Margin (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate the performance of our operating segment. We believe that information about these non-GAAP financial measures assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our business separate from non-operational factors that affect operating income (loss) and net income (loss), thus providing insights into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP. A limitation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain amortizing assets used in generating revenue in our business. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for operating income (loss), net income (loss), and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, this measure may vary among other companies; thus, Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\n\nContribution Margin (Loss) is defined as Revenue less Cost of Sales. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, other (income) expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and before (a) non-cash GAAP purchase accounting adjustments for certain deferred revenue and costs, (b) legal, accounting and other professional fees directly attributable to acquisition activity, (c) employee severance payments and third party professional fees directly attributable to acquisition or corporate realignment activities, (d) certain non-recurring expenses associated with legal settlements or reserves for legal settlements in the period that pertain to historical matters that existed at acquired companies prior to their purchase date and a one-time minimum guarantee to effectively terminate a live events distribution agreement post COVID-19, and (e) certain stock-based compensation expense. Management does not consider these costs to be indicative of our core operating results.\n\nWith respect to projected full fiscal year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA, a quantitative reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related charges and legal settlement reserves excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. We expect that the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measure to GAAP Measure” included at the end of this release. \n\n**PodcastOne** **IR Contact****:** Chris DonovanManaging DirectorMZ Group - MZ North America(914) 352-5853[PODC@mzgroup.us](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fv3tfnxv0cS91XkZKiT2dSwsWSdwRHvEkUn10Bz3lhKramlP1x26QzuKG_jyOp7352YXqmdY3b77Bi-z9Hy8Mg==) [www.mzgroup.us](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3IqC708baKUNaOYf9wVv8CJ0gasxFWyJv7nm7nyc3a5wCkc14HUAnmtPvWDC4mSDU2I2-suORgJrLgBNhgZFfw==)\n\n**PodcastOne Press Contact****:**(310) 246-4600[Susan@Guttmanpr.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qtdqlh-hhIt6I65BDwzaJeDYCoSKwZcMyftw_mzhLKMZoG8pBDTFKCqdPvJzCSCoHdj2IFUT5CXpA6gaVWDvuL016zXNPWELSa2zia4x6pj6vSeDhtcRWM9qdOZSmLv0-oPMXWKhm4qLCIhgGnfzGepDX_3DZWFp-AvS3CFfxm9AG1l9A9Ri9u-WfMMfU-96dQKhBJl2BDeFlKEyGhsyJ2HaiQG5sS2mK3Nrn7ScDDiA26n4tmsCLldZmPcg4uhdS3ErsPDfrEE8_ezOAQmuwoKWLz_khp6gsA-XTGADJEsX6QqPmk0mIqEh_-DCOFVFNFmXmcWP4g3z1kWy2Tlel_2D1S7ZXGVxAKrDK2w6fgWLszrcD5zkpAzOmOfx7LtOw4xx728lM2htz1oq9AgHeac1HPlU0qTXf1kcGvC0rj7ABWMoHrEY9JgP7B_14f2CClGxy25sjrLQRQeFAx1OIEUpknJbhU7rQ4-SfaLH3YA=)\n\n**Financial Information**\n\nThe tables below present financial results for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. \n\n**PodcastOne, Inc.** **Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited)****_(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)_**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended**| **Six Months Ended**  \n**March 31,**| **September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Revenue:**|  $| 12,154| $| 10,516| $| 25,312| $| 21,153  \n**Operating expenses:**  \nCost of sales| 11,142| 9,057| 22,851| 17,279  \nSales and marketing| 877| 1,451| 1,724| 2,701  \nProduct development| 13| 28| 31| 55  \nGeneral and administrative| 1,452| 1,215| 2,850| 2,135  \nImpairment of intangible assets| -| -| 176| -  \nAmortization of intangible assets| 328| 191| 705| 216  \nTotal operating expenses| 13,812| 11,942| 28,337| 22,386  \n**Loss from operations**| (1,658| )| (1,426| )| (3,025| )| (1,233| )  \n**Other income (expense):**  \nInterest expense, net| -| (654| )| -| (2,247| )  \nChange in fair value of bifurcated embedded derivative| -| (8,793| )| -| (7,603| )  \nTotal other expense, net| -| (9,447| )| -| (9,850| )  \n**Loss before provision (benefit) for income taxes**| (1,658| )| (10,873| )| (3,025| )| (11,083| )  \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes| 11| -| 11| -  \n**Net loss**|  $| (1,669| )| $| (10,873| )| $| (3,036| )| $| (11,083| )  \n**Net loss per share** –**basic and diluted**|  $| (0.07| )| $| (0.52| )| $| (0.13| )| $| (0.54| )  \n**Weighted average common shares** –**basic and diluted**|  24,162,612| 20,714,161| 23,991,772| 20,357,080  \n  \n**PodcastOne, Inc.****Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited)****_(In thousands)_**  \n---  \n**September 30,**| **March 31,**  \n**2024**| **2024**  \n(Unaudited)| (Audited)  \n**Assets**  \n**Current Assets**  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 1,355| $| 1,445  \nAccounts receivable, net| 6,324| 6,023  \nPrepaid expense and other current assets| 661| 1,105  \n**Total Current Assets**|  8,340| 8,573  \nProperty and equipment, net| 311| 309  \nGoodwill| 12,041| 12,041  \nIntangible assets, net| 2,146| 3,145  \nRelated party receivable| 281| 57  \n**Total Assets**|  $| 23,119| $| 24,125  \n**Liabilities and Stockholders** ’**Equity**  \n**Current Liabilities**  \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities| $| 6,659| $| 7,383  \nRelated party payable| 936| 315  \n**Total Current Liabilities**|  7,595| 7,698  \nOther long term liabilities| 46| 86  \n**Total Liabilities**|  7,641| 7,784  \n**Commitments and Contingencies**  \n**Stockholders** ’**Equity**  \nCommon stock, $0.00001 par value;
