In 2015 we set out\nour growth strategy – outlining how we are built for\nglobal growth and committed to creating value for\nour stakeholders across different economic cycles.\nToday, we continue to see that strategy through.\nFrom 3 offices in 1982 to where we are now, with\n480 employees from 50 nationalities, working from\n12 offices across 3 continents – Investcorp has\nnever been so dynamic, and so diversified in its\npeople and asset classes.\nToday, we are also committed more than ever\nto conducting responsible business. Our global\ninvestment teams remain focused on identifying\ncompelling opportunities, and as a business, we\ncontinue to position our firm as a global alternative\nasset manager of choice for both institutional\ninvestors and UHNW individuals.\n01 Message to Shareholders\n06 Business Review\n54 Corporate Governance, Balance Sheet and Risk Management\n76 Consolidated Financial Statements\n132 Senior Management\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nMESSAGE TO SHAREHOLDERS\nThe Board of Directors of Investcorp is pleased to submit the consolidated audited financial statements for\nInvestcorp’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nDear Shareholders,\nThis year marks Investcorp’s 40th anniversary or, in other words, four decades of enriching the lives of future\ngenerations and fostering close client and investor relationships. In the past twelve months, more than ever, the\nchallenges we faced as a firm and as an industry have required relentless adaptation and resilience. We have\ncontinued to make significant progress on a range of strategic initiatives to realize our medium- and longer-term\nobjectives of reaching US$50 billion and US$100 billion in AUM, respectively.\nWe would like to thank you all for your ongoing support, partnership, and trust in Investcorp as we continue to\nnavigate complex times. This past year has seen immense difficulties for people across the globe as geopolitical\ndevelopments jeopardized food and energy security for millions, if not billions, of people. These developments, in\naddition to the continuing global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in market disruptions, as well as\nextremely difficult operating conditions for business owners and investors.\nWe are incredibly proud of our steadfast resilience in difficult circumstances. During our 40-year history, we have\nexperienced and succeeded through many crises by staying resilient, prudently managing risks, and capturing\nopportunities. Naturally, this experience and pride is rooted in our people and our business partners who have made\nthis all possible.\nFinancial performance\nWe are pleased to report yet another strong year of growth for Investcorp. Our sights are firmly set on the continued\npursuit of long-term growth, as we respond to the evolving needs of our expanding and diversifying client base.\nOver the last year, we have continued to carefully diversify the business to offer a greater range of options for our\nclients than ever before – across both our suite of products and our global geographies. Despite rising inflation and\nongoing economic headwinds, during the past year the business delivered 14% growth in AUM and reached a record\nhigh of US$42.7 billion.\nThe results were driven by robust levels of activity across our core businesses of private equity, real estate, credit\nmanagement and absolute return investments. This resulted in delivering a net profit attributable to the equity holders\nof Investcorp’s parent company of US$135 million compared to US$124 million in FY21 and diluted earnings per\nshare of US$1.31 compared to US$1.34 per share in FY21.\nThis growth reflects the increasing demand for our products across our business lines and the trust that our clients\nand business partners place in us. We continue to carefully identify robust business models in the businesses that\nwe invest in, which when coupled with their strong leadership and management teams enable us to be confident\nsupporting them through times of growth or diversification. To maintain our forward-looking approach, we have\ncontinued to introduce innovations such as our blockchain fund. We also continued to further develop our ESG\n01\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\npolicies and commitments and look to drive value for the communities in which we invest, our employees, as well as\nfor our shareholders.\nTotal shareholders’ equity (excluding non-controlling interests) increased 3% to US$1,314 million, compared to the\npast financial year’s US$1,270 million and total assets were US$2,295 million – a decrease from US$2,391 million.\nThe FY22 recommendation for distribution of preferred and ordinary dividends is US$ 57 million in aggregate with\nthe proposed ordinary dividend being US$ 0.30 per share. In terms of fundraising, we have reached a record high of\nUS$7.4 billion raised across private and institutional clients for new deal-by-deal offerings, fund products and also by\nthe SPAC company IPOs that we sponsored, as well as the pricing/issuance and resets of several CLOs.\nWhile market challenges undoubtedly remain, with the ebbs and flows of the market creating volatility for investors\nand businesses alike, we are making strong progress against our Long-Term Range Plan goal of US$100 billion in\nAUM and continue to drive forward with a continuing focus on delivering sustainable growth across the business.\nStrategic expansion continued amidst challenging market conditions\nWe have continued to expand our geographical footprint across the globe. Successes in the United States includes the\nopening of our Los Angeles office and the launch of a private infrastructure investment business. Investcorp has also\ndelivered growth in the Asian markets, with our first India domestic fundraising, NDR Warehousing Private Limited.\nAdditionally, in the Middle East, we launched the Investcorp Saudi Pre-IPO Growth Fund.\nWe have also diversified our offering to better navigate an unstable market. In the last twelve months, we successfully\nsponsored two NASDAQ listed IPOs. Both SPAC IPOs were oversubscribed and generated gross proceeds of over\nUS$600 million in aggregate. We have been monitoring the environment to create new products in line with market\ntrends. We have launched the first dedicated institutional blockchain and Shariah-compliant fund based in the GCC –\nto maximize our reach and ensure that we are providing tailored products to match our investors’ needs. Furthermore,\nwe held the final close of the Investcorp Strategic Capital Partners Fund with capital commitments of US$620 million.\nMoreover, we have pursued several initiatives across business sectors, including the ‘Investcorp Insurance Solutions’\nplatform, our newly formed business line that will focus on providing investment management services to meet the\nunique investment needs of insurers. Another example of diversification efforts includes our recent joint venture with\nUnited Talent Agency which is focused on making growth investments at the intersection of Web 3.0 and the “creator\neconomy”.\nResponsible Business\nOver the last financial year, Investcorp has made significant progress in our Environmental, Social and Governance\n(ESG) and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) efforts, where we have sought to build a firmwide program that, at\nits heart, seeks to deliver better results for all our stakeholders.\nOur resolute commitment to environmental and social responsibility forms a core component of our strategy, values\nand culture. This is in part reflected by the significant additional time and resources that we have devoted to these\nefforts, adding two full time employees into the ESG team, reporting into the firm’s Head of ESG, to enhance our\nglobal ESG capabilities and ultimately nurture behaviors that facilitate responsible investment decisions, sustainable\nbusiness operations, and better employment practices.\nAs an investment manager, we believe that our greatest lever to create impact is through the investments we make.\nOur revised Responsible Investment policy, which was launched in 2021 as part of an overarching ESG policy\nframework, guides our entire investment process from deal screening through portfolio stewardship and exit. Core to\nour approach is ongoing engagement with the management teams of our underlying portfolio companies, to firstly\nhelp them gain a good understanding of the material ESG risks and opportunities that are relevant to them, and to\nsubsequently work with them to monitor and improve performance on the most material issues – we believe that this\napproach will sustainably unlock additional value over the course of our investment.\nWe are also looking inward at our own business and are actively taking steps to improve the ESG performance of\nInvestcorp as a company. For instance, this past year we conducted the firm’s first ever carbon footprint assessment\nto measure, monitor and mitigate our environmental impact, and will drive further improvements over the coming\nyear.\n02\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nEqually important is responsible employment practices, which is another core business imperative for Investcorp. We\nhave long believed that a diverse workforce is an essential ingredient to delivering strong performance and positive\neconomic development. Through our DE&I initiatives, we have continued to promote a more inclusive recruitment\nprocess and work environment, and we’re particularly proud of our 2021 Recruitment Policy, for instance, where we\nhave pledged that 50% of our shortlisted candidates must come from diverse backgrounds.\nWe are encouraged by the steps we have taken in the past year – building on the initiatives outlined in our inaugural\n2021 Responsible Business report – to create sustainable economic value for our investors and other stakeholders.\nAs we go into the new fiscal year, we will look to scale projects that are already under way and launch new value\nenhancing initiatives.\nInvestcorp is an institution built to last, operated by a diverse and multiskilled talent pool. We are confident in\nour ability to remain diligent in our approach towards responsible investing and to further challenge ourselves to\ncontinually improve. Naturally, this will always be a work in progress as a rigorous approach requires constant\nevaluation and measurement, in pursuit of our corporate purpose to sustainably enrich the lives of future generations.\nOutlook\nThe past few years have been tumultuous. We have seen volatility across economies, geopolitics, public health and\nsocieties across the world. It is undeniable that in these fluid conditions it is imperative for us to remain nimble and\nadaptive to overcome adversity. We recognize the ongoing challenges such as rising inflation, supply chain disruptions\nand the energy and commodity crises that are impacting countries around the world. We see some businesses and\nsocieties struggling – but we also see significant resilience and strength.\nWhilst the short-term macro-economic and geopolitical outlook remains uncertain, we are confident that our\nexceptional people and resilient business model will enable us to navigate challenges efficiently to reach our US$50\nbillion in AUM medium-term objective and our US$100 billion in AUM longer-term objective. As a business, we have\nweathered difficult market conditions in the past and we remain focused and ambitious in our growth strategy. As a\nresponsible investment manager, we will continue to seek opportunities to drive yield and returns for our investors. As\nan investor and strategic partner, we will continue to advise and support our portfolio companies.\nAs we enter the next financial year, we will continue to rely on our expertise and learnings, and carefully monitor the\nenvironment to identify challenges and opportunities - as well as continuously adapt our approach to business while\nstaying true to our values. We have embedded dynamism and entrepreneurial thinking across the firm and together,\nwith your support, we are confident in our ability to navigate the challenges to come and continue to thrive in the\nlong-term.\nDr. Yousef Hamad Al-Ebraheem Mohammed Mahfoodh Alardhi\nChairman of the Board of Directors Executive Chairman\n03\nIINNVVEESSTTCCOORRPP AANNNNUUAALL RREEPPOORRTT 22002222\nBUSINESS REVIEW\n044\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCONTENTS\n06 Business Review\n06 Message from the Executive Chairman\n06 Business Highlights\n22 Discussion of Results\n30 Assets Under Management\n33 Portfolio Review\nFigures throughout may not add up due to rounding.\n05\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nBUSINESS REVIEW\nWe are delighted to report another strong year of growth for Investcorp, as we pursue our long-term growth strategy and\nrespond to the evolving needs of our growing and diversifying client base.\nOver the last year, we continued to diversify our business to offer a greater range of options for our clients than ever before\n– across both our suite of products and our global geographies.

The IHL Series A Preference Shares, the IHL Series B\nPreference Shares and the IHL Series E Preference Shares owned by Investcorp Holdings entitle it to 100% of the\neconomic interest in IHL and, therefore, 100% of the economic interest in the 98.4% of the book value of the\nInvestcorp Group’s consolidated assets owned directly and/or indirectly by ISA.\nUnder the Articles of Association of IHL, in the event of the occurrence of any event, or a series of events, of an\nadverse nature that are reasonably likely to materially impair Investcorp Holdings’ ability to perform its obligations,\ncause a change of control of Investcorp Holdings or prevent it from continuing normal business activities, the\nDesignated Representatives, who are certain of Investcorp Holdings’ senior executive officers and certain of\nInvestcorp Holdings’ Directors, have the power to declare that an ‘investment protection event’ has occurred.\nExamples of circumstances that would constitute an ‘investment protection event’ include the hostile invasion of\nBahrain by the forces of a foreign state, the nationalization of Investcorp Holdings or substantial interference in\nthe conduct of business that is reasonably likely to result in a material adverse change in the business, operations,\nassets or financial condition of Investcorp Holdings.\nShould the Designated Representatives declare that an investment protection event has occurred, the IHL Series A\nPreference Shares, the IHL Series B Preference Shares and the IHL Series E Preference shares held by Investcorp\nHoldings will be automatically redeemed for nominal consideration. If the investment protection event is not\ntemporary, IHL will issue shares and cause them to be delivered to the shareholders of Investcorp Holdings so that\neach shareholder will own shares directly in IHL that are economically equivalent in all respects to the shares that\nthey own in Investcorp Holdings.\n58\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE,\nBALANCE\nSHEET\nAND\nRISK\nMANAGEMENT\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nOverview\nInvestcorp views corporate governance as the manner in which members of the Board of Directors, shareholders,\ninvestors, management and employees of Investcorp are organized and how they operate in practice. Good corporate\ngovernance involves keeping business practice above reproach and thus retaining the trust and confidence of all the\nstakeholders who enable Investcorp to operate, thrive and prosper.\nInvestcorp makes large investments in mostly illiquid asset classes such as corporate and real estate investments.\nThrough its regulated subsidiaries in the various jurisdictions where it operates, it places a large proportion of these\ninvestments with clients and retains a portion for its own balance sheet. These investment activities operate with\nabove- average risk levels and have led to the development of a comprehensive risk management infrastructure and\nstrong corporate governance over the past 40 years. Investcorp’s corporate governance practices have been structured\naround the following three principles:\ni. alignment of interests among shareholders, clients and management combined with protection of lenders’ interests;\nii. transparency of reporting and actions plus proactive risk control; and\niii. collective decision-making.\nAt June 30, 2022, Investcorp Holdings’ corporate governance was subject to the Bahrain Ministry of Industry and\nCommerce Corporate Governance Code (‘Governance Code’). Please see the Fiscal Year 2022 Corporate Governance\nReport for disclosure regarding Investcorp’s compliance with the Governance Code.\ni. Alignment of interests. A central tenet of Investcorp’s philosophy is to ensure that interests among shareholders, clients\nand management are optimally aligned and that lender interests are well protected. The diagram below summarizes the\nkey factors that drive this alignment.\nGood alignment of interest between key stakeholders\nClients\n29.66% of company\nowned by a group of 55\nstrategic shareholders\nMost shareholders are also clients Management typically co-invests alongside clients\nthat are highly regarded\nBalance sheet co-invests alongside client Carry-based incentive compensation programs\nthroughout the Gulf and are\nstrong brand ambassadors\nof Investcorp\nIndependent board of directors\nManagement invests in shares through IIP Management has 27.86%\nShareholders Management beneficial ownership of company\nOwnership structure and Ownership structure and\ncreditor protection mechanism creditor protection mechanism\nLenders\n59\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE, BALANCE SHEET AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe alignment of interest is ensured by the following mechanisms:\nCo-investments: Clients of the Investcorp Group, shareholders and management all participate in each of Investcorp’s\ninvestment products. Investcorp retains a stake in each private equity, real estate and strategic capital transaction or\nfund, placing the balance with clients through its regulated subsidiaries in the various jurisdictions where it operates.\nInvestcorp also invests a portion of its assets in the products of the Investcorp Group’s credit management business\nand in the absolute return investment products of Investcorp-Tages Limited. Hence, through ownership of Investcorp,\nshareholders indirectly participate in each of the investment products.\nIn addition, some of Investcorp’s employees typically co-invest alongside the Investcorp Group clients and Investcorp in\nthese investment products. As a result, all three groups are collectively exposed to the same risks and share the same\noutcomes. This emphasis on co-investment ensures that all stakeholders are motivated to grow Investcorp and enhance\nits value through the generation of superior risk-adjusted returns in each of the Investcorp Group products.\nPerformance-based incentive compensation: In addition, consistent with industry practice, Investcorp’s investment\nprofessionals participate in performance-based investment carried interest programs whereby a certain variable portion\nof exit proceeds due to investors from the realization of their investments is shared with the investment professionals,\nprovided that a certain pre-established minimum client investment performance objective is satisfied on the underlying\ninvestment.\nIn addition, the overall compensation paid to members of senior management and other Investcorp executives is highly\ncorrelated with Investcorp’s net income. Investcorp’s net income is driven by its ability to acquire, place, manage and\nrealize investments and realize gains from investments on its balance sheet (franchise value). The franchise value, in\nturn, depends on management’s ability to provide long-term value to the Investcorp Group clients and shareholders and\nprotection for its creditors.\nFurthermore, all of Investcorp’s employees at the level of Vice President, Principal and Managing Director who are\nabove designated levels of remuneration are required to defer a percentage of their variable (incentive) remuneration\nand utilize a portion of that deferred remuneration to purchase indirect beneficial interests in Investcorp Holdings’\nOrdinary Shares through the ISOPs or into the Deferred Cash Program (‘DCP’). Both programs are subject to vesting\nrequirements.\nAdditionally, certain of Investcorp’s management and employees have been invited to participate in the ownership of\nindirect beneficial interests in Investcorp Holdings’ Ordinary Shares through the IIPs.\nIn this manner, Investcorp’s executive compensation and share participation programs play a critical role in aligning\nmanagement’s interests with the interests of shareholders, clients and lenders.\nThe aggregate amount of compensation paid to senior management in respect of Fiscal Year 2022, including variable\nremuneration that is required to be deferred and utilized to purchase indirect beneficial interests in Ordinary Shares\nthat are subject to vesting requirements, is disclosed in Note 24 of the consolidated financial statements of Investcorp\nHoldings.\nThe names of the members of Senior Management and information regarding their roles within Investcorp and their\nprofessional backgrounds is included in the Senior Management section of this Annual Report.\nFurther information regarding the Investcorp Group’s remuneration policies and practices is provided in the Fiscal Year\n2022 Corporate Governance Report.\nii. Transparency and risk control. Transparency at Investcorp involves the open and proactive discussion of issues\nand problems with all stakeholders. The role and nature of the Board of Directors and its Standing Committees and\nInvestcorp’s management structure are vital elements of an Investcorp Group-wide framework for mitigating risks,\nallocating resources and making decisions with full accountability based on all relevant information.\n60\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE,\nBALANCE\nSHEET\nAND\nRISK\nMANAGEMENT\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nBoard of Directors\nUnder the Articles of Association of Investcorp Holdings the Board of Directors consists of not less than five and not\nmore than 15 Directors, and the number of Directors is determined by shareholder resolution. Following the resignation\nof Mr. John Fraser on November 5, 2021, there are, as at June 30, 2022, 14 Directors.

Investcorp’s Finance group has oversight and responsibility for management of the balance sheet structure and\nimplements strategy and policies within a framework set by the Financial and Risk Management Committee (FRMC),\nunder the oversight of the Board of Directors’ Audit and Risk Committee and the Board of Directors.\nThis conservative approach to balance sheet management is a deliberate strategy to mitigate the impact of refinancing\nand liquidity risk on Investcorp’s core business model of originating and syndicating alternative asset investments, and\nits ongoing commitment to stakeholder alignment by way of co-investing its balance sheet alongside investors in all its\nproducts. It also seeks to mitigate the impact on the business from market liquidity stresses or forced refinancing of\ndebt facilities during sustained periods of economic difficulty. It therefore targets to finance its entire portfolio of illiquid\nco-investments with permanent capital (equity), long dated debt and also debt secured by such co-investments.\nRatings\nInvestcorp recognizes the value of an investment-grade rating and is aiming for that objective over the medium term.\nRating agencies and lenders profile Investcorp as non-Gulf based credit risk, given that almost all of the Group’s assets\nare held under Investcorp S.A., a non-Gulf entity. As a matter of course, certain debt covenants require that Investcorp\nSome of the key themes referred to by the rating agencies in their reports are:\nl strong client franchise with a high degree of brand name recognition and respect in the Gulf region;\nl diversification benefits inherent to the business model from an increasingly globalized distribution platform and the\nestablishment and growth of new business lines;\nl the strength and longevity of tenure of the management team; and\nl the conservative balance sheet management approach for liquidity, funding and capital.\nFollowing the global financial crisis in FY09, rating agencies have repeatedly pointed to Investcorp’s balance sheet\nrisk arising from co-investment activities as a significant source of potential earnings and leverage stress in extreme\nscenarios. Rating agencies have also highlighted the negative impact from the global spread of the coronavirus on\ninvestment valuations. Investcorp recognized these challenges by deleveraging and strengthening its balance sheet\nthrough risk reduction and capital raising measures to support an eventual return to an investment grade credit rating\nin the future.\nLiquidity management\nInvestcorp targets an adequate level of accessible liquidity to meet peak levels of underwriting activity, operational cash\nto cover near term operating expenses and interest payments; and contractual debt repayments. This is achieved by a\ncombination of on-balance sheet liquidity, held in the form of invested short tenor liquid assets and off-balance sheet\nliquidity in the form of committed medium-term revolving credit facilities provided by close relationship banks. Such\nfacilities are mainly used in the normal course of business for acquisition underwriting of new corporate investment or\nreal estate investment deals prior to placement with clients, which takes place after the deal is closed. Bank revolvers,\ntherefore, supplement core liquidity, and together they provide a pool of accessible liquidity to underwrite multiple\nacquisitions, without having to redeem or dispose of co-investments to meet short-term working capital requirements.\nThe credit environment, lender preferences and the reliability of interbank markets will dictate the actual mix between\noff- balance sheet and on-balance sheet liquidity that Investcorp chooses to hold at any particular time.\nInvestcorp stress tests its liquidity on a regular basis to ensure that it has sufficient cash in the near-term to meet\nunforeseen obligations. This worst-case stress scenario assumes the disappearance of almost all short-term funding\nsources; and a need to provide additional capital support to portfolio companies.\n70\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE,\nBALANCE\nSHEET\nAND\nRISK\nMANAGEMENT\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nFunding structure\nThe conservative approach to balance sheet structure is also applied to Investcorp’s funding activity. Investcorp’s\nstrategy is to maintain strong lender relationships, provide lenders with regular dialogue on business developments and\nfinancial results, and to be responsive on issues and questions that arise. A prudent approach to financial management\nhas led to a deliberate strategy to secure long- and medium-term funding from a geographically diverse lender base.\nInvestcorp has a positive structural funding gap where the average maturity of liabilities has consistently been longer\nthan the average maturity of its assets. This has been achieved from the traditional global medium-term club and\nsyndicated bank loan markets, together with capital markets transactions such as public bonds and private placements\nwith institutional investors.\nRefinancing requirements are managed to avoid maturity concentration in any given period, and the Company continually\nreviews opportunities to access new financing markets or sources with new funding products.\nInvestcorp’s medium-term funding therefore comprises committed bank facilities (drawn and revolving), an Islamic term\nloan, capital markets notes and bonds. When the financing environment permits, this pool is targeted to have staggered\nmaturities to reduce repayment or refinancing concentration and to match the medium-term nature of Investcorp’s\nworking capital cycle. Investcorp’s long-term funding comprises private placements with international insurers with\nresidual maturities of approximately 10 years.\nA combination of high liquidity and committed term funding with actively managed maturities aims to provide adequate\ncoverage, in a worst-case scenario, for all near- and medium-term debt repayments.\nLeverage\nConsistent with its overall conservative approach to balance sheet management, Investcorp aims to maintain a\nmoderate leverage ratio, using debt where appropriate and ensuring a sufficient amount of accessible liquidity for peak\nunderwriting of new acquisitions. The de-leveraging initiatives of the last few years have reduced leverage to 0.5x equity\nwith FY20 been impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.\nInvestcorp’s debt covenants contain a ‘leverage’ and a ‘net leverage’ calculation.\nLeverage is calculated as total liabilities (excluding temporary liabilities that are generally transient in nature)\ndivided by the equity capital base. The drawdown of revolving credit facilities to fund the underwriting of corporate\ninvestments and real estate investments before they are placed with clients temporarily inflates total liabilities.\nThese are self-liquidating on receipt of client funds and Investcorp does not count these temporary liabilities in its\nleverage calculations\nThe leverage calculation above reflects a very basic measure of financial risk. It does not give any benefit to the fact\nthat a proportion of borrowed money may be retained in the form of cash. Net leverage however calculates leverage\nas total liabilities less the sum of balance sheet cash, other liquid assets and funded underwriting.\nInvestcorp is comfortable with its leverage levels, given that a continuous and thorough analysis of risks on the balance\nsheet is used to determine and ensure capital adequacy under severely stressed scenarios.\nWhile Investcorp does manage its balance sheet with the leverage ratio in mind, it also focuses on risk capital, which is, in\nInvestcorp’s opinion, a more holistic measure of the risks on the balance sheet and is described in the following section on\nRisk Management. Investcorp aims to size its capital base so it can withstand a prolonged stressed environment as well as\nevent risks, while maintaining cash flow and liquidity, sufficient to cover interest and debt repayment obligations.\n71\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE, BALANCE SHEET AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nInvestcorp takes an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, and the proactive identification and mitigation of all\nembedded risks is an integral part of the corporate decision-making process.\nThe Asset and Liability Council (‘ALCO’) which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes the Head of Risk\nManagement and other senior members of Investcorp, assesses and reviews various balance sheet risks arising from\ntreasury activities on an on-going basis and decides on mitigation strategies for these risks. The ALCO is overseen by\nthe Financial and Risk Management Committee, which is the risk management oversight committee that evaluates\nall tactical actions proposed and undertaken to manage the balance sheet and attendant risks from the standpoint of\nInvestcorp’s business model, funding profile, liquidity position, capital base and on-going operations in line with the\nAudit and Risk Committee and Board approved risk policies manual. In addition, separate risk review forums are used\nfor each line of business to determine specific risks surrounding each new investment, and actions to be taken in an\neffort to mitigate these risks.\nTYPES OF RISK1\nInvestcorp groups its predominant risks under the following categories:\nl counterparty credit risk Note 22(i)*1;\nl credit risk measurement Note 22(ii)*;\nl funding liquidity risk Note 22(iii)*;\nl concentration risk Note 22(iv)*;\nl foreign currency risk Note 22(v)(a)*;\nl interest rate risk Note 22(v)(b)*;\nl equity price risk Note 22(v)(c)*; and\nl operational risk Note 22(vi)*.\nInvestcorp has developed tools in conjunction with leading risk management consultants to perform detailed risk\nanalysis, specifically addressing the investment and concentration risks of each individual line of business.\nCredit risk management\nInvestcorp faces credit risk primarily through the activities such as placement of liquidity with counterparties, fair\nvalue of derivatives and hedging contracts, client related receivables, loans and advances to corporate structures and\nemployee compensation program related receivables. Investcorp monitors credit exposures by classifying exposures,\nestablishing credit limits, triggering a review and corrective action in case of credit deviations, and continually assessing\nthe creditworthiness of counterparties. The details of credit exposures on the balance sheet at June 30, 2022 is shown\nin Note 22(i)* of the financial statements of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C (c).\nInterest rate/currency risk management\nAssets and liabilities give rise to interest rate risk if changes to the level of interest rates impact the value of future cash\nflows generated from assets or the value of future cash flows paid in respect of liabilities. The exposure of Investcorp’s\nbalance sheet to interest rate risk is frequently measured and monitored using risk management tools that provide in-\ndepth analysis across investment and funding sources. The amount of interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet at\nJune 30, 2022 is shown in Note 22(v)(b)* of the financial statements of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C (c).\n1 * References are to footnotes in the fiscal 2022 Investcorp Holdings B.S.C. (c) consolidated financial statements.\n72\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE,\nBALANCE\nSHEET\nAND\nRISK\nMANAGEMENT\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nInvestcorp’s management team maintains a strategic position, unchanged from prior years, that shareholders’ equity\nis best protected from interest rate risk in the long run by maintaining a floating rate funding strategy. Overlaying this\nstrategy, Investcorp uses a combination of interest rate derivatives in order to protect against large movements in\ninterest rates, while at the same time preserving the benefit of potential lower rates.\nInvestcorp does not take any material foreign exchange positions on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies\nother than US dollars. Investcorp systematically hedges significant non-dollar asset and liability exposures in the\nforward foreign exchange market or by using currency derivatives. The small amount of residual net foreign currency\nexposure is shown in Note 22(v)(a)* of the consolidated financial statements of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C (c).\nLine of business investment risks\nPrivate equity investment. Private equity investment risk is a significant component of the balance sheet and is,\ntherefore, a key focus of analysis for the risk management team. The investment risk that is particular to the mid-\ncap private equity investment – North America, Europe, Asia & India business is mitigated by a set of tools that are\nused at all stages of the investment process. At pre-acquisition, the risk management team works alongside the deal\nteam to implement risk analyses based on the target company’s business plan. This enables identification of how the\ntarget company might perform under various scenarios, focusing, where appropriate, on specific characteristics of the\ndeal. Sensitivity analysis and risk contribution of identified drivers to the main outcomes (EBITDA, IRR) are essential\nelements of the risk assessment. The analysis is performed in addition to the extensive due diligence undertaken by the\nprivate equity investment team and enables the measurement of the target company’s risk compared to previous deals\nundertaken by Investcorp, as well as the fit of the target company from a client portfolio and balance sheet retention\nperspective.\nAll investment proposals are scrutinized rigorously by the Investment Committee prior to final approval by the Investment\nCouncil.\nOnce a company is acquired, Investcorp takes a portfolio approach to evaluate the risk impact of the investment on\nthe balance sheet. The risk management team regularly performs such risk analyses to ascertain how the risks of\nthe portfolio change over time and how it relates to internal limits and guidelines. Individual underwriting and sector\nexposure limits are imposed in order to manage any concentration risks. Finally, when exiting a portfolio company,\nhedging strategies may be used to mitigate risks associated with the exit process and to protect the expected realization\nproceeds from downside risks.\nAs in Investcorp’s private equity investment – North America, Europe, Asia & India business, the investment objective\nin each of the technology and MENA funds is to achieve returns that justify the risk being taken. The higher risks of\ntechnology and MENA investing are alleviated through board level representation with appropriate minority protections.\nThroughout the investment cycle, there is a strong emphasis on due diligence and proactive post-investment management.\nAbsolute Return Investments. ARI multi-manager solutions’ portfolio risk is managed both from a market strategy and\nmanager selection perspective. The most prevalent market risks emanate from an unfavorable market environment\nor from strategy-specific risks such as illiquidity. Manager risks include style drift, underperformance, excessive risk\ntaking, fraud/valuation errors and legal/documentation errors. These risks are mitigated through manager due diligence\nand selection, diversification, use of separate accounts, monitoring, stress testing, transparency and control of leverage.\nThe availability of portfolio detail, including through pre-negotiated transparency with hedge funds managers, enables\na more complete risk analysis, as well as meaningful strategy-specific exposure and profit attribution analyses.\nThe risk management function monitors and analyses ARI portfolios independent of the investment team. Among the\nrisks monitored are basis risk, concentration risk, scenario risk and tail risk. The function also conducts analysis on\nstrategy and asset class, stress tests and historical scenarios, exposure by strategy, security type, sectors, regions and\ncounterparty exposure and liquidity.\nWhile investment in ARI is designed to have a low level of correlation to various markets, liquidity can temporarily\ndecrease during periods of extreme stress, and correlations between previously uncorrelated strategies may increase,\nas occurred during March 2020, last quarter of calendar year 2008 and occurred to a lesser extent during 2011. The\n73\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE, BALANCE SHEET AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nARI team is mindful of these risks and has incorporated specific actions in its asset allocation, monitoring guidelines\nand separate accounts in order to cushion or mitigate these risks during periods of extreme market volatility and stress.\nReal estate investment. Risk management strategies used for private equity investment are also employed to mitigate\nrisks associated with the acquisition and retention of real estate investments. The real estate investment team further\nmitigates specific risk in three ways:\nl concentration on high quality, income producing properties with high occupancy rates;\nl establishment of partnerships with regional professionals, providing access to local knowledge and reputation; and\nl use of capital structures aimed at protecting properties against the negative impact of interest rate and/or occupancy\nfluctuations.\nTo this end, the team monitors interest rate and occupancy sensitivities on each property, both prior to acquisition\nand during the ownership phase. This process serves to identify and assess conditions and levels that may cause the\nproperty to incur cash flow difficulties.\nThe team is proactive in managing properties that show signs of potential difficulties. Risk management tools are used\nat all stages of the real estate investment process from pre-acquisition through to realization. During pre-acquisition,\nthe risk management team works alongside the real estate investment team to implement a detailed risk analysis based\non the target investment’s financial projections. This allows identification of how the property might perform under\nvarious scenarios, focusing, where appropriate, on specific characteristics of the investment. In addition to this analysis,\nthe extensive due diligence undertaken by the real estate team allows Investcorp to gauge the target property’s risk\ncompared to previous deals undertaken, as well as to gauge the fit of the target property from both client portfolio and\nbalance sheet retention perspectives.\nOnce an investment is made, Investcorp takes a portfolio approach to evaluate the risk impact of the investment on\nthe balance sheet. The risk management team regularly performs such risk analyses to ascertain how the risks of the\nportfolio change over time and how they relate to internal investment exposure limits and guidelines.\nCredit management investment. The credit management line of business investment risk represents risks primarily\nassociated with collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), and the underlying credit investment, managed by the investment\nteam.\nThe investment team follows investment policy guidelines to screen new investment opportunities and identify any\nactual or potentially material risk during the pre-investment due diligence phase. The investment team also checks for\ncompliance with applicable local and international laws and regulations and, where appropriate, relevant international\nstandards. The investment team monitors performance of underlying investments against agreed action plans, targets\nand timetables.\nRisk management systematically assesses and reports on fund exposures including rating actions, price movements,\nsector exposures and performance, as well as portfolio management actions.\nDuring the warehouse and risk retention phase, Investcorp takes a portfolio approach to evaluate the impact of the\ninvestment on the balance sheet to continually assess the exposures relative to the internal investment exposure limits\nand guidelines. Risk management runs multiple scenarios based on varying assumptions for prepayments, defaults\nand recoveries to assess how the portfolio would behave under different market cycles. The impact on cash flows from\nratings downgrade and default of specific loans is also assessed to measure the downside risk in the portfolio.\nOperational risk management\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or\nfrom external events (such as natural disasters, changes in regulation or outsourcing of operations). Investcorp includes\nin this definition legal risk but excludes reputational and strategic risks.\n74\nCORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE,\nBALANCE\nSHEET\nAND\nRISK\nMANAGEMENT\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nWhile operational risks cannot be entirely eliminated, they are managed and mitigated by ensuring that appropriate\ninfrastructure, controls, systems, procedures and trained and competent people are in place throughout Investcorp.\nInternal audit makes regular, independent appraisals of the control environment in all identified risk areas. Contingency\narrangements, which are tested from time to time, are also in place to support operations in the event of a range of\npossible disaster scenarios. In addition, Investcorp carries ‘Errors and Omissions’ insurance against the legal risks\narising from its business.\nThe operational risk management framework adapted by Investcorp consists of the following: 1) ‘Risk Control and\nSelf-Assessment’: Self- assess operational risks by going through key business processes end-to-end, 2) Evaluate the\nadequacy of existing process controls, 3) Implement control modifications to reduce operational risks and determine\nresidual risks and 4) Monitor and report operational risk events to senior management.\nMaterial operational risks are escalated and reviewed by senior management via a formal governance process. This\nincludes documenting of root cause analysis of risk events and associated control remediation actions.\nAn inventory of risk events is maintained which facilitates a “look-across” of historical events aimed at identifying\npotential thematic issues – this process enables Investcorp to minimize the risk of repeated control issues.\nAdequacy of capital\nInvestcorp uses an enterprise VaR-like approach to determine capital adequacy for the combination of all balance sheet\nrisks, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to facilitate future growth plans and protect against periods of prolonged\nand extreme stress in the company’s operating environment, execution or performance.\nInvestcorp uses a risk-based capital allocation approach as the main tool to manage capital adequacy. Over the years,\nInvestcorp has been continuously assessing its capital adequacy methodology to take into account any increased risk\npremium, volatility and correlation for all asset classes. In designing the risk capital methodology, Investcorp strives\nto maintain a risk capital allocation that is independent of any specific market recovery expectations, accounting rule\nchanges and correlation assumptions. Investcorp continues to use the conservative assumption of 100% correlation\nbetween asset classes to provide an embedded cushion for protection against model risk inherent in model choice,\nmodel parameters estimation and model errors. Most importantly, the correlation constraint allows for an embedded\ncushion that will be counter-cyclical, since it is set for crisis like situations when asset correlation goes to one. Investcorp\nalso applies the requirement to establish an explicit equity capital surplus (equal to total book equity capital including\ndeferred fees minus total capital charges) that is set and monitored by ALCO. The capital surplus covers new business\ninitiatives, residual non-legal operational risk and market tail-risk stress events and provides for a buffer against potential\nexposures, as opposed to already capitalized existing exposures, under normal and stressed market conditions. Reviews\nof these risks and the adequacy of the capital allocation model and equity capital surplus are conducted on a regular\nbasis. The risk management team applies back-testing and stress-testing methodologies to continually assess the\nadequacy of the capital allocation model for each business line.\nThis approach to capital adequacy takes into account the illiquid nature of the underlying portfolios of private equity,\ncredit and real estate co-investments and, where possible, models other non-investment assets using a collateral\nbased VaR like model. The capital allocation is the linear sum of independently assessed risk capital charges for each\ninvestment asset, non-investment assets (receivables, advances, etc.) and the positive impact of any tail risk hedging\nstrategies executed for the Investcorp balance sheet.\n75\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nInvestcorp Holdings B.S.C.

(CLOSED)\nREPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOpinion\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C. (closed) (“the Company”) and\nits subsidiaries (together “the Group”), which comprise of the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30\nJune 2022, and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of other comprehensive income,\nconsolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes\nto the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated\nfinancial position of the Group as at 30 June 2022, and its consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows\nfor the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).\nBasis of Opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those\nstandards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nsection of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for\nAccountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards)\n(IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements\nin the Kingdom of Bahrain, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements\nand the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis\nfor our opinion.\nOther Information Included in the Group’s 2022 Annual Report\nOther information consists of the information included in the Group’s 2022 Annual Report, other than the consolidated\nfinancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. Prior\nto the date of this auditor’s report, we have obtained the following sections of the Group’s 2022 Annual Report, and the\nremaining sections are expected to be made available to us after that date.\n• Report of the Board of Directors;\n• Business Highlights;\n• Discussion of Results;\n• Assets Under Management; and\n• Portfolio Review\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form\nof assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information\nidentified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated\nfinancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on\nthe work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of the auditor’s report, we conclude that\nthere is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report\nin this regard.\nResponsibilities of the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements\nin accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the\npreparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis\nof accounting unless Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic\nalternative but to do so.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs\nwill always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered\n78\nCONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL\nSTATEMENTS:\nINVESTCORP\nHOLDINGS\nB.S.C.\n(C)\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users\ntaken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism\nthroughout the audit. We also:\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud\nor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient\nand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from\nfraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate\nin the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related\ndisclosures made by the Board of Directors.\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based\non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast\nsignificant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty\nexists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit\nevidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to\ncease to continue as a going concern.\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the\ndisclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a\nmanner that achieves fair presentation.\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities\nwithin the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,\nsupervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\nWe communicate with the Audit and Risk Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the\naudit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\nWe report that:\na) as required by the Bahrain Commercial Companies Law,\nI. the Company has maintained proper accounting records and the consolidated financial statements are in agreement\ntherewith;\nII. the financial information contained in the Report of the Board of Directors is consistent with the consolidated\nfinancial statements; and\nIII. satisfactory explanations and information have been provided to us by management in response to all our requests.\nb) we are not aware of any violations of the Bahrain Commercial Companies Law or the terms of the Company’s\nmemorandum and articles of association during the year ended 30 June 2022 that might have had a material adverse\neffect on the business of the Company or on its consolidated financial position.\nc) as required by Article 8 of section 2 of chapter 1 of the Bahrain Corporate Governance Code, we report that the\nCompany:\nI. has appointed a Corporate Governance Officer; and\nII. has a board approved written guidance and procedures for corporate governance.\nPartner’s Registration No. 117\n30 July 2022\nManama, Kingdom of Bahrain\n79\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C.

An\nexample of a material event would be where a sale is imminent and credible bids have been received from third parties or\nvaluations have been received from banks engaged in the sale process. In these cases, the fair value would be established\nwith reference to the range of bids received and based on management’s assessment of the most likely realization value\nwithin that range. Another example of a material event would be where an arm’s length financing transaction has occurred\nrecently that is (a) material in nature, (b) involves third parties, and (c) attaches an implicit value to the company. In the\nevent that such a recent third-party measure of specific fair value for an individual investment is not available, the fair\nvalue is determined by using a multiples-based approach applied to the most recent and relevant operating performance\nmetric of the underlying company, typically EBITDA and sometimes sales. The multiple used is taken from a universe of\ncomparable publicly listed companies, recent M&A transactions involving comparable companies, and Discounted Cash\nFlow (“DCF”) analysis.\nManagement exercises its judgment in choosing the most appropriate multiple, on a consistent basis, from within the\nuniverse referred to above.\nOf the above, co-investments amounting to $35.1 million (June 30, 2021: $32.2 million) are classified as FVOCI\ninvestments. For FVOCI investments, during the year, a gain of $2.7 million (2021: loss of $5 million) was recognized in\nother comprehensive income and $0.6 million (2021: losses of $27.6 million) of gains were recycled to retained earnings\non derecognition.\n10 (B) CREDIT MANAGEMENT CO-INVESTMENTS\n$millions 2022 2021\nEuropean CLO Investments 180 238\nRisk Retention Fund 11 14\nOther credit management investments 15 3\nTotal 206 255\n96\n\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C. (CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nThe fair value of the Group’s ARI co-investments is determined based on the net asset value of the underlying funds as\nreported by the administrators of these funds. Significant controls are built into the determination of the net asset values\nof the various investments, including the appointment of third party independent fund administrators, use of separate\naccounts for increased transparency and an independent verification of the prices of underlying securities through a\ndedicated operational risk group unit.\nThe valuations of the Group’s ARI co-investments which are classified under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note\n23) are closely monitored by the Group. Management holds regular discussions with the investment managers and uses\npricing which is reflective of the investment’s fair value.\nOf the above, co-investments amounting to $4 million (June 30, 2021: $5.3 million) are classified as FVOCI investments.\nFor FVOCI investments, during the year, a loss of $0.3 million (2021: gain of $0.6 million) was recognized in other\ncomprehensive income and no (2021: nil) amount was recycled to retained earnings on derecognition. These investments\ncomprise funds which are not immediately available for redemption due to the liquidity profile of the instruments held by\nthe underlying managers and are classified as Level 3 investments in the fair value hierarchy.\n10 (E) STRATEGIC CAPITAL CO-INVESTMENTS\nThese co-investments are initially recorded at acquisition cost (being the initial fair value) and are re-measured to\nfair value at each reporting date, with resulting unrealized gains or losses being recorded as fair value changes in\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss.\nValuation techniques for measuring the fair value of the strategic capital co-investments are similar to techniques used\nfor valuations of private equity co-investments of the Group. The Group’s strategic capital co-investments are located in\nUnited States and are carried at FVTPL.\n10 (F) OTHER INVESTMENTS\n$millions 2022 2021\nInvestments in structured products 157 67\nOther strategic investments 141 53\nTotal 298 120\nValuation techniques for measuring the fair value of other investments are the same as those used for PE co-investments.\n(i) Investments in structured products\nDuring FY21, the Group established a fund of $379 million (including commitments) consisting of a portfolio of co-\ninvestments in PE, RE and ICM products. $157 million had been initially funded by Investcorp in the fund, with remaining\nfunded by a third party as preferred investor. During the year, the fund made additional investments of $101 million and\ndistributed $179 million to investors. As of June 30, 2022, the fair value of investments held by the fund amounted to\n$343 million.\nThe Group’s current exposure in the fund is carried at fair value through profit or loss.\n(ii) Other Strategic Investments\nOther strategic investments represent the following types of investments of the Group:\n1. Investments made for strategic reasons; and\n2. Instruments obtained on disposal of exited investments.\nDuring the year, $5.8 million (2021: loss of $7.5 million) of losses were recognized in other comprehensive income.\nFurthermore, losses of $15.1 million (2021: nil) amount was recycled to retained earnings on derecognition.\nDuring the year, the Group has made an investment of $120 million in the insurance platform.\n98\n\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C.

(CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nFurther, a tax query has been raised in relation to certain co-investments of the Group. The Group does not expect any\nlikely claim to arise in respect of this matter. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial\nstatements.\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk management is an integral part of the Group’s corporate decision-making process. The Financial and Risk\nManagement Committee (FRMC) oversees the Group’s risk management activities, and sets the Group’s risk profile on an\nenterprise wide basis. The FRMC is comprised of members of senior management drawn from all key areas of the Group.\nThe Group’s primary risk management objective is to support its business objectives with sufficient economic capital.\nThe Group employs risk models to determine the capital needed to cover unexpected losses from investment or other\nrisks. This capital amount is known as economic capital. The economic capital requirement for each reporting segment\nis determined for a one year horizon and subsequently aggregated to determine the total economic capital. This total\neconomic capital is then stress tested under a dynamic VaR approach. The dynamic VaR is calculated by using a five-\nyear planning horizon, a 99% one-tailed confidence level and by recognizing diversification benefits across asset classes.\nIn addition to determining an adequate economic capital allocation for each reporting segment, the risk management\nteam has developed tools in conjunction with risk management consultants to perform detailed risk analyses that\nspecifically address the investment risks in each individual line of business.\nThe principal risks associated with the Group’s business, and the related risk management processes are explained\nbelow:\n(i) Counterparty credit risk\nThe Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk on its short term funds, placements, fair value of derivatives,\nreceivables, advances, debt investments and guarantees. The Group manages counterparty credit risk by setting limits\nfor all counterparties. The Group also monitors credit exposures, and continually assesses the creditworthiness of\ncounterparties. Counterparty credit risk in respect of derivative financial instruments is limited to those with positive\nfair values. With respect to the counterparty credit risk exposure arising from other financial assets, the Group has\na maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments. The Group also actively attempts to mitigate\ncounterparty credit risks, where possible, through documented netting and margin arrangements with counterparties,\nunder ISDA and CSA agreements.\nThe risk management team maintains an overall external rating-based methodology for setting Board approved\ncounterparty limits. For rated counterparties, credit ratings from at least two rating agencies are used for developing\ncounterparty limits. All non-rated counterparties are screened through due diligence and credit analysis prior to the\nassumption of credit exposures to them by Investcorp. These non-rated counterparties are also categorized under the\n‘Standard’ internal rating for financial reporting purposes.\nThe table below shows the relationship between the internal rating* and the category of the external rating grades:\nInternal Rating External Rating by S & P and Moody’s\nHigh AAA to A\nStandard A– to B–\n* The internal rating is used to determine provisions and impairments for financial reporting purposes.\nInternal rating categories are summarized as follows:\nHigh - there is a very high likelihood of the asset being recovered in full and collateral may be available.\nStandard – whilst there is a high likelihood that the asset will be recovered and therefore, represents low risk to the\nGroup, the asset may not be collateralized.\nCounterparty credit risk exposure is considered as past due when payment is due according to the contractual terms but\nis not received. During the current and previous year, none of the advances (refer note 8) were restructured.\n108\n\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C. (CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nSecuritization\nThe Group provides fund management services to funds which invest in CLOs and funds which provide syndicated\nlending to a variety of institutions. The Group also acts as an originator and sponsor for certain CLO investments and\nco-invests through specific SPVs in the CLO investments. The CLO investments are held within a business model whose\nobjective is to hold and sell assets in order to collect contractual cash flows on specified dates. The contractual terms\ngive rise to variable distributions (solely payments of principal and interest) based on CLO’s respective waterfall and\npriorities of payment. The Group manages its risk relevant to the securitization activity in line with its risk management\npolicies and procedures.\nThe Group’s securitization exposures through the CLOs are in the rated and unrated tranches of the notes and varies\nfrom fund to fund. The Group does not hold securitization positions with trading intent or to hedge positions with trading\nintent. The Group has not established and does not manage any synthetic securitization structures nor does it securitize\nrevolving exposures.\n(ii) Credit Risk Measurement\nSignificant increase in credit risk\nWhen determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial\nrecognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue\ncost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical\nexperience, expert credit assessment and forward-looking information.\nAs a practical expedient, IFRS 9 provides a low credit risk (‘LCR’) operational simplification that if a financial instrument\nhas low credit risk i.e. an investment grade credit rating, an entity is allowed to assume at the reporting date that no\nsignificant increase in credit risk has occurred.\nThe Group considers financial instruments with an external rating grade of ‘investment grade’ as LCR for the short-term\nliquid asset portfolio.\nThe receivables and advances of the Group are collateralized by the underlying investments. Hence, the Group considers\nfair-value movements of such investments and management judgement to assess whether there has been a significant\nincrease in credit risk for its receivables and advances portfolio.\nMeasurement of ECL\nThe Group measures credit risk using Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default\n(LGD). PD represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation. EAD is based on the amounts\nthe Group expects to be owed at the time of default. LGD represents the group’s expectation of the extent of loss on\nthe exposure.\nFor the short-term liquid asset portfolio, external rating agency credit grades are used. These published grades are\ncontinuously monitored and updated. The PDs associated with each grade are determined based on realized default\nrates over the period of 12 months, as published by the rating agencies, after adjusting for forward-looking macro-\neconomic information.\nFor receivables and advances that arise in connection with the PE asset class, PDs are derived using an internal model\nand adjusted for forward-looking macro-economic information. PDs for receivables and advances of the RE asset class\nare derived based on internal categorization of the related investment and default rates published by a reputable rating\nagency adjusted for forward-looking macro-economic information.\nFor secured assets, LGDs are determined based on factors which impact the recoveries made post default. For unsecured\nassets, LGDs are based on regulatory guidelines.\nThe Group writes-off exposures if there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n110\n\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C.

Concentrations indicate the\nrelative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographic location.\nThe Group’s policies and procedures and the broad geographical and industry spread of its activities limit its exposure\nto any concentration risk.

For the purpose of managing market price risks, the Group has established appropriate procedures and\nlimits approved by the Board of Directors.\nIn addition, for internal risk assessments, the Group uses a variety of internal and external models to analyze the market\nprice risks that may arise from adverse market movements.\nMarket price risk has been further detailed below under (a) foreign currency risk, (b) interest rate risk and (c) equity\nprice risk.\n114\n\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C. (CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\n(v) (b) Interest rate risk\nThe Group closely monitors interest rate movements, and seeks to limit its exposure to such movements by managing\nthe interest rate repricing structure of its assets and liabilities. The Group actively manages its interest rate repricing gap\nexposure, with a bias towards floating rates and with exposure limits that are approved by the Board of Directors. The\nGroup does not take interest rate trading positions and all of its interest rate risk is typically in the Company’s book where\nhedge accounting applies. The Group also utilizes interest rate related derivative financial instruments to manage its\nexposure to fluctuations in interest rates for specific transactions or groups of transactions.\nA majority of the Group’s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities carry floating rates of interest or if they\ncarry fixed rates they have been hedged to floating rates of interest, except for the following:\n• Credit management Investments amounting to $206 million (June 30, 2021: $255 million), which earn interest at an\neffective rate ranging between 2.5% to 14.7% (June 30, 2021: 2.5% to 14.7%) per annum.\nThe Group is currently assessing the impact of transition away from Libor on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table depicts the sensitivity of the Group’s net income to a 200 basis points change in interest rates, with\nall other variables held constant.

Investcorp includes\nin this definition legal risk but excludes reputational and strategic risks.\nWhile operational risks cannot be entirely eliminated, they are managed and mitigated by ensuring that appropriate\ninfrastructure, controls, systems, procedures and trained and competent people are in place throughout Investcorp. The\ninternal audit department makes regular, independent appraisals of the control environment in all identified risk areas.\nContingency arrangements, which are tested from time to time, are also in place to support operations in the event of\na range of possible disaster scenarios. In addition, Investcorp carries errors and omissions insurance against legal risks\narising from its business activities.\nInvestcorp applies the Basic Indicator Approach (‘BIA’) to measure operational risk and also is implementing a Board\nof Directors approved operational risk management framework. Under the BIA approach, the operational risk charge\nis calculated by taking Investcorp’s average gross income over the preceding two years and current financial year and\nmultiplying it by a fixed alpha coefficient (15 per cent). The operational risk management framework consists of the\nfollowing: 1) “Risk Control and Self-Assessment”: Self-assess operational risks by going through key business processes\nend-to-end, 2) Evaluate the adequacy of existing process controls, 3) Implement control modifications to reduce operational\nrisks and determine residual risks and 4) Monitor and report operational risk events to senior management and the Board.\n118\n\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C.

(CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nInvestcorp extensively utilizes deferred remuneration programs as part of employees’ remuneration. These programs are\ncomprised of investment carried interest and co-investment programs and share-linked programs as described briefly\nbelow.\nPrograms for Investment Profit Participation\nThe Group’s investment professionals in its private equity investment, real estate investment and investment relationship\nmanagement lines of business participate in investment carried interest programs, whereby a certain variable portion of\nexit proceeds due to investors from realization of their investments is shared with these professionals, provided certain pre-\nestablished minimum client return hurdles are satisfied. Netting mechanisms are used so that returns from investments\nthat perform well are netted against other investments in which losses are sustained. Since this carry is awarded up front\nat the time of acquisition it has no significant value at the time of the award.\nPrograms for Investment Participation\nInvestment professionals and relationship managers also participate in a co-investment program pursuant to which\nthey acquire an interest in the Investcorp Group’s investments that they manage at the Investcorp Group’s Consolidated\nStatement of Financial Position carrying value, thereby resulting in no gain or loss to Investcorp except for any potential\nimpairment losses on the financing provided.\nUnder certain legacy co-investment programs, the Group provided financing at market rates to or on behalf of eligible\nemployees, to invest in these programs on a levered basis. The permissible levels of leverage varied on a product to\nproduct and program to program basis. The aggregate remaining amount of such financing provided to or on behalf of\nemployees as of June 30, 2022 is $1.5 million (June 30, 2021: $2.3 million).\nA portion of the deferred remuneration awarded to eligible employees is also in the form of co-investment exposures.\nThese awards have different vesting conditions and are not transferable. An expense charge of $8 million (2021: $10\nmillion) was taken by the Group based on management’s best estimate of the likely vesting of the awards.\nEmployee Share-Linked Plans\nSHL sponsors various employee share-linked plans under which a portion of the deferred remuneration awarded to eligible\nemployees is in the form of SIPCO shares or phantom SIPCO shares or performance-linked SIPCO share based awards that\nrepresent a beneficial interest in the ordinary shares of the Company. These SIPCO awards have different vesting periods\nand are not transferable.\nSIPCO shares or phantom SIPCO shares or performance-linked SIPCO share based awards are granted to the employees\nat their fair value on the grant date. The fair value of SIPCO shares for purposes of the plans is estimated considering\ntheir non-transferability and the indirect nature of the underlying beneficial ownership. The value of SIPCO shares granted\nduring the year is $21.3 million (2021: $30.2 million). The start and end date of the vesting period for each grant varies\nfrom plan to plan and is based on continued employment (unless employment is terminated due to death, disability or\nretirement) as well as satisfaction of certain performance conditions. The determination of the amount of expense to be\nrecognized as compensation expense in any year is estimated based on a model that takes into account the probability\nweighted vesting of the shares at the fair value on the grant date using the historical pattern of employee tenure. These\nestimates are updated regularly based on actual information.\nAn expense charge of $18.4 million (2021: $16.2 million) was taken by the Group based on management’s best estimate\nof the number of shares that are likely to vest. The grant date value of shares vested during the year amounted to $20.9\nmillion (2021: $19 million). The details of shares granted, vested and forfeited during the year are as follows:\nNumber of shares 2022 2021\nGranted during the year 1,975,194 3,005,251\nVested during the year 1,927,757 1,740,240\nForfeited during the year 148,875 158,164\nThe fair value of shares granted during the year amounted to $21.3 million (2021: $30.2 million).

Several milestones have been completed, such as the upgrade of the technology systems\nto handle the new reference rate, review of significant the Group’s internal documents and planning to amend\ndocumentation for existing contracts such as the existing Revolving Credit Facilities. The Group expects to have the full\ntransition implemented by June 2023.\nNew standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective\n• Amendments to IFRS 3 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework (issued May 2020, effective for annual periods\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2022);\n• Amendments to IAS 16 - Proceeds before Intended Use (issued May 2020, effective for annual periods beginning on\nor after 1 January 2022);\n• Amendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract (issued May 2020, effective for annual\nperiods beginning on or after 1 January 2022);\n• Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018 - 2020 - effective for annual periods\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2022;\n• IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (issued May 2017; effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023);\n• Amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (issued January 2020; effective for\nannual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023);\n• Amendments to IAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates (issued February 2021; effective for annual period beginning\non or after 1 January 2023); and\n• Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 - Disclosure of Accounting Policies (issued February 2021;\neffective for annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2023).\nThe Group’s management is currently evaluating the impact of the above standard and amendments on the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\ni) Accounting convention\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the re-measurement at\nfair value of financial instruments under IFRS 9 and revaluation of premises and equipment.\nii) Going concern\nThe Group’s management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern and is satisfied that the\nGroup has sufficient resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware\nof any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nTherefore, the consolidated financial statements continue to be prepared on a going concern basis.\n124\n\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C. (CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made judgments covered in the following\nsection, apart from those involving estimates, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nThe valuation approach was substantially consistent with our normal process and valuation policy. A key focus of the\nportfolio fair value was an assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on each investment. The approach\nconsidered the performance of each investment exposure before the outbreak of COVID-19, the projected short-term\nimpact on their ability to generate earnings and cash flow and also longer-term view of their ability to recover and perform\nagainst their investment cases. Given the diversity of the portfolio, the impact has been varied, based on type of underlying\nexposure, industry exposure, expected recovery from the current crisis and current market inputs.\n(viii) Foreign currencies\nA foreign currency transaction is recorded in the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the value date\nof the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that are held at the reporting date are retranslated\nat market rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss under treasury and other income.\nNon-monetary assets that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are recorded at rates of exchange\nprevailing at the value dates of the transactions. Non-monetary assets in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are\nretranslated at exchange rates prevailing on the dates the fair values were determined. Gains and losses on fair valuation\nof FVTPL investments are taken to the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nForeign currency differences arising from the translation of investments in respect of which an election has been made\nto present subsequent changes in FVOCI are recognized in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.\n(ix) Income\nInterest income is recognized using the effective yield of the asset and is recorded as asset based income. Asset based\nincome from all co-investments classified as FVTPL investments is recognized on the basis of realized and unrealized\nchanges in fair value as at the end of the reporting period.\nFee income is recognized when services are rendered. Performance fees are recognized when earned. Performance fees\nare only recognized once it is highly probable that there would be no significant reversal of any accumulated revenue in\nthe future. Estimates are needed to assess the risk that achieved earnings may be reversed before realization due to the\nrisk of lower future overall performance of the underlying investments. The reversal risk is managed through adjustments\nof the unrealized investment values by imposing discounts depending on specific investment risks and on the expected\naverage remaining holding period of the investment.\nIncome from SPAC transactions is recorded on the basis of realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of interest\nheld in the respective SPACs and is included within transaction and advisory income in the consolidated statement of\nprofit or loss.\nRealized capital gains or losses on FVOCI equity investments are taken to retained earnings at the time of derecognition\nof the investment.\nPlacement fees are charged when an underwritten investment is placed with investors. The Group has identified the\nperformance obligations arising from its contracts with investors with whom the investments are placed. The portion of\nthe fee relating to such performance obligations is deferred and recognized over the investment period.\nInvestcorp has reviewed and analyzed the terms of the contracts that it has entered into with its investors arising from the\nplacement of its investments. Based on this review, the Group has determined the following two types of performance\nobligations that Investcorp is expected to satisfy:\ni. services provided by Investcorp during the year from purchase to the placement of the investment with investors,\nincluding deal identification, funding, underwriting, maintaining a placement infrastructure, preparing the marketing\nmaterials for each deal etc; and\nii. services provided over the period of the investment as agreed with the investor at the time of placement.\n126\n\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C. (CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nto fair value at each reporting date, with resulting unrealized gains or losses being recorded as fair value changes in the\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss. Consequently, there are no impairment provisions for such investments.\nFVOCI investments are initially recorded at fair value. These investments are then re-measured to fair value at each\nreporting date and any resulting change in value of these investments is taken to the consolidated statement of other\ncomprehensive income and recorded as a separate component of equity until they are derecognized at which time the\ncumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is transferred to retained earnings.\nb. Co-investments in credit management investment\nThe Group’s co-investments in credit management and any new exposure acquired during the year are classified as FVOCI\ndebt investments. All other credit management co-investment exposures are carried at amortised cost less any impairment\nprovision. Interest income on amortized cost instruments is recognized using the effective interest rate (“EIR”).\nFVOCI debt investments are initially recorded at fair value. Any subsequent fair value changes on such investments will\nbe recognized directly in equity and any impairment in the carrying value will be recognized in the consolidated statement\nof profit or loss. At the time of derecognition, any cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is transferred to\nretained earnings through profit or loss. The fair value changes in FVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated\nstatement of profit or loss.\nAny revision of estimated future cash flows are discounted at the original EIR with a consequential adjustment to the\ncarrying amount and a corresponding increase or decrease in consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nc. Co-investments in absolute return investments\nThe Group’s co-investments in absolute return investments are classified as FVTPL and FVOCI investments and are stated\nat fair value at the reporting date. The fair value changes in FVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated statement\nof profit or loss.\nThe fair value changes in the FVOCI investments are taken to the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income\nand recorded as a separate component of equity until they are derecognized at which time the cumulative gain or loss\npreviously reported is transferred to retained earnings.\nd. Co- investments in strategic capital investment\nThe Group’s co-investments in strategic capital investments are classified as FVTPL investments and are stated at fair\nvalue at the reporting date. The fair value changes in FVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated statement of\nprofit or loss.\ne. Investment in structured products\nThe Group’s investments in structured products are classified as FVTPL and are stated at fair value at the reporting date.\nThe fair value changes in FVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nf. Investment in other strategic investments\nThe Group’s investments in other strategic investments are classified as FVTPL and FVOCI investments and are stated at\nfair value at the reporting date. The fair value changes in FVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated statement\nof profit or loss.\nThe fair value changes in the FVOCI investments are taken to the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income\nand recorded as a separate component of equity until they are derecognized at which time the cumulative gain or loss\npreviously reported is transferred to retained earnings.\nxvii) Investment in joint ventures\nThe Group’s investment in joint ventures is initially recorded at fair value and is re-measured at each reporting date, with\nresulting unrealized gains or losses being recorded in consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nxviii) Impairment and un-collectability of financial assets\nThe Group recognizes loss allowances in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for expected credit losses (ECL) on\nfinancial assets excluding investments classified as FVTPL and equity investments classified as FVOCI.\n128\n\nINVESTCORP ANNUAL REPORT 2022\nINVESTCORP HOLDINGS B.S.C. (CLOSED)\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022\nAll other items are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nPremises and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which are as follows:\nBuildings on freehold land 25 years\nLeasehold and building improvements 10 - 15 years\nOperating assets 3 - 23 years\nThe above useful lives of the assets and methods of depreciation are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at least at\neach financial year end.\nxxii) Right-of-use assets and lease liability\nThe Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets are measured at\ncost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\nThe recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an\noption to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any period covered by an option to terminate the\nlease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease\npayments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed\npayments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts\nexpected to be paid under residual value guarantees as applicable. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the\nGroup uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not\nreadily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion\nof interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if\nthere is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the\nassessment to purchase the underlying asset.\nxxiii) Intangible assets\nIntangible assets comprise management contracts and goodwill recognized on acquisition. Management contracts have a\nuseful life of 5 years from the date of the acquisition and are amortized accordingly.\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the net\nidentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of\nimpairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the\nGroup’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or\nliabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\nThe Group tests goodwill for impairment annually. For other intangible assets, the Group reviews the carrying amounts\nto determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication\nexists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss and if any,\nimpairment loss is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the period.\nxxiv) Payables, accruals and provisions\nProvision for employee benefit costs is made in accordance with contractual and statutory obligations and the terms of\nbenefit plans approved by the Board of Directors (see Note 24).\nProvisions are made when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow\nof resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made\nof the amount of the obligation.\nxxv) Unfunded deal acquisitions\nUnfunded deal acquisitions represent amounts contractually payable by the Group in respect of investment acquisitions\nthe agreements for which are signed, but have not been funded, as of the reporting date.\n130\n\n$%&’()*+,-./%%0/1.,’-+,).#2##\n!\"#$%&’\n()#)*\"(\"#+\n!\"#\n!\"#$%&’()*+,\"\"-,.+)$*()&+/0//\n%$\"!()+1,\",2$1$\"&\n(,-.//01’)2.31-4 );130.’G.H45\n!\"#$%&’(#)*+,’-.,/)) 7#,5)02)*0-90-,&#)B&-,&#AC..\nGA9:6?.$:I68><A7DJ.#2!K.

The\nfull set of financial statements are available on Investcorp’s website at www.investcorp.com.\nInvestcorp’s FY22 results were driven by good levels of activity across the core businesses of private\nequity, real estate, credit management and absolute return investments. This resulted in delivering a\nnet profit attributable to the equity holders of the parent of US$ 135 million compared to US$ 124\nmillion in FY21.\nTotal shareholders’ equity (excluding non-controlling interest) as of June 30, 2022 increased 3% to\nUS$ 1,314 million (FY21: US$ 1,270 million) and total assets were US$ 2,295 million (FY21:\nUS$ 2,391 million). The FY22 recommendation for distribution of preferred and ordinary dividends is\nUS$ 57 million in aggregate (including interim dividends on preference shares), with the proposed\nordinary dividend being US$ 0.30 per share.\nFinancial and operational highlights\n• Continued progress on strategy to drive greater recurring fee revenues and enhance earnings\nprofile. AUM fees, transaction and advisory income of US$ 411 million increased by 15%\ncompared to US$ 356 million in FY21. Recurring AUM fees of US$ 240 million grew by 11%\ncompared to US$ 217 million in FY21, reflecting a higher level of client assets under\nmanagement and strong fundraising during the year. Transaction and advisory income of US$\n171 million grew by 23% compared to US$ 139 million in FY21, driven primarily by good levels\nof transactional and fundraising activity and performance of the underlying assets under\nmanagement.\n• AUM grew to a record high of US$ 42.7 billion, a 14% increase compared to US$ 37.6 billion\nas of June 30, 2021, driven by the broad-based diversification of the franchise across\ngeographies, clients, and products.\n• Asset-based income from co-investment business and others of US$ 109 million for FY22\nwas up 2% compared to US$ 107 million in FY21. The results reflect good performance of\nthe underlying investments across all asset classes.\n• Activity metrics were solid with investment activity of US$ 4.9 billion (FY 21: US$ 3.3 billion),\ntotal fundraising of US$ 7.4 billion (FY 21: US$ 4.3 billion) and distributions of US$ 4.5 billion\n(FY21: US$ 3.0 billion).\n• Investment activity of US$ 4.9 billion includes US$ 1.2 billion for private equity and strategic\ncapital, US$ 1.2 billion for real estate, US$ 2.4 billion for various CLOs and US$ 120 million\ninto an insurance business in the U.S. providing fixed annuities. Private equity investments\nincluded five new investments in the US and Europe and four new investments in Asia.\n• Exit activities included the full realization of eight private equity investments in the US, Europe\nand MENA, the partial realization of one private equity investment in the US, and the sale of\nmultiple real estate properties in the US and Europe, including the first exit from Investcorp’s\nEuropean (ex-UK) portfolio with the sale of Bürocampus Wangen in Stuttgart, Germany.\n• Total fundraising reached a record high of US$ 7.4 billion raised across private and\ninstitutional clients for new deal-by-deal offerings, fund products and SPAC IPOs, as well as\nthe pricing/issuance and resets of several CLOs.\n• As of June 30, 2022, total equity (excluding non-controlling interests) was US$ 1,314 million\nand total accessible liquidity was US$ 1.3 billion. The increase in equity (excluding non-\ncontrolling interests) is largely due to the strong results for the year partially offset by the\npayment of FY21 dividends and purchase of treasury shares during the year.\n• The size of the balance sheet decreased by 4% to US$ 2.3 billion from US$ 2.4 billion as a\nresult of strong business and fundraising activities which translated into lower underwriting\nand lower working capital that was partially offset by fair value gains and higher co-investment\nbalances in line with the AUM growth as new products/offering are launched.\n• Net debt declined to US$ 353 million in FY22 from US$ 443 million in FY21. The improved\nnet debt position together with a high level of equity and liquidity puts the balance sheet in a\nstrong position heading into the next fiscal year.\nInvestcorp also continued to make progress on a number of key strategic initiatives:\n• Successfully concluded the Firm’s first Murabaha facility which was oversubscribed with a\nfinal participation of US$ 440 million.\n• Successfully sponsored the IPOs of two SPACs, one focused on European investments and\none focused on Indian investments. Both SPACs are listed on NASDAQ. The gross proceeds\nfrom both offerings were in excess of US$ 600 million and were heavily oversubscribed.

(CLOSED)\nReport on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOpinion\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C. (closed)\n(\"the Company”) and its subsidiaries (together “the Group”), which comprise of the\nconsolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2022, and the consolidated\nstatement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of other comprehensive income,\nconsolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the\nyear then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of\nsignificant accounting policies.\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2022, and its\nconsolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).\nBasis of Opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our\nresponsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities\nfor the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are\nindependent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for\nAccountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International\nIndependence Standards) (IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are\nrelevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the Kingdom of Bahrain, and\nwe have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and\nthe IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and\nappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nOther Information Included in the Group’s 2022 Annual Report\nOther information consists of the information included in the Group’s 2022 Annual Report,\nother than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Board\nof Directors is responsible for the other information. Prior to the date of this auditor's report,\nwe have obtained the following sections of the Group's 2022 Annual Report, and the remaining\nsections are expected to be made available to us after that date.\n• Report of the Board of Directors;\n• Business Highlights;\n• Discussion of Results;\n• Assets Under Management; and\n• Portfolio Review\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information\nand we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF INVESTCORP\nHOLDINGS B.S.C. (CLOSED) (continued)\nReport on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nOther Information Included in the Group’s 2022 Annual Report (continued)\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to\nread the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other\ninformation is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our\nknowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on\nthe work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of the auditor’s\nreport, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are\nrequired to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as\nthe Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated\nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for\nassessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters\nrelated to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Board of\nDirectors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic\nalternative but to do so.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and\nto issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of\nassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always\ndetect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and\nare considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected\nto influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial\nstatements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain\nprofessional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures\nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate\nto provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement\nresulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve\ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal\ncontrol.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF INVESTCORP\nHOLDINGS B.S.C. (CLOSED) (continued)\nReport on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of\naccounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors.\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern\nbasis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material\nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the\nGroup’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material\nuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the\nrelated disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are\ninadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence\nobtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions\nmay cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial\nstatements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial\nstatements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves\nfair presentation.\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the\nentities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision\nand performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit\nopinion.\nWe communicate with the Audit and Risk Committee regarding, among other matters, the\nplanned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant\ndeficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF INVESTCORP\nHOLDINGS B.S.C.

An example of a\nmaterial event would be where a sale is imminent and credible bids have been received\nfrom third parties or valuations have been received from banks engaged in the sale\nprocess. In these cases, the fair value would be established with reference to the range\nof bids received and based on management's assessment of the most likely realization\nvalue within that range. Another example of a material event would be where an arm's\nlength financing transaction has occurred recently that is (a) material in nature, (b)\ninvolves third parties, and (c) attaches an implicit value to the company. In the event that\nsuch a recent third-party measure of specific fair value for an individual investment is not\navailable, the fair value is determined by using a multiples-based approach applied to\nthe most recent and relevant operating performance metric of the underlying company,\ntypically EBITDA and sometimes sales. The multiple used is taken from a universe of\ncomparable publicly listed companies, recent M&A transactions involving comparable\ncompanies, and Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) analysis.\nManagement exercises its judgment in choosing the most appropriate multiple, on a\nconsistent basis, from within the universe referred to above.\nOf the above, co-investments amounting to $35.1 million (June 30, 2021: $32.2 million)\nare classified as FVOCI investments. For FVOCI investments, during the year, a gain of\n$2.7 million (2021: loss of $5 million) was recognized in other comprehensive income\nand $0.6 million (2021: losses of $27.6 million) of gains were recycled to retained\nearnings on derecognition.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n10.

The adjusted amortised cost is calculated based\non the original set EIR. The accrual based on EIR and any losses arising from\nimpairment of such investments are included in asset based income in the consolidated\nstatement of profit or loss.\nThe fair value of CLO co-investments categorized as FVOCI is determined on the basis\nof inputs from independent third parties including internal management assessment of\nthe projected cashflows.\nOf the above, co-investments amounting to $103.7 million (June 30, 2021: $110.1\nmillion) are classified as FVOCI investments.

FINANCING (CONTINUED)\nMedium term facilities\nAll medium-term facilities, carry floating rates of interest when drawn. Revolvers carry a\nfixed rate of commitment fees when undrawn. The syndicated revolving facilities are\nsubject to certain customary covenants, including maintaining certain minimum levels of\nnet worth and operating below maximum leverage ratios.\nDuring the year, the Group entered into a Murabaha agreement with a facility size of\n$440 million carrying a floating rate of interest. Subsequent to the year end, the Group\nhas drawn $350 million from this facility.\nMedium term facilities are all floating rate instruments with average margin over LIBOR\nof 275 basis points (June 30, 2021: 275 basis points).\nPrivate Notes\nLong-term notes issued by the Group carry fixed rates of interest and are governed by\ncovenants contained in the relevant agreements. Such covenants include maintaining\ncertain minimum levels of net worth and operating below a maximum leverage ratio. The\nprivate notes are fixed rate instruments, however through hedging the Group incurs a\nfloating rate interest cost of 100 basis points to 265 basis points (June 30, 2021: 100\nbasis points to 265 basis points) over LIBOR.\nSecured Financing\nSecured financing relates to financing obtained under repurchase transaction\narrangements entered into by the Group, with underlying assets being CLO co-\ninvestment exposures in Europe. The financings carry variable rates of interest. Each\nfinancing arrangement has a specified repurchase date at which the Group will\nrepurchase the underlying CLO asset at a pre-determined repurchase price.\nLease Liabilities\nThe Group recognizes lease liabilities at the commencement date of the lease measured\nat the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term.\nDuring the year, the Group repaid $11.9 million (June 30, 2021: $12.2 million) of lease\nliabilities, recognized an additional lease liabilities of $4.4 million (June 30, 2021: $0.5\nmillion) and recognized an interest expense of $3.2 million (2021: $3.4 million). There\nhas been no re-measurement of lease liabilities during the year (2021: Nil).\n16.

The reserve is not available for distribution\nbut can be utilized as stipulated by the Bahrain Commercial Companies Law.\nFair value reserve\nCertain of the Group’s PE, RE, ARI, CM and strategic investments in equity instruments\nand certain CM debt instruments have been classified as FVOCI. The gains and losses\narising on fair valuation of such investments is recorded in the fair value reserve\naccount. Any gain or loss on realization of such PE, RE, ARI, other strategic investments\nand CM equity instruments is recycled directly to retained earnings and any gain or loss\non realization of such CM debt instruments is recycled to retained earnings through profit\nor loss.\nTreasury shares\n865,443 (2021: 673,305) ordinary shares were held as treasury shares, which includes\n10,550 shares (2021: 22,823 shares) that have been granted to employees as part of\ndeferred remuneration but have not yet started vesting. 2,303,438 shares (2021:\n2,422,972 shares) that have been granted to employees and have commenced vesting,\nbut have not fully vested as at 2022, are not counted as treasury shares.\nDuring the year, as part of the delisting process, the Company re-purchased 6.1 million\nshares from its shareholders for a total consideration of $70 million. Further,\napproximately 4.2 million shares (2021: 7.6 million shares) were purchased by the\nmanagement for a total consideration of approximately $46 million (2021: $76.4 million).\nThe book value of the shares approximated the fair value of the shares.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n17. SHARE CAPITAL AND RESERVES (CONTINUED)\nPreference share capital\nThe Series B preference shares are non-cumulative, non-convertible, non-voting, non-\nparticipating and perpetual in nature and carry a floating rate dividend, equal to the\nbenchmark 12-month interbank rate + 9.75% per annum. The Series B preference\nshares are callable at any time, at the Company’s option, in part or in whole at par plus\ndividends due up to the call date.\nThe Series E preference shares are fixed rate, equal to 8%, resettable, non-cumulative,\nwith no fixed maturity date and are redeemable at Investcorp’s option only after five and\na half years from date of issuance.\nThe payment of dividends on preference shares is subject to recommendation by the\nBoard of Directors, and approval by the ordinary shareholders. The preference shares\ntake priority over the Company’s ordinary shares for payment of dividends and\ndistribution of assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution.\nShare premium\nShare premium includes any gain or loss on purchase or sale of Company’s shares\nincluding treasury shares. Movement in share premium during the year includes loss of\n$4 million (2021: loss of $12 million) on vesting of treasury shares, $17 million (2021: Nil)\nrelating to performance share awards vesting and $3 million relating to the purchase of\nshares by employees (2021: Nil).\nOther Reserves\nOther reserves consist of cash flow hedges and the revaluation reserve on premises and\nequipment recognized directly in equity.\nMovements relating to other reserves are set out below:\nRevaluation\nreserve on\nCash flow Total\npremises and\n$millions hedges\nequipment\nBalance at June 30, 2020 (9) 4 (5)\nNet realized gain recycled to statement of profit or loss 2 - 2\nNet unrealized gain for the year 0 - 0\nTransfer of depreciation to retained earnings - ( 0) (0)\nBalance at June 30, 2021 (7) 4 (3)\nNet realized loss recycled to statement of profit or loss (5) - ( 5)\nNet unrealized gain for the year 0 - 0\nTransfer of depreciation to retained earnings - ( 0) ( 0)\nBalance at June 30, 2022 (12) 4 (8)\n34 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n18.

In addition, an interim dividend of $5\nmillion was also paid on October 2021.\nThe book value per ordinary share at the year-end date is calculated by dividing the\nordinary shareholders’ equity (excluding unrealized changes relating to cash flow\nhedges, the revaluation reserve and proposed appropriations) by the number of ordinary\nshares outstanding at year end (taking into account the beneficial interest of\nmanagement in all acquired unvested shares issued at year end). The fully diluted book\nvalue per ordinary share is $11.31 per share (2021: $10.81 per share).\n20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Group’s management classifies hedges into two categories: (a) fair value hedges\nthat hedge exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability; and (b)\ncash flow hedges that hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a\nparticular risk associated with either a recognized asset or liability or a forecasted\ntransaction highly probable to occur.\nOther derivatives\nThe Group does not actively engage in proprietary trading activities in derivatives.\nHowever, on occasion, the Group may need to undertake certain derivative transactions\nto mitigate economic risks under its asset-liability management and risk management\nguidelines that may not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 (e.g. hedging of\nforeign currency risk on fair valued investments). Consequently, gains or losses resulting\nfrom the re-measurement to fair value of these derivatives are taken to the consolidated\nstatement of profit or loss.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n20. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)\nValuation of derivatives\nThe Group values the majority of its derivative financial instruments using internal\nmodels. The models use market observable inputs including interest rate curves and\nboth forward and spot prices for currencies. Derivative assets and liabilities included in\nLevel 2 (see Note 23) represent interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, currency\nforwards and option contracts. For derivatives that are not valued using internal models,\nthe Group’s policy is to rely on third party valuations, whilst benchmarking them against\nobservable market data.\nThe Group's outstanding derivative financial instruments comprise the following:\n2022 2021\nNotional Positive fair Negative Notional Positive fair Negative fair\n$millions value value* fair value value value* value\nA) DERIVATIVES WHERE HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS APPLIED\nCurrency risk being hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts\ni) Fair value hedges\nOn balance sheet exposures 290 - (33) 338 - (7)\nii) Cash flow hedges\nForecasted transactions 29 2 (0) 33 1 (0)\nCoupon on long-term debt 45 - (5) 42 - (1)\nTotal forward foreign exchange contracts 364 2 (38) 413 1 (8)\nInterest rate risk being hedged using interest rate swaps\ni) Fair value hedges - fixed rate debt 332 41 (1) 397 25 -\nii) Cash flow hedges - floating rate debt 25 - (0) 25 - (3)\nTotal interest rate hedging contracts 357 41 (1) 422 25 (3)\nTotal hedging derivatives 721 43 (39) 835 26 (11)\nB) DERIVATIVES WHERE HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS NOT APPLIED\nInterest rate swaps 225 6 (8) 475 14 (12)\nForward rate agreements 17 0 (0) 4 0 (0)\nForward foreign exchange contracts 1,418 17 (11) 1,453 6 (4)\nCurrency options 12 0 - 43 - (3)\nFutures 17 0 - 16 - (0)\nTotal other derivatives 1,689 23 (19) 1,991 20 (19)\nTOTAL - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 2,410 66 (58) 2,826 46 (30)\n* Net collateral received by the Group amounting to $2 million has been taken against the fair values above (2021: $48.9 million).\n36 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n20.

The management of the Group, after reviewing the claims pending against\nthe Group companies and based on the advice of the relevant professional legal\nadvisors, are satisfied that the outcome of these claims will not have a material adverse\neffect on the financial position of the Group. Further, a tax query has been raised in\nrelation to certain co-investments of the Group. The Group does not expect any likely\nclaim to arise in respect of this matter. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk management is an integral part of the Group’s corporate decision-making process.\nThe Financial and Risk Management Committee (FRMC) oversees the Group’s risk\nmanagement activities, and sets the Group’s risk profile on an enterprise wide basis.\nThe FRMC is comprised of members of senior management drawn from all key areas of\nthe Group.\nThe Group’s primary risk management objective is to support its business objectives\nwith sufficient economic capital. The Group employs risk models to determine the capital\nneeded to cover unexpected losses from investment or other risks. This capital amount\nis known as economic capital. The economic capital requirement for each reporting\nsegment is determined for a one year horizon and subsequently aggregated to\ndetermine the total economic capital. This total economic capital is then stress tested\nunder a dynamic VaR approach. The dynamic VaR is calculated by using a five-year\nplanning horizon, a 99% one-tailed confidence level and by recognizing diversification\nbenefits across asset classes.\nIn addition to determining an adequate economic capital allocation for each reporting\nsegment, the risk management team has developed tools in conjunction with risk\nmanagement consultants to perform detailed risk analyses that specifically address the\ninvestment risks in each individual line of business.\nThe principal risks associated with the Group’s business, and the related risk\nmanagement processes are explained below:\ni) Counterparty credit risk\nThe Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk on its short term funds, placements, fair\nvalue of derivatives, receivables, advances, debt investments and guarantees. The\nGroup manages counterparty credit risk by setting limits for all counterparties. The Group\nalso monitors credit exposures, and continually assesses the creditworthiness of\ncounterparties. Counterparty credit risk in respect of derivative financial instruments is\nlimited to those with positive fair values. With respect to the counterparty credit risk\nexposure arising from other financial assets, the Group has a maximum exposure equal\nto the carrying value of these instruments. The Group also actively attempts to mitigate\ncounterparty credit risks, where possible, through documented netting and margin\narrangements with counterparties, under ISDA and CSA agreements.\nThe risk management team maintains an overall external rating-based methodology for\nsetting Board approved counterparty limits. For rated counterparties, credit ratings from\nat least two rating agencies are used for developing counterparty limits.

The Group also acts as an\noriginator and sponsor for certain CLO investments and co-invests through specific\nSPVs in the CLO investments. The CLO investments are held within a business model\nwhose objective is to hold and sell assets in order to collect contractual cash flows on\nspecified dates. The contractual terms give rise to variable distributions (solely payments\nof principal and interest) based on CLO’s respective waterfall and priorities of payment.\nThe Group manages its risk relevant to the securitization activity in line with its risk\nmanagement policies and procedures.\nThe Group’s securitization exposures through the CLOs are in the rated and unrated\ntranches of the notes and varies from fund to fund. The Group does not hold\nsecuritization positions with trading intent or to hedge positions with trading intent. The\nGroup has not established and does not manage any synthetic securitization structures\nnor does it securitize revolving exposures.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nii) Credit Risk Measurement\nSignificant increase in credit risk\nWhen determining whether the risk of default on a financial instrument has increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable\ninformation that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both\nquantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical\nexperience, expert credit assessment and forward-looking information.\nAs a practical expedient, IFRS 9 provides a low credit risk (‘LCR’) operational\nsimplification that if a financial instrument has low credit risk i.e. an investment grade\ncredit rating, an entity is allowed to assume at the reporting date that no significant\nincrease in credit risk has occurred.\nThe Group considers financial instruments with an external rating grade of ‘investment\ngrade’ as LCR for the short-term liquid asset portfolio.\nThe receivables and advances of the Group are collateralized by the underlying\ninvestments. Hence, the Group considers fair-value movements of such investments and\nmanagement judgement to assess whether there has been a significant increase in\ncredit risk for its receivables and advances portfolio.\nMeasurement of ECL\nThe Group measures credit risk using Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default\n(EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD). PD represents the likelihood of a borrower\ndefaulting on its financial obligation. EAD is based on the amounts the Group expects to\nbe owed at the time of default. LGD represents the group’s expectation of the extent of\nloss on the exposure.\nFor the short-term liquid asset portfolio, external rating agency credit grades are used.\nThese published grades are continuously monitored and updated. The PDs associated\nwith each grade are determined based on realized default rates over the period of 12\nmonths, as published by the rating agencies, after adjusting for forward-looking macro-\neconomic information.\nFor receivables and advances that arise in connection with the PE asset class, PDs are\nderived using an internal model and adjusted for forward-looking macro-economic\ninformation. PDs for receivables and advances of the RE asset class are derived based\non internal categorization of the related investment and default rates published by a\nreputable rating agency adjusted for forward-looking macro-economic information.\nFor secured assets, LGDs are determined based on factors which impact the recoveries\nmade post default. For unsecured assets, LGDs are based on regulatory guidelines.\nThe Group writes-off exposures if there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n43 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\niii) Funding liquidity risk\nFunding liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to fund increases in assets\nand meet obligations when they fall due, without incurring unacceptable losses. To\nmitigate this risk, the Group implements a comprehensive liquidity risk management\nframework, which includes the use of risk limits, monitoring systems and scenario\nanalyses that are incorporated into a contingency funding plan. The framework is subject\nto Board and senior management oversight. Liquidity management aims to arrange\ndiversified funding sources and maintain comfortable and laddered debt maturities. The\nGroup manages assets with liquidity in mind, and it monitors liquidity on a daily basis.\nThe table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Group’s assets and liabilities\nbased on expected realizations.\n>10 years\nJune 30, 2022 Up to 3 >3 months Sub-Total >1 year up to >5 years up Non-cash\nup to 20 Total\n$millions months up to 1 year up to 1 year 5 years to 10 years items\nyears\nAssets\nFinancial assets\nCash, placements and other liquid assets 217 - 217 - - 32 - 249\nPositive fair value of derivatives 15 1 16 0 40 10 - 66\nReceivables 165 4 169 71 - - - 240\nAdvances 4 10 14 225 - - - 239\nUnderwritten and warehoused investments 315 - 315 55 - - - 370\nCo-investments 19 42 61 658 60 120 - 899\nInvestment in joint ventures - - - - - 13 - 13\nTotal financial assets 735 57 792 1,009 100 175 - 2,076\nNon-financial assets\nPrepayments - - - - - - 28 28\nPremises, equipment and other assets - - - - - - 125 125\nIntangibles - - - - - - 66 66\nTotal assets 735 57 792 1,009 100 175 219 2,295\nLiabilities\nFinancial liabilities\nPayables and accrued expenses 265 8 273 - - - - 273\nNegative fair value of derivatives 48 0 48 - 1 9 - 58\nFinancing 2 7 9 172 344 77 - 602\nTotal financial liabilities 315 15 330 172 345 86 - 933\nNon-financial liability\nDeferred fees - - - - - - 47 47\nTotal liabilities 315 15 330 172 345 86 47 980\nNet gap 420 42 462 837 (245) 89 172 1,315\nCumulative liquidity gap 420 462 462 1,299 1,054 1,143 1,315\n44 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22.

Concentrations indicate\nthe relative sensitivity of the Group’s performance to developments affecting a particular\nindustry or geographic location. The Group’s policies and procedures and the broad\ngeographical and industry spread of its activities limit its exposure to any concentration\nrisk.

For the purpose of managing market price risks, the Group has\nestablished appropriate procedures and limits approved by the Board of Directors.\nIn addition, for internal risk assessments, the Group uses a variety of internal and\nexternal models to analyze the market price risks that may arise from adverse market\nmovements.\nMarket price risk has been further detailed below under (a) foreign currency risk, (b)\ninterest rate risk and (c) equity price risk.\nv) (a) Foreign currency risk\nThe Group’s overall policy is generally to hedge all non-US dollar denominated assets,\nliabilities and commitments, and a proportion of its assets denominated in US-pegged\ncurrencies, into US dollars utilizing currency risk management products. In the normal\ncourse of its business, the Group utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts and other\nforeign exchange derivatives to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange\nrates. Positions are monitored on a daily basis and hedging strategies are used to\nensure positions are maintained within established exposure and Value at Risk (“VaR”)\nrisk limits.\nThe Group’s significant net hedged and unhedged foreign currency positions are set out\nbelow.\n$millions June 30, 2022 June 30, 2021\nNet hedged Net unhedged Net hedged Net unhedged\nLong (Short)\nexposure exposure exposure exposure\nBahraini Dinar* 1 3 (1) 1 3 (1)\nSaudi Riyal* 8 4 (7) 8 2 (9)\nEuro 2 77 (0) 62 -\nPounds Sterling 8 6 (0) 139 (1)\nSwiss Francs 1 0 42 -\nJapanese Yen (233) 0 (271) -\nKuwaiti Dinar 1 (1) 42 (1)\nUAE Dirham* 0 (0) 0 0\nSwedish Krona 3 (0) 1 11 -\nNorwegian Krona 4 (0) 4 -\nChinese Renminbi 0 (0) 1 -\nDanish Krona 6 3 0 7 5 -\nSingaporean Dollar 0 (1) 0 (0)\nIndian Rupees 2 1 (0) - -\n3 20 (10) 300 (12)\n* Currency exchange rate currently pegged against the US Dollar.\n48 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22. RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nv) Market price risk (continued)\nv) (a) Foreign currency risk (continued)\nIncidental unhedged positions are subjected to market risk calculation based on their\nVaR. VaR estimates the potential loss due to market movement of foreign exchange\nrates or volatility of those rates. Potential market movements of foreign exchange rates\nare derived from a study of their historical volatility. The risk methodology is based on\nthe assumption that changes in foreign exchange rates follow a normal probability\ndistribution over time. The characteristics of normal distribution are then used to assess\nportfolio risk. However, the Group’s risk management team conducts back testing by\ncomparing the daily VaR with the daily profit and loss to ensure the robustness of the\nVaR model.\nThe following table summarizes the 99% confidence level over a 1-day holding period\nVaR for the Group’s foreign currency exposures.\n49 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n$\nAY\nMM\nm illio\nv e r a ge\na r e\na x imin\nim u\nn s\ne F Xn\nd F X\nu m Fm\nF X\nV a\nV a\nX V\nV a\nRR\naR R\n2 0 2 2\n-\n1 6\n7\n3 4\n7\n2 0 2 1\n22\n5\n15\n99\nThe foreign exchange loss recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as a\nresult of incidental unhedged positions and costs of hedging against foreign exchange\nrisk amounts to $1.8 million (2021: $1.9 million).\nv) (b) Interest rate risk\nThe Group closely monitors interest rate movements, and seeks to limit its exposure to\nsuch movements by managing the interest rate repricing structure of its assets and\nliabilities. The Group actively manages its interest rate repricing gap exposure, with a\nbias towards floating rates and with exposure limits that are approved by the Board of\nDirectors. The Group does not take interest rate trading positions and all of its interest\nrate risk is typically in the Company’s book where hedge accounting applies.

RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nvi) Operational risk\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people and systems or from external events (such as natural disasters,\nchanges in regulation or outsourcing of operations). Investcorp includes in this definition\nlegal risk but excludes reputational and strategic risks.\nWhile operational risks cannot be entirely eliminated, they are managed and mitigated\nby ensuring that appropriate infrastructure, controls, systems, procedures and trained\nand competent people are in place throughout Investcorp. The internal audit department\nmakes regular, independent appraisals of the control environment in all identified risk\nareas. Contingency arrangements, which are tested from time to time, are also in place\nto support operations in the event of a range of possible disaster scenarios. In addition,\nInvestcorp carries errors and omissions insurance against legal risks arising from its\nbusiness activities.\nInvestcorp applies the Basic Indicator Approach (‘BIA’) to measure operational risk and\nalso is implementing a Board of Directors approved operational risk management\nframework. Under the BIA approach, the operational risk charge is calculated by taking\nInvestcorp’s average gross income over the preceding two years and current financial\nyear and multiplying it by a fixed alpha coefficient (15 per cent). The operational risk\nmanagement framework consists of the following: 1) “Risk Control and Self-\nAssessment”: Self-assess operational risks by going through key business processes\nend-to-end, 2) Evaluate the adequacy of existing process controls, 3) Implement control\nmodifications to reduce operational risks and determine residual risks and 4) Monitor\nand report operational risk events to senior management and the Board.\n23. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair\nvalue measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or\ntransfer the liability takes place either:\n• In the principal market for the asset or liability, or\n• In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the\nasset or liability\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market\nparticipants would use when pricing the asset or liability, on the basis that market\nparticipants act in their economic best interest.\n52 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n23. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe Group has established guidelines for the valuation of its investments which are\nreviewed by the Board of Directors and abides by guidelines issued under IFRS on\nvaluation of investments and guidelines recommended by the International Private\nEquity and Venture Capital Association. The Group performs valuations of its\ninvestments on a quarterly basis. The business support teams work along with deal\nteams to prepare valuation packages in accordance with the valuation guidelines of the\nGroup. The valuation packages are then presented to the Valuation Committee which is\ncomprised of senior members of the Finance team and investing lines of business. The\nValuation Committee has the final responsibility of reviewing and approving the fair value\nof all investments.\nUnderlying the definition of fair value is the presumption that the Group is a going\nconcern without any intention or requirement to curtail materially the scale of its\noperations or to undertake a transaction on adverse terms.\nFair value adjustments arise from re-measurement of liabilities which are hedged,\ninvestments and derivatives.\nNonetheless the actual amount that is realized in a future transaction may differ from the\ncurrent estimate of fair value, given the inherent uncertainty surrounding valuations of\nunquoted investments.\nThe fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are not materially different\nfrom their carrying values except for certain assets and liabilities carried at amortized\ncost. The fair value of CLO co-investments carried at amortized cost amounts to $101.1\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $145.6 million) as compared to the carrying value of $101.9\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $145.3 million). The fair value of CLO co-investments is based\non inputs from independent third parties and falls under Level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy disclosure. The fair value of medium and long term debt amounts to $350\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $414.8 million) as compared to the carrying value of $359.5\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $417.4 million). The fair value of medium and long term debt is\nbased on inputs from third party banks and falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\ndescribed below.\nThe Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of\nfinancial instruments:\nLevel 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability,\neither directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\nLevel 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e.\nunobservable inputs).\nDuring the current financial year, there was no transfer between levels (June 30, 2021:\n$6.9 million). Under absolute return investments, an exposure of $4 million (June 30,\n2021: $5.3 million) is comprised of illiquid side pocket investments which are classified\nas Level 3. The year to date fair value changes on this ARI exposure amounts to a loss\nof $0.3 million (June 30, 2021: gain of $0.6 million) and the net redemptions amount to\n$0.9 million (June 30, 2021: $1 million).\n53 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n23. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe fair values of financial assets that are traded in active markets are based on quoted\nmarket prices or dealer price quotations.

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION\nInvestcorp has a clear and well-defined “pay for risk-adjusted long-term performance”\nphilosophy that pervades its culture and motivates its employees to target delivery of\nconsistent top-quartile performance. This philosophy is exhibited in Investcorp’s\nremuneration programs and it is reflected in its annual remuneration decisions.\nThe remuneration that is paid to Investcorp’s employees is divided into two fundamental\ncomponents: (i) fixed remuneration, i.e., salary and benefits, and (ii) variable\nremuneration.\nVariable remuneration, comprised of cash and awards under deferred remuneration\nprograms, is remuneration that varies from year to year and the amount of which is\ndependent upon (i) the financial performance of Investcorp as a whole, (ii) the risk-\nadjusted performance of each employee’s respective line of business and (iii) the\nperformance of the individual employee.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n24. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\nInvestcorp extensively utilizes deferred remuneration programs as part of employees’\nremuneration. These programs are comprised of investment carried interest and co-\ninvestment programs and share-linked programs as described briefly below.\nPrograms for Investment Profit Participation\nThe Group’s investment professionals in its private equity investment, real estate\ninvestment and investment relationship management lines of business participate in\ninvestment carried interest programs, whereby a certain variable portion of exit proceeds\ndue to investors from realization of their investments is shared with these professionals,\nprovided certain pre-established minimum client return hurdles are satisfied. Netting\nmechanisms are used so that returns from investments that perform well are netted\nagainst other investments in which losses are sustained. Since this carry is awarded up\nfront at the time of acquisition it has no significant value at the time of the award.\nPrograms for Investment Participation\nInvestment professionals and relationship managers also participate in a co-investment\nprogram pursuant to which they acquire an interest in the Investcorp Group’s\ninvestments that they manage at the Investcorp Group’s Consolidated Statement of\nFinancial Position carrying value, thereby resulting in no gain or loss to Investcorp\nexcept for any potential impairment losses on the financing provided.\nUnder certain legacy co-investment programs, the Group provided financing at market\nrates to or on behalf of eligible employees, to invest in these programs on a levered\nbasis. The permissible levels of leverage varied on a product to product and program to\nprogram basis. The aggregate remaining amount of such financing provided to or on\nbehalf of employees as of June 30, 2022 is $1.5 million (June 30, 2021: $2.3 million).\nA portion of the deferred remuneration awarded to eligible employees is also in the form\nof co-investment exposures. These awards have different vesting conditions and are not\ntransferable. An expense charge of $8 million (2021: $10 million) was taken by the\nGroup based on management’s best estimate of the likely vesting of the awards.\nEmployee Share-Linked Plans\nSHL sponsors various employee share-linked plans under which a portion of the\ndeferred remuneration awarded to eligible employees is in the form of SIPCO shares or\nphantom SIPCO shares or performance-linked SIPCO share based awards that\nrepresent a beneficial interest in the ordinary shares of the Company. These SIPCO\nawards have different vesting periods and are not transferable.\nSIPCO shares or phantom SIPCO shares or performance-linked SIPCO share based\nawards are granted to the employees at their fair value on the grant date. The fair value\nof SIPCO shares for purposes of the plans is estimated considering their non-\ntransferability and the indirect nature of the underlying beneficial ownership. The value of\nSIPCO shares granted during the year is $21.3 million (2021: $30.2 million). The start\nand end date of the vesting period for each grant varies from plan to plan and is based\non continued employment (unless employment is terminated due to death, disability or\nretirement) as well as satisfaction of certain performance conditions. The determination\nof the amount of expense to be recognized as compensation expense in any year is\nestimated based on a model that takes into account the probability weighted vesting of\nthe shares at the fair value on the grant date using the historical pattern of employee\ntenure. These estimates are updated regularly based on actual information.\n56 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n24. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\nAn expense charge of $18.4 million (2021: $16.2 million) was taken by the Group based\non management’s best estimate of the number of shares that are likely to vest. The grant\ndate value of shares vested during the year amounted to $20.9 million (2021: $19\nmillion). The details of shares granted, vested and forfeited during the year are as\nfollows:\nNumber of shares 2022 2021\nGranted during the year 1,975,194 3,005,251\nVested during the year 1,927,757 1,740,240\nForfeited during the year 148,875 158,164\nThe fair value of shares granted during the year amounted to $21.3 million (2021: $30.2\nmillion). The fair value of shares forfeited during the year amounted to $1.6 million\n(2021: $1.7 million).\n25. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES\nFor the Group, related parties include its investee companies, companies that hold\nclients’ investments (investment holding companies), client fund companies associated\nwith ARI, SIPCO Limited and the Trusts.\nIt also includes major shareholders, directors and senior management of the Company,\ntheir immediate families and entities controlled, jointly controlled or significantly\ninfluenced by such parties. Income is earned or expense is incurred in the Group’s\ntransactions with such related parties in the ordinary course of business. The Group’s\nmanagement approves the terms and conditions of all related party transactions.\nAlthough these companies are classified as related parties, the Group administers and\nmanages the companies that hold clients’ investments on a fiduciary basis on behalf of\nits clients who are third parties and are the beneficiaries of a majority of the economic\ninterest from the underlying investments of these companies.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), in conformity with the Bahrain\nCommercial Companies Law.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in United States\ndollars, this being the functional currency of the Group, and rounded to the nearest\nmillions ($millions) unless otherwise stated. Certain prior year balances have been\nreclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no\nimpact on the net loss or equity of the Group.\nThe Group has adopted the below listed amendments to standards effective from July 1,\n2021. The adoption of these amendments did not have any material impact on the\nconsolidated financial statements of the Group.\n• Amendments to IFRS 4, IFRS 7, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 39 – Phase 2 of\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform.\nWhile some of the Group's financial instruments are subject to IBOR reforms at\n30 June 2022 and have not yet transitioned out of the current IBOR to ARR, the\nGroup has already made substantial progress to finalize the transition from IBOR\nto the new ARR. Several milestones have been completed, such as the upgrade\nof the technology systems to handle the new reference rate, review of significant\nthe Group’s internal documents and planning to amend documentation for\nexisting contracts such as the existing Revolving Credit Facilities. The Group\nexpects to have the full transition implemented by June 2023.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nNew standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective\n• Amendments to IFRS 3 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework (issued May\n2020, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022);\n• Amendments to IAS 16 - Proceeds before Intended Use (issued May 2020,\neffective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022);\n• Amendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts – Costs of Fulfilling a Contract\n(issued May 2020, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January\n2022);\n• Amendments resulting from Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018 -\n2020 - effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022;\n• IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (issued May 2017; effective for annual periods\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2023);\n• Amendments to IAS 1 - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n(issued January 2020; effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1\nJanuary 2023);\n• Amendments to IAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates (issued February 2021;\neffective for annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2023); and\n• Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 - Disclosure of Accounting\nPolicies (issued February 2021; effective for annual period beginning on or after\n1 January 2023).\nThe Group’s management is currently evaluating the impact of the above standard and\namendments on the consolidated financial statements.\ni) Accounting convention\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention\nexcept for the re-measurement at fair value of financial instruments under IFRS 9 and\nrevaluation of premises and equipment.\nii) Going concern\nThe Group’s management has made an assessment of its ability to continue as a going\nconcern and is satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in business\nfor the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management is not aware of any material\nuncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements continue to be prepared\non a going concern basis.\n59 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\niii) Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements are comprised of the financial statements of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity which is controlled by the Group.\nControl is achieved when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns\nthrough its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect these returns through\nits power over the entity. The Group consolidates its subsidiaries excluding entities\nwhich meet the below criteria:\na) Where there are contractual or other restrictions imposed on the Group’s ability\nto appoint the majority of the Board of Directors, or\nb) Where a majority of the economic risk and reward accrues to third parties other\nthan the Group, or\nc) Where the exception to consolidate subsidiaries of an Investment entity is\napplied, as defined in IFRS 10.\nThe Group qualifies as an investment entity as defined under IFRS 10, and as such,\nmeasures its investments in accordance with the requirements set out in the standard.\nThe results of all subsidiaries are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss\nfrom the effective date of formation or acquisition. The financial statements of the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company,\nusing consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances, income and expenses\nhave been eliminated on consolidation.\niv) Business Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an\nacquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is\nmeasured at acquisition date fair value. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as\nincurred.\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities\nassumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the\ncontractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition\ndate.\nv) Trade date accounting\nPurchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery of the assets within a\ntimeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the market place are\nrecognized using the “trade date” accounting basis (i.e. the date that the entity commits\nto purchase or sell the asset).\nvi) Offsetting\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are only offset and the net amount reported in\nthe consolidated statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable\nright to offset the recognized amounts and the Group intends to settle on a net basis.\n60 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nvii) Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of financial assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements. The use of estimates is principally\nlimited to:\na) The determination of the fair values of FVTPL investments in private equity co-\ninvestments, credit management co-investments, strategic capital co-\ninvestments, real estate co-investments, other strategic investments (see Note\n10), and investment in SPACs (Note 9), the determination of performance fees\non assets under management, impairment provisions for financial assets other\nthan FVTPL investments and FVOCI equity investments (see Note 13) and\nallocation of placement fee to the performance obligations as described later.\nb) The determination of performance fees on assets under management are\ndependent on the performance of the underlying investments and thus are\nhighly susceptible to factors outside the Group’s influence\nc) The determination of cash flows which is the basis for performing the\nassessment of solely payments of principal and interest test on CLO co-\ninvestments which are being carried as debt instruments at amortized cost (see\nNote 10).\nIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made\njudgments covered in the following section, apart from those involving estimates, which\nhave the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe valuation approach was substantially consistent with our normal process and\nvaluation policy. A key focus of the portfolio fair value was an assessment of the impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on each investment. The approach considered the\nperformance of each investment exposure before the outbreak of COVID-19, the\nprojected short-term impact on their ability to generate earnings and cash flow and also\nlonger-term view of their ability to recover and perform against their investment cases.\nGiven the diversity of the portfolio, the impact has been varied, based on type of\nunderlying exposure, industry exposure, expected recovery from the current crisis and\ncurrent market inputs.\n61 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nviii) Foreign currencies\nA foreign currency transaction is recorded in the functional currency at the rate of\nexchange prevailing at the value date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities\nin foreign currencies that are held at the reporting date are retranslated at market rates\nof exchange prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are\nrecognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss under treasury and other\nincome.\nNon-monetary assets that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies\nare recorded at rates of exchange prevailing at the value dates of the transactions. Non-\nmonetary assets in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated at\nexchange rates prevailing on the dates the fair values were determined. Gains and\nlosses on fair valuation of FVTPL investments are taken to the consolidated statement of\nprofit or loss.\nForeign currency differences arising from the translation of investments in respect of\nwhich an election has been made to present subsequent changes in FVOCI are\nrecognized in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.\nix) Income\nInterest income is recognized using the effective yield of the asset and is recorded as\nasset based income. Asset based income from all co-investments classified as FVTPL\ninvestments is recognized on the basis of realized and unrealized changes in fair value\nas at the end of the reporting period.\nFee income is recognized when services are rendered. Performance fees are\nrecognized when earned. Performance fees are only recognized once it is highly\nprobable that there would be no significant reversal of any accumulated revenue in the\nfuture. Estimates are needed to assess the risk that achieved earnings may be reversed\nbefore realization due to the risk of lower future overall performance of the underlying\ninvestments. The reversal risk is managed through adjustments of the unrealized\ninvestment values by imposing discounts depending on specific investment risks and on\nthe expected average remaining holding period of the investment.\nIncome from SPAC transactions is recorded on the basis of realized and unrealized\nchanges in the fair value of interest held in the respective SPACs and is included within\ntransaction and advisory income in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nRealized capital gains or losses on FVOCI equity investments are taken to retained\nearnings at the time of derecognition of the investment.\nPlacement fees are charged when an underwritten investment is placed with investors.\nThe Group has identified the performance obligations arising from its contracts with\ninvestors with whom the investments are placed. The portion of the fee relating to such\nperformance obligations is deferred and recognized over the investment period.\n62 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nInvestcorp has reviewed and analyzed the terms of the contracts that it has entered into\nwith its investors arising from the placement of its investments. Based on this review,\nthe Group has determined the following two types of performance obligations that\nInvestcorp is expected to satisfy:\ni. services provided by Investcorp during the year from purchase to the placement of\nthe investment with investors, including deal identification, funding, underwriting,\nmaintaining a placement infrastructure, preparing the marketing materials for each\ndeal etc; and\nii. services provided over the period of the investment as agreed with the investor at the\ntime of placement.\nInvestcorp has allocated the placement fee to each of the above performance\nobligations. The Group completes all of its performance obligations described in (i)\nabove before placing an investment with its investors. Accordingly, the fee relating to\nthis performance obligation is recognized upfront upon placement of the investment\nwith investors. This portion of the placement fee is included as part of deal fees except\nfor placement fee from program clients which is included as part of AUM fees.\nA portion of the placement fee represents the amount received upfront for the\nperformance obligation described in (ii) above. Accordingly, this component of the\nplacement fee is deferred and recognized over time, as AUM fees, over the period of\nmanaging the investment.\nx) Interest expenses\nInterest on borrowings represents funding cost and is calculated using the effective\ninterest rate method, adjusted for gains or losses on related cash flow hedges.\nxi) Taxation of foreign operations\nThere is no tax on corporate income in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Taxation on income\nfrom foreign subsidiaries is provided for in accordance with the fiscal regulations of the\ncountries in which the respective Group entities operate.\nDeferred taxation is provided for using the liability method on all temporary differences\ncalculated at the rate at which it is expected to be payable. Deferred tax assets are only\nrecognized if recovery is probable.\nxii) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term funds, cash in transit, other\nliquid funds and placements with financial institutions that are readily convertible into\ncash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.\nxiii) Receivables\nSubscription receivables are recognized when the obligation is established, i.e., when a\nbinding subscription agreement is signed. These are carried at cost less provision for\nimpairment.\n63 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nxiv) Advances\nAdvances are stated at amortized cost, net of any impairment provisions.\nxv) Classification of financial assets\n(a) Investments\nThe group classifies the financial assets into various categories as set out in Note 4.\nOn initial investment, a debt investment is measured at amortized cost if the financial\nasset is held to collect contractual cash flows over the life of the asset and if those cash\nflows comprise solely of principal repayments and interest on the principal amount\noutstanding.\nThe Group also classifies certain strategic investments, real estate co-investment,\nprivate equity co-investments, strategic capital co-investments, credit management\ninvestments and ARI investments as FVOCI investments.\nAll other investments including those over which the Group has significant influence are\nclassified as FVTPL.\n(b) Other liquid assets\nOther liquid assets, which form part of “placements with financial institutions and other\nliquid assets”, are recorded at amortized cost less any impairment in value other than\nthose assets which contain embedded derivatives requiring either separation of the\nembedded derivative or classification of the entire instrument as FVTPL assets. The\nmanagement has designated such assets as FVTPL assets.\nxvi) Co-investments\na. Co- investments in private equity investment and real estate investment\nThe Group’s co-investments in private equity investment and real estate investment are\nclassified as FVTPL and FVOCI investments. FVTPL investments are initially recorded\nat acquisition cost (being the initial fair value) and are re-measured to fair value at each\nreporting date, with resulting unrealized gains or losses being recorded as fair value\nchanges in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Consequently, there are no\nimpairment provisions for such investments.\nFVOCI investments are initially recorded at fair value. These investments are then re-\nmeasured to fair value at each reporting date and any resulting change in value of these\ninvestments is taken to the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income and\nrecorded as a separate component of equity until they are derecognized at which time\nthe cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is transferred to retained\nearnings.\nb. Co- investments in credit management investment\nThe Group’s co-investments in credit management and any new exposure acquired\nduring the year are classified as FVOCI debt investments. All other credit management\nco-investment exposures are carried at amortised cost less any impairment provision.\nInterest income on amortized cost instruments is recognized using the effective interest\nrate (“EIR”).\n64 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nFVOCI debt investments are initially recorded at fair value. Any subsequent fair value\nchanges on such investments will be recognized directly in equity and any impairment in\nthe carrying value will be recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. At\nthe time of derecognition, any cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is\ntransferred to retained earnings through profit or loss. The fair value changes in FVTPL\ninvestments are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nAny revision of estimated future cash flows are discounted at the original EIR with a\nconsequential adjustment to the carrying amount and a corresponding increase or\ndecrease in consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nc. Co-investments in absolute return investments\nThe Group’s co-investments in absolute return investments are classified as FVTPL and\nFVOCI investments and are stated at fair value at the reporting date. The fair value\nchanges in FVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or\nloss.\nThe fair value changes in the FVOCI investments are taken to the consolidated\nstatement of other comprehensive income and recorded as a separate component of\nequity until they are derecognized at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously\nreported is transferred to retained earnings.\nd. Co- investments in strategic capital investment\nThe Group’s co-investments in strategic capital investments are classified as FVTPL\ninvestments and are stated at fair value at the reporting date. The fair value changes in\nFVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\ne. Investment in structured products\nThe Group’s investments in structured products are classified as FVTPL and are stated\nat fair value at the reporting date. The fair value changes in FVTPL investments are\nrecorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nf. Investment in other strategic investments\nThe Group’s investments in other strategic investments are classified as FVTPL and\nFVOCI investments and are stated at fair value at the reporting date. The fair value\nchanges in FVTPL investments are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or\nloss.\nThe fair value changes in the FVOCI investments are taken to the consolidated\nstatement of other comprehensive income and recorded as a separate component of\nequity until they are derecognized at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously\nreported is transferred to retained earnings.\nxvii) Investment in joint ventures\nThe Group’s investment in joint ventures is initially recorded at fair value and is re-\nmeasured at each reporting date, with resulting unrealized gains or losses being\nrecorded in consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n65 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nxviii) Impairment and un-collectability of financial assets\nThe Group recognizes loss allowances in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for\nexpected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets excluding investments classified as\nFVTPL and equity investments classified as FVOCI.\nThe Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the\nfollowing, for which they are measured as 12-month ECL:\n1. debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the\nreporting date; and\n2. other financial instruments on which credit risk has not increased significantly\nsince their initial recognition.\nThe Group considers a debt security to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating is\nequivalent to the globally understood definition of 'investment grade'.\nxviii) Impairment and un-collectability of financial assets (continued)\nFor the purposes of calculation of ECL, the Group categorizes such financial assets into\nStage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as described below:\nStage 1 – Performing: when such financial assets are first recognized, the Group\nrecognizes an allowance based up to 12- month ECL.\nStage 2 – Significant increase in credit risk: when such financial assets shows a\nsignificant increase in credit risk, the Group records an allowance for the lifetime ECL.\nStage 3 – Impaired: the Group recognizes the lifetime ECL for such financial assets.\nxix) De-recognition of financial instruments\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows\nfrom the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash\nflows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of\nthe financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains\nsubstantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of\nthe financial asset.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, any cumulative gain/ loss recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of other comprehensive income in respect of equity investments\ndesignated at FVOCI is transferred directly to retained earnings.\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or\ncancelled or has expired.\nxx) Derivative financial instruments\nDerivatives are stated at fair value determined by using prevailing market rates or\ninternal pricing models.\nDerivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are classified into fair value hedges or cash\nflow hedges. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or\nis sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Accounting\ntreatments for both types of hedges and in the case of discontinuance of hedges are\ndisclosed in Note 20.\n66 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nFor derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gain or loss arising from\nchanges in their fair value is taken to the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nxxi) Premises and equipment\nPremises and equipment substantially comprise land, buildings and related leasehold\nimprovements used by the Group as office premises.\nThe Company carries its building on freehold land and certain operating assets at\nrevalued amounts, being the fair value of the assets at the date of revaluation less any\nsubsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.\nValuations are performed frequently enough to ensure that the fair value of a revalued\nasset does not differ materially from its carrying value. Any revaluation surplus is\ncredited to the asset revaluation reserve included in equity, except to the extent that it\nreverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in profit and\nloss, in which case the increase is recognized in profit or loss. A revaluation deficit is\nrecognized directly in profit or loss, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous\nsurplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the asset revaluation\nreserve. A transfer from the asset revaluation reserve to retained earnings is made for\nany difference between the depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the\nasset and depreciation based on the original cost of the asset.\nAll other items are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nPremises and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated\nuseful lives which are as follows:\nBuildings on freehold land 25 years\nLeasehold and building improvements 10 - 15 years\nOperating assets 3 - 23 years\nThe above useful lives of the assets and methods of depreciation are reviewed and\nadjusted, if appropriate, at least at each financial year end.\nxxii) Right-of-use assets and lease liability\nThe Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and\nimpairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The\nrecognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together\nwith any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be\nexercised, or any period covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably\ncertain not to be exercised.\n67 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nxxii) Right-of-use assets and lease liability (continued)\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured\nat the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease\npayments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any\nlease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a\nrate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees as\napplicable. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the\nincremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate\nimplicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the\namount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced\nfor the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is\nremeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-\nsubstance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the\nunderlying asset.\nxxiii) Intangible assets\nIntangible assets comprise management contracts and goodwill recognized on\nacquisition. Management contracts have a useful life of 5 years from the date of the\nacquisition and are amortized accordingly.\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the\nconsideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed.\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment\nlosses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business\ncombination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-\ngenerating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of\nwhether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\nThe Group tests goodwill for impairment annually. For other intangible assets, the Group\nreviews the carrying amounts to determine whether there is any indication that those\nassets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable\namount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss\nand if any, impairment loss is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for\nthe period.\nxxiv) Payables, accruals and provisions\nProvision for employee benefit costs is made in accordance with contractual and\nstatutory obligations and the terms of benefit plans approved by the Board of Directors\n(see Note 24).\nProvisions are made when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past\nevent, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will\nbe required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of\nthe obligation.\n68 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nxxv) Unfunded deal acquisitions\nUnfunded deal acquisitions represent amounts contractually payable by the Group in\nrespect of investment acquisitions the agreements for which are signed, but have not\nbeen funded, as of the reporting date.\nxxvi) Borrowings\nBorrowings, represented by short term financing on call, medium-term revolvers,\nmedium-term debt and long-term debt, are initially recognized at the fair value of\nconsideration received and subsequently adjusted for the impact of effective fair value\nhedges. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”) are\ntreated as collateralized financings. The corresponding cash received is recognized in\nthe consolidated statement of financial position as an asset with a corresponding\nobligation to return it as a liability within financing, reflecting the transaction’s economic\nsubstance as a loan to the Group.\nThe securities delivered repurchase agreements are not derecognized from the\nconsolidated statement of financial position as the Group retains substantially all of the\nrisks and rewards of ownership\nTransaction costs relating to borrowings are initially capitalized and deducted from the\nborrowings and subsequently recognized as interest expense over the expected life of\nthese borrowings.\nxxvii) Treasury shares\nTreasury shares are stated at acquisition cost and are shown as a deduction to equity.\nAny surplus arising from the subsequent sale of treasury shares at a price greater than\ncost is treated as non-distributable and included in a share premium reserve under\nequity. Any deficit arising from the subsequent sale of treasury shares at a price lower\nthan cost is charged first against any previously established reserve from past\ntransactions in treasury shares, and where such reserve is insufficient, then any\ndifference is charged to retained earnings.\nxxviii) Share awards\nShare awards to employees are accounted and expense recognized over the vesting\nperiod. The determination of the amount to be recognized is estimated based on a\nmodel that takes into account the probability weighted vesting of the shares at the fair\nvalue on the grant date using the historical pattern of employee tenure. These estimates\nare updated regularly based on actual information.\nxxix) Dividends\nProposed dividends are disclosed as appropriations within equity until the time they are\napproved by the shareholders. On approval by shareholders, these are transferred to\nliabilities.\n69 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"

RISKMANAGEMENT\nRisk management is an integral part of Investcorp’s corporate decision-making process.\nThe Financial and Risk Management Committee (FRMC) oversees the Group’s risk\nmanagement activities, and sets Investcorp’s risk profile on an enterprise wide basis.\nThe FRMC is comprised of members of senior management drawn from all key areas of\nInvestcorp.\nThe Group’s primary risk management objective is to support its business objectives\nwith sufficient economic capital. The Group employs risk modelsto determine the capital\nneeded to cover unexpected losses from investment or other risks. This capital amount\nis known as economic capital. The economic capital requirement for each reporting\nsegment is determined for a one year horizon and subsequently aggregated to\ndetermine the total economic capital. This total economic capital is then stress tested\nunder a dynamic VaR approach. The dynamic VaR is calculated by using ve-year\nplanning horizon, a 99% one-tailed confidence level and by recognizing diversification\nbenefits across asset classes.\nIn addition to determining an adequate economic capital allocation for each reporting\nsegment, the risk management team has developed tools in conjunction with risk\nmanagement consultants to perform detailed risk analyses that spec cally address the\ninvestmentrisks ineach individual lineof business.\nThe principal risks associated with the Group’s business, and the related risk\nmanagement processes are explained below:\ni) Counterparty creditrisk\nThe Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk on its short term funds, placements, fair\nvalue of derivatives, receivables, advances, debt investments and guarantees. Investcorp\nmanages counterparty credit risk by setting limits for all counterparties. The Group also\nmonitors credit exposures, and continually assesses the creditworthiness of\ncounterparties. Counterparty credit risk in respect of derivative financial instruments is\nlimited to those with positive fair values. With respect to the counterparty credit risk\nexposure arising from other financial assets, the Group has a maximum exposure equal\nto the carrying value of these instruments. Investcorp also actively attempts to mitigate\ncounterparty credit risks, where possible, through documented netting and margin\narrangements withcounterparties, underISDA andCSAagreements.\nThe risk management team maintains an overall external rating-based methodology for\nsetting Board approved counterparty limits. For rated counterparties, credit ratings from\nat least two rating agencies are used for developing counterparty limits. All non-rated\ncounterparties are screened through due diligence and credit analysis prior to the\nassumption of credit exposures to them by Investcorp. These non-rated counterparties\nare also categorizedunder the ‘Standard’ internal ratingfor financial reporting purposes.\n38 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22.

This includes both\nquantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical\nexperience,expert creditassessment andforward-looking information.\nAs a practical expedient, IFRS 9 provides a low credit risk (‘LCR’) operational\nsimplification that if a financial instrument has low credit risk i.e. an investment grade\ncredit rating, an entity is allowed to assume at the reporting date that no significant\nincrease in credit risk hasoccurred.\nThe Group considers financial instruments with an external rating grade of ‘investment\ngrade’as LCR fortheshort-term liquid asset portfolio.\nThe receivables and advances of the Group are collateralized by the underlying\ninvestments. Hence, the Group considers fair-value movementsof suchinvestments and\nmanagement judgement to assess whether there has been a significant increase in\ncredit risk for itsreceivables and advances portfolio.\nMeasurement of ECL\nThe Group measures credit risk using Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default\n(EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD). PD represents the likelihood of a borrower\ndefaulting on its financial obligation. EAD is based on the amounts the Group expects to\nbe owed at the time of default. LGD represents the group’s expectation of the extent of\nloss on the exposure.\nFor the short-term liquid asset portfolio, external rating agency credit grades are used.\nThese published grades are continuously monitored and updated. The PDs associated\nwith each grade are determined based on realized default rates over the period of 12\nmonths, as published by the rating agencies, after adjusting for forward-looking macro-\neconomic information.\nFor receivables and advances that arise in connection with the PE asset class, PDs are\nderived using an internal model and adjusted for forward-looking macro-economic\ninformation. PDs for receivables and advances of the RE asset class are derived based\non internal categorization of the related investment and default rates published by a\nreputable rating agencyadjustedfor forward-looking macro-economic information.\nFor secured assets, LGDs are determined based on factors which impact the recoveries\nmadepost default.Forunsecured assets,LGDs are based on regulatory guidelines.\nTheGroup writes-off exposuresif there is noreasonable expectation of recovery.\n41 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n22.

For the purpose of managing market price risks, the Group has\nestablished appropriate procedures and limits approved by the Boardof Directors.\nIn addition, for internal risk assessments, the Group uses a variety of internal and\nexternal models to analyze the market price risks that may arise from adverse market\nmovements.\nMarket price risk has been further detailed below under (a) foreign currency risk, (b)\ninterest rate risk and (c) equity pricerisk.\nv) (a)Foreign currencyrisk\nThe Group’s overall policy is generally to hedge all non-US dollar denominated assets,\nliabilities and commitments, and a proportion of its assets denominated in US-pegged\ncurrencies, into US dollars utilizing currency risk management products. In the normal\ncourse of its business, the Group utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts and other\nforeign exchange derivatives to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange\nrates.

RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nv) Market price risk (continued)\nv) (a)Foreign currencyrisk(continued)\nIncidental unhedged positions are subjected to market risk calculation based on their\nVaR. VaR estimates the potential loss due to market movement of foreign exchange\nrates or volatility of those rates. Potential market movements of foreign exchange rates\nare derived from a study of their historical volatility. The risk methodology is based on\nthe assumption that changes in foreign exchange rates follow a normal probability\ndistribution over time. The characteristics of normal distribution are then used to assess\nportfolio risk. However, the Group’s risk management team conducts back testing by\ncomparing the daily VaR with the daily profit and loss to ensure the robustness of the\nVaR model.\nThe following table summarizes the 99% confidence level over a 1-day holding period\nVaRfor the Group’sforeign currency exposures.\n$millions 2022 2021\nAverage FX VaR 16 21\nYear end FX VaR 7 25\nMaximum FX VaR 34 59\nMinimum FX VaR 7 9\nThe foreign exchange lossrecognizedin theconsolidated statement ofprofit or lossas a\nresult of incidental unhedged positions and costs of hedging against foreign exchange\nrisk amountsto$1.8million (2021:$1.9million).\nv)(b)Interestrate risk\nInvestcorp closely monitors interest rate movements, and seeks to limit its exposure to\nsuch movements by managing the interest rate repricing structure of its assets and\nliabilities. Investcorp actively manages its interest rate repricing gap exposure, with a\nbias towards floating rates and with exposure limits that are approved by the Board of\nDirectors. The Group does not take interest rate trading positions and all of its interest\nrate risk is typically in the Company’s book where hedge accounting applies.

RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)\nvi) Operational risk\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people and systems or from external events (such as natural disasters,\nchanges in regulation or outsourcing of operations). Investcorp includes in this definition\nlegal risk but excludesreputational and strategic risks.\nWhile operational risks cannot be entirely eliminated, they are managed and mitigated\nby ensuring that appropriate infrastructure, controls, systems, procedures and trained\nand competent people are in place throughout Investcorp. The internal audit department\nmakes regular, independent appraisals of the control environment in all identified risk\nareas. Contingency arrangements, which are tested from time to time, are also in place\nto support operations in the event of a range of possible disaster scenarios. In addition,\nInvestcorp carries errors and omissions insurance against legal risks arising from its\nbusiness activities.\nInvestcorp applies the Basic Indicator Approach (‘BIA’) to measure operational risk and\nalso is implementing a Board of Directors approved operational risk management\nframework. Under the BIA approach, the operational risk charge is calculated by taking\nInvestcorp’s average gross income over the preceding two years and current financial\nyear and multiplying it by a fixed alpha coefficient (15 per cent). The operational risk\nmanagement framework consists of the following: 1) “Risk Control and Self-\nAssessment”: Self-assess operational risks by going through key business processes\nend-to-end, 2) Evaluate the adequacy of existing process controls, 3) Implement control\nmodifications to reduce operational risks and determine residual risks and 4) Monitor\nandreportoperational risk events toseniormanagement and the Board.\n23. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIALINSTRUMENTS\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paidto transfera liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair\nvalue measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or\ntransfer the liability takes place either:\nIn the principal marketfor the assetor liability,or\nIn the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the\nasset or liability\nTheprincipal orthe most advantageous marketmust be accessible to theGroup.\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market\nparticipants would use when pricing the asset or liability, on the basis that market\nparticipants act in their economic best interest.\n50 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n23. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIALINSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)\nInvestcorp has established guidelines for the valuation of its investments which are\nreviewed by the Board of Directors and abides by guidelines issued under IFRS on\nvaluation of investments and guidelines recommended by the International Private\nEquity and Venture Capital Association. Investcorp performs valuations of its\ninvestments on a quarterly basis. The business support teams work along with deal\nteams to prepare valuation packages in accordance with the valuation guidelines of\nInvestcorp. The valuation packages are then presented to the Valuation Committee\nwhich is comprised of senior members of the Finance team and investing lines of\nbusiness. The Valuation Committee has the final responsibility of reviewing and\napproving the fair valueofall investments.\nUnderlying the definition of fair value is the presumption that the Group is a going\nconcern without any intention or requirement to curtail materially the scale of its\noperationsor to undertake a transaction on adverse terms.\nFair value adjustments arise from re-measurement of liabilities which are hedged,\ninvestmentsandderivatives.\nNonetheless the actual amount that is realizedin a future transactionmay differfrom the\ncurrent estimate of fair value, given the inherent uncertainty surrounding valuations of\nunquoted investments.\nThe fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are not materially different\nfrom their carrying values except for certain assets and liabilities carried at amortized\ncost. The fair value of CLO co-investments carried at amortized cost amounts to $101.1\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $145.6 million) as compared to the carrying value of $101.9\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $145.3 million). The fair value of CLO co-investments is based\non inputs from independent third parties and falls under Level 3 of the fair value\nhierarchy disclosure. The fair value of medium and long term debt amounts to $350\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $414.8 million) as compared to the carrying value of $359.5\nmillion (June 30, 2021: $417.4 million). The fair value of medium and long term debt is\nbased on inputs from third party banks and falls under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\ndescribed below.\nThe Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of\nfinancial instruments:\nLevel 1: quotedpricesin active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability,\neither directly (i.e. asprices)orindirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\nLevel 3: inputs forthe asset orliability that are not basedonobservable market data (i.e.\nunobservable inputs).\nDuring the current financial year, there was no transfer between levels (June 30, 2021:\n$6.9 million). Under absolute return investments, an exposure of $4 million (June 30,\n2021: $5.3 million) is comprised of illiquid side pocket investments which are classified\nas Level 3.

EMPLOYEECOMPENSATION\nInvestcorp has a clear and well-defined “pay for risk-adjusted long-term performance”\nphilosophy that pervades its culture and motivates its employees to target delivery of\nconsistent top-quartile performance. This philosophy is exhibited in Investcorp’s\nremuneration programsandit is reflected in itsannual remuneration decisions.\nThe remuneration that is paid to Investcorp’s employees is divided into two fundamental\ncomponents: (i) fixed remuneration, i.e., salary and benefits, and (ii) variable\nremuneration.\nVariable remuneration, comprised of cash and awards under deferred remuneration\nprograms, is remuneration that varies from year to year and the amount of which is\ndependent upon (i) the financial performance of Investcorp as a whole, (ii) the risk-\nadjusted performance of each employee’s respective line of business and (iii) the\nperformanceofthe individual employee.\n53 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n24. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\nInvestcorp extensively utilizes deferred remuneration programs as part of employees’\nremuneration. These programs are comprised of investment carried interest and co-\ninvestment programs and share-linked programsasdescribed briefly below.\nPrograms forInvestment Profit Participation\nThe Group’s investment professionals in its private equity investment, real estate\ninvestment and investment relationship management lines of business participate in\ninvestment carried interest programs, whereby a certainvariable portion of exit proceeds\ndue to investors from realization of their investments is shared with these professionals,\nprovided certain pre-established minimum client return hurdles are satisfied. Netting\nmechanisms are used so that returns from investments that perform well are netted\nagainst other investments in which losses are sustained. Since this carry is awarded up\nfront at the timeof acquisitionit hasno significant value at thetimeof theaward.\nPrograms forInvestment Participation\nInvestment professionals and relationship managers also participate in a co-investment\nprogram pursuant to which they acquire an interest in the Investcorp Group’s\ninvestments that they manage at the Investcorp Group’s Consolidated Statement of\nFinancial Position carrying value, thereby resulting in no gain or loss to Investcorp\nexceptfor any potential impairment losses on the financing provided.\nUnder certain legacy co-investment programs, the Group provided financing at market\nrates to or on behalf of eligible employees, to invest in these programs on a levered\nbasis. The permissible levels of leverage varied on a product to product and program to\nprogram basis. The aggregate remaining amount of such financing provided to or on\nbehalf of employees as of June30, 2022is $1.5million (June 30,2021:$2.3million).\nA portion of the deferred remuneration awarded to eligible employees is also in the form\nof co-investment exposures. These awards have different vesting conditions and are not\ntransferable. An expense charge of $8 million (2021: $10 million) was taken by the\nGroup basedonmanagement’sbest estimate ofthelikely vesting of the awards.\nEmployee Share-LinkedPlans\nSHL sponsors various employee share-linked plans under which a portion of the\ndeferred remuneration awarded to eligible employees is in the form of SIPCO shares or\nphantom SIPCO shares or performance-linked SIPCO share based awards that\nrepresent a beneficial interest in the ordinary shares of the Company. These SIPCO\nawardshave different vesting periods and are not transferable.\nSIPCO shares or phantom SIPCO shares or performance-linked SIPCO share based\nawards are granted to the employees at their fair value on the grant date. The fair value\nof SIPCO shares for purposes of the plans is estimated considering their non-\ntransferability andtheindirect natureof theunderlying beneficial ownership. Thevalue of\nSIPCO shares granted during the year is $21.3 million (2021: $30.2 million). The start\nand end date of the vesting period for each grant varies from plan to plan and is based\non continued employment (unless employment is terminated due to death, disability or\nretirement) as well as satisfaction of certain performance conditions. The determination\nof the amount of expense to be recognized as compensation expense in any year is\nestimatedbasedon a model thattakes into account the probability weighted vesting of\n54 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n24. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION (CONTINUED)\nthe shares at the fair value on the grant date using the historical pattern of employee\ntenure. These estimatesare updated regularly based on actual information.\nAn expense charge of $18.4 million (2021: $16.2 million) was taken by the Group based\non management’sbest estimate of the number of shares that are likelyto vest. The grant\ndate value of shares vested during the year amounted to $20.9 million (2021: $19\nmillion). The details of shares granted, vested and forfeited during the year are as\nfollows:\nNumber of shares 2022 2021\nGranted during the year 4,938 7,513\nVested during the year 4,819 4,351\nForfeited during the year 372 395\nThe fair value of shares granted during the year amounted to $21.3 million (2021: $30.2\nmillion). The fair value of shares forfeited during the year amounted to $1.6 million\n(2021:$1.7million).\n25. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSAND BALANCES\nA.

OTHERRELATED PARTYTRANSACTIONS\nFor the Group, related parties include its investee companies, companies that hold\nclients’ investments (investment holding companies), client fund companies associated\nwith ARI,SIPCO Limitedand the Trusts.\nIt also includes major shareholders, directors and senior management of the Company,\ntheir immediate families and entities controlled, jointly controlled or significantly\ninfluenced by such parties. Income is earned or expense is incurred in the Group’s\ntransactions with such related parties in the ordinary course of business. The Group’s\nmanagement approves the terms and conditionsofallrelated party transactions.\nAlthough these companies are classified as related parties, the Group administers and\nmanages the companies that hold clients’ investments on a fiduciary basis on behalf of\nits clients who are third parties and are the beneficiaries of a majority of the economic\ninterest from the underlying investments of these companies. As a result, the true nature\nof the Group’s transactions with these companies is effectively at commercial terms as\nspecified under pre-determinedmanagement agreements.\nIn addition to the compensation and benefits to employees disclosed in Note 24, the\nincome earned and expenses incurred in connection with related party transactions\nincludedin these consolidatedfinancial statements are as follows:\n55 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n25.

SIGNIFICANTACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards(“IFRS”).\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in United States\ndollars, this being the functional currency of the Group, and rounded to the nearest\nmillions ($millions) unless otherwise stated. Certain prior year balances have been\nreclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no\nimpact on the net loss orequity of the Group.\nThe Group has adopted the below listed amendments to standards effective from July 1,\n2021. The adoption of these amendments did not have any material impact on the\nconsolidated financialstatements ofthe Group.\n56 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANTACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nAmendments to IFRS 4, IFRS 7, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 39 – Phase 2 of\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform.\nWhile some of the Group's financial instruments are subject to IBOR reforms at\n30 June 2022 and have not yet transitioned out of the current IBOR to ARR, the\nGroup has already made substantial progress to finalize the transition from IBOR\nto the new ARR. Several milestones have been completed, such as the upgrade\nof the technology systems to handle the new reference rate, review of significant\nthe Group’s internal documents and planning to amend documentation for\nexisting contracts such as the existing Revolving Credit Facilities.

Furthermore, management is not aware of any material\nuncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a\ngoing concern. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements continue to be prepared\nonagoing concern basis.\n57 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANTACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\niii) Basis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements are comprised of the financial statements of the\nCompany and its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity which is controlled by the Group.\nControl is achieved when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns\nthrough its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect these returns through\nits power over the entity. The Group consolidates its subsidiaries excluding entities\nwhich meet thebelow criteria:\na) Where there are contractual or other restrictions imposed on the Group’s ability\ntoappointthe majority ofthe Board ofDirectors, or\nb) Where a majority of the economic risk and reward accrues to third parties other\nthan the Group, or\nc) Where the exception to consolidate subsidiaries of an Investment entity is\napplied,asdefined in IFRS10.\nThe Group qualifies as an investment entity as defined under IFRS 10, and as such,\nmeasuresits investments in accordance with the requirements setout inthestandard.\nThe results of all subsidiaries are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss\nfrom the effective date of formation or acquisition. The financial statements of the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company,\nusing consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances, income and expenses\nhavebeeneliminated on consolidation.\niv) Business Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an\nacquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is\nmeasured at acquisition date fair value. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as\nincurred.\nWhen the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities\nassumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the\ncontractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditionsas at the acquisition\ndate.\nv) Tradedateaccounting\nPurchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery of the assets within a\ntimeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the market place are\nrecognized using the “trade date” accounting basis (i.e. the date that the entity commits\ntopurchase orsell the asset).\nvi) Offsetting\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are only offset and the net amount reported in\nthe consolidated statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable\nrighttooffsetthe recognized amounts andtheGroup intendsto settle on a net basis.\n58 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nvii) Use ofestimates andjudgments\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of financial assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements. The use of estimates is principally\nlimited to:\na) The determination of the fair values of FVTPL co-investments in private equity\nco-investments, credit management co-investments, strategic capital co-\ninvestments and real estate co-investments and other strategic investments\n(see Note 10), and investment in SPACs (Note 9), the determination of\nperformance fees on assets under management, impairment provisions for\nfinancial assets other than FVTPL investments and FVOCI equity investments\n(see Note 13) and allocation of placement fee to the performance obligations\nas described later.\nb) The determination of performance fees on assets under management are\ndependent on the performance of the underlying investments and thus are\nhighly susceptibletofactorsoutside the Group’sinfluence\nc) The determination of cash flows which is the basis for performing the\nassessment of solely payments of principal and interest test on CLO co-\ninvestments whichare being carried as debt instruments at amortized cost(see\nNote10).\nIn the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made\njudgments covered in the following section, apart from those involving estimates, which\nhave the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nThe valuation approach was substantially consistent with our normal process and\nvaluation policy. A key focus of the portfolio fair value was an assessment of the impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic on each investment. The approach considered the\nperformance of each investment exposure before the outbreak of COVID-19, the\nprojected short-term impact on their ability to generate earnings and cash flow and also\nlonger-term view of their ability to recover and perform against their investment cases.\nGiven the diversity of the portfolio, the impact has been varied, based on type of\nunderlying exposure, industry exposure, expected recovery from the current crisis and\ncurrent market inputs.\nviii) Foreigncurrencies\nA foreign currency transaction is recorded in the functional currency at the rate of\nexchange prevailing at the value date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities\nin foreign currencies that are held at the reporting date are retranslated at market rates\nof exchange prevailing at that date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are\nrecognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss under treasury and other\nincome.\n59 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nNon-monetary assets that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies\nare recorded at rates of exchange prevailing at the value dates of the transactions. Non-\nmonetary assets in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated at\nexchange rates prevailing on the dates the fair values were determined. Gains and\nlosses on fair valuationof FVTPLinvestments are taken to the consolidatedstatement of\nprofit or loss.\nForeign currency differences arising from the translation of investments in respect of\nwhich an election has been made to present subsequent changes in FVOCI are\nrecognizedinthe consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.\nix) Income\nInterest income is recognized using the effective yield of the asset and is recorded as\nasset based income. Asset based income from all co-investments classified as FVTPL\ninvestments is recognized on the basis of realized and unrealized changes in fair value\nas at the end ofthe reporting period.\nFee income is recognized when services are rendered. Performance fees are\nrecognized when earned. Performance fees are only recognized once it is highly\nprobable that there would be no significant reversal of any accumulated revenue in the\nfuture. Estimates are needed to assess the risk that achieved earnings may be reversed\nbefore realization due to the risk of lower future overall performance of the underlying\ninvestments. The reversal risk is managed through adjustments of the unrealized\ninvestment values by imposing discounts depending on specific investment risks and on\nthe expected average remainingholding period ofthe investment.\nRealized capital gains or losses on FVOCI equity investments are taken to retained\nearnings at thetimeof derecognition of theinvestment.\nPlacement fees are charged when an underwritten investment is placed with investors.\nThe Group has identified the performance obligations arising from its contracts with\ninvestors with whom the investments are placed. The portion of the fee relating to such\nperformance obligationsisdeferred and recognizedoverthe investmentperiod.\nInvestcorp has reviewed and analyzed the terms of the contracts that it has entered into\nwith its investors arising from the placement of its investments. Based on this review,\nthe Group has determined the following two types of performance obligations that\nInvestcorpis expected to satisfy:\ni. services provided by Investcorp during the year from purchase to the placement of\nthe investment with investors, including deal identification, funding, underwriting,\nmaintaining a placement infrastructure, preparing the marketing materials for each\ndeal etc;and\nii. services providedoverthe periodof the investmentasagreed with theinvestoratthe\ntime of placement.\nInvestcorp has allocated the placement fee to each of the above performance\nobligations. The Group completes all of its performance obligations described in (i)\nabove before placing an investment with its investors. Accordingly, the fee relating to\nthis performance obligation is recognized upfront upon placement of the investment\nwith investors. This portion of the placement fee is included as part of deal fees except\nfor placement fee from program clientswhich is included as part of AUM fees.\n60 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nA portion of the placement fee represents the amount received upfront for the\nperformance obligation described in (ii) above. Accordingly, this component of the\nplacement fee is deferred and recognized over time, as AUM fees, over the period of\nmanagingthe investment.\nx) Interestexpenses\nInterest on borrowings represents funding cost and is calculated using the effective\ninterest rate method, adjusted for gainsor losses on related cash flow hedges.\nxi) Taxation of foreignoperations\nThere is no tax on corporate income in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Taxation on income\nfrom foreign subsidiaries is provided for in accordance with the fiscal regulations of the\ncountries inwhich the respective Group entities operate.\nDeferred taxation is provided for using the liability method on all temporary differences\ncalculated at the rate at which it is expected to be payable. Deferred tax assets are only\nrecognized ifrecovery is probable.\nxii) Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term funds, cash in transit, other\nliquid funds and placements with financial institutions that are readily convertible into\ncashandare subject toinsignificant risk ofchanges in value.\nxiii) Receivables\nSubscription receivables are recognized when the obligation is established, i.e., when a\nbinding subscription agreement is signed. These are carried at cost less provision for\nimpairment.\nxiv) Advances\nAdvances are stated at amortized cost, net ofany impairment provisions.\nxv) Classificationoffinancial assets\n(a) Investments\nThe group classifiesthefinancial assetsinto variouscategories as setout in Note 4.\nOn initial investment, a debt investment is measured at amortized cost if the financial\nasset is held to collect contractual cash flows over the life of the asset and if those cash\nflows comprise solely of principal repayments and interest on the principal amount\noutstanding.\nThe Group also classifies certain strategic investments, real estate co-investment,\nprivate equity co-investments, strategic capital co-investments, credit management\ninvestments andARIinvestments as FVOCI investments.\nAll other investments including those over which the Group has significant influence are\nclassified as FVTPL.\n61 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES (CONTINUED)\n(b) Otherliquid assets\nOther liquid assets, which form part of “placements with financial institutions and other\nliquid assets”, are recorded at amortized cost less any impairment in value other than\nthose assets which contain embedded derivatives requiring either separation of the\nembedded derivative or classification of the entire instrument as FVTPL assets. The\nmanagement has designated suchassetsasFVTPL assets.\nxvi) Co-investments\na. Co-investments in private equityinvestmentandreal estateinvestment\nThe Group’s co-investments in private equity investment and real estate investment are\nclassified as FVTPL and FVOCI investments. FVTPL investments are initially recorded\nat acquisition cost (being the initial fair value) and are re-measured to fair value at each\nreporting date, with resulting unrealized gains or losses being recorded as fair value\nchanges in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Consequently, there are no\nimpairmentprovisions for suchinvestments.\nFVOCI investments are initially recorded at fair value. These investments are then re-\nmeasured to fair value at each reporting date and any resulting change in value of these\ninvestments is taken to the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income and\nrecorded as a separate component of equity until they are derecognized at which time\nthe cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is transferred to retained\nearnings.\nb. Co-investmentsin credit managementinvestment\nThe Group’s co-investments in credit management and any new exposure acquired\nduring the year are classified as FVOCI debt investments. All other credit management\nco-investment exposures are carried at amortised cost less any impairment provision.\nInterest income on amortized cost instruments is recognized using the effective interest\nrate (“EIR”).\nFVOCI debt investments are initially recorded at fair value. Any subsequent fair value\nchanges on such investments will be recognized directly in equity and any impairment in\nthe carrying value will be recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. At\nthe time of derecognition, any cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is\ntransferred to retained earnings through profit or loss. The fair value changes in FVTPL\ninvestmentsarerecorded in the consolidated statementof profit or loss.\nAny revision of estimated future cash flows are discounted at the original EIR with a\nconsequential adjustment to the carrying amount and a corresponding increase or\ndecreasein consolidated statement of profit or loss.\nc. Co-investmentsinabsolute returninvestments\nThe Group’s co-investments in absolute return investments are classified as FVTPL and\nFVOCI investments and are stated at fair value at the reporting date.

Impairment and un-collectabilityof financial assets\nThe Group recognizes loss allowances in the consolidated statement of profit or loss for\nexpected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets excluding investments classified as\nFVTPLandequityinvestments classified as FVOCI.\nThe Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the\nfollowing, for whichthey are measured as 12-monthECL:\n1. debt investment securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the\nreporting date;and\n2. other financial instruments on which credit risk has not increased significantly\nsince theirinitial recognition.\nThe Group considers a debt security tohave low creditrisk when theircredit risk ratingis\nequivalent tothe globallyunderstooddefinition of 'investment grade'.\nFor the purposes of calculation of ECL, the Group categorizes such financial assets into\nStage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 as describedbelow:\n63 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTINGPOLICIES(CONTINUED)\nStage 1 – Performing: when such financial assets are first recognized, the Group\nrecognizes an allowance basedup to 12-month ECL.\nStage 2 – Significant increase in credit risk: when such financial assets shows a\nsignificant increase in credit risk, the Grouprecords an allowance for the lifetimeECL.\nStage 3 –Impaired:theGroup recognizesthe lifetimeECL for such financial assets.\ni. De-recognition of financialinstruments\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows\nfrom the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash\nflows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of\nthe financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains\nsubstantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of\nthefinancialasset.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, any cumulative gain/ loss recognized in the\nconsolidated statement of other comprehensive income in respect of equity investments\ndesignated at FVOCIistransferred directly to retained earnings.\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation undertheliability is discharged or\ncancelled or hasexpired.\nj. Derivative financial instruments\nDerivatives are stated at fair value determined by using prevailing market rates or\ninternal pricing models.\nDerivativesthatqualify for hedgeaccounting are classified intofairvaluehedges or cash\nflow hedges. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or\nis sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Accounting\ntreatments for both types of hedges and in the case of discontinuance of hedges are\ndisclosed in Note 20.\nFor derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gain or loss arising from\nchanges in theirfair value is taken to the consolidatedstatementof profit or loss.\nk. Premises and equipment\nPremises and equipment substantially comprise land, buildings and related leasehold\nimprovements usedby the Group as office premises.\nThe Company carries its building on freehold land and certain operating assets at\nrevalued amounts, being the fair value of the assets at the date of revaluation less any\nsubsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.\nValuations are performed frequently enough to ensure that the fair value of a revalued\nasset does not differ materially from its carrying value. Any revaluation surplus is\ncredited to the asset revaluation reserve included in equity, except to the extent that it\nreverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in profit and\nloss, in which case the increase is recognized in profit or loss. A revaluation deficit is\nrecognized directly in profit or loss, except that a deficit directly offsetting a previous\nsurplus on the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the asset revaluation\nreserve. A transfer from the asset revaluation reserve to retained earnings is made for\nany difference between the depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the\nasset and depreciation based on the originalcostofthe asset.\n64 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nAllother itemsare recorded at cost lessaccumulateddepreciation.\nPremises and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated\nusefullives which are as follows:\nBuildings on freehold land 25 years\nLeasehold and building improvements 10-15years\nOperating assets 3-23years\nThe above useful lives of the assets and methods of depreciation are reviewed and\nadjusted, if appropriate,at least at eachfinancial year end.\nl. Right-of-useassets and lease liability\nThe Group recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease.\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost,less any accumulated depreciation and\nimpairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The\nrecognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together\nwith any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be\nexercised, or any period covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably\ncertain not to be exercised.\nAt thecommencement date of the lease,the Group recognizes lease liabilities measured\nat the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease\npayments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any\nlease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a\nrate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees as\napplicable. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the\nincremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate\nimplicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the\namount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced\nfor the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is\nremeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-\nsubstance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the\nunderlying asset.\nm. Intangible assets\nIntangible assets comprise management contracts and goodwill recognized on\nacquisition. Management contracts have a useful life of 5 years from the date of the\nacquisitionand are amortized accordingly.\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the\nconsideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed.\n65 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment\nlosses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business\ncombination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-\ngenerating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of\nwhetherother assets or liabilitiesofthe acquireeareassignedto thoseunits.\nThe Group tests goodwill for impairment annually. For other intangible assets, the Group\nreviews the carrying amounts to determine whether there is any indication that those\nassets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable\namount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss\nand if any, impairment loss is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss for\nthe period.\nn. Payables,accruals and provisions\nProvision for employee benefit costs is made in accordance with contractual and\nstatutory obligations and the terms of benefit plans approved by the Board of Directors\n(see Note 24).\nProvisions are made when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past\nevent, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will\nbe required tosettle the obligation and areliable estimate can be made of the amount of\nthe obligation.\no. Unfundeddeal acquisitions\nUnfunded deal acquisitions represent amounts contractually payable by the Group in\nrespect of investment acquisitions the agreements for which are signed, but have not\nbeenfunded, as ofthereportingdate.\np. Borrowings\nBorrowings, represented by short term financing on call, medium-term revolvers,\nmedium-term debt and long-term debt, are initially recognized at the fair value of\nconsideration received and subsequently adjusted for the impact of effective fair value\nhedges. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”) are\ntreated as collateralized financings. The corresponding cash received is recognized in\nthe consolidated statement of financial position as an asset with a corresponding\nobligation to return it as a liability within financing, reflecting the transaction’s economic\nsubstance as aloan tothe Group.\nThe securities delivered repurchase agreements are not derecognized from the\nconsolidated statement of financial position as the Group retains substantially all of the\nrisksand rewards of ownership\nTransaction costs relating to borrowings are initially capitalized and deducted from the\nborrowings and subsequently recognized as interest expense over the expected life of\ntheseborrowings.\nq. Treasury shares\nTreasury shares are stated at acquisition cost and are shown as a deduction to equity.\nAny surplus arising from the subsequent sale of treasury shares at a price greater than\ncost is treated asnon-distributable andincludedin ashare premiumreserveunder\n66 NOTESTOTHECONSOLIDATEDFINANCIALSTATEMENTS\nINVESTCORP S.A.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n26.

Any deficit arising from the subsequent sale of treasury shares at a price lower\nthan cost is charged first against any previously established reserve from past\ntransactions in treasury shares, and where such reserve is insufficient, then any\ndifference is charged to retainedearnings.\nr. Share awards\nShare awards to employees are accounted and expense recognized over the vesting\nperiod. The determination of the amount to be recognized is estimated based on a\nmodel that takes into account the probability weighted vesting of the shares at the fair\nvalue on the grant dateusing the historical pattern of employee tenure. These estimates\nare updated regularly basedon actualinformation.\ns. Dividends\nProposed dividends are disclosed as appropriations within equity until the time they are\napproved by the shareholders.

Profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent of $135 million was 9% higher\nthan the prior fiscal year (FY21).

Operating expenses increased by 17% to $338 million (FY21:\n$290 million) in line with the growth in gross operating income.\nAUM fees, transaction and advisory income\nAUM fees, transaction and advisory income has two components: (i) AUM fees which include management and\nadministrative fees on aggregate client investments under management in PE, RE and SC deals, all fees from\nclient investments in ARI and CM as well as placement fees earned on PE and RE investments from program\nclients; and (ii) Transaction and advisory income which are generated and earned from transactional activities in\nconnection with PE or RE acquisitions. Activity fees also includes part of the placement fees earned by the Group\nfrom clients (excluding placements with program clients) and eventual exit fees, plus performance fees on PE, RE\nand SC assets under management (AUM) for value added during the ownership period, and income from SPACs.\nDISCUSSION OF RESULTS | 20\nBUSINESS REVIEW\nSummary of fees ($ millions) FY22 FY21 % Change H/(L)\nPE fees 91 91 -\nCM fees 65 59 10%\nRE fees 49 35 40%\nSC fees 13 7 86%\nOther management fees 22 25 (12%)\nAUM Fees 240 217 11%\nPE investment 84 77 9%\nRE investment 64 61 5%\nSPAC income 22 - n.m.\nCM investment 1 1 -\nTransaction and advisory income 171 139 23%\nAUM fees, transaction and advisory income 411 356 15%\nTotal AUM fees, transaction and advisory income in FY22 increased to $411 million (FY21: $356 million).\nAUM fees were $240 million in FY22, 11% higher than FY21.

Other expenses, comprising professional fees, travel and\nbusiness development, administration and infrastructure costs and non-compensation personnel costs such as\ntraining and recruitment increased by 18% to $91 million as compared to $77 million for the same period last year.\nThis is primarily due to an increase in travel and other discretionary expenses as travel restrictions imposed due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic started to ease as well as the generally increasing costs as markets have re-opened\naround the world and inflationary pressures are rising globally.\nOperating expenses ($ millions) FY22 FY21 Change H/(L)\nStaff compensation 225 199 26\nOther personnel costs and charges 22 14 8\nOther operating expenses 91 77 14\nTotal operating expenses 338 290 48\nFull time employees (‘FTE’) at end of period 486 427 59\nStaff compensation per FTE (‘000) 463 466 (1%)\nTotal staff compensation / total operating expenses 67% 69% (2%)\nCost-to-income(a) 69% 68% 1%\n(a) Operating expenses / Net revenue.

The affirmation also reflects the vulnerability of Investcorp's business model to a market downturn\nand Fitch's view of the firm's ability to maintain credit metrics in line with expectations.\n“Rating constraints include the firm's increased earnings volatility and placement risk relative to peers, given its\nbusiness model of offering investments to clients on a fully underwritten deal-by-deal basis and its sizable co-\ninvestment portfolio, which is subject to fair value changes. Activity fees, which are earned from transactional\nactivities and have comprised almost half of Investcorp's core fees over the past several years, are also susceptible\nto market volatility.”2\nIn November 2021, Moody’s affirmed Investcorp’s credit ratings at Ba2, and ‘Negative’ outlook. “The rating reflects\nthe company's solid market position in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region as a leading alternative\ninvestment provider, its global franchise, healthy operating margin and good asset retention.\n“Furthermore, Investcorp's level of assets under management (AUM) and liquidity are expected to remain resilient,\nand the company has a significant amount of loss-absorbing equity capital which counters its elevated balance\nsheet risk. The rating and its associated negative outlook also reflects our expectation that Investcorp group's gross\ndebt / adjusted EBITDA will remain elevated as the company seeks to diversify its funding sources.”3\nEquity\nEquity ($ millions) Jun-22 Jun-21 Change H/(L)\nOrdinary shareholders’ equity 895 854 41\nPreference share capital 375 375 -\nProposed appropriations 52 44 8\nOther reserves (8) (3) (5)\nNon-controlling interests 1 2 (1)\nNet book equity 1,315 1,272 43\nNet equity as of June 30, 2022 remained stable at $1.3 billion.

The\nincrease in total client AUM in FY22 is largely attributable to the 34% increase in real estate client AUM to $8.3\nbillion from $6.2 billion. This increase is largely due to the acquisition and placement of various new portfolios and\nfundraising for the new Industrial Real Estate Venture. Credit management client AUM increased by 11% to $15.7\nbillion from $14.2 billion largely due to the issuance/pricing of several CLOs. The growth in credit management\nclient AUM has been somewhat offset by the devaluation of the EUR versus the USD during the year.

          "content": "RATING ACTION COMMENTARY\nFitch Af\u0000rms Investcorp's\nRatings at 'BB'; Outlook Stable\nThu 04 Nov, 2021 - 3:52 PM ET\nFitch Ratings - Chicago - 04 Nov 2021: Fitch Ratings has af\u0000rmed the Long-Term Issuer\nDefault Rating (IDR) and Short-Term IDR of Investcorp Holdings B.S.C. and its related\nentities (collectively Investcorp) at 'BB' and 'B', respectively. Concurrently, Fitch has\nassigned a Long-Term senior unsecured debt rating of 'BB' to Investcorp's revolving credit\nfacility. The Rating Outlook is Stable.\nToday's rating actions have been taken as part of a periodic peer review of the alternative\ninvestment manager (IM) industry, which is comprised of 11 publicly rated global \u0000rms. For\nmore information on the broader sector review, please see, \"Fitch Completes 2021\nAlternative Investment Manager Peer Review,\" available at www.\u0000tchratings.com.\nKEY RATING DRIVERS\nIDR AND SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT\nThe rating af\u0000rmation re\u0000ects the locked-in nature of most of Investcorp's fee streams, its\nstrong client franchise and high degree of brand name recognition in the Gulf, supported by\nits investment track record and long-term relationships in the region. The af\u0000rmation also\nre\u0000ects the vulnerability of Investcorp's business model to a market downturn and Fitch's\nview of the \u0000rm's ability to maintain credit metrics in line with expectations.\nRating constraints include the \u0000rm's increased earnings volatility and placement risk\nrelative to peers, given its business model of offering investments to clients on a fully\nunderwritten deal-by-deal (DBD) basis and its sizable co-investment portfolio, which is\nsubject to fair value changes. Activity fees, which are earned from transactional activities\nand have comprised almost half of Investcorp's core fees over the past several years, are\nalso susceptible to market volatility.\nWhile the impact of oil price volatility on Investcorp's portfolio companies is limited, it\ncould have \u0000scal impacts in the region. Still, Investcorp's Gulf investors have demonstrated\nrelatively low sensitivity to oil price movements, as evidenced by record levels of DBD\nplacement activity during previous periods of volatility in the energy sector. Fitch believes\nGulf investors will continue to explore opportunities to diversify outside of the region.\nInvestcorp has embarked upon several strategic initiatives and expansion efforts aimed at\nenhancing its product offerings and geographic representation, including the\ninstitutionalization of its investor base and the expansion of committed capital fund\nstructures. Fitch believes there are execution risks associated with the \u0000rm's strategy,\nincluding integration risk associated with acquisitions, and increased group complexity\nrelated to product and geographic expansion, which will take time to evaluate.\nInvestcorp's AUM, which is largely invested in the U.S. and Europe, totaled $37.6 billion at\n\u0000scal year-end 2021 (June 30, 2021), up 17.0% from FYE20, driven by strong market\nperformance and solid fundraising. Investcorp raised more capital in committed capital\nfund structures in FY21, including launching its inaugural North America private equity\n(PE) fund.\nCore operating performance, as measured by fee-related EBITDA (FEBITDA), which\nexcludes investment income from co-investments, performance fees and performance-\nrelated compensation, improved in FY21 but remained modest. Fitch believes Investcorp\nhas less variability in its compensation structure than peers, given its business model. As\nsuch, the agency has elected to allocate a greater portion of the \u0000rm's total compensation\nto fee-based compensation, which adversely impacts its FEBITDA margin.\nThe FEBITDA margin amounted to 20.2% for FY21; up from 10.6% in FY20, and at the low-\nend of Fitch's 'bbb' category benchmark range of 20%-30% for alternative IMs. Pro\u0000tability\ncould improve over time, to the extent that Investcorp is able to scale its platform.\nPerformance fees totaled $33 million and balance sheet gains amounted to $107 million in\nFY21, representing a signi\u0000cant improvement over the prior year.\nWhen assessing Investcorp's leverage, Fitch takes a hybrid approach, given the \u0000rm's cash\ngenerative business model and heavy balance sheet utilization. On this basis, Fitch views\nInvestcorp's leverage pro\u0000le as commensurate with the current rating level, with its high\ndebt to FEBITDA (8.5x for FY21) somewhat offset by more modest debt to tangible equity\n(0.5x at FY21).\nFitch believes Investcorp had adequate liquidity at FYE21 with $289 million of cash,\ndeposits with \u0000nancial institutions and other liquid assets, along with $789 million of\nborrowing capacity on its corporate revolvers. Additionally, Investcorp had $705 million of\nbalance sheet co-investments, which could serve as additional collateral for debt, although\nit is comprised of relatively illiquid investments. Aside from client assets, which are due on\ndemand, the \u0000rm's nearest debt maturity is March 2030.\nInterest coverage, as measured by FEBITDA to interest expense on corporate debt, was\nmodest, at 2.4x for FY21, which is within Fitch's 'bb' category quantitative benchmark\nrange of 2x-4x for alternative IMs.\nThe Stable Outlook re\u0000ects Fitch's expectation that Investcorp will maintain credit metrics\nin line with Fitch's 'bb' category quantitative benchmark ranges for alternative IMs.\nThe senior unsecured debt rating is equalized with Investcorp's Long-Term IDR, re\u0000ecting\nthe largely unsecured funding pro\u0000le, expectations for average recovery prospects under a\nstress scenario and joint and several guarantees by Investcorp S.A., which is the principal\noperating and asset owning arm of the \u0000rm.\nSUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES\nInvestcorp S.A. is the principal operating and asset-owning subsidiary of the group and is a\njoint and several guarantor on debt issued by Investcorp Capital Ltd. Therefore, the Long-\nTerm IDR of each entity is equalized with Investcorp.\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\nIDRs AND SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade include\nfee-paying AUM growth, enhanced AUM diversity and scalability of the platform, resulting\nin FEBITDA margin expansion, further institutionalization of the investor base, an increase\nin management fee contribution from committed capital fund structures, enhanced\nincentive earning potential, a decline in balance sheet and/or cash \u0000ow leverage, such that\nthese metrics approach 0.50x and 4.0x, respectively, under Fitch's hybrid leverage analysis,\nimproved interest coverage, while maintaining adequate liquidity and co-investment\nfunding.\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action/downgrade\ninclude material declines in AUM, which impair the \u0000rm's management fee generating\ncapacity; a reduction in liquidity; or material changes in leverage and/or interest coverage\nresulting from a material degradation of balance sheet assets and/or weaker investment\nperformance which adversely affects the \u0000rm's ability to generate FEBITDA. More\nspeci\u0000cally, increases in debt to tangible equity and debt to FEBITDA, such that the\ncombination of these metrics exceeds 1.0x and 6.0x, respectively, under Fitch's hybrid\nleverage analysis, could negatively affect ratings.\nThe senior unsecured debt rating is equalized with Investcorp's IDRs and therefore, would\nbe expected to move in tandem. Although not envisioned by Fitch, were Investcorp to\nexperience an increase in secured debt as a percentage of total debt, this could result in the\nunsecured debt rating being notched below Investcorp's Long-Term IDR.\nSUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES\nThe ratings of Investcorp S.A. and Investcorp Capital Ltd. are linked to the IDR of Investcorp\nand are, therefore, expected to move in tandem.\nBEST/WORST CASE RATING SCENARIO\nInternational scale credit ratings of Financial Institutions and Covered Bond issuers have a\nbest-case rating upgrade scenario (de\u0000ned as the 99th percentile of rating transitions,\nmeasured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a\nworst-case rating downgrade scenario (de\u0000ned as the 99th percentile of rating transitions,\nmeasured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of\nbest- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to\n'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

Fitch believes the\ninstitutionalization of its investor base and the ability to expand committed capital fund\nstructures will likely be delayed. Further, Fitch also believes execution risks are associated with\nthe firm’s growth strategy to more than double AUM, to $50 billion, over the medium term\nthrough organic and inorganic growth. Specifically, integration risk associated with acquisitions\nand increased group complexity related to product and geographic expansion are notable\nconsiderations.\nInorganic Growth\nIn May 2020, Investcorp entered into a 50/50 joint venture (JV) with Tages Group, a leading\nEuropean alternative asset management firm, which added $1.7 billion of AUM to the platform.\nThe JV, Investcorp-Tages Limited, will manage the absolute return investments of the combined\nentities, which Fitch believes adds scale and expands Investcorp's investor base, product suite\nand geographic reach.\nIn September 2019, Investcorp entered the direct lending space with an acquisition of a\nmajority stake (76%) in CM Investment Partners (CMIP), the investment advisor to CM Finance,\na publicly traded business development company (BDC). As of June 30, 2020, the AUM relating\nto CMIP amounted to $270.6 million.\nDuring the first half of 2020, Investcorp completed the acquisition of Mercury Capital Advisors\n(Mercury), a placement agent with over 2,500 institutional investors across the globe. The\ntransaction is expected to strengthen Investcorp's capital raising efforts and further\ninstitutionalize its investor base over time.\nRevolver Extension\nIn March 2020, Investcorp amended its $250 million revolving credit facility that was maturing\nin December 2020, resulting in an increase in facility size to $350 million, improved economics,\nand a maturity of March 2024, with a one-year extension option.\nCoronavirus Vaccine Moves up Recovery Timetable, Albeit Still Sluggish\nFitch updated its “Global Economic Outlook” (GEO) report on Dec. 7, 2020, which forecasts\nglobal GDP will be down 3.7% in 2020, up from an expected 4.4% decline in the September 2020\nGEO. Fitch also modestly revised up its annual global GDP growth forecast for 2021 to 5.3%\nfrom 5.2%, as the deteriorating outlook in the near term partially offsets a stronger outlook for\nthe second half of 2021.\nWhile the second wave of the virus is prompting renewed national lockdowns in Europe and\ntighter restrictions in the U.S., a vaccine rollout raises the prospect of a significant easing in the\nglobal health crisis by the middle of 2021 and a more certain economic recovery thereafter.\nUnder Fitch’s base case assumption that an effective vaccine rollout will accelerate in the major\neconomies in 2Q21 and reach the majority of those populations in 2H21, the agency expects\nthe U.S. and the eurozone to regain pre-pandemic (4Q19) GDP levels earlier than previously\nanticipated, by 3Q21 (up from 4Q21) and 2Q22 (up from 4Q22), respectively. The key downside\nrisk includes delays in a vaccine rollout that result in repeated lockdowns and extensive social\ndistancing through 2021, weighing heavily on GDP.\nInvestcorp Holdings B.S.C.\nRating Report │ January 4, 2021 fitchratings.com 4\nNon-Bank Financial Institutions\nInvestment Managers\nBahrain\nAUM Growth\nCompany Summary and Key Qualitative Assessment Factors\nStrategic Capital and Other\nMarket Dynamics Uncertain ICM\nPE\nFitch remains cautious about the significant amount of capital the industry has available to ARI\ninvest, given competitive and uncertain market conditions.

The Rating Outlook is Stable.\nToday's rating actions have been taken as part of a periodic peer review of the alternative\ninvestment manager (IM) industry, which comprises nine publicly rated global firms. For\nmore information on the broader sector review, please see, \"Fitch Completes Alternative\nInvestment Manager Peer Review,\" available at www.fitchratings.com.\nKEY RATING DRIVERS\nIDR AND SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT\nThe rating affirmation reflects the locked-in nature of most of Investcorp's fee streams, its\nstrong client franchise and high degree of brand name recognition in the Gulf, supported by\nits investment track record and long-term relationships in the region. The affirmation also\nreflects the vulnerability of Investcorp's business model to a market downturn and Fitch's\nview of the firm's ability to maintain credit metrics in line with expectations.\nRating constraints include the firm's increased earnings volatility and placement risk\nrelative to peers, given its business model of offering investments to clients on a fully\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/research/non-bank-financial-institutions/fitch-affirms-investcorp-ratings-at-bb-outlook-stable-12-11-2020 1/11\n11/12/2020 Fitch Affirms Investcorp's Ratings at 'BB'; Outlook Stable\nunderwritten deal-by-deal (DBD) basis and its sizable co-investment portfolio, which is\nsubject to fair value changes. Activity fees, which are earned from transactional activities\nand have comprised almost half of Investcorp's core fees over the past several years, are\nalso susceptible to market volatility.\nWhile the impact of oil price volatility on Investcorp's portfolio companies is limited,\ndepressed oil prices will likely have fiscal impacts in the region. Still, Investcorp's Gulf\ninvestors have demonstrated relatively low sensitivity to oil price movements, as evidenced\nby record levels of DBD placement activity during previous periods of volatility in the\nenergy sector. While Fitch believes Gulf investors will continue to explore opportunities to\ndiversify outside of the region, potential liquidity challenges could disrupt efforts in the\nnear term.\nAssets under management (AUM) totaled $32.2 billion at fiscal year-end 2020 (June 30,\n2020), up 14.4% from FYE19, driven by a combination of organic and inorganic growth.\nFundraising and placement activity remained solid during the year, with net client flows\nrepresenting 7.6% of beginning AUM. That said, Fitch believes fundraising activity will be\nless certain during FY21, given the continued economic impact of the coronavirus.\nIn September 2019, Investcorp entered the direct lending space with an acquisition of a\nmajority stake (76%) in CM Investment Partners (CMIP), the investment advisor to CM\nFinance, a publicly traded business development company (BDC). As of June 30, 2020, the\nAUM relating to CMIP amounted to $270.6 million.\nIn May 2020, Investcorp entered into a 50/50 joint venture (JV) with Tages Group, a leading\nEuropean alternative asset management firm, which added $1.7 billion of AUM to the\nplatform. The JV, Investcorp-Tages Limited, will manage the absolute return investments of\nthe combined entities, which Fitch believes adds scale and expands Investcorp's investor\nbase, product suite and geographic reach.\nFitch also believes execution risks are associated with Investcorp's growth strategy to more\nthan double AUM, to $50 billion, over the medium term through organic and inorganic\ngrowth. Further, the firm's ability to meaningfully execute on certain strategic initiatives,\nincluding the institutionalization of its investor base and the ability to expand committed\ncapital fund structures, will be delayed by the impact the global coronavirus pandemic, in\nFitch's view.\nCore operating performance, as measured by fee-related EBITDA (FEBITDA), which\nexcludes investment income from co-investments, performance fees and performance-\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/research/non-bank-financial-institutions/fitch-affirms-investcorp-ratings-at-bb-outlook-stable-12-11-2020 2/11\n11/12/2020 Fitch Affirms Investcorp's Ratings at 'BB'; Outlook Stable\nrelated compensation, deteriorated in FY20, due to the economic impact of the\ncoronavirus. FEBITDA was almost halved at $80 million in FY20, compared with $150\nmillion in the prior year, primarily driven by a significant reduction in activity fees, lower\nmanagement fees and slightly higher expenses. The firm's FEBITDA margin was 28.1% in\nFY20, which is in line with Fitch's quantitative benchmark range for 'bbb' category\nalternative IMs of 20%-30% and down from 43.7% in FY19.\nManagement fees declined 5.6% in FY20, which was primarily driven by fund maturities,\nfee reductions on fund extensions and, to a lesser extent, the suspension of fees on certain\nprivate equity (PE) investments, due to the valuation impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\nAlso, in FY19, PE management fees were boosted by catch-up fees and the acceleration of\ndeferred fees for deals exited during the year.\nActivity fees were down 29% in FY20, reflecting reduced levels of acquisitions, placements\nand exit activity during the year.\nIn FY20, Investcorp incurred losses of $110 million on its balance sheet investments,\ncompared with asset-based income of $89 million in FY19, due to valuation declines in\ncertain U.S. retail sector exposures.\nRealized net performance fees, which tend to be lumpy from period to period due to deal\nactivity and market volatility, totaled $2 million in FY20, down from $32 million in FY19.\nInvestcorp's leverage, as measured by debt to tangible equity, amounted to 0.9x at FYE20,\nup from 0.4x at FYE19. The increase reflects the valuation impact of balance sheet\ninvestments and a change in Fitch's classification of debt. As part of its transition to a\nholding company, client bank deposits (which were excluded from prior leverage\ncalculations) were transferred into a client trust, which subsequently extended a $261\nmillion revolving loan facility to the company. There are no changes to the economics of\nthese liabilities, as balances and client distributions are typically retained and primarily\nused to fund new investments.\nDebt to FEBITDA increased to 9.3x at FYE20 from 2.6x at FYE19. On a hybrid basis,\nleverage is in line with Fitch's 'bb' category quantitative benchmark range for alternative\ninvestment managers (IMs).\nFitch believes Investcorp maintained adequate liquidity as of FYE20 with $309 million of\ncash, deposits with financial institutions and other liquid assets, along with $684 million of\nborrowing capacity on its corporate revolvers and $233 million of available liquidity from\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/research/non-bank-financial-institutions/fitch-affirms-investcorp-ratings-at-bb-outlook-stable-12-11-2020 3/11\n11/12/2020 Fitch Affirms Investcorp's Ratings at 'BB'; Outlook Stable\nclient trusts. Additionally, Investcorp had $810 million of balance sheet co-investments at\nFYE20, which could serve as additional collateral for debt, although it is comprised of\nrelatively illiquid investments. Aside from client assets, which are due on demand, the firm's\nnearest debt maturity is June 2023.\nFitch believes the extension of credit offered by Investcorp's clients provides flexibility to\nthe firm to execute on investment opportunities, although the withdrawal of client assets\nwould reduce the firm's liquidity. Still, Investcorp has long-standing client relationships that\nhave proven to be sticky throughout various market cycles.\nDebt service coverage, defined as FEBITDA divided by interest expense, was 2.7x for FY20,\nwhich down from 3.6x in FY19 and in line with Fitch's quantitative benchmark of 2x-4x for\nalternative investment managers (IMs) in the 'bb' rating category.\nUnfunded deal acquisitions and unfunded co-investment commitments to various\ninvestments totaled $193 million at FYE20, which Fitch believes will be funded over time\nwith cash on hand and operating cash flow. Fitch believes the company has significant\ndiscretion over the timing of these funding commitments.\nThe Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that Investcorp will maintain credit metrics\nin line with the agency's quantitative benchmark range for 'bb' category alternative IMs.\nThe senior unsecured debt rating is equalized with Investcorp's Long-Term IDR, reflecting\nthe largely unsecured funding profile, expectations for average recovery prospects under a\nstress scenario and joint and several guarantees by Investcorp S.A., which is the principal\noperating and asset owning arm of the firm.\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\nIDRs AND SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action/downgrade\ninclude:\n-- Material declines in AUM that impair the firm's management fee generating capacity; a\nreduction in liquidity; or material changes in leverage and/or interest coverage resulting\nfrom a material degradation of balance sheet assets and/or weaker investment\nperformance that adversely impacts the firm's ability to generate FEBITDA. More\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/research/non-bank-financial-institutions/fitch-affirms-investcorp-ratings-at-bb-outlook-stable-12-11-2020 4/11\n11/12/2020 Fitch Affirms Investcorp's Ratings at 'BB'; Outlook Stable\nspecifically, increases in balance sheet and/or cash flow leverage, such that these metrics\napproach or exceed 1.0x and 6.0x, respectively, under Fitch's hybrid leverage analysis, could\nnegatively affect ratings.\nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade\ninclude:\n-- Fee-paying AUM growth, enhanced scalability of the platform and AUM diversity,\ninstitutionalizing the investor base, an increase in management fee contributions from\ncommitted capital fund structures, a reduction in leverage and strengthened interest\ncoverage, while maintaining adequate liquidity and co-investment funding.\nThe senior unsecured debt rating is equalized with Investcorp's IDRs and, therefore, would\nbe expected to move in tandem. Although not envisioned by Fitch, an increase in secured\ndebt as a percentage of total debt could result in the unsecured debt rating being notched\nbelow Investcorp's Long-Term IDR.\nBEST/WORST CASE RATING SCENARIO\nInternational scale credit ratings of Financial Institutions and Covered Bond issuers have a\nbest-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions,\nmeasured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a\nworst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions,\nmeasured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of\nbest- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to\n'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance.

The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-\nparty verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its\nissuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is\noffered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public\ninformation, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-\nexisting third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters,\nappraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided\nby third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification\nsources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer,\nand a variety of other factors.

Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the\ninformation they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other\nreports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts,\nincluding independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with\nrespect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other\ninformation are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions\nabout future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

The Rating\nOutlook has been revised to Stable from Positive.\nKEY RATING DRIVERS\nIDR AND SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT\nThe Outlook revision reflects Fitch's view of the impact the global coronavirus\npandemic will have on Investcorp's ability to execute on its strategic initiatives over\nthe next 12-18 months, including continued growth in assets under management\n(AUM), the institutionalization of its investor base and the ability to expand\ncommitted capital fund structures. While Fitch believes there is upside potential to\nInvestcorp's ratings over time, it will likely be pushed out beyond Fitch's outlook\nhorizon.\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/research/non-bank-financial-institutions/fitch-affirms-investcorp-ratings-at-bb-outlook-revised-to-stable-03-04-2020 1/10\n4/3/2020 Fitch Affirms Investcorp's Ratings at 'BB'; Outlook Revised to Stable\nInvestcorp's business model of offering investments to its clients on a fully\nunderwritten deal-by-deal (DBD) basis and maintaining a sizable co-investment\nportfolio, which is subject to fair value changes, increases the firm's earnings\nvolatility and placement risk, making it particularly susceptible to a market\ndownturn, relative to the peer group. Fitch also believes activity fees, which are\nearned from transactional activities and have comprised almost half of Investcorp's\ncore fees over the past three years, will be under pressure in the near to\nintermediate term.\nWhile the impact of oil price volatility on Investcorp's portfolio companies is limited,\ndepressed oil prices will likely have fiscal impacts in the region. Still, Investcorp's\nGulf investors have demonstrated relatively low sensitivity to oil price movements,\nas evidenced by record levels of DBD placement activity during previous periods of\nvolatility in the energy sector. While Fitch believes Gulf investors will continue to\nexplore opportunities to diversify outside the region, potential liquidity challenges\ncould disrupt efforts in the near term.\nThe rating affirmation reflects Fitch's view that recent steps taken by Investcorp to\nde-risk its balance sheet and shore up liquidity will allow the firm to withstand an\neconomic downturn. The ratings also reflect the locked-in nature of most of\nInvestcorp's fee streams, its strong client franchise and high degree of brand name\nrecognition in the Gulf, supported by its investment track record and long-term\nrelationships in the region.\nOver the past year, Investcorp has taken several steps to reduce balance sheet risk,\nincluding the sale of investments through two secondary transactions with\nHarbourVest Partners and Coller Capital and the sale of TPx Communications in\nFebruary 2020, which represented the largest co-investment exposure on its\nbalance sheet at approximately 11% at Dec. 31, 2019. Co-investments totaled $1.1\nbillion at Dec. 31, 2019.\nAUM totaled $31.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2019, up 10.7% from fiscal YE 2019 (June 30,\n2019), as fundraising and placement activity outpaced realizations during the year.\nNet client flows averaged 3.8% of beginning AUM over the past four years, excluding\nM&A transactions. Aggregate inflows totaled $2.6 billion in 1H20, up $300 million\nfrom 1H19. Fitch believes fundraising activity for 2H20 will be more uncertain, given\nthe impact the coronavirus is having on travel and market activity.\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/research/non-bank-financial-institutions/fitch-affirms-investcorp-ratings-at-bb-outlook-revised-to-stable-03-04-2020 2/10\n4/3/2020 Fitch Affirms Investcorp's Ratings at 'BB'; Outlook Revised to Stable\nCore operating performance, as measured by fee-related EBITDA (FEBITDA), which\nexcludes investment income from co-investments, performance fees and\nperformance-related compensation, was up 28.5% for TTM Dec. 31, 2019, largely\ndriven by higher activity fees. FEBITDA margin was 48.0% in 1H20, on a TTM basis,\ncompared with 42.4% in the prior-year period. Fitch believes margins will be\nadversely affected in the near to intermediate term, given the relative contribution\nfrom activity fees, which are largely market driven.\nAsset-based income, which reflects gains and losses on co-investments, was down\n71% in 1H20, reflecting lower returns on private equity (PE) investments due to\nvaluation declines in certain U.S. retail sector exposures and a writedown on its\ninvestment in IT services provider TPx. Realized net performance fees, which tend to\nbe lumpy from period to period due to deal activity and market volatility, were $3\nmillion in 1H20, compared with $9 million the prior year.\nInvestcorp's leverage, as measured by debt to tangible equity, amounted to 0.9x at\nDec. 31, 2019, up from 0.4x at fiscal YE 2019. The increase reflects Investcorp's\ntransition to a holding company and the transfer of what were client bank deposits\n(which were excluded from prior leverage calculations) into a client trust, which has\nsubsequently extended a $452 million revolving loan facility to the company. Debt to\nFEBITDA was 5.6x for the TTM ended Dec. 31, 2019, up from 2.5x at fiscal YE 2019\ngiven draws on the revolving loan facility. On a hybrid basis, leverage is in line with\nFitch's 'bbb' category quantitative benchmark range for alternative investment\nmanagers.\nCash and short-term assets totaled $281 million, compared with $984 million of\ndebt outstanding at Dec. 31, 2019. In March 2020, the company upsized borrowing\ncapacity on its corporate revolver, which currently stands at $786 million, and\nextended the maturity, with a portion maturing in 2023 and the remainder in 2024.\nSince YE 2019, Investcorp has taken steps to boost its liquidity, such as proactively\ndrawing on corporate revolvers and further boosting its cash position, which is now\nsufficient to cover short-term debt balances.\nFitch believes the extension of credit offered by Investcorp's clients provides\nflexibility to the firm to execute on investment opportunities, although the\nwithdrawal of client assets would reduce the firm's liquidity. Still, Investcorp has\nlong-standing client relationships that have proven to be sticky throughout various\nmarket cycles.\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/research/non-bank-financial-institutions/fitch-affirms-investcorp-ratings-at-bb-outlook-revised-to-stable-03-04-2020 3/10\n4/3/2020 Fitch Affirms Investcorp's Ratings at 'BB'; Outlook Revised to Stable\nUnfunded deal acquisitions and unfunded co-investment commitments to various\nPE and real estate investments totaled $224 million at Dec. 31, 2019, which Fitch\nbelieves will be funded over time with cash on hand and operating cash flow. Fitch\nbelieves the company has significant discretion over the timing of these funding\ncommitments. Fitch believes additional liquidity demands could include shoring up\ncapital for PE portfolio companies.\nThe senior unsecured debt rating is equalized with Investcorp's Long-Term IDR,\nreflecting the largely unsecured funding profile, expectations for average recovery\nprospects under a stress scenario and joint and several guarantees by Investcorp\nS.A., which is the principal operating and asset owning arm of the firm.\nRATING SENSITIVITIES\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating\nAction/Upgrade:\n--Fee-paying AUM growth;\n--Enhanced scalability of the platform and AUM diversity;\n--Institutionalizing the investor base;\n--An increase in management fee contribution from committed capital fund\nstructures and strengthened interest coverage, while maintaining adequate\ncapitalization, co-investment funding and liquidity positions without meaningful\ngrowth in balance sheet co-investments.\nFitch believes rating upside is likely limited to the 'BB' rating category over the\nintermediate term due to the potential earnings volatility associated with the\ncompany's business model and balance sheet co-investment exposure. The\ncompany's DBD business model could be a profitability constraint in a period of\ninvestment origination and/or placement activity weakness, while elevated co-\ninvestment exposure introduces balance sheet risk in the event of investment losses.\nPost-origination placement may also introduce balance sheet risk in the event\nInvestcorp is unable to place originated investments with clients.\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/research/non-bank-financial-institutions/fitch-affirms-investcorp-ratings-at-bb-outlook-revised-to-stable-03-04-2020 4/10\n4/3/2020 Fitch Affirms Investcorp's Ratings at 'BB'; Outlook Revised to Stable\nFactors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating\nAction/Downgrade:\n--Material declines in AUM, which impair the firm's management fee generating\ncapacity;\n--A material increase in balance sheet co-investments not funded by equity, higher\nleverage or a reduction in liquidity.\nThe senior unsecured debt rating is equalized with Investcorp's IDRs and would\ntherefore be expected to move in tandem. Although not envisioned by Fitch, were\nInvestcorp to experience an increase in secured debt as a percentage of total debt,\nthis could result in the unsecured debt rating being notched below Investcorp's\nLong-Term IDR.\nBEST/WORST CASE RATING SCENARIO\nBest/Worst Case Rating Scenarios - Financial Institutions:\nRatings of Financial Institutions issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario\n(defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction)\nof three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating\ndowngrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured\nin a negative direction) of four notches over three years.

Concurrently, Fitch has withdrawn\nInvestcorp's Viability Rating, Support Rating and Support Rating Floor given the relinquishment of\nthe firm's banking license. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable. A full list\nof ratings is provided at the end of this release.\nToday's rating actions have been taken as part of a periodic peer review of the alternative\ninvestment manager (IM) industry, which is comprised of seven publicly rated global firms.

Fitch believes the\ncompletion of several strategic inorganic and organic initiatives will allow the firm to enhance its\nproduct offerings, expand growth in new markets and enhance fee-related earnings. However, there\nare execution risks associated with Investcorp's strategic growth initiatives, including integration\nrisk associated with acquisitions and increased group complexity related to product and geographic\nexpansion.\nThe rating affirmation reflects Investcorp's strong client franchise and high degree of brand name\nrecognition in the Gulf, supported by its investment track record and long-term relationships in the\nregion. The ratings also reflect Investcorp's solid capitalization and leverage profile relative to the\nassigned ratings, strong profitability and an appropriate funding strategy, which incorporates the\nuse of long-dated debt to fund its co-investment portfolio, which reduces the impact of refinancing\nand liquidity risk inherent in Investcorp's business model of originating and syndicating alternative\ninvestments on a deal-by-deal (DBD) basis.\nRating constraints include increased potential earnings volatility and placement risk associated\nwith Investcorp's strategy of offering investments to its Gulf clients on an underwritten DBD basis\nand sizable, albeit reduced, balance sheet co-investments, which are subject to mark-to-market\nvolatility. Further, the increasingly competitive alternative investment and credit environments\ncould affect Investcorp's ability to originate/syndicate investments and/or reduce the valuation\nof balance sheet investments. Fitch believes economic and political pressure in the Middle East,\nincluding potential long-term supply issues in oil, could affect Investcorp's investment placement/\nfundraising amongst Middle Eastern investors. However, continued pressure in the region could\nmotivate Gulf-based clients to increase global investments, demonstrated by record levels of\ncapital being raised in the region by Investcorp in fiscal year (FY) 2019.\nThe acquisition and continued expansion of Investcorp Credit Management (ICM) has contributed\nsignificantly to recent AUM growth, the extension of capital duration and increased earnings\nstability due to the recurring nature of management fees, although this is somewhat offset by lower\nmargins on the CLO business relative to PE investments. While the acquisition enhanced product\ndiversification, the size of the CLO business relative to Investcorp's other segments has created\nsome concentration risk. ICM represented 42% of AUM at June 30, 2019 and 28% of management\nfees in FY19.\nWhile ICM is principally CLO-centric, the firm aims to build out the non-CLO side of its credit\nbusiness over time. In June 2019, Investcorp announced its entry into the direct lending space with\nthe acquisition of a majority stake in CM Investment Partners (CMIP), the investment advisor to\nCM Finance, a publicly traded business development company (BDC). CMIP had approximately\n$330 million in AUM at June 30, 2019. The transaction expands Investcorp's investor base, given\nthe BDC's large institutional backing. While the addition of credit products will support growth in\nmanagement fees, the expansion occurs at a time when underwriting conditions are exceptionally\ncompetitive. Fitch will evaluate the performance of the BDC over time.\nIn May 2019, Investcorp also announced plans to acquire placement agent Mercury Capital\nAdvisors, which has relationships with over 2,500 institutional investors across the globe. Mercury\nis expected to remain an independent business operating under its current leadership team. The\ntransaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019. Mercury is expected to further\nstrengthen Investcorp's capital raising efforts.\nInvestcorp's strategic investment in an independent, Swiss-regulated private bank provides a\nplatform for Investcorp to offer investment solutions to high-net-worth individuals, family offices\nand institutional clients primarily from Switzerland and Europe, which should help drive AUM\ngrowth. Investcorp successfully completed a fundraising collaboration with private clients during\nFY19. The bank will remain operationally independent.\nAUM increased 7.1% annually, to $28.2 billion, at fiscal year end June, 30 2019, primarily driven\nby solid fundraising in private equity, credit and absolute return investments (ARI). Net client\nflows averaged 2.7% of beginning AUM over the past four years, excluding M&A transactions.\nIn FY19, aggregate inflows totaled $5.7 billion, up from $3.5 billion in the prior year, which was\npartially offset by $3.7 billion of client realizations and redemptions. Fundraising activity for FY20\nis expected to be solid across the platform assuming markets remain accommodative.\nFitch views Investcorp's core operating performance as incrementally improved, due to the relative\nstability of management fees derived from the credit business. Core fee revenues were up 14% in\nFY19, driven by significantly higher activity fees, which are earned from transactional activities\nand tend to be somewhat volatile, and modest growth in management fees, driven by continued\nexpansion in AUM. Activity fees represented almost half of core fees in FY19. Fitch would view\nreduced reliance on activity fees favorably.\nCore operating performance, as measured by fee-related EBITDA (FEBITDA), which excludes\ninvestment income from co-investments, performance fees and performance-related compensation\nwas up 39.6% in FY19, YoY, largely driven by higher activity fees. The firm's FEBITDA margin\nexpanded to 45.1% in FY19, compared to 36.5% in the prior year. Margins could be adversely\naffected in a market downturn, given the relative contribution from activity fees, which are largely\nmarket-driven.\nAsset-based income, which reflects realized and unrealized gains and losses on co-investments,\nwas $89 million in FY19, down from $133 million in FY18. The decline primarily reflects lower\nreturns on PE investments, due to currency devaluation in the Turkish lira, valuation declines in\ncertain U.S. retail sector exposures and the write-down of legacy assets.\nRealized performance fees were up 40% in FY19 but tend to be lumpy from period to period due to\ndeal activity and market volatility.\nIn an effort to de-risk its balance sheet, Investcorp completed several secondary transactions in\n2019, which contributed to a 12.5% reduction in its co-investment portfolio at FYE19, YoY. In\naddition, the announced sale of its largest balance sheet holding, TelePacific Holdings Corp., post-\nFYE will reduce the co-investment portfolio by an additional 7.5%, notwithstanding continued\nworking capital support provided to the company. A portion of Investcorp's secondary transactions\nraised almost $1 billion of third party capital and contributed to AUM growth in committed capital\nstructures.\nInvestcorp's leverage, as measured by long-term debt to FEBITDA, amounted to 3.0x for the TTM\nended June 30, 2019, which represents a significant reduction from the prior year, at 6.7x, due\nto the repayment of debt, 100% equity treatment afforded to preference shares and FEBITDA\ngrowth. Leverage is in line with Fitch's 'bbb' category quantitative benchmark range of 2.5x to 4x\nfor alternative IMs.\nGiven its significant balance sheet usage, Fitch also assesses Investcorp's leverage on a debt to\ntangible equity basis. On this measure, Investcorp's leverage was 0.5x at June 30, 2019; down from\n0.8x a year earlier, which is relatively low and in-line with the peer group.\nFitch views Investcorp's funding profile favorably, with unsecured debt representing 82% of\ntotal debt. The firm also has $123 million of preference shares, which are are noncumulative and\nperpetual in nature and, thus receive 100% equity treatment in accordance with Fitch's 'Corporates\nHybrids and Notching Criteria' dated November 2018. Investcorp also holds client deposits,\nwhich are transitory balances and include both subscription amounts paid in by clients toward\nparticipation in specific investment products and investment realization proceeds held in the\ninterim period prior to distribution or withdrawal by clients. Fitch expects these deposits to remain\nin place despite the firm no longer being regulated as a bank.\nFitch believes Investcorp maintained adequate liquidity at June 30, 2019, with $57 million of cash\nand short-term funds, $333 million of deposits with financial institutions and other liquid assets,\nalong with $686 million of borrowing capacity on its corporate revolvers. Additionally, Investcorp\nhad $1.0 billion of balance sheet co-investments at FYE19, which could serve as additional\ncollateral for debt, although it is comprised of relatively illiquid investments. The firm has no near-\nterm debt maturities.\nUnfunded deal acquisitions and unfunded co-investment commitments to various PE and RE\ninvestments totaled $77 million at FYE19, which Fitch believes will be funded over time with cash\non hand and operating cash flow. Fitch believes the company has significant discretion over the\ntiming of these funding commitments.\nInterest coverage, as measured by FEBITDA divided by interest expense on corporate debt, was\n3.8x for FY19, which was within Fitch's quantitative benchmark range of 2x-4x for alternative IMs\nin the 'bb' rating category. Fitch recognizes that coverage ratios would look meaningfully better if\nasset-based income on co-investments were included in FEBITDA.\nIn September 2019, Investcorp completed the realignment of its operational structure in Bahrain\nalong with the conversion of the parent company from a wholesale bank to a holding company.\nInvestcorp Bank B.S.C. voluntarily surrendered its Bahrain-based wholesale bank license and was\nrenamed Investcorp Holdings B.S.C. With the approval of shareholders and the Central Bank of\nBahrain (CBB), the company incorporated a category 1 investment business firm in Bahrain called\nInvestcorp Financial Services B.S.C. (IFS), and after engaging with clients, strategic partners and\nother stakeholders, completed the process of transitioning its regulated marketing, placement and\nMENA PE investment advisory and asset management services to IFS.\nFitch views Investcorp's relinquishment of its banking license as neutral to its ratings. The\nincrementally negative impact from having less regulatory oversight is sufficiently offset by the\nexpectation that capital will be maintained at or near currently robust levels and that liquidity and\noperational risk management frameworks will remain unchanged.\nGiven the relinquishment of its banking license, Fitch has withdrawn Investcorp's 'bb' Viability\nRating, the Support Rating of '5' and the Support Rating Floor of 'No Floor'.\nThe affirmation of Investcorp's 'B' Short-Term IDR maintains the mapping relationship between\nLong-Term and Short-Term IDRs as outlined in Fitch's Short-Term Rating Criteria.\nThe senior unsecured debt rating is equalized with Investcorp's Long-Term IDR, reflecting the\nexpectation for average recovery prospects for the debt class under a stress scenario.\nRATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs AND SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT\nFitch believes rating upside is likely limited to the 'BB' rating category over the intermediate\nterm due to the potential earnings volatility associated with the company's business model and\nbalance sheet co-investment exposure. The company's DBD business model could be a profitability\nconstraint in a period of investment origination and/or placement activity weakness, while elevated\nco-investment exposure introduces balance sheet risk in the event of investment losses. Post-\norigination placement may also introduce balance sheet risk in the event Investcorp is unable to\nplace originated investments with clients.\nFactors that could lead to an upgrade of Investcorp's ratings include fee-paying AUM growth,\nenhanced scalability of the platform and AUM diversity, an increase in management fee\ncontribution from committed capital fund structures and strengthened interest coverage, while\nmaintaining adequate capitalization, co-investment funding and liquidity positions without\nmeaningful growth in balance sheet co-investments.\nNegative rating actions could be driven by material declines in AUM, which impairs the firm's\nmanagement fee generating capacity; a material increase in balance sheet co-investments not\nfunded by equity, higher leverage or a reduction in liquidity.\nThe senior unsecured debt rating is equalized with Investcorp's IDRs and therefore, would be\nexpected to move in tandem. Although not envisioned by Fitch, were Investcorp to experience an\nincrease in secured debt as a percentage of total debt, this could result in the unsecured debt rating\nbeing notched below Investcorp's Long-Term IDR.\nESG CONSIDERATIONS\nUnless otherwise disclosed in this section, the highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of\n3 - ESG issues are credit neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to\ntheir nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.\nFor more information on Fitch's ESG Relevance Scores, visit www.fitchratings.com/esg.\nFitch has affirmed the following ratings:\nInvestcorp Holdings B.S.C.\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BB';\n--Short-Term IDR at 'B'.\nInvestcorp S.A.\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BB';\n--Short-Term IDR at 'B'.\nInvestcorp Capital Ltd.\n--Long-Term IDR at 'BB';\n--Short-Term IDR at 'B';\n--Senior unsecured debt at 'BB'.\nFitch has withdrawn the following ratings:\nInvestcorp Bank B.S.C.\n--Viability Rating at 'bb';\n--Support Rating at '5';\n--Support Rating Floor at 'NF'.\nThe Rating Outlook was revised to Positive from Stable.\nContact:\nPrimary Analyst\nDafina M.
