CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n1. The Company\nBackground\nXenetic Biosciences, Inc. (“Xenetic” or the “Company”), incorporated in the state of Nevada and based in Framingham, Massachusetts, is a biopharmaceutical company\nfocused on advancing innovative immune-oncology technologies addressing hard to treat cancers. The Company’s proprietary Deoxyribonuclease (“DNase”) platform is\ndesigned to improve outcomes of existing treatments, including immunotherapies, by targeting neutrophil extracellular traps (“NETs”), which have been implicated in cancer\nprogression and resistance to cancer treatments. Xenetic is currently focused on advancing its systemic DNase program into the clinic as an adjunctive therapy for pancreatic\ncarcinoma and locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Additionally, Xenetic has partnered with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to develop its proprietary\ndrug delivery platform, PolyXen®, and receives royalty payments under an exclusive license arrangement in the field of blood coagulation disorders.\nAs used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Quarterly Report”), unless otherwise indicated, all references herein to “Xenetic,” the “Company,” “we” or “us” refer to\nXenetic Biosciences, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe Company, directly or indirectly, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Hesperix S.A. (“Hesperix”) and Xenetic Biosciences (U.K.) Limited (“Xenetic UK”), and the\nwholly-owned subsidiaries of Xenetic UK, Lipoxen Technologies Limited (“Lipoxen”), Xenetic Bioscience, Incorporated and SymbioTec, GmbH (“SymbioTec”), own various\nUnited States (“U.S.”) federal trademark registrations and applications along with unregistered trademarks and service marks, including but not limited to XCART™,\nOncoHist™, PolyXen, ErepoXen™, and ImuXen™, which may be used throughout this Quarterly Report. All other company and product names may be trademarks of the\nrespective companies with which they are associated.\nGoing Concern and Management’s Plan\nManagement evaluates whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company has incurred substantial losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur\noperating losses in the near-term. The Company believes that its existing resources will be adequate to fund the Company’s operations for a period of at least twelve months\nfrom the date of the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. However, the Company anticipates it will need additional capital in the long-term to pursue\nits business initiatives. While the Company believes it has access to capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate\ncollaborations, related party funding, or other means to continue as a going concern, the terms, timing and extent of any future financing will depend upon several factors,\nincluding the achievement of progress in its product development programs, its ability to identify and enter into licensing or other strategic arrangements, its continued listing\non the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”), and factors related to financial, economic, geo-political, industry and market conditions, many of which are beyond its control. The\ncapital markets for the biotech industry can be highly volatile, which make the terms, timing and extent of any future financing uncertain.\n2. Risks and Uncertainties\nImpact of Global Conflicts on Operations\nThe short and long-term implications of the conflicts in the Ukraine and Middle East are difficult to predict at this time. The imposition of current and future sanctions and\ncounter sanctions may have an adverse effect on the economic markets generally and could impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n8\n3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPreparation of Interim Financial Statements\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements were prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) and, in the opinion of management, include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of the interim periods shown.\nCertain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been\ncondensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations. Management believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not\nmisleading. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein\nshould be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, and amended on April 26, 2024.\nOn May 15, 2023, the Company effected a reduction, on a 1-for-10 basis, in its authorized common stock, par value $0.001, along with a corresponding and proportional\ndecrease in the number of shares issued and outstanding (the “Reverse Stock Split”). On the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, (i) every 10 shares of common stock were\nreduced to one share of common stock, with any fractional amounts rounded up to one share; (ii) the number of shares of common stock into which each outstanding warrant,\nrestricted stock unit (“RSU”), or option to purchase common stock was convertible into was proportionately reduced on the same basis as the common stock; (iii) the exercise\nprice of each outstanding warrant or option to purchase common stock was proportionately increased on a 1-to-10 basis; and (iv) the number of shares of common stock into\nwhich each share of preferred stock was convertible into was proportionately reduced on the same basis as the common stock. Unless otherwise indicated, all of the share\nnumbers, share prices, and exercise prices have been adjusted in this Quarterly Report, on a retroactive basis, to reflect this 1-for-10 Reverse Stock Split.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of Hesperix, Xenetic UK and Xenetic UK’s wholly owned subsidiaries: Lipoxen,\nXenetic Bioscience, Incorporated, and SymbioTec. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries require guarantees of support from Xenetic. While all intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation, the Company has $0.2 million of cash collateralizing these guarantees.\nBasic and Diluted Net Loss per Share\nThe Company computes basic net loss per share by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of the Company’s common\nstock outstanding during the period. The Company computes diluted net loss per share after giving consideration to the dilutive effect of stock options that are outstanding\nduring the period, except where such non-participating securities would be anti-dilutive.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, basic and diluted net loss per share are the same in each respective three and nine month period due to the\nCompany’s net loss position. Potentially dilutive, non-participating securities have not been included in the calculations of diluted net loss per share, as their inclusion would be\nanti-dilutive.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSegment Reporting - Improving Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting\nStandards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant expenses. Under this\nASU, a company is required to enhance its segment disclosures to include significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker\n(CODM), a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to\nallocate resources. This ASU also requires all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 to be included in interim periods. This ASU is effective for the Company's\nfiscal year ending December 31, 2024, and interim periods beginning in fiscal 2025, with early adoption permitted, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods\npresented in the financial statements. The Company has one reportable segment and is currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of this ASU will have on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\n9\nIncome Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, to improve income tax disclosure requirements,\nprimarily through enhanced disclosures related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This ASU is effective for fiscal 2025, with early adoption permitted,\nand may be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n4. Significant Strategic Collaborations\nTakeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, “Takeda”)\nIn October 2017, the Company granted to Takeda the right to grant a non-exclusive sublicense to certain patents related to the Company’s PolyXen technology that were\npreviously exclusively licensed to Takeda in connection with products related to the treatment of blood and bleeding disorders. Royalty payments of approximately $0.6 million\nand $1.9 million were recorded as revenue by the Company during both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These payments are based\non single digit royalties on net sales of certain covered products. The Company’s policy is to recognize royalty payments as revenue when they are reliably measurable, which\nis upon receipt of reports from Takeda. The Company receives these reports in the quarter subsequent to the actual sublicensee sales. At the time the revenue was received, there\nwere no remaining performance obligations and all other revenue recognition criteria were met.\nBelgian Volition SARL Limited (“Volition”) Collaboration\nOn August 2, 2022, the Company announced a research and development collaboration with Volition to develop NETs-targeted adoptive cell therapies for the treatment of\ncancer. The collaboration is an early exploratory program to evaluate the potential combination of Volition’s Nu.Q® Technology Test and the Company’s DNase-Armored CAR\nT platform to develop proprietary adoptive cell therapies potentially targeting multiple types of solid cancers. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Volition will fund\na research program and the two parties will share proceeds from commercialization or licensing of any products arising from the collaboration. To date, Volition has funded\n$26,000 under this agreement.\nCatalent Pharma Solutions LLC (“Catalent”)\nOn June 30, 2022, the Company entered into a Statement of Work (the “SOW”) with Catalent to outline the general scope of work, timeline, and pricing pursuant to which\nCatalent will provide certain services to the Company to perform cGMP manufacturing of the Company’s recombinant protein, Human DNase I. The parties agreed to enter into\na Master Services Agreement that will contain terms and conditions to govern the project contemplated by the SOW and that will supersede the addendum to the SOW\ncontaining Catalent's standard terms and conditions. The Company has paid Catalent approximately $2.5 million through September 30, 2024, of which approximately $28,000\nand $0.1 million has been recognized as an advance payment and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, and approximately $0.1 million has been recognized as a liability and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of September 30, 2024. There\nwas no accrual as of December 31, 2023. In addition, approximately $0.3 million has been recognized within other assets as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023.\nScripps Research Institute (“Scripps Research”)\nOn March 17, 2023, the Company and Scripps Research entered into a Research Funding and Option Agreement (the “Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company has agreed\nto provide Scripps Research an aggregate of up to $0.9 million to fund research relating to advancing the pre-clinical development of the Company’s DNase oncology platform\ntechnology. Under the Agreement, the Company has the option to acquire a worldwide exclusive license to Scripps Research’s rights in the Technology or Patent Rights (as\ndefined in the Agreement), as well as a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferrable license to make and use TSRI Technology (as defined in the Agreement) solely for the\nCompany’s internal research purposes during the performance of the research program contemplated by the Agreement. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company\namended the Agreement to extend the term to October 31, 2024 with no additional funding required. The Company paid Scripps Research approximately $0.9 million under the\nAgreement through September 30, 2024, of which approximately $20,000 and $0.4 million has been recognized as an advance payment and is included in prepaid expenses and\nother current assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n10\nUniversity of Virginia (“UVA”)\nOn December 21, 2023, the Company entered into a Research Funding and Material Transfer Agreement with UVA (the “UVA Agreement”) to advance the development of our\nsystemic DNase program. Under the terms of the UVA Agreement, in addition to advancing our existing intellectual property, we have an option to acquire an exclusive license\nto any new intellectual property arising from the DNase research program. Allan Tsung, MD, a member of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board and Chair of the\nDepartment of Surgery at the UVA School of Medicine, will oversee the research conducted under the UVA Agreement. The Company paid UVA approximately $0.2 million\nunder the UVA Agreement through September 30, 2024, which was expensed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no amounts incurred as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nOther Agreements\nThe Company has also entered into various research, development, license and supply agreements with Serum Institute of India (“Serum Institute”), PJSC Pharmsynthez\n(“Pharmsynthez”) and SynBio LLC (“SynBio”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pharmsynthez. The Company and its collaborative partners continue to engage in research and\ndevelopment activities with no resultant commercial products through September 30, 2024. No amounts were recognized as revenue related to the Serum Institute,\nPharmsynthez or SynBio agreements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n5. Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nOn June 19, 2024, the Company entered into a confidential separation agreement and general release with each of Jeffrey F. Eisenberg, the Company’s former Chief Executive\nOfficer (the “Eisenberg Separation Agreement”), and Curtis Lockshin, the Company’s former Chief Scientific Officer (together, the “Separation Agreements”) pursuant to\nwhich Messrs. Eisenberg and Lockshin were each eligible for certain severance payments and benefits consistent with the terms of their existing employment agreements as\ndescribed under “Employment Agreements with our Named Executive Officers” in the Amendment No. 1 to Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed by the Company with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission on April 26, 2024. In addition, the Eisenberg Separation Agreement provided for accelerated vesting of all of the unvested stock options\nheld by Mr. Eisenberg as of May 16, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company expensed approximately $0.8 million of accrued payroll and\nbenefits related to the Separation Agreements. In addition, the Company recorded approximately $13,000 of share-based expense for the accelerated vesting of unvested stock\noptions. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $0.3 million was accrued within accrued expenses and other current liabilities related to these obligations.\n6. Fair Value Measurements\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in\nan orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to\nmeasure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value\nmeasurement. Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement\ndate. Level 2 utilizes quoted market prices in markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. As of September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments approximates fair value due to their short maturities. There were no financial\ninstruments classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n7. Stockholders’ Equity\nCommon Stock\nEach share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company’s stockholders. Common stockholders are entitled\nto dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, the holders of\ncommon stock are entitled to share ratably in the assets of the Company available for distribution.\n11\nOn May 11, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Change to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada to effect the Reverse Stock Split.\nThe Reverse Stock Split was effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on May 15, 2023.

The Pharmsynthez Loan had an initial term of 15-months and accrued interest at a rate of 10% per annum. The Pharmsynthez Loan was guaranteed by all of the\noperating subsidiaries of Pharmsynthez, including SynBio and AS Kevelt, and was secured by all of the common and preferred stock of the Company owned by Pharmsynthez\nand SynBio.\nPharmsynthez paid all obligations due under the Pharmsynthez Loan in May 2023, and no further amounts are due under the Pharmsynthez Loan. As a result, no amounts were\noutstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company did not recognize any interest income related to the Pharmsynthez Loan during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. The Company recognized approximately $65,000 of income related to interest and fees associated with the Pharmsynthez Loan including\napproximately $40,000 related to interest income during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n11. Subsequent Events\nThe Company performed a review of events subsequent to the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were issued and determined that there were no such\nevents requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements except as described below.\nScripps Research\nOn November 1, 2024, the Company and Scripps entered into a Second Amendment to Research Funding and Option Agreement (the “Amendment”), pursuant to which the\nCompany amended that certain Research Funding and Option Agreement, dated March 17, 2023, by and between the Company and Scripps (the “Original Agreement”), in\norder to extend the term of the Original Agreement for an additional twelve (12) month period and to provide Scripps Research additional funding in an aggregate amount of up\nto approximately $400,000 to fund continuing research relating to advancing the pre-clinical development of the Company’s DNase oncology platform technology.

Our DNase platform is designed to\nimprove outcomes of existing treatments, including immunotherapies, by targeting NETs, which have been implicated in cancer progression and resistance to cancer treatments.\nWe are currently focused on advancing our systemic DNase program into the clinic as an adjunctive therapy for pancreatic carcinoma and locally advanced or metastatic solid\ntumors. Additionally, we have partnered with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to develop our proprietary drug delivery platform, PolyXen, and receive royalty\npayments under an exclusive license arrangement in the field of blood coagulation disorders.\nWe incorporate our patented and proprietary technologies into drug candidates currently under development with biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry collaborators to\ncreate what we believe will be the next-generation biologic drugs with improved pharmacological properties over existing therapeutics. Our drug candidates have resulted from\nour research activities or that of our collaborators and are in the development stage. As a result, we have committed a significant amount of our resources to our research and\ndevelopment activities and anticipate continuing to do so for the near future. To date, none of our drug candidates have received regulatory marketing authorization or approval\nin the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration nor in any other countries or territories by any applicable agencies. We are receiving ongoing royalties pursuant to a license of\nour PolyXen technology to an industry partner. Although we hold a broad patent portfolio, the focus of our internal efforts during the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2024, was on the advancement of our DNase technology.\n15\nImpact of the Global Conflicts on Our Operations\nThe short and long-term implications of conflicts in the Ukraine and the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time. The imposition of current and future sanctions and\ncounter sanctions may have an adverse effect on the economic markets generally and could impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 to the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023 is as follows:\nQuarter Ended Quarter Ended Increase Percentage\nDescription September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 (Decrease) Change\nRevenues:\nRoyalty revenue $ 614,243 $ 611,174 $ 3,069 0.5\nOperating costs and expenses:\nResearch and development (367,985) (1,020,618) (652,633) (63.9)\nGeneral and administrative (745,731) (737,241) 8,490 1.2\nTotal operating costs and expenses (1,113,716) (1,757,859) (644,143) (36.6)\nLoss from operations (499,473) (1,146,685) (647,212) (56.4)\nTotal other income, net:\nOther income (expense) 1,504 (666) 2,170 325.8\nInterest income, net 61,298 91,796 (30,498) (33.2)\nNet loss $ (436,671) $ (1,055,555) $ (618,884) (58.6)\nRevenue\nRevenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively flat with that of the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch & development (“R&D”) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately $0.7 million, or 63.9%, to approximately $0.4 million\nfrom approximately $1.0 million in the comparable quarter in 2023. The table below sets forth the R&D costs incurred by the Company by category of expense for the quarters\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nQuarter Ended,\nCategory of Expense September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nOutside services and contract research organizations $ 360,549 $ 877,647\nPersonnel costs – 88,557\nShare-based expense – 13,961\nOther 7,436 40,453\nTotal research and development expense $ 367,985 $ 1,020,618\nThe decrease in outside services and contract research organizations expense was primarily due to decreased spending in connection with our process development efforts\nrelated to our DNase platform. The decrease in personnel costs during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ending September 30, 2023\nis due to the departure of our former Chief Scientific Officer during the second quarter of 2024.\n16\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively flat with that of the three months ended September 30, 2023. Increases in\nlegal fees during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 were offset by decreases is personnel costs during the third quarter of 2024\ndue to the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer in the second quarter of 2024.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income was approximately $1,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately $700 of other expense for the comparable quarter in 2023.\nThis increase in other income was primarily related to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to\nthe same period in 2023.\nInterest Income\nInterest income, net decreased to approximately $61,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately $92,000 for the same period in the prior year.\nThis decrease was primarily due to lower average invested funds during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nComparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nThe comparison of our historical results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is as follows:\nNine Months Nine Months\nEnded Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, Increase Percentage\nDescription 2024 2023 (Decrease) Change\nRevenues:\nRoyalty revenue $ 1,851,464 $ 1,868,023 $ (16,559) (0.9)\nOperating costs and expenses:\nResearch and development (2,246,077) (2,519,137) (273,060) (10.8)\nGeneral and administrative (2,710,670) (2,608,934) 101,736 3.9\nTotal operating costs and expenses (4,956,747) (5,128,071) (171,324) (3.3)\nLoss from operations (3,105,283) (3,260,048) (154,765) (4.7)\nTotal other income, net:\nOther income 1,535 24,976 (23,441) (93.9)\nInterest income, net 197,994 272,000 (74,006) (27.2)\nNet loss $ (2,905,754) $ (2,963,072) $ (57,318) (1.9)\nRevenue\nRevenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively flat with that of the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n17\nResearch and Development Expenses\nR&D expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately $0.3 million, or 10.8%, to approximately $2.2 million from approximately $2.5\nmillion in the comparable period in 2023. The table below sets forth the R&D costs incurred by the Company by category of expense for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023:\nNine Months Ended,\nCategory of Expense September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nOutside services and contract research organizations $ 1,581,070 $ 2,034,601\nPersonnel costs 561,612 340,307\nShare-based expense 11,433 41,427\nOther 91,962 102,802\nTotal research and development expense $ 2,246,077 $ 2,519,137\nThe decrease in outside services and contract research organizations expense was primarily due to decreased spending in connection with our process development efforts,\npartially offset by increased pre-clinical development efforts related to our DNase platform. The increase in personnel costs is due to certain severance and benefits expensed in\nconnection with a separation agreement entered into during the second quarter of 2024 with our former Chief Scientific Officer.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately $0.1 million, or 3.9%, to approximately $2.7 million from\napproximately $2.6 million in the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to certain severance and benefits expensed in connection with a separation\nagreement entered into during the second quarter of 2024 with our former Chief Executive Officer. This increase was partially offset by general decreases in accounting fees\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nOther Income\nOther income was approximately $1,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately $25,000 of other income for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. This decrease in other income was primarily related to fees associated with the Pharmsynthez Loan recognized during the nine months ended September\n30, 2023 for which there was no similar fees received in the same period in 2024.\nInterest Income\nInterest income decreased to approximately $198,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to approximately $272,000 for the same period in the\nprior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower average invested funds during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, as well as\na decrease in interest income received on the Pharmsynthez Loan.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe incurred a net loss of approximately $2.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately $196.1 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024, as compared to an accumulated deficit of approximately $193.2 million at December 31, 2023. Working capital was approximately $6.0 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024, and approximately $8.8 million at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our working capital decreased by\napproximately $2.8 million primarily due to our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nOur principal source of liquidity consists of cash. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately $6.8 million in cash and approximately $1.0 million in current liabilities. At\nDecember 31, 2023, we had approximately $9.0 million in cash and approximately $0.8 million in current liabilities. We have historically relied upon sales of our equity\nsecurities to fund our operations.\n18\nWe evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year\nafter the date that the financial statements are issued. We have incurred substantial losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses in the near-\nterm. The Company believes that its existing resources will be adequate to fund the Company’s operations for a period of at least twelve months from the date of the issuance of\nthese financial statements. However, we anticipate we will need additional capital in the long-term to pursue our business initiatives. While the Company believes it has access\nto capital resources through possible public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations, related party funding, or other means to continue as a going\nconcern, the terms, timing and extent of any future financing will depend upon several factors, including the achievement of progress in our clinical development programs, our\nability to identify and enter into licensing or other strategic arrangements, our continued listing on Nasdaq, and factors related to financial, economic, geo-political, industry and\nmarket conditions, many of which are beyond our control. The capital markets for the biotech industry can be highly volatile, which make the terms, timing and extent of any\nfuture financing uncertain.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately $2.1 million, which was primarily due to our net loss for the\nperiod, partially offset by non-cash charges associated with share-based expense. In addition, prepaid expenses and other decreased approximately $0.4 million and current\nliabilities increased approximately $0.2 million during the period. Cash flows used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled approximately\n$3.3 million, which was primarily due to our net loss for the period as well as advance payments made in accordance with our statement of work with Catalent, partially offset\nby cash received from the repayment of the Pharmsynthez Loan.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThere were no cash flows from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nThere were no cash flows from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, as amended on April 26, 2024.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, change in\nfinancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee Note 3 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, as amended on April 26, 2024, for a discussion\nof recent accounting standards.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses. We base our\nestimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an\nongoing basis.
