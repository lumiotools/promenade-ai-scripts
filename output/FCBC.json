Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results and Quarterly Cash Dividend\n\nCompany Release - 10/22/2024 04:00 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nBLUEFIELD, Va., Oct. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Community Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCBC) ([www.firstcommunitybank.com](http://www.firstcommunitybank.com)) (the “Company”) today reported its unaudited results of operations and other financial information for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The Company reported net income of $13.03 million, or $0.71 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $38.56 million or $2.09 per diluted common share. \n\nThe Company also declared a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of thirty-one cents, $0.31 per common share. The quarterly dividend is payable to common shareholders of record on November 8, 2024, and is expected to be paid on or about November 22, 2024. This marks the 39th consecutive year of regular dividends to common shareholders.\n\nThe Company is working with borrowers and customers in North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and southern West Virginia affected by the devastating floods, power outages, and water shortages from Hurricane Helene. This includes payment relief for affected borrowers. We will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks as it relates to asset quality.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n  * Net income of $13.03 million for the third quarter of 2024, was a decrease of $1.61 million, or 10.98%, from the same quarter of 2023. Net income of $38.56 million for the first nine months of 2024, was an increase of $2.33 million, or 6.42%, from the same period of 2023. \n  * Net interest income decreased $1.75 million compared to the same quarter in 2023, primarily due to increases in rates paid on interest-bearing deposits. \n  * Net interest margin of 4.41% was a decrease of 10 basis points over the same quarter of 2023. The yield on earning assets increased 26 basis points from the same period of 2023 and is attributable to an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in yield. While there was an increase in yield for both loans and securities available for sale; the average balances decreased. The average balance for interest-bearing deposits with banks increased $219.59 million over the same period of 2023; however, there was no change in the yield from the same period of 2023. The yield on interest-bearing liabilities increased 58 basis points when compared with the same period of 2023 and is primarily attributable to increased rates on interest-bearing deposit liabilities. \n  * Noninterest income increased approximately $830 thousand, or 8.63%, when compared to the same quarter of 2023. Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2024 included a gain of $825 thousand from the sale of two closed branch properties; noninterest income for the same period of 2023 included a gain of $204 thousand for the sale of a closed branch property. Noninterest expense increased $1.26 million, or 5.52%. \n  * Annualized return on average assets (\"ROA\") was 1.60% for the third quarter and 1.60% for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 1.74% and 1.49% for the same periods, respectively, of 2023. Annualized return on average common equity (\"ROE\") was 10.04% for the third quarter and 10.08% for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 11.63% and 10.25% for the same periods, respectively, of 2023. Annualized return on average tangible common equity (\"ROTCE\") was 14.46% for the third quarter and 14.61% for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 17.11% and 14.94% for the same periods, respectively, of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet and Asset Quality**\n\n  * Consolidated assets totaled $3.22 billion at September 30, 2024. \n  * Loans decreased $128.19 million, or 4.98%, from December 31, 2023. Securities available for sale decreased $114.29 million, or 40.68%, from December 31, 2023. Deposits decreased $63.07 million, or 2.32%. The net effect of these balance sheet changes resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $198.92 million, or 170.86%. \n  * The Company repurchased 12,854 common shares during the third quarter of 2024 at a total cost of $469 thousand. The Company repurchased 257,294 common shares during the first nine months of 2024 at a total cost of $8.72 million. \n  * Non-performing loans to total loans increased to 0.82% when compared with the same quarter of 2023. The Company experienced net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2024 of $1.13 million, or 0.18% of annualized average loans, compared to net charge-offs of $1.46 million, or 0.22%, of annualized average loans for the same period in 2023.\n  * The allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.44% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.41% at December 31, 2023, and 1.39% for September 30, 2023.\n  * Book value per share at September 30, 2024, was $ 28.47, an increase of $1.27 from year-end 2023.\n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that provide useful information for financial and operational decision making, evaluating trends, and comparing financial results to other financial institutions. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this news release include “tangible book value per common share,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “adjusted earnings,” “adjusted diluted earnings per share,” “adjusted return on average assets,” “adjusted return on average common equity,” “adjusted return on average tangible common equity,” and certain financial measures presented on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis. FTE basis is calculated using the federal statutory income tax rate of 21%. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as a reconciliation to that comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the attached tables to this press release. While the Company believes certain non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of its business and performance, they are supplemental and not a substitute for, or more important than, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to those reported by other financial institutions.\n\n**About First Community Bankshares, Inc.**\n\nFirst Community Bankshares, Inc., a financial holding company headquartered in Bluefield, Virginia, provides banking products and services through its wholly owned subsidiary First Community Bank.

Announces Second Quarter 2024 Results and Quarterly Cash Dividend\n\nCompany Release - 7/23/2024 04:00 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nBLUEFIELD, Va., July 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Community Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCBC) ([www.firstcommunitybank.com](http://www.firstcommunitybank.com)) (the “Company”) today reported its unaudited results of operations and other financial information for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The Company reported net income of $12.69 million, or $0.71 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was $25.53 million or $1.42 per diluted common share.\n\nThe Company also declared a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of thirty-one cents, $0.31 per common share. The quarterly dividend is payable to common shareholders of record on August 9, 2024, and is expected to be paid on or about August 23, 2024. This marks the 39th consecutive year of regular dividends to common shareholders.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n  * Net income of $12.69 million for the second quarter of 2024, was an increase of $2.87 million, or 29.26%, from the same quarter of 2023. Net income of $25.53 million for the first six months of 2024, was an increase of $3.94 million, or 18.22%, from the same period of 2023.\n  * The provision for credit losses decreased $3.96 million, or 96.49%, from the same quarter of 2023. The second quarter of 2023 included $1.61 million of Day 2 provision associated with the Surrey Bancorp acquisition. The majority of the difference is due to a much smaller required credit loss provision as the loan portfolio has experienced a decline of $147.81 million from the same period of 2023. In addition, there was a recovery of provision for the allowance for unfunded commitments of $305 thousand for the current quarter; there was no provision for the same period of 2023.\n  * Net interest income decreased $950 thousand compared to the same quarter in 2023, primarily due to increases in rates paid on interest-bearing deposits.\n  * Net interest margin of 4.51% was an increase of 3 basis points over the same quarter of 2023. The yield on earning assets increased 45 basis points from the same period of 2023 and is attributable to an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in yield and an increase in average balance. There was an increase in yield for both loans and securities available for sale. The average balance for interest-bearing deposits with banks increased $147.11 million over the same period of 2023. The yield on interest-bearing liabilities increased 67 basis points when compared with the same period of 2023 and is primarily attributable to increased rates on interest-bearing deposit liabilities.\n  * Noninterest income increased approximately $557 thousand, or 6.34%, when compared to the same quarter of 2023. Noninterest expense increased $226 thousand, or 0.92%. Noninterest expense for the quarter ending June 30, 2024, included a non-recurring charge of $1.80 million to settle a putative class action lawsuit. Noninterest expense for the same period of 2023 included non-recurring expense of $2.01 million in merger charges related to the Surrey Bancorp acquisition.\n  * Annualized return on average assets (\"ROA\") was 1.58% for the second quarter and 1.59% for the first six months of 2024 compared to 1.18% and 1.36% for the same periods, respectively, of 2023. Annualized return on average common equity (\"ROE\") was 10.02% for the second quarter and 10.10% for the first six months of 2024 compared to 8.04% and 9.48% for the same periods, respectively, of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet and Asset Quality**\n\n  * Consolidated assets totaled $3.23 billion at June 30, 2024.\n  * Securities available for sale decreased $151.28 million, or 53.84%, from December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to the maturity of $141.50 million in U.S. Treasury Notes during the first six months of 2024. Loans decreased $99.03 million, or 3.85%. Deposits decreased $45.05 million, or 1.65%. The net effect of these balance sheet changes resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $213.46 million, or 183.35%.\n  * The Company repurchased 155,044 common shares during the second quarter of 2024 at a total cost of $5.28 million. The Company repurchased 244,440 common shares during the first six months of 2024 at a total cost of $8.25 million.\n  * Non-performing loans to total loans increased to 0.80% when compared with the same quarter of 2023. The Company experienced net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2024 of $1.03 million, or 0.16% of annualized average loans, compared to net charge-offs of $728 thousand, or 0.11%, of annualized average loans for the same period in 2023.\n  * The allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.41% at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.41% at December 31, 2023, and 1.38% for June 30, 2023.\n  * Book value per share at June 30, 2024, was $ 27.85, an increase of $0.65 from year-end 2023.\n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that provide useful information for financial and operational decision making, evaluating trends, and comparing financial results to other financial institutions. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this news release include “tangible book value per common share,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “adjusted earnings,” “adjusted diluted earnings per share,” “adjusted return on average assets,” “adjusted return on average common equity,” “adjusted return on average tangible common equity,” and certain financial measures presented on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis. FTE basis is calculated using the federal statutory income tax rate of 21%. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as a reconciliation to that comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the attached tables to this press release. While the Company believes certain non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of its business and performance, they are supplemental and not a substitute for, or more important than, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to those reported by other financial institutions.\n\n**About First Community Bankshares, Inc.**\n\nFirst Community Bankshares, Inc., a financial holding company headquartered in Bluefield, Virginia, provides banking products and services through its wholly owned subsidiary First Community Bank.

Announces First Quarter 2024 Results and Quarterly Cash Dividend\n\nCompany Release - 4/23/2024 04:00 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nBLUEFIELD, Va., April 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Community Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCBC) ([www.firstcommunitybank.com](http://www.firstcommunitybank.com)) (the “Company”) today reported its unaudited results of operations and other financial information for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The Company reported net income of $12.85 million, or $0.71 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. \n\nThe Company also declared a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of twenty-nine cents $0.29 per common share. The quarterly dividend is payable to common shareholders of record on May 10, 2024, and is expected to be paid on or about May 24, 2024. This marks the 39th consecutive year of regular dividends to common shareholders.\n\n**First Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n  * Net income of $12.85 million for the first quarter of 2024, was an increase of $1.06 million, or 9.02%, from the same quarter of 2023. \n  * Net interest income increased $2.22 million compared to the same quarter in 2023, as increases in benchmark interest rates have improved net interest margin. Provision for credit losses was approximately $731 thousand lower than the same quarter last year. \n  * Net interest margin of 4.47% is an increase of 12 basis points over the same quarter of 2023. The yield on earning assets increased 62 basis points primarily driven by increased earnings on loans. \n  * Interest and fees on loans increased $5.79 million from the same quarter of 2023 and is attributable to both an increase in yield and an increase in average balance compared to the yield and average balance of the prior year. The Company acquired Surrey Bancorp on April 21, 2023, adding approximately $239.08 million in loans. \n  * Noninterest income increased approximately $676 thousand, or 7.88%, when compared to the same quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by increased interchange income. Noninterest expense increased $2.57 million, or 12.36%. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily driven by salaries and employee benefits, service fees, and other operating expense. The increase in non interest expense is primarily attributable to the addition of Surrey branches and staff. \n  * Annualized return on average assets (\"ROA\") was 1.60% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 1.55% for the same period of 2023. Annualized return on average common equity (\"ROE\") was 10.18% for the first quarter of 2024 compared to 11.15% for the same period of 2023. \n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet and Asset Quality**\n\n  * Consolidated assets totaled $3.24 billion at March 31, 2024. \n  * Securities available for sale decreased $114.71 million, or 40.83%, from December 31,2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to the maturity of $115.75 million in U.S. Treasury Notes during the first quarter of 2024. Loans decreased $52.47 million, or 2.04%. Deposits decreased $40.11 million, or 1.47%. The net effect of these balance sheet changes resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $132.49 million, or 113.80%. The increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to an increase in federal funds sold of $142.63 million. \n  * The Company repurchased 89,396 common shares during the first quarter of 2024 for a total cost of $2.97 million. \n  * Non-performing loans to total loans increased to 0.78% when compared with the same quarter of 2023. The Company experienced net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2024 of $1.74 million, or 0.27%, of annualized average loans, compared to net charge-offs of $1.74 million, or 0.29%, of annualized average loans for the same period in 2023. \n  * The allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.41% at March 31, 2024, compared to 1.41% at December 31, 2023, and 1.29% for March 31, 2023.\n  * Book value per share at March 31, 2024, was $27.53, an increase of $0.33 from year-end 2023.\n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that provide useful information for financial and operational decision making, evaluating trends, and comparing financial results to other financial institutions. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this news release include “tangible book value per common share,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “adjusted earnings,” “adjusted diluted earnings per share,” “adjusted return on average assets,” “adjusted return on average common equity,” “adjusted return on average tangible common equity,” and certain financial measures presented on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis. FTE basis is calculated using the federal statutory income tax rate of 21%. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as a reconciliation to that comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the attached tables to this press release. While the Company believes certain non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of its business and performance, they are supplemental and not a substitute for, or more important than, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to those reported by other financial institutions.\n\n**About First Community Bankshares, Inc.**\n\nFirst Community Bankshares, Inc., a financial holding company headquartered in Bluefield, Virginia, provides banking products and services through its wholly owned subsidiary First Community Bank.

Announces Fourth Quarter 2023 Results and Quarterly Cash Dividend\n\nCompany Release - 1/23/2024 04:30 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nBLUEFIELD, Va., Jan. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Community Bankshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCBC) ([www.firstcommunitybank.com](http://www.firstcommunitybank.com)) (the “Company”) today reported its unaudited results of operations and other financial information for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The Company reported net income of $11.78 million, or $0.66 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, was $48.02 million or $2.72 per diluted common share.\n\nThe Company also declared a quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders of twenty-nine cents $0.29 per common share. The quarterly dividend is payable to common shareholders of record on February 9, 2024, and is expected to be paid on or about February 23, 2024. This marks the 39th consecutive year of regular dividends to common shareholders.\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2023 and Full Year Highlights**\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n  * Net income of $11.78 million for the fourth quarter and $48.02 million for the year were negatively impacted by a $3.00 million accrual for estimated litigation expenses.\n  * Adjusted for non-recurring items, fourth quarter net income increased $1.84 million to $14.59 million compared to fourth quarter 2022 on improved net interest margin and lower provision for credit losses. Also adjusted for non-recurring items, current year net income of $54.74 million was $9.12 million, or 19.99%, greater than last year.\n  * Net interest income increased $1.44 million compared to the same quarter in 2022, as increases in benchmark interest rates have improved net interest margin. Provision for credit losses was approximately $2.39 million lower than the same quarter last year.\n  * Interest and fees on loans increased $5.80 million from the same quarter of 2022 and is attributable to both an increase in yield and an increase in average balance compared to the yield and average balance of the prior year. The Company acquired Surrey Bancorp on April 21, 2023, adding approximately $239.08 million in loans. Interest income on deposits in banks decreased $777 thousand to $438 thousand for the fourth quarter, primarily due to a significant decrease in the average balance compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.\n  * Annualized return on average assets (“ROA”) was 1.43% for the fourth quarter and 1.48% for the twelve months of 2023 compared to 1.59% and 1.45% for the same periods, respectively of 2022. Annualized return on average common equity (“ROE”) was 9.39% for the fourth quarter and 10.02% for the twelve months of 2023 compared to 11.99% and 11.04%, for the same periods, respectively of 2022. Adjusted for non-recurring items, ROA was 1.77% and ROE was 11.63% for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet and Asset Quality**\n\n  * The Company’s loan portfolio increased by $172.10 million, or 7.17%, from December 31, 2022. Excluding the Surrey transaction, the loan portfolio decreased approximately $66.98 million, or 2.79%.\n  * Deposits increased $43.51 million, or 1.62%, from year-end 2022. Excluding the Surrey transaction, deposits decreased approximately $360.13 million, or 13.44%, from December 31, 2022.\n  * The Company repurchased 189,500 common shares during the fourth quarter of 2023 for a total cost of $5.98 million. The Company repurchased 768,079 common shares during 2023 for a total cost of $23.04 million. The Company recently announced a new 2.7 million share repurchase program that replaced the remainder of the prior program.\n  * Non-performing loans to total loans increased to 0.76% when compared with the same quarter of 2022. The Company experienced net charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2023 of $883 thousand, or 0.14%, of annualized average loans, compared to net charge-offs of $2.25 million, or 0.37%, of annualized average loans for the same period in 2022.\n  * The allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.41% at December 31, 2023, compared to 1.27% for the same period of 2022.\n  * The accumulated other comprehensive loss of $10.95 million at December 31, 2023, decreased $4.77 million compared to the accumulated other comprehensive loss of $15.71 million at December 31, 2022.\n  * Book value per share at December 31, 2023, was $27.20, an increase of $1.19 from year-end 2022.\n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures that provide useful information for financial and operational decision making, evaluating trends, and comparing financial results to other financial institutions. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this news release include “tangible book value per common share,” “return on average tangible common equity,” “adjusted earnings,” “adjusted diluted earnings per share,” “adjusted return on average assets,” “adjusted return on average common equity,” “adjusted return on average tangible common equity,” and certain financial measures presented on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis. FTE basis is calculated using the federal statutory income tax rate of 21%. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as a reconciliation to that comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in the attached tables to this press release. While the Company believes certain non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of its business and performance, they are supplemental and not a substitute for, or more important than, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to those reported by other financial institutions.\n\n**About First Community Bankshares, Inc.**\n\nFirst Community Bankshares, Inc., a financial holding company headquartered in Bluefield, Virginia, provides banking products and services through its wholly owned subsidiary First Community Bank.
