(NASDAQ: RARE), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel products for rare and ultra-rare diseases, today announced that it has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for setrusumab (UX143) as a treatment to reduce the risk of fracture associated with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) Type I, III, or IV in patients 2 years of age and older.\n\n\"FDA designation of setrusumab as a Breakthrough Therapy emphasizes the seriousness of osteogenesis imperfecta and the impact of this disease on people and their families affected by this disorder,” said Eric Crombez, M.D., chief medical officer at Ultragenyx. “The designation is also recognition of the significant clinical benefit observed in the Phase 2 portion of the Orbit study and supports our work to expeditiously bring this investigational therapy to patients who currently have no approved treatment option.”\n\nThe FDA’s decision is based on preliminary clinical evidence including the positive 14-month results from the Phase 2 portion of the Orbit study, which demonstrated a rapid and clinically meaningful decrease in fracture rate in patients, and from the completed Phase 2b ASTEROID study. Breakthrough Therapy Designation aims to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and whose preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies.\n\nSetrusumab was granted Orphan Drug Designation in the United States and EU, rare pediatric disease designation in the United States, and accepted into the European Medicine Agency’s Priority Medicines program (PRIME).\n\n**About Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI)** Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) includes a group of genetic disorders impacting bone metabolism. Approximately 85% to 90% of OI cases are caused by genetic variants in the  _COL1A1_ or  _COL1A2_ genes, leading to either reduced or abnormal collagen and changes in bone metabolism. The collagen mutations in OI can result in increased bone brittleness, which contributes to a high rate of fractures. Patients with OI also exhibit inadequate production of new bone and excess bone resorption, resulting in decreased bone mineral density, bone fragility and weakness. OI can also lead to bone deformities, abnormal spine curvature, pain, decreased mobility, and short stature. No treatments are globally approved for OI, which affects approximately 60,000 people in commercially accessible geographies.\n\n**About Setrusumab (UX143)** Setrusumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits sclerostin, a negative regulator of bone formation. Blocking sclerostin is expected to increase new bone formation, bone mineral density and bone strength in OI. In mouse models of OI, the use of anti-sclerostin antibodies was shown to increase bone formation, improve bone mass to normal levels, and increase bone strength against fracture force testing to normal levels. \n\nIn 2019, Mereo BioPharma completed the Phase 2b dose-finding study (ASTEROID) for setrusumab in 112 adults with OI. The ASTEROID study demonstrated treatment with setrusumab resulted in a clear, dose-dependent and statistically significant effect on bone formation and bone density at multiple anatomical sites among adult participants with OI. \n\nUltragenyx and Mereo BioPharma are collaborating on the development of setrusumab globally based on the collaboration and license agreement between the parties. The companies have developed a comprehensive late-stage program to continue development of setrusumab in pediatric and young adult patients across OI sub-types I, III and IV.\n\n**About Ultragenyx** Ultragenyx is a biopharmaceutical company committed to bringing novel therapies to patients for the treatment of serious rare and ultrarare genetic diseases. The company has built a diverse portfolio of approved medicines and treatment candidates aimed at addressing diseases with high unmet medical need and clear biology, for which there are typically no approved therapies treating the underlying disease.\n\nThe company is led by a management team experienced in the development and commercialization of rare disease therapeutics. Ultragenyx’s strategy is predicated upon time- and cost-efficient drug development, with the goal of delivering safe and effective therapies to patients with the utmost urgency.\n\nFor more information on Ultragenyx, please visit the company's website at: [www.ultragenyx.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5RJCIECyQm9KgvqGX7HmISe_24z9JwdL6cH0WkOQ-aORevdavRcKLW_v9CqJsPUpLlTYZyJlHYRL6t4qIx_LpcoGUtyuj4_iQLLYLTo12-o=).\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements and Use of Digital Media**  _Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters set forth in this press release, including statements related to Ultragenyx's expectations and projections regarding its future operating results and financial performance, business plans and objectives for UX143, expectations regarding the tolerability and safety of UX143, and future clinical and regulatory developments for UX143 are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(NASDAQ: RARE) and Mereo BioPharma Group plc (NASDAQ: MREO) today announced positive 14-month results from the Phase 2 portion of the ongoing Phase 2/3 Orbit study ([NCT05125809](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05125809?term=setrusumab%20orbit&rank=1)) demonstrating that, as of a May 24, 2024 data cut-off date, treatment with setrusumab (UX143) continued to significantly reduce incidence of fractures in patients with OI with at least 14 months of follow-up. Treatment with setrusumab also resulted in ongoing and meaningful improvements in lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) at month 12 without evidence of plateau. \n\nThe large reduction in annualized radiologically confirmed fracture rate previously reported in patients treated for a minimum of 6 months was sustained in patients treated for at least 14 months with a high degree of significance. The median annualized rate of radiologically confirmed fractures across all 24 patients in the 2 years prior to treatment was 0.72. Following a mean treatment duration period of 16 months, the median annualized fracture rate was reduced 67% to 0.00 (p=0.0014; n=24). The annualized fracture rate excluded morphometric vertebral fractures and fractures of the fingers, toes, skull, and face, consistent with the Phase 3 study primary efficacy endpoint. \n\n“All indications are that setrusumab is having the effect we hoped for, safely reducing the incidence of fractures and improving BMD in patients with OI,” said Gary S. Gottesman, M.D., Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine. “The anti-sclerostin antibody appears effective even after a year and remarkably, patients continue to make measurable gains, suggesting we will see an ongoing response over the long term.” \n\nThe reduction in annualized fracture rates was associated with continued, clinically meaningful increases in BMD. Tests conducted at the 12-month timepoint demonstrated that treatment with setrusumab resulted in a mean increase in lumbar spine BMD from baseline of 22% (p<0.0001, n=19) across all age groups (5 to < 26 years old), a further improvement from 14% observed at 6 months of treatment. This increase in BMD is reflected in the change from the mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of -1.73 to -0.49 at 12 months across all age groups, a substantial normalization in Z-score of +1.25 (p<0.0001, n=18). This is further improved from the mean 6-month Z-score change of +0.85. The improvements in BMD and Z-scores were significant and consistent across all OI sub-types studied.\n\n“The clinically meaningful continued improvement in BMD suggests that new and stronger bone is being created that has resulted in an important reduction in fractures across age groups and types of OI,” said Eric Crombez, M.D., chief medical officer at Ultragenyx. “With our phase 3 _Orbit_ and _Cosmic_ studies fully enrolled we now look forward to the possibility to bring this potential new treatment to a larger number of patients living with OI.”\n\nAs of the data cut-off, there were no treatment-related serious adverse events observed in the study. Reported adverse events were generally consistent with those observed in the  _Asteroid_ study with infusion-related events and headache determined to be the most common adverse events related to the study drug. As of the data cut-off, there were no reported hypersensitivity reactions related to setrusumab. \n\nMore detailed 14-month data will be presented at a future scientific meeting.\n\n**About the Setrusumab Phase 3 Program** Ultragenyx is developing setrusumab in pediatric and young adult patients across OI sub-types I, III and IV with two late-stage trials: the pivotal Phase 2/3 _Orbit_ study and Phase 3 _Cosmic_ study.\n\nThe global, seamless Phase 2/3 _Orbit_ study is evaluating the effect of setrusumab on clinical fracture rate in patients aged 5 to 25 years. In the Phase 2 portion, 24 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive setrusumab at one of two doses to determine the optimal dosing strategy for Phase 3. All patients from the 40 mg/kg dosing cohort have been transitioned to 20 mg/kg of setrusumab. \n\nThe pivotal Phase 3 portion of the study has enrolled an additional 158 patients at 45 sites across 11 countries, with subjects randomized 2:1 to receive setrusumab or placebo, and a primary efficacy endpoint of annualized clinical fracture rate. All patients will transition to an extension period and receive open-label setrusumab after the Phase 3 primary analysis is complete.\n\nThe global Phase 3 _Cosmic_ study is an open-label, randomized, active-controlled study in patients aged 2 to <7 years. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive setrusumab or intravenous bisphosphonates (IV-BP) therapy to evaluate reduction in total fracture rate. The _Cosmic_ study has enrolled 69 patients at 21 sites across 7 countries.\n\n**About Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI)** Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) includes a group of genetic disorders impacting bone metabolism. Approximately 85% to 90% of OI cases are caused by genetic variants in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, leading to either reduced or abnormal collagen and changes in bone metabolism. The collagen mutations in OI can result in increased bone brittleness, which contributes to a high rate of fractures. Patients with OI also exhibit inadequate production of new bone and excess bone resorption, resulting in decreased bone mineral density, bone fragility and weakness. OI can also lead to bone deformities, abnormal spine curvature, pain, decreased mobility, and short stature. No treatments are globally approved for OI, which affects approximately 60,000 people in commercially accessible geographies.\n\n**About Setrusumab (UX143)** Setrusumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits sclerostin, a negative regulator of bone formation. Blocking sclerostin is expected to increase new bone formation, bone mineral density and bone strength in OI. In mouse models of OI, the use of anti-sclerostin antibodies was shown to increase bone formation, improve bone mass to normal levels, and increase bone strength against fracture force testing to normal levels.\n\nIn 2019 Mereo BioPharma completed the Phase 2b dose-finding study (_Asteroid_) for setrusumab in 112 adults with OI. The _Asteroid_ study demonstrated treatment with setrusumab resulted in a clear, dose-dependent and statistically significant effect on bone formation and bone density at multiple anatomical sites among adult participants with OI.\n\nUltragenyx and Mereo BioPharma are collaborating on the development of setrusumab globally based on the collaboration and license agreement between the parties. The companies have developed a comprehensive late-stage program to continue development of setrusumab in pediatric and young adult patients across OI sub-types I, III and IV. \n\n**About Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.** Ultragenyx is a biopharmaceutical company committed to bringing novel products to patients for the treatment of serious rare and ultrarare genetic diseases. The company has built a diverse portfolio of approved therapies and product candidates aimed at addressing diseases with high unmet medical need and clear biology for treatment, for which there are typically no approved therapies treating the underlying disease.\n\nThe company is led by a management team experienced in the development and commercialization of rare disease therapeutics. Ultragenyx’s strategy is predicated upon time- and cost-efficient drug development, with the goal of delivering safe and effective therapies to patients with the utmost urgency.\n\nFor more information on Ultragenyx, please visit the company's website at: [www.ultragenyx.com](http://www.ultragenyx.com/).\n\n**About Mereo BioPharma** Mereo BioPharma is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of innovative therapeutics for rare diseases. The Company has two rare disease product candidates, setrusumab for the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and alvelestat primarily for the treatment of severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease (AATD-LD). The Company’s partner, Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical, Inc., has completed enrollment in the Phase 3 portion of a pivotal Phase 2/3 pediatric study in young adults (5 to 25 years old) for setrusumab in OI and in the Phase 3 study in pediatric patients (2 to <7 years old) in the first half of 2024. The partnership with Ultragenyx includes potential additional milestone payments of up to $245 million and royalties to Mereo on commercial sales in Ultragenyx territories. Mereo has retained EU and UK commercial rights and will pay Ultragenyx royalties on commercial sales in those territories.
