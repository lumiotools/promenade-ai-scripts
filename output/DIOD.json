Net cash flow was $49.4 million, including borrowing of $9.7 million of total debt. \n\n\n\nCommenting on the results, Gary Yu, President of Diodes, stated, “Third quarter revenue exceeded our expectations increasing 9.5% sequentially, while also achieving double-digit POS growth in Asia. As further evidence of the market recovery in Asia, our channel inventory continues to improve as both inventory dollars and inventory days decreased sequentially. Additionally, our automotive market revenue increased 18% sequentially to 19% of product revenue reflecting our ongoing content expansion and design win initiatives, even though both the automotive and industrial markets continue to undergo inventory and demand adjustments. \n\n“For the fourth quarter, we are guiding revenue to be better than typical seasonality. Our gross margin expectation continues to reflect factory underloading related to our wafer service agreements and internal demand. With sufficient capacity available to support future demand improvements, we took the initiative in the third quarter to moderate our CapEx investments to below our target model. This action combined with our past cost reduction actions will help preserve near-term earnings and cash flow until the recovery accelerates, especially in the higher margin automotive and industrial end markets.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024**\n\nRevenue for third quarter 2024 was $350.1 million, compared to $319.8 million in the second quarter 2024 and $404.6 million in the third quarter 2023. \n\nGAAP gross profit for the third quarter 2024 was $118.0 million, or 33.7 percent of revenue, compared to $107.4 million, or 33.6 percent of revenue, in the second quarter 2024 and $155.9 million, or 38.5 percent of revenue, in the third quarter of 2023. \n\nGAAP operating expenses for third quarter 2024 were $96.1 million, or 27.5 percent of revenue, and on a non-GAAP basis were $91.7 million, or 26.2 percent of revenue, which excludes $3.8 million amortization of acquisition-related intangible asset expenses, $0.8 million in acquisition-related costs and a $0.2 million adjustment on restructuring charges. GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter 2024 were $103.7 million, or 32.4 percent of revenue and in the third quarter 2023 were $102.0 million, or 25.2 percent of revenue. \n\nThird quarter 2024 GAAP net income was $13.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income in the second quarter 2024 of $8.0 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, and $48.7 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, of GAAP net income in the third quarter 2023. \n\nThird quarter 2024 non-GAAP adjusted net income was $20.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, which excluded, net of tax, $3.1 million of acquisition-related intangible asset cost, $2.7 million non-cash mark-to-market investment value adjustment, $0.6 million in acquisition-related costs and a $0.2 million adjustment on restructuring charges. This compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of $15.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the second quarter 2024 and $52.5 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, in the third quarter 2023. \n\nThe following is an unaudited summary reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income and per share data, net of tax (_in thousands, except per share data):_\n\n**Three Months Ended**  \n---  \n**September 30, 2024**  \n**GAAP net income** |  **$** |  **13,745**  \n**GAAP diluted earnings per share** |  **$** |  **0.30**  \n**Adjustments to reconcile net income to non-GAAP net income:**  \n**Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets** |  **3,130**  \n**Acquisition related cost** |  **604**  \n**Restructuring charge** |  **(157** |  **)**  \n**Non-cash mark-to-market investment value adjustments** |  **2,729**  \n**Non-GAAP net income** |  **$** |  **20,051**  \n**Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share** |  **$** |  **0.43**  \n  \nNote: Throughout this release, we refer to “net income attributable to common stockholders” as “net income.” \n\n(See the reconciliation tables of GAAP net income to non-GAAP adjusted net income near the end of this release for further details.) \n\nIncluded in third quarter 2024 GAAP net income and non-GAAP adjusted net income was approximately $5.9 million, net of tax, non-cash share-based compensation expense. Excluding share-based compensation expense, GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”) and non-GAAP adjusted EPS would have increased by $0.13 per share for the third quarter 2024, compared to $0.07 and $0.06, respectively, for the second quarter 2024 and $0.10 for both in the third quarter 2023. \n\nEBITDA (a non-GAAP measure), which represents earnings before net interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, in third quarter 2024 was $46.9 million, or 13.4 percent of revenue, compared to $41.1 million, or 12.8 percent of revenue, in second quarter 2024 and $90.6 million, or 22.4 percent of revenue, in third quarter 2023. For a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA, see the table near the end of this release for further details. \n\nFor the third quarter 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $54.4 million. Net cash flow was $49.4 million, including borrowing of $9.7 million of total debt. Free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) was $39.4 million, which includes $15.0 million of capital expenditures. \n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $325 million in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments. Total debt (including long-term and short-term) amounted to approximately $58 million and working capital was approximately $910 million. \n\nThe results announced today are preliminary and unaudited, as they are subject to the Company finalizing its closing procedures and completion of the quarterly review by its independent registered public accounting firm. As such, these results are subject to revision until the Company files its Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2024. \n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nGary Yu further commented, “For the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to be approximately $337 million, plus or minus 3 percent, representing a 3.7% sequential decrease at the mid-point, slightly better than typical seasonality. GAAP gross margin is expected to be 33.0 percent, plus or minus 1 percent. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which are GAAP operating expenses adjusted for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, are expected to be approximately 28.0 percent of revenue, plus or minus 1 percent. We expect net interest income to be approximately $2.5 million. Our income tax rate is expected to be 18.0 percent, plus or minus 3 percent, and shares used to calculate diluted EPS for the fourth quarter are anticipated to be approximately 46.7 million.” \n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets of $3.1 million, after tax, for previous acquisitions is not included in these non-GAAP estimates. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nDiodes will host a conference call on Thursday, November 7, 2024 at 4:00 p.m. Central Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss its third quarter financial results.

Excluding share-based compensation expense, both GAAP and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share would have improved by $0.40 per share. \n\n**ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE**\n\nThe Company’s financial statements present net income and earnings per share that are calculated using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company’s management makes adjustments to the GAAP measures that it feels are necessary to allow investors and other readers of the Company’s financial releases to view the Company’s operating results as viewed by the Company’s management, board of directors and research analysts in the semiconductor industry. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with, and should not be considered alternatives or necessarily superior to, GAAP financial data and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures, even if they have similar names. The explanation of the adjustments made in the table above, are set forth below: \n\n**_Detail of non-GAAP adjustments_**\n\n**Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets – **The Company excluded this item, including amortization of developed technologies and customer relationships. The fair value of the acquisition-related intangible assets is amortized using straight-line methods which approximate the proportion of future cash flows estimated to be generated each period over the estimated useful life of the applicable assets. The Company believes that exclusion of this item is appropriate because a significant portion of the purchase price for its acquisitions was allocated to the intangible assets that have short lives and exclusion of the amortization expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for both the Company’s newly acquired and long-held businesses. In addition, the Company excluded this item because there is significant variability and unpredictability among companies with respect to this expense. \n\n**Officer retirement** – The Company excluded costs related to the retirement of two executives. These costs represent cash payments and the accelerated vesting of previously issued stock awards. The Company feels it is appropriate to exclude these costs since they don’t represent ongoing operating expenses and will present investors with a more accurate indication of our continuing operations. \n\n**Acquisition related costs –** The Company excluded expenses associated with previous acquisitions of that typically consist of advisory, legal and other professional and consulting fees. These costs were expensed as they were incurred and as services were received, and in which the corresponding tax adjustments were made for the non-deductible portions of these expenses. The Company believes the exclusion of the acquisition related costs provides investors with a more accurate reflection of costs likely to be incurred in the absence of an unusual event such as an acquisition and facilitates comparisons with the results of other periods that may not reflect such costs. \n\n**Insurance recovery for manufacturing facility** – The Company recorded gains related to insurance recovery for a manufacturing facility in Asia. The Company believes the exclusion of the insurance recovery provides investors with a more accurate reflection of the continuing operations of the Company and facilitates comparisons with the results of other periods which may not reflect such gains. \n\n**Non-cash mark-to-market investment adjustments** – The Company excluded mark-to-market adjustments on various equity related investments. The Company believes this is not reflective of the ongoing operations and exclusion of this provides investors an enhanced view of the Company’s operating results. \n\n**Restructuring charge** – The Company recorded restructuring charges related to various locations. These restructuring charges are excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the exclusion of the restructuring charges provides investors an enhanced view of the cost structure of the Company’s operations and facilitates comparisons with the results of other periods that may not reflect such charges or may reflect different levels of such charges. \n\n**Investment gain** – The Company excluded the gain realized on the sale of an equity investment. The Company believes this is not reflective of the ongoing operations and exclusion of this item provides investors an enhanced view of the Company’s operating results. \n\n**CASH FLOW ITEMS**\n\n**Free cash flow (FCF) (Non-GAAP)**\n\nFCF for the third quarter of 2024 is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operations. For the third quarter of 2024, FCF was $39.4 million, which represents the cash and cash equivalents that we are able to generate after taking into account cash outlays required to maintain or expand property, plant and equipment. FCF is important because it allows us to pursue opportunities to develop new products, make acquisitions and reduce debt. \n\n**CONSOLIDATED RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO EBITDA**\n\nEBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization. Management believes EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties, such as financial institutions in extending credit, in evaluating companies in our industry and provides further clarity on our profitability. In addition, management uses EBITDA, along with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures, in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry. The calculation of EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing, operating in different income tax jurisdictions, and accounting effects of capital spending, including the impact of our asset base, which can differ depending on the book value of assets and the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization expense. EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income from operations and net income, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. For example, our EBITDA takes into account all net interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization without taking into account any amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest**.** Furthermore, EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. \n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA _(in thousands, unaudited):_\n\n**Three Months Ended** |  **Nine Months Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 30 ,** |  **September 30 ,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet income (per-GAAP) |  $  |  13,745  |  $  |  48,720  |  $  |  35,783  |  $  |  201,890   \nPlus:  \nInterest expense, net |  (4,076  |  )  |  (3,609  |  )  |  (11,543  |  )  |  (3,284  |  )   \nIncome tax provision |  3,619  |  10,674  |  9,799  |  44,514   \nDepreciation and amortization |  33,650  |  34,827  |  102,300  |  102,723   \n**EBITDA (non-GAAP)** |  **$** |  **46,938** |  **$** |  **90,612** |  **$** |  **136,339** |  **$** |  **345,843**  \n**DIODES INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS**  \n_(Unaudited)_  \n_(In thousands, except share and per share data)_  \n**September 30 ,** |  **December 31 ,**  \n**2024** |  **2023**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents |  $  |  311,864  |  $  |  315,457   \nRestricted Cash |  5,220  |  3,026   \nShort-term investments |  7,463  |  10,174   \nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of $10,461 and $5,641 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively |  358,938  |  371,930   \nInventories |  482,038  |  389,774   \nPrepaid expenses and other |  96,921  |  97,024   \nTotal current assets |  1,262,444  |  1,187,385   \nProperty, plant and equipment, net |  703,725  |  746,169   \nDeferred income tax |  52,443  |  51,620   \nGoodwill |  148,512  |  146,558   \nIntangible assets, net |  53,698  |  63,937   \nOther long-term assets |  168,560  |  171,990   \nTotal assets |  $  |  2,389,382  |  $  |  2,367,659   \n**Liabilities**  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nLine of credit |  $  |  35,704  |  $  |  40,685   \nAccounts payable |  150,247  |  158,261   \nAccrued liabilities |  161,880  |  179,674   \nIncome tax payable |  3,506  |  10,459   \nCurrent portion of long-term debt |  1,446  |  4,419   \nTotal current liabilities |  352,783  |  393,498   \nLong-term debt, net of current portion |  20,717  |  16,979   \nDeferred tax liabilities |  11,600  |  13,662   \nUnrecognized tax benefits |  34,035  |  34,035   \nOther long-term liabilities |  86,938  |  99,808   \nTotal liabilities |  506,073  |  557,982   \nCommitments and contingencies  \n**Stockholders' equity**  \nPreferred stock - par value $1.00 per share;
