Retail segment net sales declined\n0.8% in the quarter to $234.2 million, driven by the impact of our tactical decision to exit our perimeter-of-\nthe-store bakery product lines this past March. Foodservice segment net sales were essentially flat at\n$218.6 million as deflationary pricing offset volume growth.\n• Consolidated gross profit increased $4.4 million to $97.6 million.\n• Consolidated operating income increased $30.2 million to $41.7 million. Restructuring and impairment\ncharges reduced this year’s fourth quarter operating income by $2.7 million while impairment charges\nreduced last year’s fourth quarter operating income by $25.0 million.\n• Fourth quarter net income was $1.26 per diluted share versus $0.33 per diluted share last year.\nRestructuring and impairment charges reduced this year’s fourth quarter net income by $0.08 per diluted\nshare whereas impairment charges reduced last year’s fourth quarter net income by $0.70 per diluted share.\nCEO David A. Ciesinski commented, “We were pleased to report gross profit growth of 4.8% in the fourth\nquarter despite the modest sales decline. In the Retail segment, our licensed items continued to perform well, as the\nrecently introduced Subway® sandwich sauces and Texas Roadhouse® steak sauces provided incremental sales\ngrowth to our lineup of licensed sauces and dressings. Our category-leading New York BRAND® Bakery frozen\ngarlic bread also achieved solid volume gains in the quarter. Excluding the perimeter-of-the-store bakery product\nlines that we exited in March, Retail net sales increased 1.4% and Retail sales volume, measured in pounds shipped,\nincreased 1.2%. In the Foodservice segment, flat net sales reflect the unfavorable impact of deflationary pricing\nwhile the segment’s sales volume improved 4.2%, driven by increased demand from several of our national chain\nrestaurant account customers.”\n“The $4.4 million increase in fourth quarter gross profit resulted in a gross profit margin of 21.6%, an\nincrease of 110 basis points versus the prior year driven by our cost savings programs. As anticipated, we did not\nbenefit from pricing net of commodity costs, or PNOC, in our fiscal fourth quarter.”\nMORE. . .\nPAGE 2 / LANCASTER COLONY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR RESULTS\nFourth Quarter Results\nConsolidated net sales decreased 0.4% to $452.8 million. Retail segment net sales declined 0.8% to\n$234.2 million while the segment’s sales volume, measured in pounds shipped, was flat. Excluding the perimeter-\nof-the-store bakery product lines that we exited in March, specifically our Flatout® and Angelic Bakehouse®\nbrands, Retail net sales increased 1.4% and Retail sales volume increased 1.2%. In the Foodservice segment, net\nsales were essentially unchanged at $218.6 million including the unfavorable impact of deflationary pricing while\nFoodservice sales volume increased 4.2%.\nConsolidated gross profit increased $4.4 million to $97.6 million as our cost savings programs more than\noffset higher labor costs and the impact of deflationary pricing.\nSG&A expenses decreased $3.5 million to $53.2 million as expenditures for Project Ascent, our ERP\ninitiative, continued to wind down and consumer spending was also lower. These lower costs were partially\noffset by increased investments in personnel and IT. Expenditures for Project Ascent totaled $0.5 million in the\ncurrent-year quarter versus $5.6 million last year.\nRestructuring and impairment charges of $2.7 million are attributed to our decision to exit our perimeter-\nof-the-store bakery product lines this past March. The associated property and equipment for those product lines\nwere sold or disposed of during the fourth quarter, and we do not anticipate any additional related charges going\nforward. In the prior-year quarter, impairment charges of $25.0 million resulted from a reduction in the carrying\nvalue of certain intangible assets attributed to the now discontinued Flatout product line.\nConsolidated operating income increased $30.2 million to $41.7 million as impacted by the net reduction\nof $22.3 million in restructuring and impairment charges along with the improved gross profit and reduced SG&A\nexpenses.\nNet income increased $25.7 million to $34.8 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, versus $9.2 million, or\n$0.33 per diluted share, last year. In the current-year quarter, the restructuring and impairment charges reduced\nnet income by $2.1 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, while expenditures for Project Ascent reduced net income\nby $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. In the prior-year quarter, impairment charges reduced net income by\n$19.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, while expenditures for Project Ascent reduced net income by $4.3\nmillion, or $0.16 per diluted share.\nFiscal Year Results\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, net sales increased 2.7% to $1.87 billion compared to $1.82\nbillion a year ago. Net income for the fiscal year totaled $158.6 million, or $5.76 per diluted share, versus the\nprior-year amount of $111.3 million, or $4.04 per diluted share. In fiscal 2024, restructuring and impairment\ncharges reduced net income by $11.4 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, and expenditures for Project Ascent\ndecreased net income by $6.3 million, or $0.23 per diluted share. In fiscal 2023, expenditures for Project Ascent\ndecreased net income by $23.0 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, while restructuring and impairment charges\nreduced net income by $19.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share.\nMORE. . .\nPAGE 3 / LANCASTER COLONY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR RESULTS\nFiscal 2025 Outlook\nMr. Ciesinski commented, “Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, we anticipate Retail segment sales will\ncontinue to benefit from volume growth led by our licensing program, including increased sales from the new\nproducts, flavors and sizes we introduced in fiscal 2024. We are also excited to share that our partnership with\nTexas Roadhouse has expanded beyond steak sauces to include their popular dinner rolls, which we introduced\nwith a regional pilot test in June. In addition, we anticipate continued positive sales momentum for our New York\nBRAND® Bakery frozen garlic bread products in fiscal 2025 driven by the introduction of a great-tasting gluten-\nfree garlic bread, along with volume growth for our Marzetti® refrigerated dressings. In the Foodservice segment,\nwe expect sales volume to be led by growth from select quick-service restaurant customers in our mix of national\nchain restaurant accounts, while external factors, including U.S. economic performance and consumer behavior,\nmay impact demand. With respect to our input costs, in aggregate we do not foresee significant impacts from\ncommodity cost inflation or deflation in the coming year. We also expect to drive margin improvement through\nour cost savings programs.”\nConference Call on the Web\nThe company’s fourth quarter and fiscal year-end conference call is scheduled for this morning,\nAugust 22, at 10:00 a.m. ET.

          "content": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE SYMBOL: LANC\nMay 2, 2024 TRADED: Nasdaq\nLANCASTER COLONY REPORTS THIRD QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS\nWESTERVILLE, Ohio, May 2 - Lancaster Colony Corporation (Nasdaq: LANC) today reported results\nfor the company’s fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2024.\nSummary\n• Consolidated net sales increased 1.4% to a third quarter record $471.4 million versus $464.9 million last\nyear. Retail net sales improved 0.3% to $248.1 million while Foodservice net sales grew 2.6% to $223.4\nmillion.\n• Consolidated gross profit increased $10.3 million, or 10.9%, to $104.5 million driven by favorability in\nour pricing net of commodity costs, or PNOC, our ongoing cost savings initiatives, and volume growth.\nConsolidated gross profit was unfavorably impacted by a $2.6 million inventory write-down resulting\nfrom the decision to exit our perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines, specifically our Flatout® and\nAngelic Bakehouse® brands, which were not significant contributors to our overall financial results.\n• Consolidated operating income increased $5.7 million to $35.1 million due to solid growth in the\nunderlying performance of the business partially offset by the impacts of our decision to exit our\nperimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines which resulted in costs totaling $14.7 million. The exit costs\ninclude $12.1 million in restructuring and impairment charges and the $2.6 million inventory write-down.\nOf the $12.1 million in restructuring and impairment charges, noncash impairment charges for fixed\nassets and intangible assets accounted for $10.7 million.\n• Net income was $1.03 per diluted share versus $0.89 per diluted share last year. The exit costs reduced\ncurrent-year net income by $0.41 per diluted share.\nCEO David A. Ciesinski commented, “We completed our fiscal third quarter with record net sales of\n$471.4 million. In the Retail segment, net sales increased 0.3% to $248.1 million driven by volume gains for our\nsuccessful licensing program, led by Chick-fil-A® sauces and dressings; our newly introduced Subway® sandwich\nsauces and Texas Roadhouse® steak sauces; and Olive Garden® dressings. Sales volume for the Retail segment,\nmeasured in pounds shipped, increased 1.5%, outpacing the sales dollar growth as we invested in trade spending\nthat supported household penetration growth and new items. Retail segment sales compare to a strong quarter last\nyear when net sales increased 16.0% and volume was up 6.1%. In our Foodservice segment, net sales increased\n2.6% to $223.4 million while Foodservice sales volume grew 3.9% as increased demand from several of our\nnational chain restaurant customers and volume gains for our Marzetti® branded Foodservice products more than\noffset deflationary pricing in the segment.”\nMORE. . .\nPAGE 2 / LANCASTER COLONY REPORTS THIRD QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS\n“Our reported gross profit margin improved 190 basis points versus last year to 22.2%, which reflects\nfavorable pricing net of commodity costs, or PNOC, following two years of unprecedented inflation, in addition\nto the positive impacts of our cost savings initiatives and volume growth. The $2.6 million inventory write-down\nreduced gross profit margin by about 50 basis points.”\n“Following a review of our product portfolio, we made the difficult decision to exit our perimeter-of-the-\nstore bakery product lines, specifically our Flatout and Angelic Bakehouse brands, which were not significant\ncontributors to our overall financial results. Both brands were typically sold in the deli section of the grocery\nstore with product offerings that included Flatout flatbread wraps and pizza crusts and Angelic Bakehouse\nsprouted grain bread loaves and wraps. Unfortunately, due to a lack of scale and direct-to-store distribution\ncapabilities, we were not able to achieve the desired operational or financial performance for these product lines.\nProduction at both the Flatout and Angelic Bakehouse facilities ended on March 12, 2024. I extend my sincere\nthanks to the Flatout and Angelic employees for their dedicated service during their tenure with our company.\nWith our decision to exit these product lines now behind us, we will direct even greater focus toward the\ncontinued growth of our core retail brands, including New York BRAND® Bakery, Sister Schubert’s® and\nMarzetti®; our retail licensing program; and our foodservice business.”\n“Looking ahead to our fiscal fourth quarter, we anticipate Retail sales will continue to benefit from our\nlicensing program, including incremental growth from the recent additions of Subway and Texas Roadhouse\nsauces. In the Foodservice segment, we expect continued volume growth from select quick-service restaurant\ncustomers and our branded Foodservice products, while deflationary pricing is projected to remain a headwind to\nFoodservice segment net sales.”\nThird Quarter Results\nConsolidated net sales increased 1.4% to a third quarter record $471.4 million versus $464.9 million last\nyear. Retail segment net sales improved 0.3% to $248.1 million while Retail segment sales volume, measured in\npounds shipped, was up 1.5%, driven by higher demand for our licensed dressings and sauces. In the Foodservice\nsegment, net sales grew 2.6% to $223.4 million despite deflationary pricing. Foodservice sales volume increased\n3.9% led by volume gains from select quick-service restaurant and pizza chain customers in our mix of national\naccounts along with higher demand for our Marzetti branded Foodservice products.\nConsolidated gross profit increased $10.3 million, or 10.9%, to a third quarter record $104.5 million,\nwhich reflects favorable PNOC, our ongoing cost savings initiatives, and volume growth. Consolidated gross\nprofit was unfavorably impacted by a $2.6 million inventory write-down resulting from the company’s decision to\nexit our perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines, specifically our Flatout and Angelic Bakehouse brands.\nSG&A expenses declined $7.6 million to $57.2 million, driven by the continued wind down of our\nexpenditures for Project Ascent, our ERP initiative, which decreased $5.7 million to $1.9 million versus $7.6\nmillion last year. SG&A expenses in the prior-year quarter also included some nonrecurring legal charges for\nclosed operations.\nMORE. . .\nPAGE 3 / LANCASTER COLONY REPORTS THIRD QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS\nThe restructuring and impairment charges of $12.1 million resulted from our decision to exit our\nperimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines. The $12.1 million total includes noncash impairment charges of\napproximately $6.2 million for fixed assets and $4.5 million for intangible assets.\nConsolidated operating income increased $5.7 million to $35.1 million, driven by favorable PNOC, the\nlower SG&A expenses, our ongoing cost savings initiatives, and volume growth. Consolidated operating income\ngrowth was unfavorably impacted by the $12.1 million in restructuring and impairment charges and the $2.6\nmillion inventory write-down. The restructuring and impairment charges were not allocated to our two reportable\nsegments whereas the inventory write-down was recorded in our Retail segment.\nNet income increased $3.8 million to $28.4 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, versus $0.89 per diluted\nshare last year. In the current-year quarter, costs related to our decision to exit our perimeter-of-the-store bakery\nproduct lines reduced net income by a total of $11.3 million, or $0.41 per diluted share. These exit costs included\nthe restructuring and impairment charges, which reduced net income by $9.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted share,\nand the inventory write-down, which reduced net income by $2.0 million, or $0.07 per diluted share.\nExpenditures for Project Ascent decreased net income by $1.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the current-\nyear quarter compared to $5.9 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Net income and\nearnings per diluted share in the prior-year quarter benefited from a lower overall effective tax rate.\nFiscal Year-to-Date Results\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2024, net sales increased 3.7% to $1.42 billion compared to $1.37\nbillion a year ago. Net income for the nine-month period totaled $123.8 million, or $4.50 per diluted share, versus\nthe prior-year amount of $102.1 million, or $3.71 per diluted share. In the current-year period, costs related to our\ndecision to exit our perimeter-of-the-store bakery product lines reduced net income by a total of $11.3 million, or\n$0.41 per diluted share. These exit costs included the restructuring and impairment charges, which reduced net\nincome by $9.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, and the inventory write-down, which reduced net income by\n$2.0 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. Expenditures for Project Ascent reduced net income by $5.9 million, or\n$0.22 per diluted share, in the current-year period compared to $18.7 million, or $0.68 per diluted share, in the\nprior-year period.\nConference Call on the Web\nThe company’s third quarter conference call is scheduled for this morning, May 2, at 10:00 a.m. ET.\nAccess to a live webcast of the call is available through a link on the company’s Internet home page at\nwww.lancastercolony.com.

Retail net sales grew 2.0% to $264.0 million while Foodservice net sales advanced 1.5% to\n$221.9 million.\n• Consolidated gross profit increased $19.4 million, or 19.0%, to a second quarter record $121.5 million.\n• Consolidated operating income increased $14.4 million, or 28.1%, to a second quarter record $65.8\nmillion.\n• Net income was $1.87 per diluted share versus $1.45 per diluted share last year.\nCEO David A. Ciesinski commented, “We were very pleased to complete the quarter with record sales\nand profit. In addition to carryover pricing, Retail segment net sales growth of 2.0% was driven by volume gains\nfor our successful licensing program, continued strong performance for our New York BRAND® Bakery frozen\ngarlic bread and increased demand for our Reames® frozen egg noodles. In the Foodservice segment, sales\ngrowth of 1.5% was led by higher demand from several of our national chain restaurant accounts along with\nvolume growth for our branded Foodservice products. It is worth noting that, during the period, Foodservice\nsegment sales were adversely impacted by deflationary pricing.”\n“Our reported gross profit margin improved to 25.0%, an increase of 360 basis points versus last year,\nwhich reflects favorable pricing net of commodity costs, or PNOC, following two years of unprecedented\ninflation, in addition to the positive impacts of our cost savings initiatives.”\n“Looking ahead to our fiscal third quarter, we project Retail sales will continue to benefit from our\nexpanding licensing program while, in the Foodservice segment, we expect sustained volume growth from select\nquick-service restaurant customers. We anticipate continued favorability in our pricing net of commodity costs,\nbut at a sequentially lower level compared to our fiscal second quarter. Deflationary pricing is expected to remain\na headwind to Foodservice segment net sales.”\nMORE. . .\nPAGE 2 / LANCASTER COLONY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS\nSecond Quarter Results\nConsolidated net sales increased 1.8% to a second quarter record $485.9 million versus $477.4 million\nlast year. Retail segment net sales grew 2.0% to $264.0 million. Beyond the favorable impact of our fiscal 2023\npricing actions, key contributors to the increase in Retail segment net sales included our licensing program, most\nnotably Chick-fil-A® sauces and dressings; our New York BRAND® Bakery frozen garlic bread products; and our\nReames® frozen egg noodles. Retail segment sales volume, measured in pounds shipped, declined 1.9%.\nExcluding the impacts of a recent value engineering initiative and our reduced commitment to private label bread,\nRetail sales volume increased 1.2%. In the Foodservice segment, net sales improved 1.5% to $221.9 million\ndespite deflationary pricing. Foodservice sales volume, measured in pounds shipped, increased 4.6% led by\nhigher demand from several of our national chain restaurant accounts along with volume growth for our branded\nFoodservice products.\nConsolidated gross profit increased $19.4 million, or 19.0%, to a second quarter record $121.5 million,\nwhich reflects favorability in our pricing net of commodity costs and the impact of our cost savings initiatives.\nPartial offsets to these positive factors included higher labor costs and increased depreciation expense.\nSG&A expenses rose $4.9 million to $55.7 million driven by increased consumer spending and higher\nbrokerage costs. Expenditures for Project Ascent, our ERP initiative, continued to wind down with costs totaling\n$2.0 million in the current-year quarter versus $7.5 million last year.\nConsolidated operating income grew $14.4 million, or 28.1%, to a second quarter record $65.8 million\ndriven by the increase in gross profit partially offset by the higher SG&A expenses.\nNet income increased $11.5 million to $51.5 million, or $1.87 per diluted share, versus $1.45 per diluted\nshare last year. Expenditures for Project Ascent reduced net income by $1.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in\nthe current-year quarter compared to $5.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter.\nFiscal Year-to-Date Results\nFor the six months ended December 31, 2023, net sales increased 4.9% to $947.5 million compared to\n$902.9 million a year ago. Net income for the six-month period totaled $95.4 million, or $3.47 per diluted share,\nversus the prior-year amount of $77.6 million, or $2.81 per diluted share. In the current-year period, spend for\nProject Ascent decreased net income by $4.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. In the prior-year period, spend\nfor Project Ascent decreased net income by $12.8 million, or $0.47 per diluted share.\nConference Call on the Web\nThe company’s second quarter conference call is scheduled for this morning, February 1, at 10:00 a.m.\nET.
