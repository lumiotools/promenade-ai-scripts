(Nasdaq: TRDA) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company aiming to transform the lives of patients by establishing a new class of medicines that engage intracellular targets long considered inaccessible. The Company today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and highlighted recent business updates.\n\n“We are highly encouraged by the progress in our Duchenne franchise, with both ENTR-601-44 and ENTR-601-45 achieving significant milestones since June. The recent data presented at the World Muscle Society enhance our proposed regulatory packages, and we remain on track with our global regulatory filings for both ENTR-601-44 and ENTR-601-45,” said Dipal Doshi, Chief Executive Officer at Entrada Therapeutics. “Our team continues to work hard across our entire Duchenne franchise in an effort to bring these important potential therapies to the Duchenne community. In addition, we are pleased with the momentum that our partner, Vertex, is building with VX-670 for the potential treatment of DM1 where no approved therapies are available. The successful completion of the SAD and subsequent initiation of the MAD portion of their ongoing Phase 1/2 study underscores the potential of this therapeutic opportunity.”\n\n**Recent Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * In October 2024, the Company presented data in support of its Duchenne franchise at the 29th Annual Congress of the World Muscle Society in Prague, Czechia. The poster presentations included additional positive data from its Phase 1 clinical trial (ENTR-601-44-101), reinforcing the candidate's pharmacokinetic and safety profile in patients, and new preclinical data showing both exon skipping and dystrophin production for ENTR-601-45.\n  * The Company remains on track to submit regulatory applications in Q4 2024 to initiate separate global Phase 2 clinical trials for ENTR-601-44 and ENTR-601-45. Submission of regulatory applications to initiate a global Phase 2 clinical trial for its third Duchenne candidate, ENTR-601-50, in patients who are exon 50 skipping amenable, is expected in 2025.\n  * In September 2024, Entrada announced the promotion of Natarajan Sethuraman PhD, previously Chief Scientific Officer, to President of Research and Development. Dr. Sethuraman has brought broad experience to the Company since its inception and has been invaluable in advancing ENTR-601-44 into the clinic.\n  * In November 2024, Vertex announced the completion of the SAD portion of the global Phase 1/2 clinical trial for VX-670 in people with DM1. Vertex has initiated the MAD portion of the Phase 1/2 study, in which the safety and efficacy of VX-670 will be evaluated.\n\n\n\n**Upcoming Conferences**\n\nThe Company will present at the following events during the fourth quarter of 2024:\n\n  * ASGCT-MDA Breakthroughs in Muscular Dystrophy, Chicago, IL from November 19-20\n  * Evercore ISI HealthCONx Conference, Coral Gables, FL on December 4\n  * Oppenheimer Movers in Rare Disease Summit, New York, NY on December 12\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $449.3 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $352.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily a result of the $100 million registered direct offering completed in June of 2024 and the receipt of the $75 million payment for the clinical advancement milestone for VX-670 that was achieved in the first quarter of 2024, offset by cash used to fund operations. Based on current operating plans, the Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund its operations into 2027.\n\n**Collaboration Revenue:** Collaboration revenue was $19.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $43.7 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of fewer costs incurred for VX-670 research activities during the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Research & Development (R&D) Expenses**: R&D expenses were $31.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $22.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by additional costs incurred for ENTR-601-44, ENTR-601-45, and ENTR-601-50, as well as higher personnel costs (including non-cash, stock-based compensation).\n\n**General & Administrative (G&A) Expenses**: G&A expenses were $10.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $7.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs (including non-cash, stock-based compensation).\n\n**Net (Loss) Income:** Net loss was $(14.0) million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net income of $35.5 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n**About Entrada Therapeutics** Entrada Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company aiming to transform the lives of patients by establishing a new class of medicines that engage intracellular targets that have long been considered inaccessible. The Company’s Endosomal Escape Vehicle (EEV™)-therapeutics are designed to enable the efficient intracellular delivery of a wide range of therapeutics into a variety of organs and tissues, resulting in an improved therapeutic index. Through this proprietary, versatile and modular approach, Entrada is advancing a robust development portfolio of RNA-, antibody- and enzyme-based programs for the potential treatment of neuromuscular, ocular, metabolic and immunological diseases, among others. The Company’s lead oligonucleotide programs are in development for the potential treatment of people living with Duchenne who are exon 44, 45 and 50 skipping amenable. Entrada has partnered to develop a clinical-stage program, VX-670, for myotonic dystrophy type 1.\n\nFor more information about Entrada, please visit our website, [_www.entradatx.com_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=zfsY5sGJi4wKYo4wSc_UPrjoepBe00CP_SDRBrlbnj5XbeiTaBs5g9LiLXitscNbaTfrllv1xydIL7gheXN8WdW9cc_MMrqwtkgrkBWl7J4=), and follow us on [_LinkedIn_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hRA5npzwuGhCraHxUoM8TWWNps5MnBmUdcRgmgo3mg2gC2nPEIIvEDTrwpTJ7-sWYMcS9h912E8iMT3TXWXdy-ScA_ytLu-V_Puoo7EB7uA=).\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.
