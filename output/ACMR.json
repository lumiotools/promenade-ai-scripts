(“ACM”) (NASDAQ: ACMR), a leading supplier of wafer processing solutions for semiconductor and advanced wafer-level packaging applications, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\"I am pleased to report another strong quarter for ACM, with record revenue and shipments, good profitability, and positive cash flow from operations,\" said ACM’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. David Wang. \"We believe our results demonstrate ACM’s role as an innovator, delivering world-class tools that drive value for our customers and strengthen our position in the global market. Tahoe is gaining momentum with multiple logic and memory customers in production. This tool now delivers the same advanced cleaning performance as single-wafer tools, and at the same time up to 75% reduction of sulfuric acid use. We also believe the unique approach of our new panel products – including the Ultra ECP ap-p Horizontal Plating tool, the Ultra C vac-p Flux Cleaning tool, and the Ultra C bev-p Bevel Etching Tool – position ACM to become a significant contributor to the global adoption of AI chip manufacturing.”\n\nDr. Wang continued, \"Looking ahead, we anticipate continued growth of our business in mainland China through market share gains and new product ramps. We have begun initial operations at our Lingang facility, and we remain committed to support major customers in the US, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Our near-term outlook has improved, and as a result, we have raised our 2024 revenue outlook.\"\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**GAAP**| **Non-GAAP(1)**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n _(dollars in thousands, except EPS)_  \nRevenue| $| 203,976| $| 168,569| $| 203,976| $| 168,569  \nGross margin| 51.4| %| 52.5| %| 51.6| %| 52.9| %  \nIncome from operations| $| 44,184| $| 33,173| $| 56,065| $| 43,754  \nNet income attributable to ACM Research, Inc.| $| 30,904| $| 25,679| $| 42,372| $| 37,579  \nBasic EPS| $| 0.49| $| 0.43| $| 0.68| $| 0.62  \nDiluted EPS| $| 0.45| $| 0.39| $| 0.63| $| 0.57  \n  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**GAAP**| **Non-GAAP(1)**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n _(dollars in thousands, except EPS)_  \nRevenue| $| 558,647| $| 387,402| $| 558,647| $| 387,402  \nGross margin| 50.3| %| 50.9| %| 50.6| %| 51.1| %  \nIncome from operations| $| 107,009| $| 72,465| $| 147,801| $| 87,131  \nNet income attributable to ACM Research, Inc.| $| 72,547| $| 59,649| $| 114,490| $| 78,743  \nBasic EPS| $| 1.17| $| 0.99| $| 1.85| $| 1.31  \nDiluted EPS| $| 1.07| $| 0.90| $| 1.70| $| 1.19  \n  \n(1)| Reconciliations to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures from non-GAAP financial measures are presented below under “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation and, with respect to net income (loss) attributable to ACM Research, Inc. and basic and diluted earnings per share, also exclude unrealized gain (loss) on short-term investments.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Outlook_**\n\nACM has raised its revenue guidance range for fiscal year 2024 to a range of $725 million to $745 million from the prior range of $695 million to $735 million. This expectation is based on ACM management’s current assessment of the continuing impact from international trade policy, together with various expected spending scenarios of key customers, supply chain constraints, and the timing of acceptances for first tools under evaluation in the field, among other factors.\n\n**_Operating Highlights and Recent Announcements_**\n\n  * **Shipments.** Total shipments in the third quarter of 2024 were $261 million, up 23% from the third quarter of 2023. Total shipments include deliveries for revenue in the quarter and deliveries of first tool systems awaiting customer acceptance for potential revenue in future quarters.\n\n\n  * **Major Performance Breakthrough for Flagship Ultra C Tahoe Cleaning Tool**. The upgraded Ultra C Tahoe now achieves the performance of standalone single-wafer cleaning tools on low-to-medium temperature sulfuric peroxide mix (SPM) processes. The hybrid architecture delivers enhanced cleaning performance, high throughput, and process flexibility, with an up to 75% reduction in chemical consumption. The upgraded Ultra C Tahoe is now in production at several high-volume customer facilities in mainland China. Additional logic and memory customers are evaluating the tool, and we expect to deliver additional units through the end 2024.\n  * **Launched Ultra C bev-p Panel Bevel Etching Tool for Panel-Level Packaging Applications.** The new tool is specifically designed for bevel etching and cleaning in copper-related processes and is capable of handling both the front and back side etching within a single system. This capability enhances process efficiency and product reliability.\n  * **Received Orders for Wafer-Level Packaging Tools from U.S. Customer and R &D Center.** ACM has received purchase orders for four wafer-level packaging tools, including two from a U.S.-based customer and two from a U.S.-based research and development (R&D) center. The four tools support a range of advanced packaging processes and are scheduled for delivery in the first half of 2025.\n  * **Completed Purchase of Commercial Facility in Oregon.** On October 1, 2024, ACM completed the purchase of a 39,500 square foot facility, including a 5,200 square foot functional clean room. This facility is intended to augment ACM’s current Oregon facility and further expand ACM’s R&D and demonstration capability in the U.S. market.\n\n\n  * **Opening of R &D and Production Facility**. On October 20, 2024, ACM Shanghai celebrated the official opening of its new R&D and production facility in Lingang, China.\n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Summary_**\n\n_Unless otherwise noted, the following figures refer to the third quarter of 2024 and comparisons are with the third quarter of 2023._\n\n  * **Revenue** was $204.0 million, up 21%, reflecting higher sales of single wafer cleaning, Tahoe and semi-critical cleaning equipment and ECP (front-end and packaging), furnace and other technologies, partly offset by lower sales of advanced packaging (excluding ECP), services & spares.\n  * **Gross margin** was 51.4% versus 52.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 51.6% versus 52.9%. Gross margin exceeded ACM’s long-term business model range of 40% to 45%. ACM expects gross margin to vary from period to period due to a variety of factors, such as product mix, currency impacts and sales volume.\n  * **Operating expenses** were $60.7 million, an increase of 10%. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 29.7% from 32.8%. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude the effect of stock-based compensation, were $49.2 million, up 8.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 24.1% from 26.9%.\n  * **Operating income** was $44.2 million, compared to $33.2 million. Operating margin was 21.7% compared to 19.7%. Non-GAAP operating income, which excludes the effect of stock-based compensation, was $56.1 million, compared to $43.8 million. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation, was 27.5% compared to 26.0%.\n  * **Unrealized gain (loss) on short-term investments** was $0.4 million, compared to an unrealized gain (loss) of $(1.3) million. Unrealized gain (loss) reflects the change in market value of the investments by ACM’s principal operating subsidiary, ACM Research (Shanghai), Inc. The value is marked-to-market quarterly and is excluded in the non-GAAP financial metrics.\n  * **Income tax expense** was $4.0 million, compared to $0.7 million.\n  * **Net income attributable to ACM Research, Inc.** was $30.9 million, compared to $25.7 million. Non-GAAP net income attributable to ACM Research, Inc., which excludes the effect of stock-based compensation and unrealized gain (loss) on short-term investments, was $42.4 million, compared to $37.6 million.\n  * **Net income per diluted share attributable to ACM Research, Inc.** was $0.45, compared to $0.39. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which excludes the effect of stock-based compensation and unrealized gain (loss) on short-term investments, was $0.63, compared to $0.57.\n  * **Cash and cash equivalents,** plus restricted cash and short-term and long-term time deposits were $369.1 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $366.8 million at June 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**_Conference Call Details_**\n\nA conference call to discuss results will be held on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 p.m. China Time).

These supplemental measures exclude the impact of stock-based compensation, which ACM does not believe is indicative of its core operating results. In addition, non-GAAP net income attributable to ACM Research, Inc. and basic and diluted earnings per share exclude the effect of stock-based compensation and unrealized gain (loss) on short-term investments, which ACM also believes are not indicative of its core operating results. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below under “Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n\nACM believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in assessing its operating performance. ACM uses these financial measures internally to evaluate its operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Financial analysts may focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on the non-GAAP financial measures. ACM also believes it is in the best interests of investors for ACM to provide this non-GAAP information.\n\nWhile ACM believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be reported by competitors, and they may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in calculation methodologies. The non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to GAAP information and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures. They should be used only as a supplement to GAAP information and should be considered only in conjunction with ACM’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\nCertain statements contained in this press release are not historical facts and may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “plans,” “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “designed,” and similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on ACM management’s current expectations and beliefs, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied by the forward-looking statements. A description of certain of these risks, uncertainties and other matters can be found in filings ACM makes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are available at www.sec.gov. Because forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual results and events may differ materially from results and events currently expected by ACM. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. ACM undertakes no obligation to publicly update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof or to reflect any change in its expectations with regard to these forward-looking statements or the occurrence of unanticipated events.\n\n**_About ACM Research, Inc._** ACM develops, manufactures and sells semiconductor process equipment for single-wafer or batch wet cleaning, electroplating, stress-free polishing, vertical furnace processes, Track and PECVD, which are critical to advanced semiconductor device manufacturing and wafer-level packaging.

The resulting enhancements are designed to meet demanding technical requirements of advanced nodes for foundry, logic and memory applications.\n\nThe Ultra C Tahoe now achieves the performance of standalone single-wafer cleaning tools on low-to-medium temperature sulfuric peroxide mix (SPM) processes. Tahoe’s patented hybrid architecture is among the first in the industry to combine batch wafer processing and single wafer cleaning chambers into the same SPM tool. The hybrid architecture delivers enhanced cleaning performance, high throughput, and process flexibility, with up to 75% reduction in chemical consumption. ACM estimates cost savings of up to $500,000 per year from sulfuric acid alone, with additional environmental and cost benefits from reduced sulfuric acid treatment and disposal.\n\n“With the rise of AI to the forefront of consumers’ minds, we expect increased public attention on the environmental impact of semiconductor chip manufacturing. We believe ACM’s Ultra C Tahoe is well-positioned to help customers increase production of advanced AI chips, but with a reduced footprint on the environment,” said Dr. David Wang, ACM’s President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n“We believe the Ultra C Tahoe is another example of excellence from ACM’s innovative and world-class R&D team,” Dr. Wang added. “We believe the Tahoe platform is well-positioned to capture market share within the SPM market, particularly in middle and low-temperature applications, which believe represents an estimated 20% of the total clean market.”\n\nThe upgraded Ultra C Tahoe is now in production at several high-volume customer facilities in mainland China. Additional logic and memory customers are evaluating the tool, and we expect to deliver additional production units through the end of 2024. \n\n**New Features and Benefits of the Upgraded Ultra C Tahoe Tool:**\n\n  * **Enhanced Particle Removal:** The Tahoe platform’s advanced cleaning capabilities have achieved average particle counts of less than 6 particles at 26nm, meeting the stringent requirements for advanced node manufacturing. The tool is also capable of removing 1x nm particles for the most advanced logic and memory applications, with the addition of a smaller particle filtering system.\n  * **Higher Throughput:** The upgraded 25-slot bench module (previously 13 slots) and nine single-wafer chambers (upgraded from eight) now deliver throughput exceeding 200 wafers per hour, comparable to the capacity of a 12-chamber SPM system.\n  * **Environmental and Cost Benefits:** With a reduction of up to 75% in sulfuric acid consumption, the Ultra C Tahoe aligns with environmental regulations and sustainability goals, reducing costs for high-volume manufacturers.\n  * **Expanded Process Capabilities:** Qualified for more than 30 production layers, including key loops such as lightly-doped drain (LDD) and source/drain (SD), with additional layers and applications currently in development.\n  * **Advanced Flexibility in Single-Wafer Cleaning:** Optional configurations include new jet spray technology, ACM’s patented SAPS/TEBO technologies, and HOT IPA drying technology, increasing the tool’s versatility across multiple process applications.\n\n\n\n**Visit ACM at SEMICON Europa**\n\nTo learn more about the upgraded Ultra C Tahoe platform, please visit us at SEMICON Europa, booth C2265, from November 12-15, 2024, in Munich, Germany, or explore our [website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=v56Ll0dfrTYiM4I8CjSNxh2ReYoRtrNoXJO1KlJ6cEIGVJ48TTzWKinWluS5zRTkD5rfYlnTwjryj4nTmHDmJY8-jZ3M0k-lfQetTS0nDw0JP2B_I755bN431G77G6JCtI7Xd9NdFahdeznXP9YdRQ==).\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nCertain statements contained in this press release are not historical facts and may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Today’s release coincides with the as-scheduled release of unaudited financial results by ACM Research (Shanghai), Inc., ACM’s principal operating subsidiary (“ACM Shanghai”), to the Shanghai Stock Exchange website [[link to China Disclosure](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0c11gQG87Jqp0pMRPkP3maaeS_dSAUW1zwhcrzu2XNPzwIATFDLRSPVVl0FtC1wI58mzpGCimfnwthe2ggYy321cR3a2M_PGE-oTy-uX4wlHakZW11BcbxHevm38fEXhjMF5VMkm-dzwyWAxwCwVQhV37cceAD6OgzwM5-CAtb3hyRN1ZNFEyS7rYx1Mwr6rMR_yr0cgFGeTL-_lClsiFg==)].\n\nACM will discuss its full financial results for the third quarter 2024 and its revenue outlook for the remainder of the year on its earnings call on Thursday, November 7, 2024, at 8 a.m. Eastern Time (9 p.m. China Time).\n\nACM announces the following:\n\n  * preliminary unaudited revenue for the third quarter of 2024 is expected to be in the range of $200 million to $203 million, which would represent year-to-year growth of 19% to 20%.\n  * preliminary total shipments are expected to be in the range of $245 million to $255 million, which would represent year-to-year growth of 15% to 19%.\n\n\n\nActual unaudited third quarter 2024 results are subject to the completion of ACM’s quarter end closing procedures and review by ACM’s independent registered public accounting firm.\n\nACM currently owns an 82.0% equity interest in ACM Shanghai, and a substantial majority of ACM’s consolidated revenue and net income is contributed by ACM Shanghai. The stand-alone financial results of ACM Shanghai are reported in RMB as prepared in accordance with Chinese generally accepted accounting principles, and those results will differ, potentially materially, from ACM’s consolidated revenue and net profit for the period, which will reflect additional financial and operational items and will be prepared in U.S. dollars in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n**About ACM Research, Inc.**\n\nACM develops, manufactures and sells semiconductor process equipment for single-wafer or batch wet cleaning, electroplating, stress-free polishing, vertical furnace processes, Track and PECVD, which are critical to advanced semiconductor device manufacturing and wafer-level packaging.
