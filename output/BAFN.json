Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results; Third Quarter Net Income Increased 31.3% Over Prior Quarter\n\nOctober 24, 2024\n\nDownload(opens in new window)\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BayFirst Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: BAFN) (“BayFirst” or the “Company”), parent company of BayFirst National Bank (the “Bank”) today reported net income of $1.1 million, or $0.18 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 31.3% compared to $0.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n“The highlight of the third quarter of 2024 was the 31% increase in net income compared to the preceding quarter, led by increases in net interest income and higher gain on sale of government guaranteed loans,” stated Thomas G. Zernick, Chief Executive Officer. “Our Government Guaranteed Lending team had another good quarter, producing $94.4 million in new government guaranteed loans; however, this volume was below both the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. Our team is focused on meeting loan origination targets, while also adhering to prudently conservative credit quality metrics. The result of these efforts is better profitability reflected in lower net charge-offs, lower expenses compared to the third quarter last year, and faster revenue growth than expense growth compared to the second quarter of this year. While we made progress this quarter, we have much more work to do to improve profitability and consistently demonstrate high performing characteristics.”\n\n“Our community bank business model, which includes serving individuals, families and small businesses, continues to build franchise value in our great community bank in Tampa Bay,” Zernick continued. “We were honored to be named the best bank in Florida in 2024 by Forbes Magazine which is a testament to our incredible customers and employees.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Performance Review**\n\n  * The Company’s government guaranteed loan origination team originated $94.4 million in new government guaranteed loans during the third quarter of 2024, a slight decrease from $98.7 million of loans produced in the previous quarter, and a decrease from $155.9 million of loans produced during the third quarter of 2023. Demand was down in the third quarter for the Company's Bolt loan program, an SBA 7(a) loan product designed to expeditiously provide working capital loans of $150 thousand or less to businesses throughout the country while the Bank's Core SBA 7(a) loan program had $9 million of higher production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and $5 million higher production compared to the third quarter of 2023. As we mentioned earlier this year, we have taken proactive steps to strengthen the credit characteristics of this business which has contributed to the decrease in origination of Bolt loans; however, the volume is still significant compared to the SBA 7(a) small loans originated by our peers. Since the launch in 2022, the Company has originated 5,231 Bolt loans totaling $676.6 million, of which 502 Bolt loans totaling $65.2 million were originated during the quarter.\n  * Loans held for investment increased by $34.1 million, or 3.4%, during the third quarter of 2024 to $1.04 billion and increased $164.0 million, or 18.7%, over the past year. During the quarter, the Company originated $166.7 million of loans and sold $84.0 million of government guaranteed loan balances. The majority of the loan growth was to individuals and businesses across the Tampa Bay and Sarasota regions.\n  * Deposits increased $69.8 million, or 6.7%, during the third quarter of 2024 and increased $94.4 million, or 9.3%, over the past year to $1.11 billion.\n  * Book value and tangible book value at September 30, 2024 were $20.86 per common share, an increase from $20.54 at June 30, 2024.\n  * Net interest margin decreased by 9 basis points to 3.34% in the third quarter of 2024, from 3.43% in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was attributable to a one-time unamortized premium recognition related to a purchased USDA loan which prepaid during the quarter. Excluding this item, the net interest margin would have been down 1 basis point compared to the second quarter.\n\n\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**Net Income**\n\nNet income was $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.9 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net income for the third quarter of 2024 from the preceding quarter was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income of $0.3 million and an increase in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $0.5 million partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $0.5 million. The decrease in net income from the third quarter of 2023 was due to a decrease in government guaranteed loan fair value gains of $1.1 million and a decrease in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $1.0 million, partially offset by an increase in net interest income of $1.1 million and lower compensation expense of $0.3 million.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, net income was $2.8 million, a decrease from $4.0 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to higher provision for credit losses of $2.5 million, a decrease in government guaranteed fair value gains of $1.1 million, and higher noninterest expense of $2.2 million, partially offset by higher gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $2.3 million and higher government guaranteed loan packaging fees of $1.3 million.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income from continuing operations was $9.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase from $9.2 million during the second quarter of 2024, and an increase from $8.4 million during the third quarter of 2023. The net interest margin decreased by 9 basis points to 3.34% in the third quarter of 2024, from 3.43% in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe increase in net interest income from continuing operations during the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the second quarter of 2024, was mainly due to an increase in loan interest income, including fees, of $1.0 million and a decrease in the interest cost on borrowings of $0.4 million, partially offset by higher interest cost on deposits of $1.2 million. The increase was partially offset by $0.3 million due to a one-time recognition of unamortized premium related to a purchased USDA government guaranteed loan which prepaid during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThe increase in net interest income from continuing operations during the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the year ago quarter, was mainly due to an increase in interest income of $3.8 million, partially offset by higher interest expense on deposits.\n\nNet interest income from continuing operations was $27.4 million in the first nine months of 2024, a decrease from $27.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to an increase in interest expense of $11.6 million, partially offset by an increase in interest income, including fees, of $11.4 million.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nNoninterest income from continuing operations was $12.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, which was an increase from $11.7 million in the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease from $14.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the second quarter of 2024, was primarily the result of an increase in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $0.5 million. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023, was the result of decreases in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $1.0 million, fair value gains on government guaranteed loans of $1.1 million, government guaranteed loan packaging fees of $0.3 million, and other noninterest income of $0.2 million.\n\nNoninterest income from continuing operations was $38.2 million for the first nine months of 2024, which was an increase from $35.1 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily the result of increases in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $2.3 million and government guaranteed loan packaging fees of $1.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in fair value gains on government guaranteed loans of $1.1 million.\n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense from continuing operations was $17.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $16.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $17.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the prior quarter, was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of $0.5 million. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023, was primarily due to lower compensation expense of $0.3 million and lower marketing and business development expenses of $0.4 million, partially offset by higher data processing expenses of $0.3 million.\n\nNoninterest expense from continuing operations was $51.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to $49.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase was the result of increases in data processing expense of $0.8 million, loan origination and collection expense of $0.9 million, professional services expenses of $0.5 million, and other noninterest expenses of $0.6 million. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business development expenses of $1.0 million.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n**Assets**\n\nTotal assets increased $27.2 million, or 2.2%, during the third quarter of 2024 to $1.25 billion, mainly due to an increase of $34.1 million in loans held for investment. Compared to the third quarter last year, total assets increased $111.1 million, or 9.8%, driven by growth of loans held for investment of $164.0 million, or 18.7%, offset by lower excess cash and cash equivalents of $48.2 million, or 42.8%, from the year ago quarter.\n\n**Loans**\n\nLoans held for investment increased $34.1 million, or 3.4%, during the third quarter of 2024 and $164.0 million, or 18.7%, over the past year to $1.04 billion, due to originations in both conventional community bank loans and government guaranteed loans, partially offset by government guaranteed loan sales.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nDeposits increased $69.8 million, or 6.7%, during the third quarter of 2024 and increased $94.4 million, or 9.3%, from the third quarter of 2023, ending the third quarter of 2024 at $1.11 billion. During the third quarter, there were increases in noninterest-bearing deposit account balances of $2.0 million, interest-bearing transaction account balances of $11.5 million, savings and money market deposit account balances of $35.0 million and time deposit balances of $21.4 million. The majority of the deposits are generated through the community bank. At September 30, 2024, approximately 78% of total deposits were insured by the FDIC. At times, the Bank has brokered time deposit and non-maturity deposit relationships available to diversify its funding sources. At September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, the Company had $76.9 million, $60.1 million, and $0.2 million, respectively, of brokered deposits.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses in the third quarter of $3.1 million, compared to provisions of $3.0 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $3.0 million during the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe ratio of ACL to total loans held for investment at amortized cost was 1.48% at September 30, 2024, 1.50% as of June 30, 2024, and 1.68% as of September 30, 2023. The ratio of ACL to total loans held for investment at amortized cost, excluding government guaranteed loan balances, was 1.70% at September 30, 2024, 1.73% as of June 30, 2024, and 2.03% as of September 30, 2023.\n\nNet charge-offs for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.8 million, which was a decrease from $3.3 million for the second quarter of 2024 and an increase from $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans held for investment at amortized cost were 1.16% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.45% in the second quarter of 2024 and 1.13% in the third quarter of 2023. Nonperforming assets to total assets were 1.38% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1.28% as of June 30, 2024, and 0.88% as of September 30, 2023. Nonperforming assets, excluding government guaranteed loan balances, to total assets were 0.88% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 0.82% as of June 30, 2024, and 0.71% as of September 30, 2023. As we discussed last quarter, the Bank developed an express modification program for SBA 7(a) borrowers to help those borrowers who are challenged with larger payments in the higher interest rate environment compared to interest rates at the time the loans were originated. To date 400 SBA 7(a) borrowers have been offered loan modification options. These efforts have helped and are expected to continue to help reduce net charge-offs.\n\n**Capital**\n\nThe Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.41% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 8.73% as of June 30, 2024, and 9.16% as of September 30, 2023. The CET 1 and Tier 1 capital ratio to risk-weighted assets were 10.14% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 10.54% as of June 30, 2024, and 12.21% as of September 30, 2023. The total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 11.39% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 11.79% as of June 30, 2024, and 13.47% as of September 30, 2023.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nThe Bank's overall liquidity position remains strong and stable with liquidity in excess of internal minimums as stated by policy and monitored by management and the Board. The on-balance sheet liquidity ratio at September 30, 2024 was 8.62%, as compared to 9.33% at December 31, 2023. The Bank has robust liquidity resources which include secured borrowings available from the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Reserve, and lines of credit with other financial institutions. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had $10.0 million of borrowings from the FHLB and no borrowings from the FRB or other financial institutions. This compares to $55.0 million and $10.0 million of borrowings from the FHLB and no borrowings from the FRB or other financial institutions at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\n**Recent Events**\n\n**Fourth Quarter Common Stock Dividend.** On October 22, 2024, BayFirst’s Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2024 cash dividend of $0.08 per common share. The dividend will be payable December 15, 2024 to common shareholders of record as of December 1, 2024.

PETERSBURG, Fla. (September 5, 2024) –** St. Petersburg-based community bank BayFirst is proud to announce that it has been named one of America’s Best-In-State Banks for 2024 by Forbes, coming in No. 1 in the state of Florida. This prestigious Best-In-State Bank award is presented by ForbesandStatistaInc.,theworld-leadingstatisticsportalandindustryrankingprovider,andwasgiven to only 185 banks in the entire country.\n\nWinning banks were selected for fulfilling the unique financial needs and expectations of their local communities thereby being the most valued by residents of each state. The ranking is based on two sources:\n\n  1. **_An Independent Survey_** : Approximately 26,000 U.S. residents were surveyed online. Participantswereaskedtonameallbankswheretheyhaveachecking/savingsaccountand rate it in six different subdimensions: Trust, Terms & Conditions, Branch Services, Digital Services, Customer Services, and Financial Advice.\n  2. **_Publicly Available Reviews_** : For each bank, in each state, a sentiment analysis approach of publicly available online text reviews and ratings was applied.\n\n\n\nIn each state, banks with branches in fewer than 15 U.S. states were ranked, and the banks with the highest combined score from the analysis of survey results and publicly available reviews were awarded. The survey score was weighted 80% and publicly available reviews were weighted 20%.

Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results; Third Quarter Net Income Increased 31.3% Over Prior Quarter\n\nOctober 24, 2024\n\nDownload(opens in new window)\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BayFirst Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: BAFN) (“BayFirst” or the “Company”), parent company of BayFirst National Bank (the “Bank”) today reported net income of $1.1 million, or $0.18 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 31.3% compared to $0.9 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n“The highlight of the third quarter of 2024 was the 31% increase in net income compared to the preceding quarter, led by increases in net interest income and higher gain on sale of government guaranteed loans,” stated Thomas G. Zernick, Chief Executive Officer. “Our Government Guaranteed Lending team had another good quarter, producing $94.4 million in new government guaranteed loans; however, this volume was below both the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. Our team is focused on meeting loan origination targets, while also adhering to prudently conservative credit quality metrics. The result of these efforts is better profitability reflected in lower net charge-offs, lower expenses compared to the third quarter last year, and faster revenue growth than expense growth compared to the second quarter of this year. While we made progress this quarter, we have much more work to do to improve profitability and consistently demonstrate high performing characteristics.”\n\n“Our community bank business model, which includes serving individuals, families and small businesses, continues to build franchise value in our great community bank in Tampa Bay,” Zernick continued. “We were honored to be named the best bank in Florida in 2024 by Forbes Magazine which is a testament to our incredible customers and employees.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Performance Review**\n\n  * The Company’s government guaranteed loan origination team originated $94.4 million in new government guaranteed loans during the third quarter of 2024, a slight decrease from $98.7 million of loans produced in the previous quarter, and a decrease from $155.9 million of loans produced during the third quarter of 2023. Demand was down in the third quarter for the Company's Bolt loan program, an SBA 7(a) loan product designed to expeditiously provide working capital loans of $150 thousand or less to businesses throughout the country while the Bank's Core SBA 7(a) loan program had $9 million of higher production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and $5 million higher production compared to the third quarter of 2023. As we mentioned earlier this year, we have taken proactive steps to strengthen the credit characteristics of this business which has contributed to the decrease in origination of Bolt loans; however, the volume is still significant compared to the SBA 7(a) small loans originated by our peers. Since the launch in 2022, the Company has originated 5,231 Bolt loans totaling $676.6 million, of which 502 Bolt loans totaling $65.2 million were originated during the quarter.\n  * Loans held for investment increased by $34.1 million, or 3.4%, during the third quarter of 2024 to $1.04 billion and increased $164.0 million, or 18.7%, over the past year. During the quarter, the Company originated $166.7 million of loans and sold $84.0 million of government guaranteed loan balances. The majority of the loan growth was to individuals and businesses across the Tampa Bay and Sarasota regions.\n  * Deposits increased $69.8 million, or 6.7%, during the third quarter of 2024 and increased $94.4 million, or 9.3%, over the past year to $1.11 billion.\n  * Book value and tangible book value at September 30, 2024 were $20.86 per common share, an increase from $20.54 at June 30, 2024.\n  * Net interest margin decreased by 9 basis points to 3.34% in the third quarter of 2024, from 3.43% in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was attributable to a one-time unamortized premium recognition related to a purchased USDA loan which prepaid during the quarter. Excluding this item, the net interest margin would have been down 1 basis point compared to the second quarter.\n\n\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**Net Income**\n\nNet income was $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $0.9 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in net income for the third quarter of 2024 from the preceding quarter was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income of $0.3 million and an increase in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $0.5 million partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $0.5 million. The decrease in net income from the third quarter of 2023 was due to a decrease in government guaranteed loan fair value gains of $1.1 million and a decrease in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $1.0 million, partially offset by an increase in net interest income of $1.1 million and lower compensation expense of $0.3 million.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2024, net income was $2.8 million, a decrease from $4.0 million for the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to higher provision for credit losses of $2.5 million, a decrease in government guaranteed fair value gains of $1.1 million, and higher noninterest expense of $2.2 million, partially offset by higher gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $2.3 million and higher government guaranteed loan packaging fees of $1.3 million.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income from continuing operations was $9.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase from $9.2 million during the second quarter of 2024, and an increase from $8.4 million during the third quarter of 2023. The net interest margin decreased by 9 basis points to 3.34% in the third quarter of 2024, from 3.43% in the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe increase in net interest income from continuing operations during the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the second quarter of 2024, was mainly due to an increase in loan interest income, including fees, of $1.0 million and a decrease in the interest cost on borrowings of $0.4 million, partially offset by higher interest cost on deposits of $1.2 million. The increase was partially offset by $0.3 million due to a one-time recognition of unamortized premium related to a purchased USDA government guaranteed loan which prepaid during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThe increase in net interest income from continuing operations during the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the year ago quarter, was mainly due to an increase in interest income of $3.8 million, partially offset by higher interest expense on deposits.\n\nNet interest income from continuing operations was $27.4 million in the first nine months of 2024, a decrease from $27.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to an increase in interest expense of $11.6 million, partially offset by an increase in interest income, including fees, of $11.4 million.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nNoninterest income from continuing operations was $12.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, which was an increase from $11.7 million in the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease from $14.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the second quarter of 2024, was primarily the result of an increase in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $0.5 million. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023, was the result of decreases in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $1.0 million, fair value gains on government guaranteed loans of $1.1 million, government guaranteed loan packaging fees of $0.3 million, and other noninterest income of $0.2 million.\n\nNoninterest income from continuing operations was $38.2 million for the first nine months of 2024, which was an increase from $35.1 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase was primarily the result of increases in gain on sale of government guaranteed loans of $2.3 million and government guaranteed loan packaging fees of $1.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in fair value gains on government guaranteed loans of $1.1 million.\n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nNoninterest expense from continuing operations was $17.1 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $16.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 and $17.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the prior quarter, was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of $0.5 million. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to the third quarter of 2023, was primarily due to lower compensation expense of $0.3 million and lower marketing and business development expenses of $0.4 million, partially offset by higher data processing expenses of $0.3 million.\n\nNoninterest expense from continuing operations was $51.4 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to $49.2 million for the first nine months of 2023. The increase was the result of increases in data processing expense of $0.8 million, loan origination and collection expense of $0.9 million, professional services expenses of $0.5 million, and other noninterest expenses of $0.6 million. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing and business development expenses of $1.0 million.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\n**Assets**\n\nTotal assets increased $27.2 million, or 2.2%, during the third quarter of 2024 to $1.25 billion, mainly due to an increase of $34.1 million in loans held for investment. Compared to the third quarter last year, total assets increased $111.1 million, or 9.8%, driven by growth of loans held for investment of $164.0 million, or 18.7%, offset by lower excess cash and cash equivalents of $48.2 million, or 42.8%, from the year ago quarter.\n\n**Loans**\n\nLoans held for investment increased $34.1 million, or 3.4%, during the third quarter of 2024 and $164.0 million, or 18.7%, over the past year to $1.04 billion, due to originations in both conventional community bank loans and government guaranteed loans, partially offset by government guaranteed loan sales.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nDeposits increased $69.8 million, or 6.7%, during the third quarter of 2024 and increased $94.4 million, or 9.3%, from the third quarter of 2023, ending the third quarter of 2024 at $1.11 billion. During the third quarter, there were increases in noninterest-bearing deposit account balances of $2.0 million, interest-bearing transaction account balances of $11.5 million, savings and money market deposit account balances of $35.0 million and time deposit balances of $21.4 million. The majority of the deposits are generated through the community bank. At September 30, 2024, approximately 78% of total deposits were insured by the FDIC. At times, the Bank has brokered time deposit and non-maturity deposit relationships available to diversify its funding sources. At September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, the Company had $76.9 million, $60.1 million, and $0.2 million, respectively, of brokered deposits.\n\n**Asset Quality**\n\nThe Company recorded a provision for credit losses in the third quarter of $3.1 million, compared to provisions of $3.0 million for the second quarter of 2024 and $3.0 million during the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe ratio of ACL to total loans held for investment at amortized cost was 1.48% at September 30, 2024, 1.50% as of June 30, 2024, and 1.68% as of September 30, 2023. The ratio of ACL to total loans held for investment at amortized cost, excluding government guaranteed loan balances, was 1.70% at September 30, 2024, 1.73% as of June 30, 2024, and 2.03% as of September 30, 2023.\n\nNet charge-offs for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.8 million, which was a decrease from $3.3 million for the second quarter of 2024 and an increase from $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans held for investment at amortized cost were 1.16% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 1.45% in the second quarter of 2024 and 1.13% in the third quarter of 2023. Nonperforming assets to total assets were 1.38% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 1.28% as of June 30, 2024, and 0.88% as of September 30, 2023. Nonperforming assets, excluding government guaranteed loan balances, to total assets were 0.88% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 0.82% as of June 30, 2024, and 0.71% as of September 30, 2023. As we discussed last quarter, the Bank developed an express modification program for SBA 7(a) borrowers to help those borrowers who are challenged with larger payments in the higher interest rate environment compared to interest rates at the time the loans were originated. To date 400 SBA 7(a) borrowers have been offered loan modification options. These efforts have helped and are expected to continue to help reduce net charge-offs.\n\n**Capital**\n\nThe Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 8.41% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 8.73% as of June 30, 2024, and 9.16% as of September 30, 2023. The CET 1 and Tier 1 capital ratio to risk-weighted assets were 10.14% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 10.54% as of June 30, 2024, and 12.21% as of September 30, 2023. The total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio was 11.39% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 11.79% as of June 30, 2024, and 13.47% as of September 30, 2023.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nThe Bank's overall liquidity position remains strong and stable with liquidity in excess of internal minimums as stated by policy and monitored by management and the Board. The on-balance sheet liquidity ratio at September 30, 2024 was 8.62%, as compared to 9.33% at December 31, 2023.

FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 25, 2024\nPresentation\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\nGood morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the BayFirst Financial Corp. Q3 2004 (sic) [ 2024 ]\nConference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. This call is recorded on Friday, October 25, 2024.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Zernick, CEO. Please go ahead.\nThomas G. Zernick\nCEO & Director\nThanks, Dan. Good morning, and thank you for participating on our call today. I have with me Robin\nOliver, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and our CFO, Scott McKim.\nToday's call will include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to our\ncautionary statement on forward-looking statements contained on Page 2 of the investor presentation.\nThe past month has provided an unprecedented level of challenges for our Tampa Bay community, our\ncustomers and our team members. After 2 very destructive hurricanes over a 2-week period, our bank\ndemonstrated a very high level of resiliency built on solid planning and preparation.\nOur people and facilities were tested by severe flooding, extreme wind in over 20 inches of rainfall.\nEven with those impacts, our full branch network was up and running within 2 business days after each\nhurricane. We continued to fund loans and our heart of the house operations teams never stopped\nworking. Today, we are actively engaged with our customers to support their immediate needs.\nI want to personally thank all of our employees many of whom lost their homes, belongings or vehicles\nwho have maintained a level of service and commitment, which makes BayFirst the Premier Community\nBank of Tampa Bank.\nDuring the third quarter, we produced net income of $1.1 million. This represents a 31% increase over Q2\n'24 with earnings of $900,000. Net income increased due to higher net interest income and higher revenue\nfrom servicing income and gains on sales of $0.5 million quarter-over-quarter.\nLet me now share some highlights from around BayFirst. Our convenient and attractive network of 12\nbanking centers grew deposit balances 13% and net new accounts 11% year-to-date ending the quarter\nat $1.11 billion.\nBayFirst has maintained a granular deposit base and continues to benefit from 78% of deposits being\ninsured on September 30, 2024. In fact, our total number of households exceeds 24,500. On the lending\nside, BayFirst continues to enjoy minimal commercial exposure in the CRE space with nonowner-occupied\nCRE, representing only 6.3% of our loans held for investment at the end of the quarter. Loans held for\ninvestment increased by $34 million or 3% during the third quarter of 2024 to $1.04 billion.\nThe company's government-guaranteed loan origination platform originated $94.4 million in new\ngovernment guaranteed loans during the third quarter of 2024, a slight decrease from $98.7 million of\nloans produced in the previous quarter and a 39% decrease from $155.9 million of loans produced during\nthe third quarter of 2023.\nThe company's Bolt loan program is an SBA 7(a) loan product designed to expeditiously provide working\ncapital loans of $150,000 or less to businesses throughout the country. Since the launch of this product\nin 2022, the company has originated 5,231 Bolt loans totaling $676.6 million, of which 502 Bolt loans\ntotaling $65.2 million were originated during the third quarter.\nDuring the quarter, the company originated $160 million (sic) [ $166.7 million ] of loans and sold $84\nmillion of government guaranteed loan balances. I'm also pleased to announce that BayFirst finished the\nSBA fiscal year as the #5 lender by units in the United States by approving 3,187 loans for $508 million.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 3\nBAYFIRST FINANCIAL CORP. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 25, 2024\nOur commitment to building a strong community bank continues to be reinforced by the recent hiring\nof a Director of Business Banking, who will focus on the banking needs, including deposits and treasury\nmanagement services for small businesses across our Tampa Bay footprint. Furthermore, we added\nanother dedicated commercial lender during Q3 to manage the lending needs of these small businesses.\nFinally, I am excited to share that our bank was ranked the top bank in Florida by Forbes Magazine for\n2024. This is a humbling achievement, and I am very proud of our team for this accomplishment and want\nto thank all of our customers who voted for this recognition.\nNow I will pass the microphone on to Scott McKim, our CFO, to provide an overview of our financial\nperformance.\nScott J. McKim\nExecutive VP & CFO\nThank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned, our net income was $1.1 million in the\nthird quarter and balances of loans held for investment grew $34 million or 3% during the quarter and\noverall total assets increased $27 million to $1.25 billion or 2% during the quarter. Year-over-year, total\nassets have increased by $111 million or 10%. Total deposits increased by $69.8 million or 7% during the\nthird quarter of this year and increased by $94 million from the third quarter of 2023. Total deposits ended\nthe quarter at $1.1 billion.\nShareholders' equity at the end of the quarter was $102.3 million and is $8.1 million higher than the end\nof the third quarter of 2023. We also had a sizable decrease in accumulated other comprehensive losses of\n$801,000 during the quarter and our tangible book value increased to $20.86 per share from $20.54 per\nshare at the end of the second quarter.\nNet interest income was $9.4 million in the third quarter, up $300,000 or 3% compared to the second\nquarter and up $1.1 million from the year ago quarter. Net interest margin decreased 9 basis points from\nthe second quarter. However, this decrease is mostly from a onetime recognition of unamortized premium\non a purchased USDA government-guaranteed loan, which prepaid during the quarter. Excluding this\nonetime event, the net interest margin would have decreased by only 1 basis point in the third quarter.\nNoninterest income was $12.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, up $570,000, reflecting higher gains\non sale of government-guaranteed loans. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest income was\ndown $2.4 million, reflecting lower gain on sale proceeds as the bank's salable SBA 7(a) loan volume was\ndown 39% compared to the third quarter of last year, as Tom had mentioned.\nNoninterest expense increased slightly by $400,000 in the third quarter due to an increase in bonus\ncommissions and incentive compensation. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, noninterest expense is\n$400,000 lower driven by lower marketing expenses and nondeferrable loan origination costs as well as\nbonus commission and other incentive compensation, all of which are offset by higher loan origination and\ncollection costs during the quarter.\nOur provision for credit losses was $3.1 million in the third quarter compared to $3.3 million in the second\nquarter and also $3 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs decreased by $500,000, primarily\nfrom lower charge-offs on unguaranteed SBA 7(a) loan balances. The ratio of allowance for credit losses\nto total loans held for investment at amortized costs was relatively flat for the quarter compared to last\nquarter, sitting at 1.48% as of September 30 and 1.50% at June 30, 2024, and 1.68% as of September\n30, 2023. Robin will talk about how our efforts to actively manage our SBA 7(a) portfolio have positively\nimpacted net charge-offs over the past 2 quarters.\nOur portfolio of unsecured consumer loans purchased from a third party generated $305,000 worth of net\ncharge-offs during the quarter and that is down $300,000 from second quarter, a very positive impact on\nthis portfolio. As we have previously mentioned, the unsecured consumer loan exposure continues to pay\ndown and as expected, its impact on net charge-offs continued to dissipate.\nAt this time, I'll turn things over to Robin for more discussion.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nBAYFIRST FINANCIAL CORP. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 25, 2024\nRobin L. Oliver\nPresident & COO\nThank you, Scott. I will further delve into credit quality as it is a key focus for us, particularly given the\nnature of our SBA portfolio. The vast majority of our SBA loans are tied to prime adjusting quarterly and\nas such, many of our borrowers have seen significant increases in their payments over the past 2 years at\nthe same time, they are dealing with higher inflation.\nTo try to help these small businesses survive and mitigate loan losses, as we disclosed last quarter,\nthe bank developed an express modification program for SBA 7(a) borrowers at the end of Q2 to help\nborrowers who are struggling to make their payments. To date, 400 SBA 7(a) loans have been modified\nto lower their payments by extending their maturity dates. These continued efforts helped reduce net\ncharge-offs during the quarter and provided welcome relief to these small businesses.\nAnnualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans held for investment at amortized costs were\n1.16% for the third quarter of 2024 down from 1.45% in the second quarter and up slightly from 1.13%\nin the third quarter of '23. Nonperforming assets to total assets were 1.38% as of September 30, '24\ncompared to 1.28% as of June 30 and up from 0.88% as of September 30, 2023, with the increase this\nquarter largely being driven by 2 larger loans. We will continue to monitor our portfolio closely and actively\nwork with struggling borrowers to help them get back on track, and we believe a decline in interest rates\nin the near term will be a benefit to our credit quality as well as a boost to production.\nSwitching gears, I'd also like to comment briefly on some key operational initiatives. As we've discussed\nin prior quarters, our loan origination platform called PowerLOS is a key tool for BayFirst and is currently\nused to originate our high-volume bulk loan product. PowerLOS is continually being enhanced with new\nfunctionality to make the loan origination process faster and more efficient as well as a better experience\nfor our borrowers and referral partners. Just this week, we upgraded the customer-facing part of this\nplatform with a better and more efficient enhancement that will allow us to scale our process even further.\nIn addition, we are working to get all other commercial loan products into this origination platform before\nthe end of the year to further maximize our teams and reduce processing costs.\nBesides PowerLOS, there are several other initiatives that are in progress that are designed to increase\nour efficiency, lower costs and maximize the investments we've already made in technology and in our\nbanking centers. As we've said in the past, we are actively working to make continual progress to improve\nour earnings and our efficiency ratio. While we are pleased with the progress this quarter, we are excited\nfor many of these initiatives to come to fruition to further boost our results and keep our progress moving\nup into the right.\nAt this time, I will turn it back to Tom for any final comments.\nThomas G. Zernick\nCEO & Director\nThank you, Robin, and thanks again to all of you for joining our call this morning, and management looks\nforward to continuing to build the strongest community bank franchise in Tampa Bay. Have a great day.\nAnd at this time, I will open it up for questions.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nBAYFIRST FINANCIAL CORP. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 25, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ross Haberman of Rlh Investments.\nRoss Haberman\nRlh Investments, LLC\nI'm sorry, I got on a bit late. Could you address, if you had and I apologize, your exposure to the recent\nstorms and what is your exposure if you had much.\nThomas G. Zernick\nCEO & Director\nRoss, this is Tom Zernick. Obviously, we have a significant consumer loan base here in the Tampa Bay\nmarket as well as a number of SBA and conventional clients. We have had a chance to do outreach to all\nof them, offering them deferral et cetera, if they need them. So we've been very proactive on it, and we\nexpect to be able to support them in any way we can. And I think giving them a much needed deferral at\nthis point if their businesses were impacted or their house was impacted, we will continue to work with\nboth the consumer product line as well as our business loan product.\nRoss Haberman\nRlh Investments, LLC\nHave you put a dollar amount on what your total exposure is?\nScott J. McKim\nExecutive VP & CFO\nRoss, I would tell you, at this point, I don't really have a number to put on it. As Tom mentioned, we've\nbeen pretty proactive as far as working with people and there's -- there are requests for, \"hey, I need a\nlittle bit of relief,\" but there's also a lot of people saying, \"I was prepared. And going forward, we're going\nto be -- we'll be okay.\" So we are about -- gosh, maybe close to 3 weeks from hurricane #2. And there is\n-- the cleanup efforts are underway, and I think we'll have a better read on that going forward. But right\nnow, it's a little bit difficult just to put a dollar figure around it.\nRobin L. Oliver\nPresident & COO\nAnd I would add that our products are -- if it's a home equity loan, for example, in a flood zone, I mean\nthere is adequate insurance on our businesses and our consumer products inside any of these blood\nzones. So -- and businesses are getting back up and running more quickly than you might imagine on\nsome of these barrier islands. So I think, hopefully, there's more of just a short-term stock gap that we\nmay need to provide certain individuals or businesses.\nBut we do expect this area to come back quickly, and we are very diligent in making sure that we have the\nproper insurances on all of the properties that secure any of our loans.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Ian Green of Pendragon Capital.\nIan Green\nI'm somewhat new to the -- to understanding your bank. But I was wondering if you could talk a little bit\nabout your preferred stock that's out there. Is that able to be redeemed early? And would it make sense?\nIt seems like it's kind of somewhat high cost. It's not a huge piece of your capital structure, but I was\nwondering if it just -- if it's something that could be cleaned up or you have an idea of cleaning it up.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nBAYFIRST FINANCIAL CORP. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL OCT 25, 2024\nScott J. McKim\nExecutive VP & CFO\nIan, this is Scott. I'll -- let me try to answer those questions for you. So the preferred A is something\nthat we could redeem at this point. The other 2 preferred series had a 3-year no-call attached to it. So\nthe bank cannot initiate or would not initiate any sort of redemption around those 2 preferreds. The\nredemption process redeem them at what the current tangible book value of the stock is. So although\nthe holder has that opportunity for them, they need to make their own decision as to whether or not\neconomically it makes sense for them to do it.\nBut as I mentioned, it's -- the bank does not have any immediate plans on the first series to begin\nredeeming them. Your question is the right one. And I think that ultimately trying to manage that capital\nstack is something that we're looking at both in the short term and in the long term.\nIan Green\nOkay. And a second question, if I could sneak one in, is the net interest margin. It seemed to decline a\nlittle bit quarter-over-quarter. Again, are you seeing an inflection point? Or can you -- how is your balance\nsheet positioned given possibly -- we've already had 50 basis points of short-term reduction and possibly\nanother 25 on the horizon next month. Do you see that you've hit an inflection yet or...\nScott J. McKim\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. Great question as well. The -- just to repeat as far as the third quarter, the 9-basis point reduction\nin our margin basis, 8 points of that was related to a onetime recognition of a premium that we had to\nwrite off on a USDA loan that we sold. And that's not something that we -- that will occur again. And if you\nexclude that, the impact on the margin really was only down 1 basis point from the second quarter to the\nthird quarter. So we're right around the 340 to 345 range as you look at it.\nThe rate decrease that occurred in September and any future rate increases will impact both sides of\nour balance sheet. First and foremost, when a rate change occurs, our variable price consumer loans,\nfor example, HELOCs reprice the next day. The SBA loans that we carry on our balance sheet actually do\nnot reprice until the first calendar day of the following quarter. So with that September change, the rate\ndecrease didn't take it into account until October 1, and any changes that we see in the fourth quarter will\nnot be effective until January 1.\nSo what does that mean in terms of the overall net interest margin? Well, we have some ability to manage\nthe pricing on our deposits on the other side of the balance sheet, and whereas I will not claim that\nwe are discretely match funded, we are working to maintain that both sides of the balance sheet are\ngoing to reprice under similar characteristics. If anything, I'd expect us to have a very small short-term\ncompression of the margin, which should probably, I don't know, take maybe 60 to 90 days to recover\nas we roll through the period. But a lot of that's going to depend on how much and how quickly the Fed\ndecides to reduce interest rates. The good news is we just aren't exposed to large swings one way or the\nother.\nOperator\nThis concludes the question-and-answer session and today's conference. Thank you for attending. You\nmay now disconnect your lines.\nScott J. McKim\nExecutive VP & CFO\nThanks, everyone.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.
