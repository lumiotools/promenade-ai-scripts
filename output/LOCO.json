Today, the brand announces that their Original Pollo Bowl is also priced at $5 through the end of January.\n\nThe Original Pollo Bowl features the brand’s famous citrus-marinated, fire-grilled chopped chicken combined with savory pinto beans, seasoned rice, chopped cilantro, onions, and freshly prepared salsa fresca.\n\n“Customers are making it clear that they’re looking for value,” said El Pollo Loco CEO Liz Williams. “The Taco Tuesday promotion and $5 Original Pollo Bowl are our way of communicating to customers: we hear you; we know you want great food at a good price point; and we’re working hard to deliver on that for you.”\n\nAnother way the brand is meeting customer demand is with the addition of Apple and Google Pay options to the Loco Rewards app. Beginning in December, Loco Rewards Members will have the added convenience of these mobile payment options when placing an order. This new feature is a result of customer service requests along with online and social media comments from fans asking for the additional payment method option.\n\n“If additional deals aren’t reason enough to become a Loco Rewards Member, our loyalty program members will now benefit from an even more convenient and seamless user experience on the app,” said El Pollo Loco CMO Jill Adams. “While Apple and Google Pay have been available in many of our restaurants, it was due time to reward our app users with this added benefit as well.”\n\nThe two tacos for $5 promotion is valid every Tuesday through December 31, 2024, at participating locations. The $5 Original Pollo Bowl promotion will run through January 29, 2025, at all El Pollo Loco locations. Apple and Google Pay options are permanent features that will be added to the Loco Rewards loyalty app in December 2024.\n\n**About El Pollo Loco**El Pollo Loco (Nasdaq: LOCO) is the nation's leading fire-grilled chicken restaurant known for its craveable, flavorful, and better-for-you offerings.

Announces Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\n[PDF Version](/node/12456/pdf)\n\nCOSTA MESA, Calif., Oct. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: LOCO) today announced financial results for the 13-week period ended September 25, 2024.\n\n**Highlights for the third quarter ended September 25, 2024 compared to the third quarter ended September 27, 2023 were as follows:**\n\n  * **Total revenue** was $120.4 million in both periods.\n  * **System-wide comparable restaurant sales****(****1)** increased by 2.7%.\n  * **Income from operations** was $10.1 million compared to $13.7 million.\n  * **Restaurant contribution****(1)** was $16.9 million, or 16.7% of company-operated restaurant revenue, compared to $14.8 million, or 14.4% of company-operated restaurant revenue.\n  * **Net income** was $6.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.2 million, or $0.28 per diluted share.\n  * **Adjusted net income****(1)** was $6.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to $6.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA****(1)** was $15.5 million, compared to $15.0 million.\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n(1) | System-wide comparable restaurant sales, restaurant contribution, adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and are defined under “Definitions of Non-GAAP and other Key Financial Measures” below. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the accompanying financial data. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.  \n---|---  \n  \nLiz Williams, Chief Executive Officer of El Pollo Loco Holdings, Inc., stated, “Our third quarter results reflect yet another step toward capturing the opportunity ahead of us to become the national fire-grilled chicken brand. More specifically, we drove top-line growth through a 2.7% increase in system-wide comparable sales; expanded restaurant-level margins by 230 basis points year-over-year to 16.7%; and continue to make great progress on reducing the cost of our prototype to stimulate future unit growth. As we look ahead, we are pleased with what we have accomplished thus far to develop a strong foundation, and we are well positioned to ignite further growth in 2025 and beyond.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nCompany-operated restaurant revenue in the third quarter of 2024 decreased to $101.2 million, compared to $102.7 million in the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to a $5.3 million decrease related to the 19 company-operated restaurants sold by the Company to existing franchisees during or subsequent to the third quarter of 2023. This company-operated restaurant revenue decrease was partially offset by an increase in company-operated comparable restaurant revenue of $2.7 million, or 2.8%, as well as $0.5 million of additional sales from restaurants opened during or after the third quarter of 2023. The company-operated comparable restaurant sales increase consisted of an 11.3% increase in average check size due to increases in menu prices, partially offset by a 7.6% decrease in transactions.\n\nFranchise revenue in the third quarter of 2024 increased 10.5% to $11.3 million. This increase was primarily due to a franchise comparable restaurant sales increase of 2.7%, three franchise-operated restaurant openings and 19 company-operated restaurants sold by the Company to existing franchisees in each case, during or subsequent to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nIncome from operations in the third quarter of 2024 was $10.1 million, compared to $13.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Restaurant contribution was $16.9 million, or 16.7% of company-operated restaurant revenue, compared to $14.8 million, or 14.4% of company-operated restaurant revenue in the third quarter of 2023. The increase in restaurant contribution as a percentage of company-operated restaurant revenue was largely due to higher menu prices combined with better operating efficiencies.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2024 was $11.4 million, compared to $9.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due primarily to a $1.9 million increase in labor-related costs, primarily related to an increase in estimated management bonus expense and a $0.4 million increase in other general and administrative expenses.\n\nNet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $6.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net income of $9.2 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income was $6.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2024, compared to $6.4 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, during the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAs of September 25, 2024, after pay downs of $11.0 million on its five-year senior-secured revolving credit facility (the “2022 Revolver”), the Company’s outstanding debt balance was $76.0 million with $7.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, during the third quarter, the Company repurchased 92,043 shares of its common stock under its Share Repurchase Program, using open market purchases, for total consideration of approximately $1.1 million. Following completion of these repurchases, approximately $3.1 million of the Company’s common stock remained available for repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program at September 25, 2024.\n\n**Subsequent Events**\n\nSubsequent to the quarter-end, the Company paid down an additional $5.0 million on its 2022 Revolver resulting in outstanding borrowings of $71.0 million as of October 31, 2024.\n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nThe Company is providing the following expectations for the remainder of 2024:\n\n  * The opening of two new company-owned restaurants and three to four new franchised restaurants.\n  * Capital spending between $21.0 – $23.0 million.\n  * G&A expense between $45.0 and $47.0 million excluding one-time charges.\n  * Adjusted income tax rate of 27.5 – 28.0%.\n\n\n\n**Definitions of Non-GAAP and other Key Financial Measures**\n\n**System-Wide Sales** are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. System-wide sales are the sum of company-operated restaurant revenue and sales from franchised restaurants. The Company’s total revenue in the consolidated statements of income is limited to company-operated restaurant revenue and franchise revenue from the Company’s franchisees. Accordingly, system-wide sales should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results as reported under GAAP. Management believes that the presentation of system-wide sales provides useful information to investors, because it is a measure that is widely used in the restaurant industry, including by our management, to evaluate brand scale and market penetration. System-wide sales does not include the 10 licensed stores in the Philippines.\n\n**Company-Operated Restaurant Revenue** consists of sales of food and beverages in company-operated restaurants net of promotional allowances, employee meals, and other discounts. Company-operated restaurant revenue in any period is directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of open restaurants, and comparable restaurant sales. Seasonal factors and the timing of holidays cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue per restaurant is typically lower in the first and fourth quarters due to reduced January and December transactions and higher in the second and third quarters. As a result of seasonality, our quarterly and annual results of operations and key performance indicators such as company-operated restaurant revenue and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate.\n\n**Comparable Restaurant Sales** reflect year-over-year sales changes for comparable company-operated, franchised and system-wide restaurants. A restaurant enters our comparable restaurant base the first full week after it has operated for 15 months. Comparable restaurant sales exclude restaurants closed during the applicable period. At September 25, 2024, there were 482 comparable restaurants, 168 company-operated and 314 franchised. Comparable restaurant sales indicate the performance of existing restaurants, since new restaurants are excluded. Comparable restaurant sales growth can be generated by an increase in the number of meals sold and/or by increases in the average check amount, resulting from a shift in menu mix and/or higher prices resulting from new products or price increases. Because other companies may calculate this measure differently than we do, comparable restaurant sales as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that comparable restaurant sales is a valuable metric for investors to evaluate the performance of our store base, excluding the impact of new stores and closed stores.\n\n**Restaurant Contribution** and **Restaurant Contribution Margin** are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Restaurant contribution is defined as company-operated restaurant revenue less company restaurant expenses, which includes food and paper cost, labor and related expenses, and occupancy and other operating expenses, where applicable. Restaurant contribution therefore excludes franchise revenue, franchise advertising fee revenue and franchise expenses as well as certain other costs, such as general and administrative expenses, franchise expenses, depreciation and amortization, asset impairment and closed-store reserve, loss on disposal of assets and other costs that are considered corporate-level expenses and are not considered normal operating costs of our restaurants. Accordingly, restaurant contribution is not indicative of overall Company results and does not accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders because of the exclusion of certain corporate-level expenses. Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of net company-operated restaurant revenue. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or superior to, or as substitutes for the analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Management uses restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, to evaluate our restaurant performance across periods, and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared with our competitors. Management believes that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for investors, because they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency, and performance. Management further believes restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors to highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures.\n\n**EBITDA** and **Adjusted EBITDA** are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance, as identified in the reconciliation table included under “Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” in the accompanying financial tables at the end of this release. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this release are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\n\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) they do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) they do not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our on-going operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from such non-GAAP financial measures. We further compensate for the limitations in our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting comparable GAAP measures more prominently.\n\nManagement believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or NOLs) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because (i) management believes that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) management believes that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally for a number of benchmarks, including to compare our performance to that of our competitors.\n\n**Adjusted Net Income** is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted net income represents net income adjusted for (i) costs (or gains) related to loss (or gains) on disposal of assets or assets held for sale and asset impairment and closed store costs reserves, (ii) amortization expense and other estimate adjustments (whether expense or income) incurred on the Tax Receivable Agreement (“TRA”) completed at the time of our IPO, (iii) legal costs associated with securities class action litigation, (iv) extraordinary legal settlement costs, (v) insurance proceeds received related to securities class action legal expenses and (vi) provision for income taxes at a normalized tax rate of 27.6% and 27.7% for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, respectively, and 26.9% for both the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, which reflects our estimated long-term effective tax rate, including both federal and state income taxes (excluding the impact of the income tax receivable agreement, valuation allowance and other discrete items) and applied after giving effect to the foregoing adjustments. Because other companies may calculate these measures differently than we do, adjusted net income as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes adjusted net income is an important supplement to GAAP measures that enhances the overall understanding of our operating performance and long-term profitability, and enables investors to more effectively compare the Company’s performance to prior and future periods.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss financial results for the third quarter of 2024 today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures that are supplemental measures of the operating performance of our business and restaurants: System-wide sales, Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income. Our calculations of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. These measures have limitations as analytical tools, and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as substitutes for, or superior to, financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and to evaluate our restaurants’ financial performance against our competitors’ performance. We believe these measures they provide useful information about our operating results, enhance understanding of past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. These non-GAAP financial measures may also assist investors in evaluating our business and performance relative to industry peers and provide greater transparency with respect to the Company’s financial condition and results of operation.\n\nAdditional information about these non-GAAP financial measures (System-wide sales, Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted net income) is provided under “Definitions of Non-GAAP and other Key Financial Measures” above. For a reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see “Unaudited Reconciliation of System-Wide Sales to Company-Operated Restaurant Revenue and Total Revenue,” “Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA,” “Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted Net Income” and “Unaudited Reconciliation of Income from Operations to Restaurant Contribution” in the accompanying financial tables at the end of this press release.\n\n**Investor Contact:** Jeff PriesterICR[Investors@elpolloloco.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7-xFOlsJzb4AmuRbccOxHTRZR0_x7V69FWDfP3sxiYmE1VWKquhVdDzOyRDnC_v_9ClZVVg4UnCkkgtg57y45LEqbbEPfbvLpUQYU27_l_lje-b-c1qtESCeOJls20XK)\n\n**Media Contact:** Brittney Shaffer[media@elpolloloco.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8HzfvSWx1CJ_fhBae1oeIy3n1PDydDGxD4N5NIm5Oke0Coh7pE1-ROyKcSnreehq5M_DyMz6EK5GSUS-wrbjip1Wvh2MUHxjiFudbrZeWWI=)\n\n**EL POLLO LOCO HOLDINGS, INC.****UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME****(in thousands, except share data)**  \n---  \n**Thirteen Weeks Ended** | **Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended**  \n**September 25, 2024** | **September 27, 2023** | **September 25, 2024** | **September 27, 2023**  \n$ | % | $ | % | $ | % | $ | %  \n**Revenue:**  \nCompany-operated restaurant revenue | $ | 101,178 | 84.0 | $ | 102,703 | 85.3 | $ | 300,638 | 83.8 | $ | 304,477 | 85.4  \nFranchise revenue | 11,330 | 9.4 | 10,255 | 8.5 | 34,329 | 9.6 | 30,046 | 8.4  \nFranchise advertising fee revenue | 7,887 | 6.6 | 7,441 | 6.2 | 23,757 | 6.6 | 21,894 | 6.2  \n**Total revenue** | 120,395 | 100.0 | 120,399 | 100.0 | 358,724 | 100.0 | 356,417 | 100.0  \n**Cost of operations:**  \nFood and paper cost(1) | 25,401 | 25.1 | 27,552 | 26.8 | 76,751 | 25.5 | 82,928 | 27.2  \nLabor and related expenses(1) | 32,744 | 32.4 | 33,092 | 32.2 | 96,192 | 32.0 | 96,910 | 31.8  \nOccupancy and other operating expenses(1) | 26,088 | 25.8 | 27,289 | 26.6 | 74,609 | 24.8 | 77,751 | 25.5  \nGain on recovery of insurance proceeds, lost profits, net(1) | — | — | — | — | — | — | (151 | ) | (0.0 | )  \n**Company restaurant expenses****(1)** | 84,233 | 83.3 | 87,933 | 85.6 | 247,552 | 82.3 | 257,438 | 84.6  \nGeneral and administrative expenses | 11,418 | 9.5 | 9,144 | 7.6 | 35,130 | 9.8 | 31,451 | 8.8  \nFranchise expenses | 10,488 | 8.7 | 9,583 | 8.0 | 31,961 | 8.9 | 28,107 | 7.9  \nDepreciation and amortization | 4,034 | 3.4 | 3,946 | 3.3 | 11,755 | 3.3 | 11,277 | 3.2  \nLoss (gain) on disposal of assets | 77 | 0.1 | 16 | 0.0 | 181 | 0.1 | (34 | ) | (0.0 | )  \nGain on recovery of insurance proceeds, property, equipment and expenses | — | — | — | — | (41 | ) | (0.0 | ) | (242 | ) | (0.1 | )  \n(Gain) loss on disposition of restaurants | — | — | (4,923 | ) | (4.1 | ) | 7 | 0.0 | (5,034 | ) | (1.4 | )  \nImpairment and closed-store reserves | 8 | 0.0 | 1,008 | 0.8 | 45 | 0.0 | 1,123 | 0.3  \n**Total expenses** | 110,258 | 91.6 | 106,707 | 88.6 | 326,590 | 91.0 | 324,086 | 90.9  \n**Income from operations** | 10,137 | 8.4 | 13,692 | 11.4 | 32,134 | 9.0 | 32,331 | 9.1  \nInterest expense, net | 1,536 | 1.3 | 1,382 | 1.1 | 4,627 | 1.3 | 3,362 | 0.9  \nIncome tax receivable agreement expense | — | — | 106 | 0.1 | — | — | 105 | 0.0  \n**Income before provision for income taxes** | 8,601 | 7.1 | 12,204 | 10.2 | 27,507 | 7.7 | 28,864 | 8.2  \nProvision for income taxes | 2,415 | 2.0 | 2,975 | 2.5 | 7,776 | 2.2 | 7,661 | 2.1  \n**Net income** | **$** | **6,186** | **5.1** | **$** | **9,229** | **7.7** | **$** | **19,731** | **5.5** | **$** | **21,203** | **6.1**  \n**Net income per share:**  \nBasic | $ | 0.21 | $ | 0.28 | $ | 0.66 | $ | 0.61  \nDiluted | $ | 0.21 | $ | 0.28 | $ | 0.65 | $ | 0.60  \n**Weighted-average shares used in computing net income per share:**  \nBasic | 29,199,971 | 33,412,674 | 30,072,637 | 35,026,731  \nDiluted | 29,423,649 | 33,490,004 | 30,235,309 | 35,179,483  \n  \n___________________\n\n(1) | Percentages for line items relating to cost of operations and company restaurant expenses are calculated with company-operated restaurant revenue as the denominator.

During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, we did not record any non-cash impairment charges.

As the brand approaches its 50th anniversary next year, they look to create a modern legacy of curated experiences, inspired by place and punctuated by new menu innovation.\n\nWhile the new restaurant prototype includes existing brand elements - such as the fire stack gradient, logo, and font - that fans have come to know and love, these elements now reflect an updated color palette, footprint, and use of materials. Specifics include interior and furniture upgrades to create a bright and airy space; LED lighting; and energy-efficient hoods and HVAC.\n\nThe new restaurant design comes on the heels of hiring Tim Welsh as Chief Development Officer earlier this year. Welsh, a registered architect, joins El Pollo Loco with over 25 years of experience in restaurant and retail design. Prior to joining El Pollo Loco, Welsh was Senior Vice President of Design and Construction for TriMark, an industry leader in food service design and commercial kitchen construction. Before his time at TriMark, Welsh was the Chief Development Officer of Crunch Fitness and QDOBA® Mexican Eats. His extensive experience also includes leadership roles at The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Sweetgreen, and Walgreens. Throughout his career, Welsh has led growth strategies, franchise sales, prototype development, remodel programs, and facilities maintenance.\n\nCurrently operating 495 restaurants across seven U.S. states, El Pollo Loco plans to open its 500th location by the end of 2024. The brand is also eyeing previously untapped markets such as Boise, El Paso, Kansas City, and Seattle-Tacoma for growth in 2025.\n\nEl Pollo Loco is committed and passionate about nurturing strong relationships, targeting new partners, and leveraging incentives to excite new and existing franchisees. As it continues to serve delicious fire-grilled chicken and better-for-you menu offerings across the nation, the brand remains committed to delivering exceptional, flavor-packed experiences to every customer. Stay tuned for more exciting developments from El Pollo Loco as it looks to expand its presence nationally.\n\nFor more information about El Pollo Loco's expansion, development, and growth, visit its [Franchising](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rDJUllmBOexlYTWfOxNKLAiQenp3mXBEUDH6iMfB8vbLZVCVhANQ9q44HEMOW148PreA1QmCN5dOeqvJm5uxvx9jNz7SBXbptBxNcKnr7qU=) page on the website.
