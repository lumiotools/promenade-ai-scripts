(“Greenlight\nCapital Re,” “Company,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”). All statements, other than statements of historical facts included in this report, including statements regarding estimates,\nprojections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon\nwhich those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements”. We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered\nby the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements in the United States (“U.S.”) federal securities laws established by\nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words\n“believe,” “project,” “predict,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will\nbe,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are\nbased on current expectations, estimates and projections, and various assumptions, many of which, are inherently uncertain and\nbeyond management’s control.\nForward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q may include, but are not limited to, information regarding our\nestimates for catastrophes and weather-related losses (herein referred as “CAT losses”), measurements of potential losses in the\nfair market value of our investments, our expectations regarding the performance of our business, our financial results, our\nliquidity and capital resources, the outcome of our strategic initiatives, our expectations regarding pricing, and other market and\neconomic conditions including inflation, our growth prospects, and valuations of the potential impact of movements in interest\nrates, equity securities’ prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.\nForward-looking statements only reflect our expectations and are not guarantees of performance. These statements\ninvolve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual events\nor results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited\nto:\n• a downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings;\n• any suspension or revocation of any of our licenses;\n• losses from catastrophes and other major events;\n• the loss of significant brokers; and\n• those described under “Item 1A, Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31,2023, as filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024 (“2023 Form 10-K”), which is\naccessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new\ninformation, future events, or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements,\nwhich speak only to the dates they were made.\nWe intend to communicate certain events that we believe may have a material adverse impact on our operations or\nfinancial position, including property and casualty catastrophic events and material losses in our investment portfolio, in a\ntimely manner through a public announcement. Other than as required by the Exchange Act, we do not intend to make public\nannouncements regarding underwriting or investment events that we do not believe, based on management’s estimates and\ncurrent information, will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.\n3\nItem 1.

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nOrganization\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE” and, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company”) was\nincorporated as an exempted company under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands on July 13, 2004. The Company is a\nglobal specialty property and casualty reinsurer headquartered in the Cayman Islands. The ordinary shares of GLRE are listed\non Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE.”\nBasis of Presentation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (the “financial statements”) have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial\ninformation, and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) instructions to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nand Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP\nfor complete financial statements. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K. The financial statements include the accounts of\nGLRE and the consolidated financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all significant intercompany transactions\nand balances have been eliminated on consolidation.\nIn the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)\nconsidered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and results of operations as at the end of and\nfor the periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full\nyear.\nTabular dollars are in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts or otherwise noted. All amounts are reported\nin U.S. dollars.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the\ncurrent financial statements. The Company has reported separately the foreign exchange gains (losses) from “Other income” in\nthe condensed consolidated statements of operations. This resulted in no change to the previously reported total revenues or net\nincome. The Company has also included the foreign exchange gains (losses) as part of the net change in working capital in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Further, the Company combined “Other assets, excluding depreciation” and\n“Other liabilities” and presented the sum as “Other items, net” in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. These\nchanges in presentation in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows have resulted in no change to the previously\nreported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThere were no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies subsequent to its 2023 Form 10-K.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nOn November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new ASU requires\nincremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment, the\nmethod for determining segments, or the criteria for aggregating operating segments into reportable segments. This new\nguidance is effective for the Company’s 2024 year-end financial statements, and should be adopted retrospectively unless\nimpracticable. Early adoption is permitted.\n8\nReturn to table of contents\nOn December 14, 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes Topic (740) - Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures. The new ASU provides more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax\ndisclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. Early adoption is permitted. The\namendments should be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective application is permitted. This ASU is effective\nfor the Company’s 2024 year-end financial statements.\nAs the above ASUs relate solely to financial statement disclosures, the adoption of these ASUs will not impact the\nCompany’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n3. INVESTMENT IN RELATED PARTY INVESTMENT FUND\nEffective August 1, 2024, the Company and Solasglas Investments, LP (“Solasglas”) entered into Amendment No. 2 to\nthe Second Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement, to revise the Investment Cap from 60% to 70%\n(as defined in Note 3 of the 2023 Form 10-K).\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss relating to Solasglas is limited to GLRE's share of Partners’ capital in\nSolasglas.

DME Advisors II, LLC held the\nremaining 22.8% (December 31, 2023: 27.3%) of Solasglas’ total net assets.\nThe Company’s share of the net increase in Partner’s capital for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nwas $19.8 million and $42.4 million, respectively, (three and nine months ended September 30, 2023: a net decrease of $1.9\nmillion and a net increase of $27.8 million, respectively), as shown in the caption “Income (loss) from investment in related\nparty investment fund” in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe summarized financial statements of Solasglas are presented below.\nSummarized Statements of Financial Condition of Solasglas Investments, LP\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAssets\nInvestments, at fair value $ 549,163 $ 453,358\nDerivative contracts, at fair value 11,844 11,167\nDue from brokers 210,446 121,754\nCash and cash equivalents 21,782 —\nInterest and dividends receivable 438 1,143\nTotal assets 793,673 587,422\nLiabilities and partners’ capital\nLiabilities\nInvestments sold short, at fair value (263,540) (197,571)\nDerivative contracts, at fair value (12,101) (12,917)\nCapital withdrawals payable (1,250) (1,000)\nDue to brokers — (17,398)\nInterest and dividends payable (1,409) (2,315)\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities (204) (247)\nTotal liabilities (278,504) (231,448)\nPartners' capital $ 515,170 $ 355,974\nGLRE’s share of Partners' capital $ 397,888 $ 258,890\n9\nReturn to table of contents\nSummarized Statements of Operations of Solasglas Investments, LP\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInvestment income\nDividend income (net of withholding taxes) $ 752 $ 273 $ 2,524 $ 1,624\nInterest income 3,540 2,523 10,040 6,415\nTotal Investment income 4,292 2,796 12,564 8,039\nExpenses\nManagement fee (1,613) (1,238) (4,344) (3,469)\nInterest (817) (2,380) (2,887) (5,387)\nDividends (782) (659) (2,217) (1,871)\nProfessional fees and other (262) (507) (921) (1,396)\nTotal expenses (3,474) (4,784) (10,369) (12,123)\nNet investment income (loss) 818 (1,988) 2,195 (4,084)\nRealized and change in unrealized gains (losses)\nNet realized gain (loss) 23,647 460 86,677 (2,145)\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) 4,801 (1,191) (24,582) 52,601\nNet gain (loss) on investment transactions 28,448 (731) 62,095 50,456\nNet increase (decrease) in Partners' capital (1) $ 29,265 $ (2,719) $ 64,289 $ 46,372\nGLRE’s share of the increase (decrease) in Partners'\ncapital $ 19,844 $ (1,853) $ 42,422 $ 27,791\n(1) The net increase in Partners’ capital is net of management fees and performance allocation presented below:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nManagement fees $ 1,613 $ 1,238 $ 4,344 $ 3,469\nPerformance allocation 2,205 $ (206) 4,714 3,088\nTotal $ 3,818 $ 1,032 $ 9,058 $ 6,557\n4.

The magnitude and volume of losses arising from these events is\ninherently uncertain and, consequently, actual losses for these events may ultimately differ, potentially materially, from current\nestimates.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized total CAT loss, net of reinsurance, of $48.9\nmillion. Current year CAT loss events were $39.9 million, driven mainly by the Baltimore Bridge collapse, Hurricane Helene,\nand U.S. tornados (including severe convective storms). Additionally, the Company incurred $9.0 million of net adverse prior\nyear CAT loss development relating primarily to U.S. tornados (including severe convective storms) affecting U.S.\nhomeowners’ property coverage (2021-2023 underwriting years).\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized total CAT loss, net of reinsurance, of $20.2\nmillion. Current year CAT loss events were $29.5 million, driven mainly by the Turkey earthquake, New Zealand Cyclone\nGabrielle and U.S. tornados, coupled with $9.3 million net favorable prior year CAT loss development predominantly from\nvarious prior years’ property catastrophe events (mostly 2019, 2021 and 2022 underwriting years).\n13\nReturn to table of contents\nPrior Year Reserve Development\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company experienced $0.9 million in net favorable development\non prior year loss and LAE reserves.

This\nwas partially offset by $10.5 million of reserve strengthening predominantly for prior years’ CAT loss events mentioned above.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company experienced $10.5 million in net adverse development\non prior year loss and LAE reserves. This was comprised of $31.3 million of reserve strengthening predominantly on legacy\nmotor (mainly 2021 underwriting year) and workers’ compensation (2021 and prior underwriting years) due to current\neconomic and social inflation trends, coupled with adverse CAT loss development on U.S. homeowners’ property business\nrelating to Winter Storm Elliott (2022 underwriting year) and a final claim settlement on a professional liability contract (2008\nunderwriting year). This was partially offset by $20.8 million better than expected loss emergence predominantly from the\nabove prior years’ CAT loss events, marine and energy (predominantly 2020 and 2022 underwriting years), group medical\n(2022 and prior underwriting years), and cyber contracts (predominantly 2021 underwriting year).\n8.

Our goal is to build long-term\nshareholder value by providing risk management solutions to the insurance, reinsurance, and other risk marketplaces.\nFor the third quarter of 2024 (“Q3 2024”) we earned a net income of $35.2 million, an increase of $21.8 million over\nthe same period in the prior year, principally due to strong performance from our investment in Solasglas. Our underwriting\nresults were lower by $8.3 million in Q3 2024 compared to the same quarter in 2023 (“Q3 2023”).\nThe following is a summary of our financial performance for Q3 2024, compared to Q3 2023:\n• Gross premiums written was $168.3 million, a decrease of 8.0%;\n• Net premiums earned was $151.9 million, a decrease of 6.9%;\n• Net underwriting income (1) was $6.1 million, compared to $14.4 million;\n• Current year CAT losses, net of reinsurance, were $14.1 million, including $7.5 million from Hurricane\nHelene, compared to $13.2 million;\n• Favorable prior year loss development was $5.7 million, compared to $3.3 million;\n• Total investment income was $28.1 million, an increase of $23.0 million (including 5.2% net return from our\ninvestment in Solasglas), compared to net return of (0.6)%; and\n• Diluted EPS was $1.01, compared to $0.39.\nFully diluted book value per share(1) was $18.72 at September 30, 2024, an increase of 11.8% since December 31,\n2023.\nOn October 18, 2024, A.M. Best affirmed the Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer\nCredit Ratings of “a-” (Excellent) for our principal operating subsidiaries and revised the outlooks to positive from stable. The\npositive outlook reflects A.M. Best’s view of our operating performance, which has steadily improved in recent years.\n(1) See “Key Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures” section of this MD&A.\nOutlook and Trends\nWe have witnessed an active North Atlantic Hurricane season to date, with the industry’s attention now on the widely\nvarying insured loss estimate ranges for Hurricanes Helene and Milton. It has also been an active year in many regions for\nsecondary peril events – with the reinsurance market’s share of these events varying depending on the region and reinsurance\nstructures in those regions. These dynamics will contribute to the restructuring and repricing of property reinsurance deals\nduring the upcoming key renewal season. We believe that property reinsurance capacity remains well matched to meet demand\nin the current state of the market.\nAnother key focus in the industry is the degree of additional reserve strengthening that may emerge in casualty classes\nthroughout the remainder of the year. We anticipate continued primary rate increases and tightening reinsurance terms in US\nCasualty.\nWe have been watching significant rising global geopolitical tensions, including in the Middle East. There is\nworldwide attention on the upcoming U.S. election, which could have far reaching implications from a global macroeconomic\nand trade perspective, while we have also begun to see rate cuts from various Central Banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve.\nOur cedants are attentive to these dynamics, which will be a core focus of the renewal season. The 2024 mid-year renewals\nhave been characterized by a healthy balance of supply and demand of reinsurance capacity. Reinsurance terms and conditions\nare retaining discipline across a majority of classes, most notably with respect to property excess of loss attachment points. We\ncontinue to view the terms and conditions available in the property and specialty market as attractive for growth.\nThe anticipated interest rates cuts could have a meaningful favorable impact on our interest expense relating to our\nfloating rate term loan, which would be offset by lower interest income earned on our restricted cash and cash equivalents.\n24\nReturn to table of contents\nKey Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures\nThere have been no changes to our key financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures, as described in the\nMD&A of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nFully Diluted Book Value Per Share\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the fully diluted book value per share to basic book value per share (the\nmost directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure):\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n2024 2024 2024 2023 2023\nNumerator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share:\nTotal equity as reported under U.S.\nGAAP $ 663,418 $ 634,020 $ 624,458 $ 596,095 $ 575,865\nDenominator for basic and\nfully diluted book value per share:\nOrdinary shares issued\nand outstanding as reported and\ndenominator for basic book value per\nshare 34,832,493 35,321,144 35,321,144 35,336,732 35,337,407\nAdd: In-the-money stock options (1) and\nall outstanding RSUs 602,013 594,612 585,334 264,870 312,409\nDenominator for fully diluted book\nvalue per share 35,434,506 35,915,756 35,906,478 35,601,602 35,649,816\nBasic book value per share $ 19.05 $ 17.95 $ 17.68 $ 16.87 $ 16.30\nIncrease in basic book value per share\n($) $ 1.10 $ 0.27 $ 0.81 $ 0.57 $ 0.39\nIncrease in basic book value per share\n(%) 6.1 % 1.5 % 4.8 % 3.5 % 2.5 %\nFully diluted book value per share $ 18.72 $ 17.65 $ 17.39 $ 16.74 $ 16.15\nIncrease in fully diluted book value per\nshare ($) $ 1.07 $ 0.26 $ 0.65 $ 0.59 $ 0.38\nIncrease in fully diluted book value per\nshare (%) 6.1 % 1.5 % 3.9 % 3.7 % 2.4 %\n(1) Assuming net exercise by the grantee.\n25\nReturn to table of contents\nNet Underwriting Income\nThe reconciliations of net underwriting income to income before income taxes (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP\nfinancial measure) on a consolidated basis are shown below:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome before income tax $ 35,960 $ 13,506 $ 71,911 $ 69,335\nAdd (subtract):\nTotal investment income (28,088) (5,105) (67,033) (52,496)\nForeign exchange losses (gains) (5,826) 1,999 (3,245) (7,661)\nOther non-underwriting income (2,210) (706) (9,969) (5,738)\nCorporate expenses 4,253 3,266 13,334 13,820\nInterest expense 2,018 1,457 4,827 2,977\nNet underwriting income $ 6,107 $ 14,417 $ 9,825 $ 20,237\n26\nReturn to table of contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe table below summarizes our consolidated operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnderwriting revenue\nGross premiums written $ 168,346 $ 183,074 $ 554,579 $ 524,472\nGross premiums ceded (26,598) (14,789) (64,611) (35,740)\nNet premiums written 141,748 168,285 489,968 488,732\nChange in net unearned premium reserves 10,136 (5,175) (18,150) (43,030)\nNet premiums earned $ 151,884 $ 163,110 $ 471,818 $ 445,702\nUnderwriting related expenses\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred:\nCurrent year $ 98,820 $ 100,143 $ 305,467 $ 273,570\nPrior year (1) (5,654) (3,300) (943) 10,502\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 93,165 96,843 304,524 284,072\nAcquisition costs 46,162 46,933 138,226 126,702\nUnderwriting expenses 6,073 4,639 18,223 14,046\nDeposit interest expense (income), net 377 278 1,020 645\nNet underwriting income (2) $ 6,107 $ 14,417 $ 9,825 $ 20,237\nIncome (loss) from investment in Solasglas $ 19,844 $ (1,853) $ 42,422 $ 27,791\nNet investment income 8,244 6,958 24,611 24,705\nTotal investment income $ 28,088 $ 5,105 $ 67,033 $ 52,496\nCorporate expenses $ 4,253 $ 3,266 $ 13,334 $ 13,820\nForeign exchange losses (gains) (5,826) 1,999 (3,245) (7,661)\nOther income, net (2,210) (706) (9,969) (5,738)\nInterest expense 2,018 1,457 4,827 2,977\nIncome tax expense 723 29 1,677 111\nNet income $ 35,237 $ 13,477 $ 70,234 $ 69,224\nEarnings per share:\nBasic $ 1.03 $ 0.40 $ 2.05 $ 2.03\nDiluted $ 1.01 $ 0.39 $ 2.02 $ 1.99\nUnderwriting ratios:\nLoss ratio -

See “ Key Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures” above\nfor discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following provides further details on the significant variances for Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023 and for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 (“YTD 2024”) compared to the same period in 2023 (“YTD 2023”).\nOverview\nThree months ended September 30, 2024\nFully diluted book value per share increased by $1.07 per share, or 6.1%, to $18.72 per share from $17.65 per share at\nJune 30, 2024. Basic book value per share increased by $1.10 per share, or 6.1%, to $19.05 per share from $17.95 per share at\nJune 30, 2024.\nNet income was $35.2 million for Q3 2024, compared to net income of $13.5 million reported for Q3 2023.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during Q3 2024, compared to Q3 2023,\nare summarized below:\n• Underwriting income: Decreased by $8.3 million due to an increase of 4.7 percentage points to our combined\nratio on lower net premiums earned. The increase in our combined ratio was driven by the increase in loss ratio,\nacquisition cost ratio, and underwriting expense ratio. While the attritional loss ratio for our underwriting\nportfolio and current year CAT losses were higher in the current quarter than in Q3 2023, this was offset partially\nby improved prior year loss development. Current year CAT losses contributed 9.3% to our combined ratio,\ncompared to 8.1% in Q3 2023. For further information on CAT losses and prior year loss development, refer to\nNote 7 - Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves of the Q3 2024 Financials.\n• Investment income: Increased by $23.0 million primarily driven by our investment in Solasglas, which reported a\ngain of $19.8 million during Q3 2024, compared to a loss of $1.9 million during Q3 2023. Solasglas generated a\nnet return of 5.2% for Q3 2024 compared to a net return of (0.6)% for Q3 2023.\n• Corporate expense: Increased by $1.0 million mainly due to an increase in personnel costs, overhead costs, and\ntechnology investment to support the business growth we experienced in the last two years.\n• Foreign exchange gains (losses): $5.8 million foreign exchange gains for Q3 2024, compared to $2.0 million\nforeign exchange losses in Q3 2023, driven mainly by the strengthening of the pound sterling against the U.S.\ndollar in Q3 2024.\n• Other income, net: Increased by $1.5 million due to higher investment income generated on funds withheld by\nthird party Lloyd’s syndicates, reported on a quarterly lag basis.\nNine months ended September 30, 2024\nFully diluted book value per share increased by $1.98 per share, or 11.8%, to $18.72 per share from 16.74 per share at\nDecember 31, 2023. Basic book value per share increased by $2.18 per share, or 12.9%, to $19.05 per share from 16.87 per\nshare at December 31, 2023.\nNet income was $70.2 million for YTD 2024, compared to net income of $69.2 million reported for YTD 2023.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during YTD 2024, compared to YTD\n2023, are summarized below:\n• Underwriting income: Decreased by $10.4 million due to 2.4 percentage points increase in our combined ratio,\noffset partially by an increase in net premiums earned. The increase in our combined ratio was driven by the\n28\nReturn to table of contents\nincrease in loss ratio, acquisition cost ratio, and underwriting expense ratio. While the current year CAT losses\ncontributed 8.5 percentage points to our combined ratio, compared to 5.1 percentage points for YTD 2023, this\nwas offset partially by improved prior year loss development. For further information on CAT losses and prior\nyear loss development, refer to Note 7 - Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves of the Q3 2024 Financials.\n• Investment income: Increased by $14.5 million primarily driven by our investment in Solasglas, which reported a\ngain of $42.4 million during YTD 2024, compared to a gain of $27.8 million during the equivalent period in 2023.\nSolasglas generated a net return of 11.9% for YTD 2024, compared to a net return of 9.1% for YTD 2023.\n• Corporate expense: Decreased by $0.5 million mainly due to non-recurring severance costs included in YTD\n2023 and lower outside legal costs following the hiring of our new General Counsel in April 2023. This was\npartially offset by the increase in other personnel and overhead costs as noted for Q3 2024.\n• Foreign exchange gains (losses): $3.2 million foreign exchange gains for YTD 2024, compared to $7.7 million\nforeign exchange gains for YTD 2023, driven mainly by a stronger pound sterling movement against the U.S.\ndollar in YTD 2023.\n• Other income, net: Increased by $4.2 million due to stronger investment income generated on funds withheld by\nthird party Lloyd’s syndicates, reported on a quarterly lag basis.\nUnderwriting Results by Segment\nThe following provides a further discussion of our underwriting results for our Property & Casualty (Re)insurance\noperating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nGross Premiums Written\nDetails of gross premiums written are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProperty $ 13,625 8.1 % $ 32,940 18.0 % $ 61,578 11.1 % $ 94,660 18.0 %\nCasualty 92,124 54.7 108,964 59.5 279,118 50.3 284,560 54.3\nOther 62,597 37.2 41,170 22.5 213,883 38.6 145,252 27.7\nTotal $ 168,346 100.0 % $ 183,074 100.0 % $ 554,579 100.0 % $ 524,472 100.0 %\nAs a result of our underwriting philosophy, the total premiums we write and the mix of premiums between property,\ncasualty, and other business, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the market opportunities we identify.\nOur Q3 2024 gross premiums written decreased by $14.7 million, or 8.0%, compared to the equivalent 2023 period.\n29\nReturn to table of contents\nThe following table provides a further analysis of this overall decrease:\nGross Premiums Written\nThree months ended September 30, 2024\nIncrease\n(decrease) % change Explanation\n($ in millions)\nProperty $(19.3) (58.6)% Driven predominantly by the non-renewal of a U.S. homeowners’ property\ntreaty on January 1st and a net reduction to estimated ultimate gross premiums\nfor certain treaties.\nCasualty $(16.8) (15.5)% Mainly due to the following:\n• General Liability by $3.2 million, or 10.3%, primarily due to net\nreduction to estimated ultimate gross premiums for certain deals,\ncoupled with a decrease in our line share for certain non-proportional\ntreaty and quota-share treaties. This was partially offset by favorable\nrate changes on renewed business and new business.\n• Multiline by $8.4 million, or 12.3%, driven mainly by non-renewed\nFAL business on January 1st which contributed $8.9 million to the\nchange in the quarter, partially offset by net growth in premiums\nwritten from existing FAL business.\n• Workers’ Compensation by 3.5 million, or 79.1%, due to timing of\nrenewal for an excess of loss treaty, coupled with the non-renewal of\nquota share treaties in 2022 a portion of which was written in 2023.\n• Professional Liability by $1.6 million, or 98.0%, primarily due to non-\nrenewal of certain quota-share treaties.\nOther $21.4 52.0% Driven predominantly by new business in our Marine and Energy class. This\nwas partially offset by $5.2 million, or 30.4%, decrease in our Financial class\ndue to lower premium volume from our surety and transactional liability\nbusiness.\nOur YTD 2024 gross premiums written increased by $30.1 million, or 5.7%, compared to the equivalent 2023 period.\nThe following table provides a further analysis of this overall increase:\nGross Premiums Written\nNine months ended September 30, 2024\nIncrease\n(decrease) % change Explanation\n($ in millions)\nProperty $(33.1) (34.9)% Same trends as noted for Q3 2024.\nCasualty $(5.4) (1.9)% Same trends as noted for Q3 2024, except for General Liability, which increased\nby $4.1 million, or 5.1%, driven by favorable rate changes in 2024, coupled\nwith growth from 2023 quota share treaties and new business.\nGeneral Liability and Multi-line classes accounted for 30% and 62%,\nrespectively, of total Casualty, compared to 28% and 62%, respectively, in the\nsame period in 2023.\nOther $68.6 47.2% Driven predominantly by new business in our Marine and Energy class,\nincluding Lloyd’s whole account excess of loss treaties. The Financial class also\ngrew as a result of new non-proportional mortgage and financial multiline\ntreaties, partially offset by lower premium volume from our surety and\ntransactional liability business.\nPremiums Ceded\nFor Q3 2024, premiums ceded were $26.6 million, or 15.8% of gross premiums written, compared to $14.8 million, or\n8.1% of gross premiums written, for the same quarter in 2023. For YTD 2024, premiums ceded were $64.6 million, or 11.7%\nof gross premiums written, compared to $35.7 million, or 6.8% of gross premiums written, for YTD 2023.\n30\nReturn to table of contents\nThe increase in both periods was primarily due to the purchase of additional retrocessional coverage to manage our\noverall exposure to Aviation and Marine and Energy in light of growth in these classes of business during 2024 and to reinstate\ncertain retro excess-of-loss treaties in which the full coverage was presumed exhausted primarily from the Baltimore Bridge\nloss event in Q1 2024. Additionally, we had an increase in quota share retrocessions for Other Specialty business due to growth\nfrom inward premiums.\nNet Premiums Written\nDetails of net premiums written are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProperty $ 9,819 6.9 % $ 24,771 14.7 % $ 47,878 9.8 % $ 77,397 15.8 %\nCasualty 84,134 59.4 103,542 61.5 261,015 53.3 275,578 56.4\nOther 47,795 33.7 39,972 23.8 181,075 37.0 135,757 27.8\nTotal $ 141,748 100.0 % $ 168,285 100.0 % $ 489,968 100.0 % $ 488,732 100.0 %\nFor Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, net premiums written decreased by $26.5 million, or 15.8%, and increased by $1.2\nmillion or 0.3%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.

The Q3 2024 prior year favorable loss\ndevelopment was mainly from our general liability class (2020-2022 underwriting years);\nwhereas for the same period in 2023, the adverse loss development was related to legacy\nmotor, workers’ compensation and professional liability program.\nOther 10.5 Driven by $2.4 million of prior year adverse loss development, compared to $9.7 million of\nprior year favorable loss development in Q3 2023, which contributed 26.2 points to the overall\nincrease in loss ratio. The Q3 2024 prior year adverse loss development was mainly from\nmarine and energy business across multiple years (2020-2023); whereas for the same period in\n2023, the favorable loss development was related mainly to marine and energy, cyber, and\ngroup medical classes.\nOffsetting the above increase, non-natural CAT losses were 12.7 points lower in the current\nperiod compared to the prior year period.\n32\nReturn to table of contents\nThe following provides further details on the change in YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023.\nNet Losses Incurred\nNine months ended September 30, 2024\nIncrease /\n(decrease) in\nloss ratio\npoints\nProperty 8.5 Driven by 11.5 points of higher current year CAT loss events. For the YTD 2024, these were\ndriven mainly by the Baltimore Bridge collapse, Hurricane Helene, and U.S. tornados\n(including severe convective storms), whereas for YTD 2023 the CAT losses were driven\nmainly by the Turkey earthquake, New Zealand Cyclone Gabrielle, and U.S. tornados\n(including severe convective storms).\nAdditionally, we recognized $4.5 million of prior year adverse loss development relating\nprimarily to the U.S. severe convective storms in 2023, compared to $1.1 million of prior year\nfavorable loss development in YTD 2023. This contributed 10.9 points to the increase in loss\nratio.\nThe above was partially offset by the change in business mix, with Commercial Property\naccounting for 73% of total premium earned, compared to 48% in the prior period. This class\nhas a lower attritional loss rate than for Personal Property and Motor classes of business.\nCasualty (5.5) Due to $0.4 million of prior year favorable loss development compared to $22.3 million of\nprior year adverse loss development in YTD 2023, which contributed 8.2 points improvement\nto the overall decrease in loss ratio. The YTD 2023 prior year adverse loss development was\nrelated to same classes as previously noted for Q3 2023. Additionally, the lack of CAT losses\nassociated with this line of business in YTD 2024 also contributed to the overall reduction in\nloss ratio.\nOther 11.9 Due to the lower prior year favorable loss development compared to Q3 2023, which\ncontributed 5.0 points to the overall increase in loss ratio. For YTD 2024, the prior year\nfavorable loss development of $5.1 million was driven primarily by our mortgage, cyber, and\nenergy classes; whereas in YTD 2023 the prior year favorable loss development was related to\nthe same classes as previously noted for Q3 2023.\nAdditionally, the overall loss ratio increased by 5.1 points due to higher CAT losses compared\nto prior year period. The increase in CAT losses was driven mainly by the Baltimore bridge\ncollapse in Q1 2024.\nAcquisition Costs, Net\nFor Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, our total acquisition costs decreased by 1.6% to $46.2 million, and increased by 9.1% to\n$138.2 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The YTD 2024 increase was mainly due to growth in net\npremiums earned.

This was partially offset primarily by a\nlower acquisition cost ratio for General Liability, driven mainly by a reduction in profit\ncommission for a significant Innovation quota share treaty.\nOther 0.2 No significant change.\nThe following provides further details on the change in YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023.\nChange in Acquisition Cost Ratios\nNine months ended September 30, 2024\nIncrease / (decrease)\nin acquisition cost Explanation\nratio points\nProperty (1.4) Driven mainly by the change in business mix where we have reduced the premium volume\nin our Personal Property class as result of not renewing a large U.S. homeowners’ property\nquota share treaty. This treaty had a higher acquisition cost ratio than our Commercial\nProperty business.\nCasualty 1.6 Same trends as noted for Q3 2024, coupled with the change in business mix. The increase\nwas partially offset by lower acquisition costs from the Motor Liability class due to a\nhigher proportion of excess of loss treaties, which have lower ceding commission rate than\nquota share reinsurance treaties, in addition to the lower acquisition cost ratio from the\nGeneral Liability class as noted for Q3 2024.\nOther 0.1 No significant change.\n34\nReturn to table of contents\nRatio Analysis\nThe following table provides our underwriting ratios by line of business for the respective periods:\nThree months ended September 30 Three months ended September 30\n2024 2023\nProperty Casualty Other Total Property Casualty Other Total\nLoss ratio 112.4 % 52.7 % 56.1 % 61.3 % 54.1 % 67.4 % 45.6 % 59.4 %\nAcquisition cost ratio 19.9 34.0 28.4 30.4 17.7 31.9 28.2 28.8\nComposite ratio 132.3 % 86.7 % 84.5 % 91.7 % 71.8 % 99.3 % 73.8 % 88.2 %\nUnderwriting expense ratio 4.2 3.0\nCombined ratio 95.9 % 91.2 %\nOur combined ratio increased by 4.7 percentage points for the current quarter compared to Q3 2023 driven by higher\nloss ratio, acquisition cost ratio and underwriting expense ratio.

The increase was driven by:\n• Underwriting expenses: Increased by $1.4 million or 30.9%, predominantly due to an increase in headcount to\ndrive business growth, coupled with an increase in professional fees, office expenses, and outsourced services relating\nto underwriting activities.\n• Corporate expenses: Increased by $1.0 million or 30.2%, predominantly due to an increase in personnel costs,\nincluding share-based compensation costs, coupled with an increase in professional fees and office overhead costs,\nincluding information technology systems and support.\n35\nReturn to table of contents\nG&A increased by 13.2% for YTD 2024, compared to same period in 2023. The increase was driven by:\n• Underwriting expenses: Increased by $4.2 million or 29.7%, for the same reason as noted for Q3 2024.\nFurther, YTD 2023 included a bad debt charge of $0.6 million, with no bad debt charge during YTD 2024.\n• Corporate expenses: Decreased by $0.5 million or 3.5%, driven mainly by non-recurring severance costs\nincluded in YTD 2023 and lower outside legal costs following the hiring of our new General Counsel in April 2023.\nThis was partially offset by an increase in personnel costs, including share-based compensation costs, and office\noverhead costs.\nTotal Investment Income\nA summary of our total investment income is as follows:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest and dividend income, net of withholding\ntaxes and other expenses 8,244 9,513 $ 24,935 $ 27,004\nNet realized and unrealized gains on other\ninvestments (see Note 4) — (2,555) (324) (2,299)\nNet investment-related income $ 8,244 $ 6,958 $ 24,611 $ 24,705\nShare of Solasglas' net income (loss) (see Note 3) 19,844 (1,853) 42,422 27,791\nTotal investment income $ 28,088 $ 5,105 $ 67,033 $ 52,496\nNet investment-related income\nOur net investment-related income increased by 18.5% compared to Q3 2023, and by a nominal change compared to\nYTD 2023, mainly driven by lower net realized and unrealized gains (losses) from our Innovation portfolio. This was partially\noffset by the decrease in interest income earned from restricted cash and cash equivalents mainly due to the decrease in the\noutstanding collateral balance during both periods.\nShare of Solasglas’ net income\nFor Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, Solasglas reported a net gain of 5.2% and 11.9%, respectively, compared to a net loss of\n0.6% and a net gain of 9.1% for Q3 2023 and YTD 2023, respectively.

The increase was primarily driven by $96.6 million of net contributions into Solasglas, coupled with the\nnet investment return for YTD 2024 The contributions were funded partially from cash flow from operations and partially from\nthe release of restricted cash.\nInvestments in Solasglas\nDME Advisors reports the composition of Solasglas’ portfolio on a delta-adjusted basis, which it believes is the\nappropriate manner to assess the exposure and profile of investments and reflects how it manages the portfolio. An option’s\ndelta is the option price’s sensitivity to the underlying stock (or commodity) price. The delta-adjusted basis is the number of\nshares or contracts underlying the option multiplied by the delta and the underlying stock (or commodity) price.\nThe following table represents the composition of Solasglas’ investments:\nSeptember 30 December 31\n2024 2023\nLong % Short % Long % Short %\nEquities and related derivatives 85.2 % 53.9 % 90.2 % 53.8 %\nPrivate and unlisted equity securities 1.7 — 2.0 —\nDebt instruments 0.2 — 0.3 —\nTotal 87.1 % 53.9 % 92.5 % 53.8 %\nThe above exposure analysis does not include cash (U.S. dollar and foreign currencies), gold and other\ncommodities, credit default swaps, sovereign debt, foreign currency derivatives, interest rate derivatives, inflation swaps and\nother macro positions. Under this methodology, a total return swap’s exposure is reported at its full notional amount and\noptions are reported at their delta-adjusted basis. At September 30, 2024, Solasglas’ exposure to gold on a delta-adjusted basis\nwas 7.4% (2023: 11.2%).\nAt September 30, 2024, 95.2% of Solasglas’ portfolio was valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets\n(Level 1), 3.6% was composed of instruments valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2), and\na nominal amount was composed of instruments valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). At September 30, 2024,\n1.2% of Solasglas’ portfolio consisted of private equity funds valued using the funds’ net asset values as a practical expedient.\n37\nReturn to table of contents\nOther Investments\nThe other investment holdings relate to private investments made by Innovations. The marginal increase since\nDecember 31, 2023, is due to new investments of $0.8 million, partially offset by an impairment charge for certain private debt\nsecurities during YTD 2024 (see Note 4).\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\nWe use our restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily for funding trusts and letters of credit issued to our ceding\ninsurers. Our restricted cash decreased by $37.6 million, or 6.2%, from $604.6 million at December 31, 2023, to $567.1 million\nat September 30, 2024, primarily due to release of collateral from our ceding insurers relating to legacy contracts in run-off.\nReinsurance balances receivable\nOur reinsurance balances receivable increased by $99.3 million, or 16.0%, to $718.7 million from $619.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. This was driven primarily by $72.3 million increase in premiums receivable, net of collections, and $27.8\nmillion in funds withheld from new and renewed reinsurance treaties.\nLoss and LAE Reserves; Loss and LAE Recoverable\nOur reserves for loss and LAE by lines of business were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCase Case\nReserves IBNR Total Reserves IBNR Total\nProperty $ 50,739 $ 114,352 $ 165,091 $ 24,181 $ 41,056 $ 65,237\nCasualty 106,667 241,139 347,806 136,713 299,933 436,646\nOther 58,794 239,461 298,255 28,156 131,515 159,671\nTotal $ 216,200 $ 594,952 $ 811,152 $ 189,050 $ 472,504 $ 661,554\nOur total gross loss and LAE reserves increased by $149.6 million, or 22.6%, to $811.2 million from $661.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, driven by the increase in earned premium from the renewal of reinsurance treaties and new business,\ncoupled with an increase in loss ratio. This was offset partially by paid losses during YTD 2024. See Note 7 “Loss and Loss\nAdjustment Expense Reserves” of the financial statements for a summary of changes in outstanding loss and LAE reserves and a\ndescription of prior period loss developments.\nOur total loss and LAE recoverable increased by $40.3 million, or 156.7%, to $65.9 million from $25.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. This increase was driven mainly by the estimated loss recoveries on the Baltimore Bridge loss event, the\nTaiwan earthquake (gross losses were mostly retroceded), and the increase in quota share retrocessions for Other Specialty\nbusiness due to growth from inward premiums. See Note 8 “Retrocession” of the financial statements for a description of the\ncredit risk associated with our retrocessionaires.\nProbable Maximum Loss (“PML”)\nAt October 1, 2024, our estimated largest PML at a 1-in-250-year return period for a single event, and in aggregate,\nwas $99.8 million and $109.7 million, respectively, both relating to the peril of North Atlantic Hurricane, compared to $99.9\nmillion and $109.2 million, respectively, at July 1, 2024.\n38\nReturn to table of contents\nThe below table contains the expected modeled loss for each of our peak peril regions and sub-regions for both a\nsingle event loss and aggregate loss measures at the 1-in-250-year return period.\nOctober 1, 2024\nNet 1-in-250 Year Return Period\nPeril Single Event Loss Aggregate Loss\nNorth Atlantic Hurricane $ 99,847 $ 109,664\nSoutheast Hurricane 94,666 94,666\nGulf of Mexico Hurricane 52,434 54,643\nNortheast Hurricane 56,281 56,281\nNorth America Earthquake 96,181 97,074\nCalifornia Earthquake 84,189 87,892\nPacific Northwest Earthquake 49,656 49,656\nOther N.A.

The increase was primarily due to the net income of $70.2 million reported for the period, coupled with share-based\ncompensation adjustment to additional paid-in capital. This was partially offset by $7.5 million of share repurchases in the\nopen market at an average price of $13.68 per share (see Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of\nProceeds).\n39\nReturn to table of contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nRefer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section included in Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K for a general\ndiscussion of our liquidity and capital resources.\nLiquidity\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of funds:\nNine months ended September 30\n2024 2023\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 81,970 $ (14,630)\nInvesting activities (97,222) (22,548)\nFinancing activities (19,364) (5,292)\nEffect of currency exchange on cash(1) 619 (152)\nNet cash outflows (33,997) (42,622)\nCash, beginning of period 655,730 706,548\nCash, end of period $ 621,733 $ 663,926\n(1)\nCash includes unrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents - see Note 5 of the financial statements.\nCash provided by operating activities\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven mainly by the ebb and flow from our underwriting\nactivities, which may vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of business, the nature of underwriting\nopportunities available and volume of claims submitted to us by our cedents.\nCash used in investing activities\nThe increase in cash used for investing activities was driven mainly by the net contribution of $96.6 million in\nSolasglas for YTD 2024 compared to a net contribution of $23.0 million during the same period in 2023.\nCash used in financing activities\nThe increase in cash used in our financing activities was driven mainly by $7.5 million of share repurchases and $11.9\nmillion of debt repayments during YTD 2024, compared to the debt refinancing in YTD 2023 in which we issued $75.0 million\nof debt to repay $62.1 million of the outstanding convertible senior notes, coupled with $17.2 million of repurchases of these\nnotes.\nCapital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our debt and capital structure:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nDebt - outstanding principal $ 62,187 $ 74,062\nShareholders’ equity $ 663,418 $ 596,095\nRatio of debt to shareholders’ equity 9.4 % 12.4 %\nThe debt to shareholders’ equity provides an indication of our leverage and capital structure, along with some insights\ninto our financial strength. In addition to the above capital, we also have LOC facilities to support our reinsurance business\noperations where we are not licensed or admitted as a reinsurer.\n40\nReturn to table of contents\nOrdinary Shares\nAt September 30, 2024, there were 34,832,493 outstanding ordinary shares, a decrease of 504,239 since December 31,\n2023, mainly due to 547,402 of share repurchases offset partially by issuance of RSs and ordinary shares for vested RSUs, net\nof forfeitures.\nWe expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business\nstrategy for the foreseeable future. However, to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we\nrequire additional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, we have\nrenewed our $200.0 million shelf registration by filing the Form S-3 registration statement with the SEC, which became\neffective on July 5, 2024, and will expire on July 1, 2027.\nSecured LOC Facilities\nAs disclosed in Note 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities” of Q3 2024 Financials, the $275 million committed capacity under\nthe Citi LOC agreement terminated on August 20, 2024. However, Citi continues providing the Citi LOC on an uncommitted\nbasis.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt September 30, 2024, our contractual obligations and commitments by period due were as follows:\nLess than More than\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total\nOperating activities\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves (1) $ 385,297 $ 257,135 $ 95,716 $ 73,004 $ 811,152\nOperating lease obligations 650 516 — — 1,166\nFinancing activities\nDebt (2) 937 61,645 — — 62,582\nTotal $ 386,884 $ 319,296 $ 95,716 $ 73,004 $ 874,900\n(1) Due to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance contractual\nliabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain.\n(2) See Note 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities” of the financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and have required management to make\nassumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including those described in “Part II. Item 1A.\nRisk Factors” included in our 2023 Form 10-K, cause actual events or results to differ materially from our underlying\nassumptions or estimates. In that case, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition,\nor liquidity. The most significant estimates relate to: premium revenues and risk transfer, loss and loss adjustment expense\nreserves, investment impairments, allowances for credit losses, and share-based compensation.\nWe believe that the critical accounting estimates discussion in “Part II. Item 7. — Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results on Operations” of our 2023 Form 10-K continues to describe the significant\nestimates and judgments included in the preparation of these financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAt September 30, 2024, there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that\nwe expect could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. See Note 2 “Significant\nAccounting Policies” of the Q3 2024 Financials.\n41\nReturn to table of contents\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRefer to Item 7A included in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to this item since December 31,\n2023.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in such rules) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports prepared in accordance with the rules and\nregulations of the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules\nand forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These\ninherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur\nbecause of simple error or mistake.\nAdditionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,\nor by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its\nstated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,\nor the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-\neffective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal controls\nover financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the\nCompany’s systems evolve with its business.\n42\nReturn to table of contents\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, we may be involved in formal and informal dispute resolution\nprocedures, which may include arbitration or litigation, the outcomes of which determine our rights and obligations under our\nreinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, we may seek to enforce our rights under an\nagreement or to collect funds owing to us. In other matters, we may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged\nrights. While the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of our existing\ncontractual disputes, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFactors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report are any of the risks described in\n“Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our 2023 Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024. Any of these factors\ncould result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors\nnot presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there have been no other material changes to the risk factors disclosed in “Part I. Item 1A.\nRisk Factors” included in our 2023 Form 10-K. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from\ntime to time in our future filings with the SEC.\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nOur Board has adopted a share repurchase plan (the “Plan”). The timing of such repurchases and the actual number of\nshares repurchased will depend on various factors, including price, market conditions, and applicable regulatory and corporate\nrequirements. On May 3, 2024, our Board of Directors re-approved the Plan until June 30, 2025, authorizing us to repurchase\nup to $25.0 million of ordinary shares or securities convertible into ordinary shares in the open market, through privately\nnegotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans. Any shares repurchased are canceled immediately upon repurchase.\nWe are not required to repurchase any of the ordinary shares. The Plan may be modified, suspended, or terminated at the\nelection of our Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nThe table below details the share repurchases that were made under the Plan during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nShares Purchased Under Publicly Announced Repurchase Program\nMaximum Dollar\nAmount Still Available\nNumber of Shares Average Price per Under Share\nPeriod Purchased Share Repurchase Plan\nBeginning balance $ 25,000,000\nJuly 1 - 31, 2024 — $ — 25,000,000\nAugust 1 - 31, 2024 273,202 13.35 21,351,540\nSeptember 1 - 30, 2024 274,200 14.00 17,512,240\nTotal 547,402 $ 17,512,240\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 547,402 ordinary shares at an aggregate cost of\n$7.5 million at an average price of $13.68 per share.\nItem 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\n43\nReturn to table of contents\nItem 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. OTHER INFORMATION\n(c) Insider Trading Arrangements and Related Disclosures\nOur directors and executive officers may purchase or sell shares of our ordinary shares in the market from time to time,\nincluding pursuant to equity trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act (“Rule 10b5-1”)\nand in compliance with guidelines specified by the Company. In accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and our insider trading policy,\ndirectors, officers, and certain employees who, at such time, are not in possession of material non-public information about the\nCompany are permitted to enter into written plans that pre-establish amounts, prices and dates (or formula for determining the\namounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired pursuant to the\nCompany’s equity plans (“Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans”). Under Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to\nparameters established by the director or executive officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from them.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not have any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements or any\n“non-Rule 10b5-1 arrangements” (as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K) in place for our directors and officers.\nItem 6.

(“Greenlight\nCapital Re,” “Company,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”). All statements, other than statements of historical facts included in this report, including statements regarding estimates,\nprojections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon\nwhich those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements”. We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered\nby the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements in the United States (“U.S.”) federal securities laws established by\nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words\n“believe,” “project,” “predict,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will\nbe,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are\nbased on current expectations, estimates and projections, and various assumptions, many of which, are inherently uncertain and\nbeyond management’s control.\nForward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q may include, but are not limited to, information regarding our\nestimates for catastrophes and weather-related losses (herein referred as “CAT losses”), measurements of potential losses in the\nfair market value of our investments, our expectations regarding the performance of our business, our financial results, our\nliquidity and capital resources, the outcome of our strategic initiatives, our expectations regarding pricing, and other market and\neconomic conditions including inflation, our growth prospects, and valuations of the potential impact of movements in interest\nrates, equity securities’ prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.\nForward-looking statements only reflect our expectations and are not guarantees of performance. These statements\ninvolve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual events\nor results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited\nto:\n• a downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings;\n• any suspension or revocation of any of our licenses;\n• losses from catastrophes and other major events;\n• the loss of significant brokers; and\n• those described under “Item 1A, Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31,2023, as filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024 (“2023 Form 10-K”), which is\naccessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new\ninformation, future events, or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements,\nwhich speak only to the dates they were made.\nWe intend to communicate certain events that we believe may have a material adverse impact on our operations or\nfinancial position, including property and casualty catastrophic events and material losses in our investment portfolio, in a\ntimely manner through a public announcement.

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nOrganization\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE” and, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company”) was\nincorporated as an exempted company under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands on July 13, 2004. The Company is a\nglobal specialty property and casualty reinsurer headquartered in the Cayman Islands. The ordinary shares of GLRE are listed\non Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE.”\nBasis of Presentation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (the “financial statements”) have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial\ninformation, and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) instructions to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nand Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP\nfor complete financial statements. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K. The financial statements include the accounts of\nGLRE and the consolidated financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all significant intercompany transactions\nand balances have been eliminated on consolidation.\nIn the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)\nconsidered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and results of operations as at the end of and\nfor the periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full\nyear.\nTabular dollars are in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts or otherwise noted. All amounts are reported\nin U.S. dollars.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the\ncurrent financial statements. The Company has reported separately the foreign exchange gains (losses) from “Other income” in\nthe condensed consolidated statements of operations. This resulted in no change to the previously reported total revenues or net\nincome. The Company has also included the foreign exchange gains (losses) as part of the net change in working capital in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Further, the Company combined “Other assets, excluding depreciation” and\n“Other liabilities” and presented the sum as “Other items, net” in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. These\nchanges in presentation in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows have resulted in no change to the previously\nreported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThere were no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies subsequent to its 2023 Form 10-K.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nOn November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new ASU requires\nincremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment, the\nmethod for determining segments, or the criteria for aggregating operating segments into reportable segments. This new\nguidance is effective for the Company’s 2024 year-end financial statements, and should be adopted retrospectively unless\nimpracticable. Early adoption is permitted.\n8\nReturn to table of contents\nOn December 14, 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes Topic (740) - Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures. The new ASU provides more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax\ndisclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. Early adoption is permitted. The\namendments should be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective application is permitted. This ASU is effective\nfor the Company’s 2024 year-end financial statements.\nAs the above ASUs relate solely to financial statement disclosures, the adoption of these ASUs will not impact the\nCompany’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n3. INVESTMENT IN RELATED PARTY INVESTMENT FUND\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, there was no change to the Company’s agreement with Solasglas\nInvestments, LP (“Solasglas”).

At June 30, 2024, GLRE’s share of Partners’ capital in Solasglas was $351.5 million (December 31, 2023: $258.9\nmillion), representing 76.3% (December 31, 2023: 72.7%) of Solasglas’ total net assets. DME II held the remaining 23.7%\n(December 31, 2023: 27.3%) of Solasglas’ total net assets.\nThe Company’s share of the net increase in Partner’s capital for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was $4.3\nmillion and $22.6 million, respectively, (three and six months ended June 30, 2023: $32.8 million and $29.6 million,\nrespectively), as shown in the caption “Income (loss) from investment in related party investment fund” in the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe summarized financial statements of Solasglas are presented below.\nSummarized Statements of Financial Condition of Solasglas Investments, LP\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAssets\nInvestments, at fair value $ 401,510 $ 453,358\nDerivative contracts, at fair value 11,244 11,167\nDue from brokers 169,898 121,754\nCash and cash equivalents 53,460 —\nInterest and dividends receivable 195 1,143\nTotal assets 636,307 587,422\nLiabilities and partners’ capital\nLiabilities\nInvestments sold short, at fair value (162,984) (197,571)\nDerivative contracts, at fair value (11,147) (12,917)\nCapital withdrawals payable — (1,000)\nDue to brokers — (17,398)\nInterest and dividends payable (1,404) (2,315)\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities (164) (247)\nTotal liabilities (175,699) (231,448)\nPartners' capital $ 460,608 $ 355,974\nGLRE’s share of Partners' capital $ 351,468 $ 258,890\n9\nReturn to table of contents\nSummarized Statements of Operations of Solasglas Investments, LP\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInvestment income\nDividend income (net of withholding taxes) $ 941 $ 724 $ 1,772 $ 1,351\nInterest income 2,148 2,076 6,500 3,892\nTotal Investment income 3,089 2,800 8,272 5,243\nExpenses\nManagement fee (1,408) (1,163) (2,731) (2,231)\nInterest (736) (1,579) (2,070) (3,007)\nDividends (731) (793) (1,435) (1,212)\nProfessional fees and other (335) (607) (659) (889)\nTotal expenses (3,210) (4,142) (6,895) (7,339)\nNet investment income (loss) (121) (1,342) 1,377 (2,096)\nRealized and change in unrealized gains (losses)\nNet realized gain (loss) 20,085 (845) 63,030 (2,605)\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) (13,138) 54,825 (29,383) 53,792\nNet gain (loss) on investment transactions 6,947 53,980 33,647 51,187\nNet increase (decrease) in Partners' capital (1) $ 6,826 $ 52,638 $ 35,024 $ 49,091\nGLRE’s share of the increase (decrease) in Partners'\ncapital $ 4,330 $ 32,782 $ 22,578 $ 29,644\n(1) The net increase in Partners’ capital is net of management fees and performance allocation presented below:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nManagement fees $ 1,408 $ 1,163 $ 2,731 $ 2,231\nPerformance allocation 481 $ 3,294 2,509 3,294\nTotal $ 1,889 $ 4,457 $ 5,240 $ 5,525\n4.

The interest rate swaps are carried at fair value and are determined\nusing a market approach valuation technique based on significant observable market inputs from third-party pricing vendors.\nAccordingly, the interest rates swaps are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. These derivative instruments are\nnot designated as accounting hedges under U.S. GAAP.\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a reduction in unrealized loss of $0.1\nmillion and $0.6 million, respectively, for the above derivatives to a nominal value at June 30, 2024, which is included in other\nliabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations, and in “net change in unrealized gains and losses on investments and derivatives” in the condensed consolidated\nstatements of cash flows.

Current year CAT loss events were $25.7 million, driven mainly by the Baltimore bridge collapse, the U.S. tornados\n(including severe convective storms), satellite failures, and a Mexican state-owned oil platform fire. Additionally, the\nCompany incurred $9.4 million of net adverse prior year CAT loss development relating primarily to severe weather affecting\nU.S. homeowners’ property coverage (2021-2023 underwriting years).\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized total CAT loss, net of reinsurance, of $19.6\nmillion. Current year CAT loss events were $16.4 million, driven mainly by the Turkey earthquake, New Zealand Cyclone\n13\nReturn to table of contents\nGabrielle and the U.S. tornados, coupled with $3.2 million net adverse prior year CAT loss development mainly relating to the\n2022 Winter Storm Elliott.\nPrior Year Reserve Development\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company experienced $4.7 million in net adverse development on prior\nyear loss and LAE reserves. This was composed of $19.5 million of reserve strengthening predominantly for the above prior\nyear CAT loss events, coupled with additional losses reported on general liability contracts (mostly 2014-2017 underwriting\nyears) and legacy quota share workers’ compensation treaties (mostly 2017-2021 underwriting years) due to current economic\nand social inflation trends. The reserve increases were partially offset by $14.8 million favorable loss development\npredominantly from mortgage contracts (various underwriting years), multi-line commercial treaties (mostly 2020 underwriting\nyear), Funds at Lloyd’s (“FAL”) (2023 underwriting year), and other specialty business (mostly 2020-2022 underwriting years).\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company experienced $13.8 million in net adverse development on prior\nyear loss and LAE reserves. This was comprised of $21.5 million of reserve strengthening predominantly on casualty contracts\n(mostly 2018, 2019 and 2021 underwriting years) and property contracts (mostly 2020 and 2021 underwriting years) due to\ncurrent economic and social inflation trends, coupled with adverse CAT loss development on U.S. homeowners’ property\nbusiness relating to Winter Storm Elliott (2022 underwriting year). This was partially offset by $7.7 million better than\nexpected loss emergence predominantly from other property catastrophe events (mostly 2019, 2021 and 2022 underwriting\nyears).\n8.

Our goal is to build long-term\nshareholder value by providing risk management solutions to the insurance, reinsurance, and other risk marketplaces.\nFor the second quarter of 2024 (“Q2 2024”) we earned a net income of $8.0 million, a decrease of $41.9 million over\nthe same period in the prior year, principally due to the lower return from our investment in Solasglas and to a lesser extent\nlower underwriting profits driven by higher CAT losses.\nThe following is a summary of our financial performance for Q2 2024, compared to the same quarter in 2023 (“Q2\n2023”):\n• Gross premiums written was $169.0 million, an increase of 9.1%;\n• Net premiums earned was $158.4 million, an increase of 13.2%;\n• Net underwriting income (1) was $0.3 million, compared to $5.4 million;\n• Total CAT losses, net of reinsurance, were $17.9 million, compared to $9.3 million;\n• Total investment income was $12.6 million, a decrease of 70.2% (including 1.2% net return from our\ninvestment in Solasglas, compared to net return of 10.9%); and\n• Diluted EPS was $0.23, compared to $1.32.\nFully diluted book value per share(1) was $17.65 at June 30, 2024, an increase of 5.4% since December 31, 2023.\n(1) See “Key Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures” section of this MD&A.\nOutlook and Trends\nThe 2024 mid-year renewals have been characterized by a healthy balance of supply and demand of reinsurance\ncapacity. Reinsurance terms and conditions are retaining discipline across a majority of classes, most notably with respect to\nproperty excess of loss attachment points. We continue to view the terms and conditions available in the property and specialty\nmarket as attractive for growth.\nAs we approach the peak months of North Atlantic hurricane season, the industry’s attention is drawn to the record set\nin early July by Hurricane Beryl for the earliest category 5 storm to form in the North Atlantic. Another key focus in the\nindustry is the degree of additional reserve strengthening that may emerge in casualty classes throughout the remainder of the\nyear.\nIt is likely that terms and conditions in the reinsurance market will be highly dependent on the progression of the\nabove factors throughout the remainder of 2024.\n23\nReturn to table of contents\nKey Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures\nThere have been no changes to our key financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures, as described in the\nMD&A of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nFully Diluted Book Value Per Share\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the fully diluted book value per share to basic book value per share (the\nmost directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure):\nJune 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30,\n2024 2024 2023 2023 2023\nNumerator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share:\nTotal equity as reported under U.S. GAAP $ 634,020 $ 624,458 $ 596,095 $ 575,865 $ 561,121\nDenominator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share:\nOrdinary shares issued and outstanding as\nreported and denominator for basic book\nvalue per share 35,321,144 35,321,144 35,336,732 35,337,407 35,272,013\nAdd: In-the-money stock options (1) and all\noutstanding RSUs 594,612 585,334 264,870 312,409 312,409\nDenominator for fully diluted book value\nper share 35,915,756 35,906,478 35,601,602 35,649,816 35,584,422\nBasic book value per share $ 17.95 $ 17.68 $ 16.87 $ 16.30 $ 15.91\nIncrease in basic book value per share ($) $ 0.27 $ 0.81 $ 0.57 $ 0.39 $ 1.45\nIncrease in basic book value per share (%) 1.5 % 4.8 % 3.5 % 2.5 % 10.0 %\nFully diluted book value per share $ 17.65 $ 17.39 $ 16.74 $ 16.15 $ 15.77\nIncrease in fully diluted book value per\nshare ($) $ 0.26 $ 0.65 $ 0.59 $ 0.38 $ 1.43\nIncrease in fully diluted book value per\nshare (%) 1.5 % 3.9 % 3.7 % 2.4 % 10.0 %\n(1) Assuming net exercise by the grantee.\n24\nReturn to table of contents\nNet Underwriting Income (Loss)\nThe reconciliations of net underwriting income (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes (the most directly comparable\nU.S. GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis are shown below:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nIncome before income tax $ 8,413 $ 49,888 $ 35,951 $ 55,829\nAdd (subtract):\nTotal investment income (12,554) (42,151) (38,945) (47,391)\nForeign exchange losses (gains) 932 (4,729) 2,581 (9,660)\nOther non-underwriting income (2,724) (2,866) (7,759) (5,032)\nCorporate expenses 4,706 4,557 9,081 10,554\nInterest expense 1,560 744 2,809 1,520\nNet underwriting income $ 333 $ 5,443 $ 3,718 $ 5,820\n25\nReturn to table of contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe table below summarizes our consolidated operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and\n2023:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnderwriting revenue\nGross premiums written $ 168,975 $ 154,943 $ 386,233 $ 341,398\nGross premiums ceded (14,832) (9,739) (38,013) (20,951)\nNet premiums written 154,143 145,204 348,220 320,447\nChange in net unearned premium reserves 4,255 (5,261) (28,286) (37,855)\nNet premiums earned $ 158,398 $ 139,943 $ 319,934 $ 282,592\nUnderwriting related expenses\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred:\nCurrent year $ 102,722 $ 88,740 $ 206,647 $ 173,428\nPrior year (1) (689) 1,764 4,712 13,801\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 102,033 90,504 211,359 187,229\nAcquisition costs 50,454 38,293 92,064 79,769\nUnderwriting expenses 5,811 5,468 12,150 9,407\nDeposit interest expense (income), net (233) 235 643 367\nNet underwriting income (2) $ 333 $ 5,443 $ 3,718 $ 5,820\nIncome (loss) from investment in Solasglas $ 4,330 $ 32,782 $ 22,578 $ 29,644\nNet investment income 8,224 9,369 16,367 17,747\nTotal investment income $ 12,554 $ 42,151 $ 38,945 $ 47,391\nCorporate expenses $ 4,706 $ 4,557 $ 9,081 $ 10,554\nForeign exchange losses (gains) 932 (4,729) 2,581 (9,660)\nOther income, net (2,724) (2,866) (7,759) (5,032)\nInterest expense 1,560 744 2,809 1,520\nIncome tax expense 435 28 954 82\nNet income $ 7,978 $ 49,860 $ 34,997 $ 55,747\nEarnings per share:\nBasic $ 0.23 $ 1.46 $ 1.02 $ 1.64\nDiluted $ 0.23 $ 1.32 $ 1.01 $ 1.49\nUnderwriting ratios:\nLoss ratio -

See “ Key Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures” above\nfor discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nThe following provides further details on the significant variances for Q2 2024 compared to same quarter in 2023 (“Q2\n2023”) and for the six months ended June 30, 2024 (“YTD 2024”) compared to the same period in 2023 (“YTD 2023”).\nOverview\nThree months ended June 30, 2024\nFully diluted book value per share increased by $0.26 per share, or 1.5%, to $17.65 per share from $17.39 per share at\nMarch 31, 2024. Basic book value per share increased by $0.27 per share, or 1.5%, to $17.95 per share from $17.68 per share\nat March 31, 2024.\nNet income was $8.0 million for Q2 2024, compared to net income of $49.9 million reported for Q2 2023.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during Q2 2024, compared to Q2 2023,\nare summarized below:\n• Underwriting income: Decreased by $5.1 million primarily driven by 3.6 percentage points increase in our\ncombined ratio, predominantly due to higher acquisition costs relating to our FAL business, partially offset by\nimproved loss ratio and underwriting expense ratio. While total CAT losses were higher than in Q2 2023, this\nwas offset by improved attritional loss ratio for our underwriting portfolio during the quarter. Current year CAT\nlosses contributed 8.4% to our combined ratio, compared to 7.3% in Q2 2023. For further information on CAT\nlosses and prior year loss development, refer to Note 7 - Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves of the Q2\n2024 Financials.\n• Investment income: Decreased by $29.6 million primarily driven by lower income from Solasglas. Our\ninvestment in Solasglas reported a gain of $4.3 million during Q2 2024, compared to a gain of $32.8 million\nduring Q2 2023. Solasglas generated a net return of 1.2% for Q2 2024 compared to a net return of 10.9% for Q2\n2023; and\n• Foreign exchange gains (losses): $0.9 million foreign exchange losses for Q2 2024, compared to $4.7 million\nforeign exchange gains in Q2 2023, driven mainly by the strengthening of the pound sterling against the U.S.\ndollar in Q2 2023 whereby there was no significant movement in Q2 2024.\nSix months ended June 30, 2024\nFully diluted book value per share increased by $0.91 per share, or 5.4%, to $17.65 per share from $16.74 per share at\nDecember 31, 2023. Basic book value per share increased by $1.08 per share, or 6.4%, to $17.95 per share from 16.87 per share\nat December 31, 2023.\nNet income was $35.0 million for YTD 2024, compared to net income of $55.7 million reported for YTD 2023.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during YTD 2024, compared to YTD\n2023, are summarized below:\n• Underwriting income: Decreased by $2.1 million primarily driven by 0.9 percentage points increase in our\ncombined ratio mainly due to an increase in acquisition costs (same reason as Q2 2024) and an increase in\nunderwriting expenses. While current year CAT losses contributed 8.0 percentage points to our combined ratio,\ncompared to 5.8 percentage points for YTD 2023, the increase was offset by an improved attritional loss ratio for\n27\nReturn to table of contents\nour underwriting portfolio. For further information on CAT losses and prior year loss development, refer to Note 7\n- Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves of the Q2 2024 Financials.\n• Investment income: Decreased by $8.4 million primarily driven by lower income from Solasglas. Our investment\nin Solasglas reported a gain of $22.6 million during YTD 2024, compared to a gain of $29.6 million during the\nequivalent period in 2023. Solasglas generated a net return of 6.4% for YTD 2024 compared to a net return of\n9.7% for YTD 2023 .\n• Corporate expense: Decreased by $1.5 million mainly due to non-recurring severance costs included in YTD\n2023 and lower outside legal costs following the hiring of our new General Counsel in April 2023.\n• Foreign exchange gains (losses): $2.6 million foreign exchange losses for YTD 2024, compared to $9.7 million\nforeign exchange gains for YTD 2023, driven mainly by the reversal of the pound sterling movement against the\nU.S. dollar; and\n• Other income, net: Increased by $2.7 million due to stronger investment income generated on funds withheld by\nthird party Lloyd’s syndicates, reported on a quarterly lag basis.\nUnderwriting Results by Segment\nThe following provides a further discussion of our underwriting results for our Property & Casualty (Re)insurance\noperating segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.\nGross Premiums Written\nDetails of gross premiums written are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProperty $ 22,777 13.5 % $ 31,160 20.1 % $ 47,953 12.4 % $ 61,720 18.1 %\nCasualty 80,205 47.5 88,472 57.1 186,994 48.4 175,596 51.4\nOther 65,993 39.1 35,311 22.8 151,286 39.2 104,082 30.5\nTotal $ 168,975 100.0 % $ 154,943 100.0 % $ 386,233 100.0 % $ 341,398 100.0 %\nAs a result of our underwriting philosophy, the total premiums we write and the mix of premiums between property,\ncasualty, and other business, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the market opportunities we identify.\nOur Q2 2024 gross premiums written increased by $14.0 million, or 9.1%, compared to the equivalent 2023 period.\n28\nReturn to table of contents\nThe following table provides a further analysis of this overall increase:\nGross Premiums Written\nThree months ended June 30, 2024\nIncrease\n(decrease) % change Explanation\n($ in millions)\nProperty $(8.4) (26.9)% The decrease was driven predominantly by the non-renewal of a U.S.\nhomeowners’ property treaty within Personal class. This was offset partially by\ngrowth in the Commercial class driven by new Innovations business. This\nresulted in a change in business mix for Property, with Commercial and\nPersonal accounting for 53% and 47%, respectively, of total Property compared\nto 46% and 53%, respectively, for the same quarter in 2023.\nCasualty $(8.3) (9.3)% The decrease was driven predominantly from revision to estimated ultimate\ngross premiums for certain 2023 and 2024 FAL treaties, partially offset by\ngrowth experienced by Syndicate 3456, within the Multi-line class.\nAdditionally, we revised the estimated premiums for certain prior years’ quota\nshare treaties within Professional and Workers’ Compensation classes of\nbusiness. This reduction in Casualty premiums was partially offset by growth in\nthe General Liability class from 2023 quota share treaties and new business in\n2024. Further, Motor Liability premium increased mainly due to new excess of\nloss treaties.\nAs a result, the business mix within our Casualty line of business has changed\nwith General Liability, Motor Liability, and Multi-line classes accounting for\n42%, 11%, and 48% of total Casualty, respectively, compared to 31%, 3%, and\n58% in the same period in 2023.\nOther $30.7 86.9% The increase was driven predominantly by new business in our Marine and\nEnergy class, including Lloyd’s whole account excess of loss treaties.\nOur YTD 2024 gross premiums written increased by $44.8 million, or 13.1%, compared to the equivalent 2023 period.\nThe following table provides a further analysis of this overall increase:\nGross Premiums Written\nSix months ended June 30, 2024\nIncrease\n(decrease) % change Explanation\n($ in millions)\nProperty $(13.8) (22.3)% Same trends as noted for Q2 2024.

The growth\nin Motor Liability class is predominantly from new excess of loss treaties.\nThe above growth was partially offset by revision to estimated ultimate gross\npremiums for certain 2023 and 2024 FAL treaties and by lower premiums for\nProfessional and Workers’ Compensation classes of business.\nGeneral Liability and Multi-line classes accounted for 30% and 61%,\nrespectively, of total Casualty, compared to 27% and 60%, respectively, in the\nsame period in 2023.\nOther $47.2 45.4% Same trends as noted for Q2 2024.\n29\nReturn to table of contents\nPremiums Ceded\nFor Q2 2024, premiums ceded were $14.8 million, or 8.8% of gross premiums written, compared to $9.7 million, or\n6.3% of gross premiums written, for the same quarter in 2023. For YTD 2024, premiums ceded were $38.0 million, or 9.8% of\ngross premiums written, compared to $21.0 million, or 6.1% of gross premiums written, for YTD 2023.\nThe increase in both periods was primarily due to the purchase of an additional retrocessional coverage to manage our\noverall exposure to Marine and Energy class in light of recent growth in this class of business and to reinstate certain retro\nexcess of loss treaties in which the full coverage was presumed exhausted primarily from the Baltimore bridge loss event.\nAdditionally, we had an increase in quota share retrocessions for Other Specialty business due to growth from inward\npremiums.\nNet Premiums Written\nDetails of net premiums written are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nProperty $ 16,855 10.9 % $ 26,433 18.2 % $ 38,059 10.9 % $ 52,626 16.4 %\nCasualty 77,431 50.2 84,840 58.4 176,881 50.8 172,036 53.7\nOther 59,857 38.8 33,931 23.4 133,280 38.3 95,785 29.9\nTotal $ 154,143 100.0 % $ 145,204 100.0 % $ 348,220 100.0 % $ 320,447 100.0 %\nFor Q2 2024 and YTD 2024, net premiums written increased by $8.9 million, or 6.2%, and $27.8 million or 8.7%,\nrespectively, compared to the same periods in 2023.

The acquisition cost ratios by line of business were as\nfollows:\n32\nReturn to table of contents\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\nIncrease / Increase /\n(decrease) in (decrease) in\nacquisition cost acquisition cost\n2024 2023 ratio points 2024 2023 ratio points\nProperty 10.7 % 19.1 % (8.4) % 15.8 % 19.1 % (3.3) %\nCasualty 36.9 30.5 6.4 32.0 30.5 1.5\nOther 31.0 25.1 5.9 28.3 28.1 0.2\nTotal 31.9 % 27.4 % 4.5 % 28.8 % 28.2 % 0.6 %\nThe following provides further details on the change in Q2 2024 vs. Q2 2023.\nChange in Acquisition Cost Ratios\nThree months ended June 30, 2024\nIncrease / (decrease)\nin acquisition cost Explanation\nratio points\nProperty (8.4) The decrease was driven by the change in business mix as a result of not renewing a U.S.\nhomeowner’s program that had a higher acquisition cost ratio compared to the increase in\nnet premiums earned from CAT retro quota share treaties at lower acquisition costs.\nCasualty 6.4 The increase was driven primarily due to higher than previously estimated acquisition\ncosts for certain 2023 and 2024 FAL business within our Multi-line class. This was\npartially offset by a change in business mix, particularly with growth in net premiums\nearned from General Liability and Motor Liability classes of business at lower acquisition\ncosts.\nOther 5.9 The increase was driven primarily by the prior year favorable loss reserve releases during\nthe quarter for certain mortgage programs within our Financial class, which resulted in\nhigher performance-based commission costs. There was no comparable favorable loss\nreserves release for this business in Q2 2023, which would have triggered additional\ncommission costs.\nThe following provides further details on the change in YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023.\nChange in Acquisition Cost Ratios\nSix months ended June 30, 2024\nIncrease / (decrease)\nin acquisition cost Explanation\nratio points\nProperty (3.3) Same trends as noted for Q2 2024.\nCasualty 1.5 Same trends as noted for Q2 2024.\nOther 0.2 Same trends as noted for Q2 2024.

The underwriting\nexpense ratio improved as a result of higher volume of net premium earned to cover underwriting expenses and, to a lesser\nextent, a net gain from deposit-accounted contracts as a result of a favorable commutation during the quarter.\nSix months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2024 2023\nProperty Casualty Other Total Property Casualty Other Total\nLoss ratio 79.9 % 65.6 % 61.1 % 66.1 % 98.6 % 66.8 % 48.6 % 66.3 %\nAcquisition cost ratio 15.8 % 32.0 % 28.3 % 28.8 % 19.1 % 30.5 % 28.1 % 28.2 %\nComposite ratio 95.7 % 97.6 % 89.4 % 94.9 % 117.7 % 97.3 % 76.7 % 94.5 %\nUnderwriting expense ratio 4.0 % 3.5 %\nCombined ratio 98.9 % 98.0 %\nOur combined ratio increased by 0.9 percentage points for YTD 2024 compared to same period in 2023 predominantly\ndue to higher acquisition cost ratio and underwriting expense ratio (see G&A Expenses below for further details); partially\noffset by a decrease in loss ratio.\nGeneral and Administrative (“G&A”) Expenses\nThe breakdown of our G&A expenses between underwriting and corporate functions was as follows:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nUnderwriting expenses $ 5,811 $ 5,468 $ 12,150 $ 9,407\nCorporate expenses 4,706 4,557 9,081 10,554\nGeneral and administrative expenses $ 10,517 $ 10,025 $ 21,231 $ 19,961\nG&A increased by 4.9% for Q2 2024, compared to Q2 2023. The increase was driven by:\n• Underwriting expenses: Increased by $0.3 million or 6.3%, predominantly due to an increase in headcount to\ndrive business growth, coupled with an increase in professional fees and outsourced services relating to underwriting\nactivities. Further, Q2 2023 included a bad debt charge of $0.6 million, with no similar charge during Q2 2024.\n• Corporate expenses: No significant change for the quarter.\n34\nReturn to table of contents\nG&A increased by 6.4% for YTD 2024, compared to same period in 2023. The increase was driven by:\n• Underwriting expenses: Increased by $2.7 million or 29.2%, predominantly due to an increase in headcount to\ndrive business growth, coupled with an increase in professional fees and outsourced services relating to underwriting\nactivities. As a result, this contributed to the net increase in underwriting expense ratio in the YTD 2024 compared to\nthe same period in 2023.\n• Corporate expenses: Decreased by $1.5 million or 14.0%, driven mainly by non-recurring severance costs\nincluded in YTD 2023 and lower outside legal costs following the hiring of our new General Counsel in April 2023.\nTotal Investment Income\nA summary of our total investment income is as follows:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest and dividend income, net of withholding\ntaxes and other expenses 8,135 8,863 $ 16,691 $ 17,491\nNet realized and unrealized gains on other\ninvestments (see Note 4) 89 506 (324) 256\nNet investment-related income $ 8,224 $ 9,369 $ 16,367 $ 17,747\nShare of Solasglas' net income (see Note 3) 4,330 32,782 22,578 29,644\nTotal investment income $ 12,554 $ 42,151 $ 38,945 $ 47,391\nNet investment-related income\nOur net investment-related income decreased by 8.2% compared to Q2 2023, and by 4.6% compared to YTD 2023,\nmainly driven by the decrease in interest income earned from restricted cash and cash equivalents as a result of decreases in the\noutstanding collateral balance during both periods.\nShare of Solasglas’ net income\nFor Q2 2024 and YTD 2024, Solasglas reported a gain of 1.2% and 6.4%, respectively, compared to a gain of 10.9%\nand 9.7% for Q2 2023 and YTD 2023, respectively.

The largest detractors were long positions in Brighthouse Financial (BHF),\nGreen Brick Partners (GRBK), and a single-name short position.\nFor YTD 2024, the significant contributors to Solasglas’ investment return were long positions in GRBK, gold, and\nTenet Healthcare (THC). The largest detractors were a long position in BHF and two single-name short positions.\n35\nReturn to table of contents\nEach month, we post on our website (www.greenlightre.com) the returns from our investment in Solasglas.\nFinancial Condition\nInvestments\nThe following table provides a breakdown of our total investments:\nJune 30 December 31\n2024 2023\nInvestment in related party investment fund (Solasglas) $ 351,468 82.8 % $ 258,890 78.0 %\nOther investments:\nPrivate investments and unlisted equities 71,866 16.9 71,157 21.4\nDebt and convertible debt securities 1,293 0.3 2,136 0.6\nTotal other investments $ 73,159 17.2 % $ 73,293 22.0 %\nTotal investments $ 424,627 100.0 % $ 332,183 100.0 %\nAt June 30, 2024, our total investments increased by $92.4 million, or 27.8%, to $424.6 million from December 31,\n2023. The increase was primarily driven by $70.0 million of additional contributions into Solasglas, coupled with the net\ninvestment return for Q2 2024. The contributions were funded partially from cash flow from operations and partially from the\nrelease of restricted cash.\nInvestments in Solasglas\nDME Advisors reports the composition of Solasglas’ portfolio on a delta-adjusted basis, which it believes is the\nappropriate manner to assess the exposure and profile of investments and reflects how it manages the portfolio. An option’s\ndelta is the option price’s sensitivity to the underlying stock (or commodity) price. The delta-adjusted basis is the number of\nshares or contracts underlying the option multiplied by the delta and the underlying stock (or commodity) price.\nThe following table represents the composition of Solasglas’ investments:\nJune 30 December 31\n2024 2023\nLong % Short % Long % Short %\nEquities and related derivatives 79.4 % 38.2 % 90.2 % 53.8 %\nPrivate and unlisted equity securities 2.0 — 2.0 —\nDebt instruments 0.3 — 0.3 —\nTotal 81.7 % 38.2 % 92.5 % 53.8 %\nThe above exposure analysis does not include cash (U.S. dollar and foreign currencies), gold and other\ncommodities, credit default swaps, sovereign debt, foreign currency derivatives, interest rate derivatives, inflation swaps and\nother macro positions. Under this methodology, a total return swap’s exposure is reported at its full notional amount and\noptions are reported at their delta-adjusted basis. At June 30, 2024, Solasglas’ exposure to gold on a delta-adjusted basis was\n7.5% (2023: 11.2%).\nAt June 30, 2024, 94.3% of Solasglas’ portfolio was valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets (Level\n1), 4.1% was composed of instruments valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2), and a nominal\namount was composed of instruments valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). At June 30, 2024, 1.6% of Solasglas’\nportfolio consisted of private equity funds valued using the funds’ net asset values as a practical expedient.\n36\nReturn to table of contents\nOther Investments\nThe other investment holdings relate to private investments made by Innovations. During Q2 2024, we made two\nmodest private equity investments. During the YTD 2024, we impaired certain debt securities (see Note 4), resulting in a\ndecrease in the carrying value of these securities.\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\nWe use our restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily for funding trusts and letters of credit issued to our ceding\ninsurers. Our restricted cash decreased by $42.7 million, or 7.1%, from $604.6 million at December 31, 2023, to $561.9 million\nat June 30, 2024, primarily due to release of collateral from our ceding insurers relating to legacy contracts in run-off.\nReinsurance balances receivable\nOur reinsurance balances receivable increased by $67.3 million, or 10.9%, to $686.7 million from $619.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. This increase was driven primarily by the renewal of reinsurance treaties, in addition to new business\nbound during 2024.\nLoss and LAE Reserves; Loss and LAE Recoverable\nOur reserves for loss and LAE by lines of business were as follows:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCase Case\nReserves IBNR Total Reserves IBNR Total\nProperty $ 33,531 $ 49,708 $ 83,239 $ 24,181 $ 41,056 $ 65,237\nCasualty 139,286 317,563 456,849 136,713 299,933 436,646\nOther 37,985 174,684 212,669 28,156 131,515 159,671\nTotal $ 210,802 $ 541,955 $ 752,757 $ 189,050 $ 472,504 $ 661,554\nOur total gross loss and LAE reserves increased by $91.2 million, or 13.8%, to $752.8 million from $661.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. This increase is primarily driven by the increase in earned premium from the renewal of reinsurance\ntreaties and new business, offset partially by paid losses during Q2 2024. See Note 7 “Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense\nReserves” of the financial statements for a summary of changes in outstanding loss and LAE reserves and a description of prior\nperiod loss developments.\nOur total loss and LAE recoverable increased by $33.0 million, or 128.3%, to $58.6 million from $25.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. This increase was driven mainly by the loss recoveries on the Baltimore bridge loss event, the Taiwan\nearthquake (gross losses were mostly retroceded), and the increase in quota share retrocessions for Other Specialty business due\nto growth from inward premiums. See Note 8 “Retrocession” of the financial statements for a description of the credit risk\nassociated with our retrocessionaires.\nProbable Maximum Loss (“PML”)\nAt July 1, 2024, our estimated largest PML at a 1-in-250-year return period for a single event, and in aggregate, was\n$99.9 million and $109.2 million, respectively, both relating to the peril of North Atlantic Hurricane, compared to $103.3\nmillion and $111.5 million, respectively, at April 1, 2024.\n37\nReturn to table of contents\nThe below table contains the expected modeled loss for each of our peak peril regions and sub-regions for both a\nsingle event loss and aggregate loss measures at the 1-in-250-year return period.\nJuly 1, 2024\nNet 1-in-250 Year Return Period\nPeril Single Event Loss Aggregate Loss\nNorth Atlantic Hurricane $ 99,856 $ 109,207\nSoutheast Hurricane 94,455 94,455\nGulf of Mexico Hurricane 52,552 52,715\nNortheast Hurricane 54,688 55,167\nNorth America Earthquake 95,487 96,748\nCalifornia Earthquake 83,828 86,690\nPacific Northwest Earthquake 49,540 49,540\nOther N.A.

Refer to Note 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities” of the financial statements for further information.\nTotal shareholders’ equity\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased by $37.9 million to $634.0 million, compared to $596.1 million at December 31,\n2023. The increase was primarily due to the net income of $35.0 million reported for the period.

In Q2 2024, we partially repaid $11.7 million of the Term loans.\nCapital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our debt and capital structure:\nJune 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nDebt $ 62,188 $ 74,062\nShareholders’ equity $ 634,020 $ 596,095\nRatio of debt to shareholders’ equity 9.7 % 12.4 %\nThe debt to shareholders’ equity provides an indication of our leverage and capital structure, along with some insights\ninto our financial strength. In addition to the above capital, we also have LOC facilities to support our reinsurance business\noperations where we are not licensed or admitted as a reinsurer.\nOur shareholders’ equity increased in YTD 2024 primarily due to net income for the period.\n39\nReturn to table of contents\nOrdinary Shares\nAt June 30, 2024, there were 35,321,144 outstanding ordinary shares, a decrease of 15,588 since December 31, 2023,\ndue to forfeited performance restricted shares net of issuance of ordinary shares for vested RSUs.\nWe did not repurchase any ordinary shares for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\nWe expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business\nstrategy for the foreseeable future. However, to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we\nrequire additional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, we have\nrenewed our $200.0 million shelf registration by filing the Form S-3 registration statement with the SEC, which became\neffective on July 5, 2024, and will expire on July 1, 2027.\nSecured LOC Facilities\nAs disclosed in Note 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities” of Q2 2024 Financials, the $275 million committed capacity under\nthe Citi LOC agreement will terminate on August 20, 2024. However, Citi informed the Company that it intends to continue\nproviding the Citi LOC on an uncommitted basis for the foreseeable future following the termination date.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt June 30, 2024, our contractual obligations and commitments by period due were as follows:\nLess than More than\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total\nOperating activities\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves (1) $ 357,560 $ 238,624 $ 88,825 $ 67,748 $ 752,757\nOperating lease obligations 686 726 — — 1,412\nFinancing activities\nDebt (2) 2,813 59,375 — — 62,188\nTotal $ 361,059 $ 298,725 $ 88,825 $ 67,748 $ 816,357\n(1) Due to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance contractual\nliabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain.\n(2) See Note 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities” of the financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and have required management to make\nassumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including those described in “Part II. Item 1A.\nRisk Factors” included in our 2023 Form 10-K, cause actual events or results to differ materially from our underlying\nassumptions or estimates. In that case, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition,\nor liquidity. The most significant estimates relate to: premium revenues and risk transfer, loss and loss adjustment expense\nreserves, investment impairments, allowances for credit losses, and share-based compensation.\nWe believe that the critical accounting estimates discussion in “Part II. Item 7. — Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results on Operations” of our 2023 Form 10-K continues to describe the significant\nestimates and judgments included in the preparation of these financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAt June 30, 2024, there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we\nexpect could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. See Note 2 “Significant\nAccounting Policies” of the Q2 2024 Financials.\n40\nReturn to table of contents\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRefer to Item 7A included in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to this item since December 31,\n2023.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in such rules) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports prepared in accordance with the rules and\nregulations of the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules\nand forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These\ninherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur\nbecause of simple error or mistake.\nAdditionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,\nor by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its\nstated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,\nor the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-\neffective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended\nJune 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal controls over\nfinancial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the\nCompany’s systems evolve with its business.\n41\nReturn to table of contents\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, we may be involved in formal and informal dispute resolution\nprocedures, which may include arbitration or litigation, the outcomes of which determine our rights and obligations under our\nreinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, we may seek to enforce our rights under an\nagreement or to collect funds owing to us. In other matters, we may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged\nrights. While the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of our existing\ncontractual disputes, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFactors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report are any of the risks described in\n“Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our 2023 Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024. Any of these factors\ncould result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors\nnot presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.\nAs of June 30, 2024, there have been no other material changes to the risk factors disclosed in “Part I. Item 1A. Risk\nFactors” included in our 2023 Form 10-K. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to\ntime in our future filings with the SEC.\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nOur Board has adopted a share repurchase plan. The timing of such repurchases and the actual number of shares\nrepurchased will depend on various factors, including price, market conditions, and applicable regulatory and corporate\nrequirements. On May 3, 2024, our Board of Directors re-approved the share repurchase plan until June 30, 2025, authorizing\nus to repurchase up to $25.0 million of ordinary shares or securities convertible into ordinary shares in the open market, through\nprivately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans. Any shares repurchased are canceled immediately upon\nrepurchase. We are not required to repurchase any of the ordinary shares.

(“Greenlight\nCapital Re,” “Company,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange\nAct”). All statements, other than statements of historical facts included in this report, including statements regarding estimates,\nprojections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon\nwhich those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements”. We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered\nby the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements in the United States (“U.S.”) federal securities laws established by\nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words\n“believe,” “project,” “predict,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will\nbe,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are\nbased on current expectations, estimates and projections, and various assumptions, many of which, are inherently uncertain and\nbeyond management’s control.\nForward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q may include, but are not limited to, information regarding our\nestimates for catastrophes and weather-related losses (herein referred as “CAT losses”), measurements of potential losses in the\nfair market value of our investments, our expectations regarding the performance of our business, our financial results, our\nliquidity and capital resources, the outcome of our strategic initiatives, our expectations regarding pricing, and other market and\neconomic conditions including inflation, our growth prospects, and valuations of the potential impact of movements in interest\nrates, equity securities’ prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.\nForward-looking statements only reflect our expectations and are not guarantees of performance. These statements\ninvolve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual events\nor results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited\nto:\n• a downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings;\n• any suspension or revocation of any of our licenses;\n• losses from catastrophes and other major events;\n• the loss of significant brokers; and\n• those described under “Item 1A, Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31,2023, as filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024 (“2023 Form 10-K”), which is\naccessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new\ninformation, future events, or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements,\nwhich speak only to the dates they were made.\nWe intend to communicate certain events that we believe may have a material adverse impact on our operations or\nfinancial position, including property and casualty catastrophic events and material losses in our investment portfolio, in a\ntimely manner through a public announcement. Other than as required by the Exchange Act, we do not intend to make public\nannouncements regarding underwriting or investment events that we do not believe, based on management’s estimates and\ncurrent information, will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.\n3\nItem 1.

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nOrganization\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE” and, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company”) was\nincorporated as an exempted company under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands on July 13, 2004. The Company is a\nglobal specialty property and casualty reinsurer headquartered in the Cayman Islands. The ordinary shares of GLRE are listed\non Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE.”\nBasis of Presentation\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements (the “financial statements”) have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial\ninformation, and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) instructions to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nand Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP\nfor complete financial statements. The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in the Company’s 2023 Form 10-K. The financial statements include the accounts of\nGLRE and the consolidated financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all significant intercompany transactions\nand balances have been eliminated on consolidation.\nIn the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)\nconsidered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and results of operations as at the end of and\nfor the periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full\nyear.\nTabular dollars are in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts or otherwise noted. All amounts are reported\nin U.S. dollars.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the\ncurrent financial statements. The Company has reported separately the foreign exchange gains (losses) from “Other income” in\nthe condensed consolidated statements of operations. This resulted in no change to the previously reported total revenues or net\nincome. The Company has also included the foreign exchange gains (losses) as part of the net change in working capital in the\ncondensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Further, the Company combined “Other assets, excluding depreciation” and\n“Other liabilities” and presented the sum as “Other items, net” in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. These\nchanges in presentation in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows have resulted in no change to the previously\nreported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in its 2023 Form 10-\nK.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nOn November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new ASU requires\nincremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment, the\nmethod for determining segments, or the criteria for aggregating operating segments into reportable segments. This new\nguidance is effective for the Company’s 2024 year-end financial statements, and should be adopted retrospectively unless\nimpracticable. Early adoption is permitted.\n8\nReturn to table of contents\nOn December 14, 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes Topic (740) - Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures. The new ASU provides more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax\ndisclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. Early adoption is permitted. The\namendments should be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective application is permitted. This ASU is effective\nfor the Company’s 2024 year-end financial statements.\nAs the above ASUs relate solely to financial statement disclosures, the adoption of these ASUs will not impact the\nCompany’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n3. INVESTMENT IN RELATED PARTY INVESTMENT FUND\nThere has been no change to the Company’s agreement with Solasglas Investments, LP (“SILP” or “Solasglas”) as\ndescribed in its 2023 Form 10-K.\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss relating to SILP is limited to GLRE's share of Partners’ capital in SILP.

The magnitude and volume of losses arising from these events is\ninherently uncertain and, consequently, actual losses for these events may ultimately differ, potentially materially, from current\nestimates.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized CAT loss, net of reinsurance, of $12.4 million\nfor current year CAT loss events, driven mainly by the Baltimore bridge collapse and satellite failures. Additionally, the\nCompany incurred $4.9 million of net adverse prior year CAT loss development relating primarily to a Mexican state-owned\noil platform fire (2023 underwriting year), Hurricane Otis (2023 underwriting year) and homeowners’ property (mostly 2022\nunderwriting year).\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized CAT loss, net of reinsurance, of $6.2 million\nfor current year CAT loss events, driven mainly by the Turkey earthquake, the New Zealand Cyclone Gabrielle and the U.S.\n13\nReturn to table of contents\nconvective storms that occurred during the quarter, coupled with adverse prior year CAT development of $4.1 million relating\nto the 2022 Winter Storm Elliott.\nPrior Year Reserve Development\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company experienced $5.4 million in net adverse development on\nprior year loss and LAE reserves. This was comprised of $10.5 million of reserve strengthening predominantly for the above\nprior year CAT loss events, coupled with additional losses reported on general liability contracts (mostly 2015-2017\nunderwriting years) due to current economic and social inflation trends. The reserve increases were partially offset by\n$5.1 million favorable loss development predominantly from FAL and other specialty business (2022 and 2023 underwriting\nyears).\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company experienced $12.0 million in net adverse development on\nprior year loss and LAE reserves. This was comprised of $13.9 million of reserve strengthening on casualty contracts due to\ncurrent economic and social inflation trends (mostly 2019 and 2021 underwriting years), as well as on homeowners’ business\nprimary due to the deterioration in the CAT loss estimate relating to Winter Storm Elliott (2022 underwriting year). This was\npartially offset by $1.9 million better than expected loss emergence for other lines of business (mostly 2021 and 2022\nunderwriting years).\n8. RETROCESSION\nFrom time to time, the Company purchases retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to manage\nits overall exposure, reduce its net liability on individual risks, obtain additional underwriting capacity, and balance its\nunderwriting portfolio.

The outcomes of these procedures determine the rights and\nobligations under the Company’s reinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, the Company may\nseek to enforce its rights under an agreement or collect funds owed. In other matters, the Company may resist attempts by\nothers to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of legal disputes with certainty,\nthe Company does not believe that any existing dispute, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, or operating results.\n20\nReturn to table of contents\n16.

Our goal is to build long-term\nshareholder value by providing risk management solutions to the insurance, reinsurance, and other risk marketplaces.\nWe earned net income of $27.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $21.1 million, or\n359% over the same period in the prior year, principally due to stronger performance from our investment in SILP and to a\nlesser extent improved underwriting performance despite higher CAT losses.\nThe following is a summary of our financial performance for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the\nsame period in 2023:\n• Gross premiums written was $217.3 million, an increase of 16.5%;\n• Net premiums earned was $161.5 million, an increase of 13.2%;\n• Net underwriting income (1) was $3.4 million, compared to $0.4 million;\n• Total investment income was $26.4 million, an increase of 403.6% (including 5.2% net return from our\ninvestment in SILP, compared to a loss of 1.1%);\n• Diluted EPS was $0.78, compared to $0.17; and\n• Fully diluted book value per share(1) was $17.39, an increase of 3.9%.\n(1) See “Key Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures” section of this MD&A.\nOutlook and Trends\nFurther to increasing competition in the market at the January 1, 2024 renewal season, we have continued to see higher\nlevels of competition in the market in most classes of business throughout the first quarter. Most notably at the April 1\nrenewals, we observed an increase in capacity related to property catastrophe and specialty classes. Specific to Japanese\nproperty renewals, the pricing was impacted by the devaluation of the Japanese Yen over the trailing 12 months. We have seen\nmarket conditions stabilize relative to prior year, but continue to view the property and specialty market as attractive.\nMarket headline catastrophic events occurring in the first quarter of 2024 include the January 1 Noto Peninsula\nearthquake in Japan and the March 26 collapse of the Francis Scott Key bridge in Baltimore, Maryland. The Japan earthquake\nevent is anticipated to result in minimal losses ceded to the reinsurance market, and market conditions at the April 1 renewal\nreflected this, with risk adjusted rates modestly down and little evidence of supply constraints. Conversely, market sources are\nindicating that the Baltimore bridge collapse might be among the largest-ever Marine industry losses. As a result we expect the\nMarine & Energy reinsurance market to continue experiencing favorable pricing conditions.\n23\nReturn to table of contents\nKey Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures\nThere have been no changes to our key financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures, as described in the\nMD&A of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nFully Diluted Book Value Per Share\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the fully diluted book value per share to basic book value per share (the\nmost directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure):\nMarch 31, December September June 30, March 31,\n2024 31, 2023 30, 2023 2023 2023\nNumerator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share:\nTotal equity as reported under U.S. GAAP $ 624,458 $ 596,095 $ 575,865 $ 561,121 $ 510,041\nDenominator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share:\nOrdinary shares issued and outstanding as\nreported and denominator for basic book\nvalue per share 35,321,144 35,336,732 35,337,407 35,272,013 35,262,678\nAdd: In-the-money stock options (1) and all\noutstanding RSUs 585,334 264,870 312,409 312,409 312,409\nDenominator for fully diluted book value\nper share 35,906,478 35,601,602 35,649,816 35,584,422 35,575,087\nBasic book value per share $ 17.68 $ 16.87 $ 16.30 $ 15.91 $ 14.46\nIncrease in basic book value per share ($) $ 0.81 $ 0.57 $ 0.39 $ 1.45 $ 0.01\nIncrease in basic book value per share (%) 4.8 % 3.5 % 2.5 % 10.0 % 0.1 %\nFully diluted book value per share $ 17.39 $ 16.74 $ 16.15 $ 15.77 $ 14.34\nIncrease in fully diluted book value per\nshare ($) $ 0.65 $ 0.59 $ 0.38 $ 1.43 $ 0.01\nIncrease in fully diluted book value per\nshare (%) 3.9 % 3.7 % 2.4 % 10.0 % 0.1 %\n(1) Assuming net exercise by the grantee.\nThe above comparative prior quarters have been restated to conform with the revised calculation for basic and fully\ndiluted book value per share as described in the MD&A of our 2023 Form 10-K.\n24\nReturn to table of contents\nNet Underwriting Income (Loss)\nThe reconciliations of net underwriting income (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes (the most directly comparable\nU.S. GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis are shown below:\nThree months ended March 31\n2024 2023\nIncome before income tax $ 27,538 $ 5,941\nAdd (subtract):\nTotal investment income (26,391) (5,240)\nForeign exchange losses (gains) 1,649 (4,931)\nOther non-underwriting income (5,035) (2,166)\nCorporate expenses 4,375 5,997\nInterest expense 1,249 776\nNet underwriting income $ 3,385 $ 377\n25\nReturn to table of contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe table below summarizes our consolidated operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\n2024 2023\nUnderwriting revenue\nGross premiums written $ 217,258 $ 186,455\nGross premiums ceded (23,181) (11,212)\nNet premiums written 194,077 175,243\nChange in net unearned premium reserves (32,541) (32,594)\nNet premiums earned $ 161,536 $ 142,649\nUnderwriting related expenses\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred:\nCurrent year $ 103,925 $ 84,687\nPrior year (1) 5,401 12,038\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 109,326 96,725\nAcquisition costs 41,610 41,476\nUnderwriting expenses 6,339 3,939\nDeposit interest expense 876 132\nNet underwriting income (2) $ 3,385 $ 377\nIncome (loss) from investment in Solasglas $ 18,248 $ (3,138)\nNet investment income 8,143 8,378\nTotal investment income $ 26,391 $ 5,240\nCorporate expenses $ 4,375 $ 5,997\nForeign exchange losses (gains) 1,649 (4,931)\nOther income, net (5,035) (2,166)\nInterest expense 1,249 776\nIncome tax expense 519 54\nNet income $ 27,019 $ 5,887\nEarnings per share:\nBasic $ 0.79 $ 0.17\nDiluted $ 0.78 $ 0.17\nUnderwriting ratios:\nLoss ratio - current year 64.4 % 59.4 %\nLoss ratio - prior year 3.3 % 8.4 %\nLoss ratio 67.7 % 67.8 %\nAcquisition cost ratio 25.8 % 29.1 %\nComposite ratio 93.5 % 96.9 %\nUnderwriting expense ratio 4.5 % 2.9 %\nCombined ratio 98.0 % 99.8 %\n1 The net financial impacts associated with changes in the estimate of losses incurred in prior years, which incorporate earned\nreinstatement premiums assumed and ceded, adjustments to assumed and ceded acquisition costs, and deposit interest expense,\nwere a loss of $5.4 million and $12.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n26\nReturn to table of contents\n2 Net underwriting income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, basic book\nvalue per share increased by $0.81 per share, or 4.8%, to $17.68 per share from $16.87 per share at December 31, 2023.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, our net income was $27.0 million, compared to net income of $5.9\nmillion reported for the equivalent 2023 period.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during Q1 2024, compared to the\nequivalent 2023 period, are summarized below:\n• Underwriting income: Increased by $3.0 million primarily driven by 1.8 percentage points improvement in our\ncombined ratio due to lower adverse prior year loss development and acquisition costs, offset partially by an\nincrease in underwriting costs. Current year CAT losses contributed 7.7% to our combined ratio, compared to\n4.3% in Q1 2023. For further information on CAT losses and prior year loss development, refer to Note 7 - Loss\nand Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves of the Q1 2024 Financials.\n• Investment income: Increased by $21.2 million primarily driven by stronger results from SILP. Our investment\nin SILP reported a gain of $18.2 million during Q1 2024, compared to a loss of $3.1 million during the equivalent\nperiod in 2023. SILP generated a net return of 5.2% for Q1 2024.\n• Corporate expense: Decreased by $1.6 million mainly due to non-recurring severance costs included in Q1 2023\nand lower outside legal costs following the hiring of our new General Counsel in April 2023.\n• Foreign exchange gains (losses): $1.6 million foreign exchange losses for Q1 2024, compared to $4.9 million\nforeign exchange gains in Q1 2023, driven mainly by the reversal of the pound sterling movement against the U.S.\ndollar; and\n• Other income, net: Increased by $2.9 million due to stronger investment income on funds withheld by third party\nLloyd’s syndicates, reported on a quarterly lag basis.\nUnderwriting Results by Segment\nThe following provides a further discussion of our underwriting results for our Property & Casualty (Re)insurance\noperating segment for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nGross Premiums Written\nDetails of gross premiums written are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended March 31\n2024 2023 (1)\nProperty $ 25,176 11.6 % $ 30,560 16.4 %\nCasualty 106,789 49.2 87,124 46.7\nOther 85,293 39.3 68,771 36.9\nTotal $ 217,258 100.0 % $ 186,455 100.0 %\n(1) As a result of the reclassification of certain treaties within the lines of business (see Note 16 of the Q1 2024 Financials), the gross premiums written for Property, Casualty,\nand Other were restated accordingly. However, there was no change to the Total gross premiums written.\nAs a result of our underwriting philosophy, the total premiums we write and the mix of premiums between property,\n27\nReturn to table of contents\ncasualty, and other business, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the market opportunities we identify.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, our gross premiums written increased by $30.8 million, or 16.5%,\ncompared to the equivalent 2023 period. The following table provides a further analysis of this overall increase:\nGross Premiums Written\nThree months ended March 31, 2024\nIncrease\n(decrease) % change Explanation\n($ in millions)\nProperty $(5.4) (17.6)% The decrease was driven predominantly by the non-renewal of a homeowner\ntreaty within Personal class in order to reduce our exposure to U.S. severe\nconvective storms. This was offset partially by growth in the Commercial class\ndriven by new business. This resulted in a change in business mix for Property,\nwith Commercial and Personal accounting for 72% and 28%, respectively, of\ntotal Property compared to 48% and 51%, respectively, for the same quarter in\n2023.\nCasualty $19.7 22.6% The increase was driven predominantly from new quota share business in 2023\nand 2024 within our Syndicate 3456, which is included in our Multi-line class.\nThis was partially offset by lower renewals in our Professional class.\nAs a result, the business mix within our Casualty line of business has changed\nwith General Liability and Multi-line classes accounting for 20% and 70% of\ntotal Casualty, respectively, compared to 24% and 62% in same period in 2023.\nOther $16.5 24.0% The increase was driven mainly from new business in our Marine and Energy\nclass, including Lloyd’s whole account excess of loss treaties, offset partially by\nlower premiums written within Financial relating to Mortgage business.\nPremiums Ceded\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, premiums ceded were $23.2 million, or 10.7% of gross premiums written,\ncompared to $11.2 million, or 6.0% of gross premiums written, for the same quarter in 2023. The increase was primarily due to\nthe purchase of an additional reinsurance coverage to reduce our overall exposure to Marine and Energy class in light of recent\ngrowth in this class of business, coupled with an increase in quota share retrocessions for Other Specialty business due to\ngrowth from inward premiums.\nNet Premiums Written\nDetails of net premiums written are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended March 31\n2024 2023 (1)\nProperty $ 21,204 10.9 % $ 26,193 14.9 %\nCasualty 99,450 51.3 87,196 49.8\nOther 73,423 37.8 61,854 35.3\nTotal $ 194,077 100.0 % $ 175,243 100.0 %\n(1) As a result of the reclassification of certain treaties within the lines of business (see Note 16), the net premiums written for Property, Casualty, and Other were restated\naccordingly.

However, there was no change to the Total acquisition cost ratio.\nThe following provides further details on the change in Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2023.\nChange in Acquisition Cost Ratios\nThree months ended March 31, 2024\nIncrease / (decrease)\nin acquisition cost Explanation\nratio points\nProperty 0.1 No significant change.\nCasualty (3.1) The decrease was driven primarily by change in business mix, particularly due to an\nincrease in net premiums earned from general liability and a decrease from multi-line\nbusiness within Casualty. The multi-line class (including FAL) has a higher ceding\ncommission.\nOther (5.2) The decrease was driven primarily by change in business mix, in which we had lower net\npremiums earned from the Financial class at higher acquisition costs offset by higher net\npremiums earned from Other Specialty class at lower acquisition costs. Excess of loss\ncontracts accounted for 30% of the net premiums earned for Other Specialty class in Q1\n2024, compared to 28% in Q1 2023.\nRatio Analysis\nThe following table provides our underwriting ratios by line of business for the respective periods:\nThree months ended March 31 Three months ended March 31\n2024 2023\nProperty Casualty Other Total Property Casualty Other Total\nLoss ratio 51.3 % 63.4 % 85.7 % 67.7 % 93.4 % 73.1 % 45.6 % 67.8 %\nAcquisition cost ratio 19.7 27.6 25.0 25.8 19.6 30.7 30.2 29.1\nComposite ratio 71.0 % 91.0 % 110.7 % 93.5 % 113.0 % 103.8 % 75.8 % 96.9 %\nUnderwriting expense ratio 4.5 2.9\nCombined ratio 98.0 % 99.8 %\nOur combined ratio improved by 1.8 percentage points in the current quarter compared to Q1 2023 predominantly due\nto lower acquisition costs ratio; partially offset by an increase in underwriting expense ratio (see G&A Expenses below for\nfurther details).\n31\nReturn to table of contents\nGeneral and Administrative (“G&A”) Expenses\nThe breakdown of our G&A expenses between underwriting and corporate functions was as follows:\nThree months ended March 31\n2024 2023\nUnderwriting expenses $ 6,339 $ 3,939\nCorporate expenses 4,375 5,997\nGeneral and administrative expenses $ 10,714 $ 9,936\nG&A increased by 7.8% in the current quarter, compared to Q1 2023. The increase was driven by:\n• Underwriting expenses: Increased by $2.4 million or 60.9%, predominantly due to an increase in headcount to\ndrive business growth, coupled with an increase in professional fees and outsourced services relating to underwriting\nactivities. As a result, our underwriting expense ratio increased by 1.6 percentage points in the current quarter\ncompared to Q1 2023.\n• Corporate expenses: Decreased by $1.6 million or 27.0%, driven mainly by non-recurring severance costs\nincluded in Q1 2023 and lower outside legal costs following the hiring of our new General Counsel in April 2023.\nTotal Investment Income\nA summary of our total investment income is as follows:\nThree months ended March 31\n2024 2023\nInterest and dividend income, net of withholding taxes and other expenses $ 8,556 $ 8,628\nNet realized and unrealized gains on other investments (see Note 4) (413) (250)\nNet investment-related income $ 8,143 $ 8,378\nShare of Solasglas' net income (see Note 3) 18,248 (3,138)\nTotal investment income $ 26,391 $ 5,240\nNet investment-related income\nOur net investment-related income decreased marginally compared to Q1 2023, driven mostly by an impairment\ncharge relating to our Innovations-related investments.\nShare of Solasglas’ net income\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, Solasglas reported a gain of 5.2%, compared to a loss of 1.1% for the\nsame quarter in 2023. The following table provides a breakdown of the gross and net investment return.\nThree months ended March 31\n2024 2023\nLong portfolio gains (losses) 4.4 % 8.9 %\nShort portfolio gains (losses) 0.0 (9.0)\nMacro gains (losses) 1.8 (0.3)\nOther income and expenses 1 (0.5) (0.7)\nGross investment return 5.7 % (1.1) %\nNet investment return 1 5.2 % (1.1) %\n1 “Other income and expenses” excludes performance compensation but includes management fees. “Net investment return” incorporates\nboth of these amounts. For further information about management fees and performance compensation, refer to Note 3.\n32\nReturn to table of contents\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, the significant contributors to SILP’s investment return were long\npositions in Green Brick Partners (GRBK), Tenet Healthcare (THC), and an S&P 500 / U.S. interest rate derivative position.\nThe largest detractors were long positions in Penn National Gaming (PENN), CONSOL Energy (CEIX), and a single-name\nshort position.\nEach month, we post on our website (www.greenlightre.com) the returns from our investment in SILP.\nFinancial Condition\nInvestments\nThe following table provides a breakdown of our total investments:\nMarch 31\n2024 2023\nInvestment in related party investment fund (SILP) $ 307,138 80.9 % $ 258,890 78.0 %\nOther investments:\nPrivate investments and unlisted equities 71,577 18.8 71,157 21.4\nDebt and convertible debt securities 1,079 0.3 2,136 0.6\nTotal other investments $ 72,656 19.1 % $ 73,293 22.0 %\nTotal investments $ 379,794 100.0 % $ 332,183 100.0 %\nAt March 31, 2024, our total investments increased by $47.6 million, or 14.3%, to $379.8 million from December 31,\n2023. The increase was primarily driven by $30.0 million of additional contributions into SILP, coupled with the net\ninvestment return for Q1 2024.\nInvestments in SILP\nDME Advisors reports the composition of SILP’s portfolio on a delta-adjusted basis, which it believes is the appropriate\nmanner to assess the exposure and profile of investments and reflects how it manages the portfolio. An option’s delta is the\noption price’s sensitivity to the underlying stock (or commodity) price. The delta-adjusted basis is the number of shares or\ncontracts underlying the option multiplied by the delta and the underlying stock (or commodity) price.\nThe following table represents the composition of SILP’s investments:\nMarch 31\n2024 2023\nLong % Short % Long % Short %\nEquities and related derivatives 83.7 45.6 90.2 53.8\nPrivate and unlisted equity securities 1.8 — 2.0 —\nDebt instruments 0.2 % — 0.3 % —\nTotal 85.7 % 45.6 % 92.5 % 53.8 %\nThe above exposure analysis does not include cash (U.S. dollar and foreign currencies), gold and other\ncommodities, credit default swaps, sovereign debt, foreign currency derivatives, interest rate derivatives, inflation swaps and\nother macro positions. Under this methodology, a total return swap’s exposure is reported at its full notional amount and\noptions are reported at their delta-adjusted basis. At March 31, 2024, SILP’s exposure to gold on a delta-adjusted basis was\n8.7% (Q1 2023: 11.2%).\nAt March 31, 2024, 95.2% of SILP’s portfolio was valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets (Level\n1), 3.4% was composed of instruments valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2), and a nominal\namount was composed of instruments valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). At March 31, 2024, 1.4% of SILP’s\nportfolio consisted of private equity funds valued using the funds’ net asset values as a practical expedient.\n33\nReturn to table of contents\nOther Investments\nThe other investment holdings relate to private investments made by Innovations. During Q1 2024, we made no new\nprivate investments compared to $1.1 million in Q1 2023.\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\nWe use our restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily for funding trusts and letters of credit issued to our ceding\ninsurers. Our restricted cash decreased by $23.4 million, or 3.9%, from $604.6 million at December 31, 2023, to $581.2 million\nat March 31, 2024, primarily due to release of collateral from our ceding insurers relating to legacy contracts in run-off.\nReinsurance balances receivable\nOur reinsurance balances receivable increased by $74.3 million, or 12.0%, to $693.7 million from $619.4 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. This increase was driven primarily by the renewal of reinsurance treaties, in addition to new business in\nQ1 2024.\nLoss and LAE Reserves; Loss and LAE Recoverable\nOur reserves for loss and LAE by lines of business were as follows:\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCase Case\nReserves IBNR Total Reserves IBNR Total\nProperty $ 21,302 $ 47,212 $ 68,514 $ 24,181 $ 41,056 $ 65,237\nCasualty 139,602 313,964 453,566 136,713 299,933 436,646\nOther 31,159 177,416 208,575 28,156 131,515 159,671\nTotal $ 192,063 $ 538,592 $ 730,655 $ 189,050 $ 472,504 $ 661,554\nOur total gross loss and LAE reserves increased by $69.1 million, or 10.4%, to $730.7 million from $661.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. This increase is primarily driven by the increase in earned premium from the renewal of reinsurance and\nnew business, offset partially by paid losses during Q1 2024. See Note 7 “Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves” of the\nfinancial statements for a summary of changes in outstanding loss and LAE reserves and a description of prior period loss\ndevelopments.\nOur total loss and LAE recoverable increased by $19.1 million, or 74.3%, to $44.8 million from $25.7 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. This increase was driven mainly by the loss recoveries on the Baltimore bridge loss event. See Note 8\n“Retrocession” of the financial statements for a description of the credit risk associated with our retrocessionaires.\nProbable Maximum Loss (“PML”)\nAt April 1, 2024, our estimated largest PML at a 1-in-250-year return period for a single event, and in aggregate, was\n$103.3 million and $111.5 million, respectively, both relating to the peril of North Atlantic Hurricane, compared to $89.7\nmillion and $97.0 million, respectively, at January 1, 2024. We have increased our PMLs in response to favorable market\nconditions and attractive opportunities, coupled with higher surplus to remain within our risk management appetite.\n34\nReturn to table of contents\nThe below table contains the expected modeled loss for each of our peak peril regions and sub-regions for both a\nsingle event loss and aggregate loss measures at the 1-in-250-year return period.\nApril 1, 2024\nNet 1-in-250 Year Return Period\nPeril Single Event Loss Aggregate Loss\n($ in thousands)\nNorth Atlantic Hurricane $ 103,280 $ 111,476\nSoutheast Hurricane 95,403 95,403\nGulf of Mexico Hurricane 61,386 61,665\nNortheast Hurricane 57,095 58,208\nNorth America Earthquake 99,527 101,462\nCalifornia Earthquake 83,432 88,535\nPacific Northwest Earthquake 53,268 53,268\nOther N.A.

Refer to\nNote 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities” of the financial statements for further information.\nTotal shareholders’ equity\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased by $28.4 million to $624.5 million, compared to $596.1 million at December 31,\n2023. The increase was primarily due to the net income of $27.0 million reported for the quarter. For details of other\nmovements in shareholders’ equity, see the condensed consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity.\n35\nReturn to table of contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nRefer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section included in Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K for a general\ndiscussion of liquidity and capital resources.\nLiquidity\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of funds:\nThree months ended March 31\n2024 2023\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 17,960 $ (1,259)\nInvesting activities (29,832) (22,076)\nFinancing activities (938) (17,085)\nEffect of currency exchange on cash(1) (114) 132\nNet cash inflows (outflows) (12,924) (40,288)\nCash, beginning of period 655,730 706,548\nCash, end of period $ 642,806 $ 666,260\n(1)\nCash includes unrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents - see Note 5 of the financial statements.\nCash provided by operating activities\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven mainly by $3.0 million improved underwriting\nincome, coupled with the ebb and flow from our underwriting activities, which may vary significantly from period to period\ndepending on the mix of business, the nature of underwriting opportunities available and volume of claims submitted to us by\nour cedents.\nCash used in investing activities\nThe increase in cash used for investing activities was driven mainly by the net change in our investment in SILP where\nwe made a net contribution of $30.0 million during Q1 2024 compared to a net redemption of $21.0 million during Q1 2023.\nDuring Q1 2023, we also made $1.1 million additional Innovations-related investments.\nCash used in financing activities\nThe decrease in cash used in our financing activities was driven mainly by the repurchase of a portion of the\noutstanding Convertible Notes in Q1 2023. In Q1 2024, we made the quarterly installment on the Term Loans.\nCapital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our capital structure:\nMarch 31, 2024 December 31, 2023\nDebt $ 73,125 $ 74,062\nShareholders’ equity 624,458 596,095\nTotal capital $ 697,583 $ 670,157\nRatio of debt to shareholders’ equity 11.7 % 12.4 %\nThe debt to shareholders’ equity provides an indication of our leverage and capital structure, along with some insights\ninto our financial strength. In addition to the above capital, we also have LOC facilities to support our reinsurance business\noperations where we are not licensed or admitted as a reinsurer.\nOur total capital increased in Q1 2024 primarily due to net income for the quarter.\n36\nReturn to table of contents\nOrdinary Shares\nAt March 31, 2024, there were 35,321,144 outstanding ordinary shares, a decrease of 15,588 since December 31,\n2023, due to forfeited performance restricted shares net of issuance of ordinary shares for vested RSUs.\nWe did not repurchase any ordinary shares for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nWe expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business\nstrategy for the foreseeable future. However, to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we\nrequire additional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, we have\nfiled a Form S-3 registration statement, which expires in July 2024.\nSecured LOC Facilities\nAs disclosed in Note 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities” of Q1 2024 Financials, the $275 million committed capacity under\nthe Citi LOC agreement will terminate on August 20, 2024. However, Citi informed the Company that it intends to continue\nproviding the Citi LOC on an uncommitted basis for the foreseeable future following the termination date.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt March 31, 2024, our contractual obligations and commitments by period due were as follows:\nLess than More than\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total\nOperating activities\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves (1) $ 347,061 $ 231,618 $ 86,217 $ 65,759 $ 730,655\nOperating lease obligations 509 1,075 — — 1,584\nFinancing activities\nDebt (2) 2,813 70,312 — — 73,125\nTotal $ 350,383 $ 303,005 $ 86,217 $ 65,759 $ 805,364\n(1) Due to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance contractual\nliabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain.\n(2) See Note 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities” of the financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and have required management to make\nassumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including those described in “Part II. Item 1A.\nRisk Factors” included in our 2023 Form 10-K, cause actual events or results to differ materially from our underlying\nassumptions or estimates. In that case, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition,\nor liquidity. The most significant estimates relate to: premium revenues and risk transfer, loss and loss adjustment expense\nreserves, investment impairments, allowances for credit losses, and share-based compensation.\nWe believe that the critical accounting estimates discussion in “Part II. Item 7. — Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results on Operations” of our 2023 Form 10-K continues to describe the significant\nestimates and judgments included in the preparation of these financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAt March 31, 2024, there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we\nexpect could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. See Note 2 “Significant\nAccounting Policies” of the Q1 2024 Financials.\n37\nReturn to table of contents\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur financial instruments are subject to a variety of market risks. The term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising\nfrom adverse changes from:\n•\nequity price;\n•\ncommodity price;\n•\nforeign currency; and\n•\ninterest rate (including credit spreads).\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis below to estimate the effects that market risk exposure could have on the future\nearnings, fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments. These represent forward-looking statements of market risk\nassuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected\nresults due to actual developments in the global financial markets.\nEquity Price Risk\nAt March 31, 2024, our investments consisted primarily of an investment in SILP. Among SILP’s holdings are equity\nsecurities, the carrying values of which are based primarily on quoted market prices. Generally, market prices of common\nequity securities are subject to fluctuation, which could cause the amount to be realized upon closing a position to differ\nsignificantly from its current reported value. This risk is partly mitigated by the presence of both long and short equity\nsecurities as part of SILP’s investment strategy. At March 31, 2024, a 10% decline in the price of each of the underlying listed\nequity securities and equity-based derivative instruments would result in a $14.4 million (2023: $8.1 million) unrealized loss in\nour investment in SILP.\nCommodity Price Risk\nGenerally, market prices of commodities are subject to fluctuation. SILP’s investments periodically include long or short\ninvestments in commodities or derivatives directly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of commodities. At March 31, 2024,\nSILP’s investments incorporate unhedged exposure to changes in gold, copper, uranium, and crude oil prices.\nThe following table summarizes the net impact that a 10% movement in commodity prices would have on the fair value\nof SILP’s investment portfolio. The below table excludes the indirect effect that changes in commodity prices might have on\nequity securities in the SILP’s investment portfolio.\n10% increase in commodity 10% decrease in commodity\nprices prices\nMarch 31, 2024 ($ in millions)\nGold $ 3.3 $ (3.3)\nCopper 1.5 (1.3)\nUranium 0.5 (0.5)\nCrude oil 1.6 (1.5)\nTotal $ 6.9 $ (6.6)\n10% increase in commodity 10% decrease in commodity\nprices prices\nDecember 31, 2023 ($ in millions)\nGold $ 3.8 $ (3.8)\nUranium 0.8 (0.8)\nCrude oil 1.6 (1.5)\nTotal $ 6.2 $ (6.1)\n38\nReturn to table of contents\nForeign Currency Risk\nUnderwriting Related\nCertain of our reinsurance contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, whereby premiums are receivable and losses\nare payable in foreign currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that our foreign currency reinsurance\nbalances are more than (or less than) the corresponding foreign currency cash balances, and there is an increase (or decrease) in\nthe exchange rate of that foreign currency.\nWhile we do not seek to precisely match our liabilities under reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies\nwith investments denominated in such currencies, we continually monitor our exposure to potential foreign currency losses and\nmay use foreign currency cash and cash equivalents or forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate against adverse\nforeign currency movements.\nCertain cedents, particularly the Lloyd’s syndicates, report to us in foreign currencies even though some or all of the\nunderlying exposure is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations may report a foreign\nexchange gain or loss associated with this exposure when reported by the cedents. Additionally, we may report foreign\nexchange gains or losses due to the mismatch between the currency exchange rates applied to foreign-denominated (i) monetary\nbalances and (ii) non-monetary balances under U.S. GAAP. See Note 2 of the accompanying financial statements for further\ninformation regarding our accounting treatment of foreign currency transactions.\nWe monitor our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities on an “underlying exposure” basis without\ndistinguishing between monetary and non-monetary balances.\nThe following table summarizes the net impact of a hypothetical 10% currency rate movement relating to our primary\nforeign denominated reinsurance net assets or liabilities (including balances held at Lloyd's):\nNet Asset\n(Liability) 10% increase in 10% decrease in\nMarch 31, 2024 Exposure currency rate currency rate\nGBP £ 31,671 $ (3,997) $ 3,997\nEuro € (13,082) 1,412 (1,412)\nTotal foreign exchange gain (loss) $ (2,585) $ 2,585\nNet Asset\n(Liability) 10% increase in 10% decrease in\nDecember 31, 2023 Exposure currency rate currency rate\nGBP £ 25,337 $ (3,228) $ 3,228\nEuro € (13,975) 1,543 (1,543)\nTotal foreign exchange gain (loss) $ (1,685) $ 1,685\nInvestment in SILP\nWe may also be exposed to foreign currency risk through SILP’s underlying cash, forwards, options, and investments in\nsecurities denominated in foreign currencies. At March 31, 2024, most of SILP’s currency exposures resulting from foreign-\ndenominated securities (longs and shorts) were reduced by offsetting cash balances denominated in the corresponding foreign\ncurrencies.\nAt March 31, 2024 and 2023, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would\nhave no meaningful impact on our investment in SILP.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe primary market risk exposure for any debt instrument is interest rate risk, including credit spreads. Most of our\ninterest rate risk relates to interest rate derivatives held in SILP, and their value may fluctuate with changes in interest rates.\n39\nReturn to table of contents\nAt March 31, 2024, our investment in SILP includes interest-rate sensitive securities, such as corporate and sovereign\ndebt instruments and interest rate derivatives. A 100 basis points change (increase or decrease) in interest rates would result in a\n$14.0 million gain (December 31, 2023: $1.6 million) or a $2.5 million (December 31, 2023: $3.5 million) loss, respectively, to\nour investment in SILP.\nWe, along with DME Advisors, monitor the net exposure to interest rate risk and generally do not expect changes in\ninterest rates to have a materially adverse impact on our operations.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in such rules) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports prepared in accordance with the rules and\nregulations of the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules\nand forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These\ninherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur\nbecause of simple error or mistake.\nAdditionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,\nor by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its\nstated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,\nor the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-\neffective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal controls over\nfinancial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the\nCompany’s systems evolve with its business.\n40\nReturn to table of contents\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, we may be involved in formal and informal dispute resolution\nprocedures, which may include arbitration or litigation, the outcomes of which determine our rights and obligations under our\nreinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, we may seek to enforce our rights under an\nagreement or to collect funds owing to us. In other matters, we may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged\nrights. While the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of our existing\ncontractual disputes, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFactors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report are any of the risks described in\n“Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our 2023 Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 5, 2024. Any of these factors\ncould result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors\nnot presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.\nAs of March 31, 2024, there have been no other material changes to the risk factors disclosed in “Part I. Item 1A. Risk\nFactors” included in our 2023 Form 10-K. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to\ntime in our future filings with the SEC.\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nOur Board has adopted a share repurchase plan. The timing of such repurchases and the actual number of shares\nrepurchased will depend on various factors, including price, market conditions, and applicable regulatory and corporate\nrequirements. On May 3, 2024, our Board of Directors re-approved the share repurchase plan until June 30, 2025, authorizing\nus to repurchase up to $25.0 million of ordinary shares or securities convertible into ordinary shares in the open market, through\nprivately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans. Any shares repurchased are canceled immediately upon\nrepurchase. We are not required to repurchase any of the ordinary shares. The repurchase plan may be modified, suspended, or\nterminated at the election of our Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nThere were no share repurchases made under the plan during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nItem 3.

All statements, other than statements of historical facts included in this report, including statements\nregarding estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the\nassumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements”. We intend these forward-looking\nstatements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements in the United States (“U.S.”) federal\nsecurities laws established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally\nare identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “predict,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,”\n“should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements\nare not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections, and various assumptions, many of\nwhich, are inherently uncertain and beyond management’s control.\nForward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K may include, but are not limited to, information regarding our\nestimates for catastrophes and weather-related losses, measurements of potential losses in the fair market value of our\ninvestments, our expectations regarding the performance of our business, our financial results, our liquidity and capital\nresources, the outcome of our strategic initiatives, our expectations regarding pricing, and other market and economic\nconditions including inflation, our growth prospects, and valuations of the potential impact of movements in interest rates,\nequity securities’ prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.\nForward-looking statements only reflect our expectations and are not guarantees of performance. These statements\ninvolve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual events\nor results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited\nto:\n• a downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings;\n• any suspension or revocation of any of our licenses;\n• losses from catastrophes and other major events;\n• the loss of significant brokers; and\n• those described under “Item 1A, Risk Factors”of this Form 10-K, including the summary below, as those risk\nfactors may be updated from time to time in our periodic and other filings with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”), which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new\ninformation, future events, or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements,\nwhich speak only to the dates they were made.\nWe intend to communicate certain events that we believe may have a material adverse impact on our operations or\nfinancial position, including property and casualty catastrophic events and material losses in our investment portfolio, in a\ntimely manner through a public announcement. Other than as required by the Exchange Act, we do not intend to make public\nannouncements regarding underwriting or investment events that we do not believe, based on management’s estimates and\ncurrent information, will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.\n3\nLink to Table of Contents\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that we believe could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial\nresults.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\n• Our results of operations fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\n• A downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement\nour business strategy.\n• If our losses and loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”) greatly exceed our loss reserves, our financial condition may be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\n• Our property and casualty reinsurance operations make us vulnerable to losses from catastrophes and may cause our\nresults of operations to vary significantly from period to period.\n• The loss of significant brokers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nRisks Relating to Insurance and Other Regulations\n• Any suspension or revocation of any of our licenses would materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n• Our reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these\nrequirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nRisks Relating to Our SILP Investment Strategy\n• Our investment performance depends in part on the performance of Solaglas Investments, LP (“SILP”) and may suffer\nas a result of adverse financial market developments or other factors that impact SILP’s liquidity, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our investment results, financial condition and results of operations.\n• SILP may be concentrated in a few large positions, which could result in material adverse valuation movements.\n• Under the SILP limited partnership agreement (“SILP LPA”), we are contractually obligated to invest substantially all\nour assets in SILP, with certain exceptions. SILP’s performance depends on the ability of its investment advisor, DME\nAdvisors, LP (“DME Advisors”), to select and manage appropriate investments.\nRisks Relating to Our Innovations Strategy\n• The carrying values of our Innovations investments may differ significantly from those that would be used if we\ncarried these investments at fair value. Additionally, we have a material concentration in our top five holdings at\nDecember 31, 2023.\n• Our Innovations investments support our underwriting operations and the failure to identify and consummate\ninvestment opportunities may materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy.\n• Investments in privately held early-stage companies involve significant risks, and are highly illiquid.\n4\nLink to Table of Contents\nItem 1.

Business” of this Form 10-K.\nAll dollar amounts referred to in this Form 10-K are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. Due to rounding,\nnumbers presented in the tables included in this Form 10-K may not add up precisely to the totals provided.\nCompany Overview\nEstablished in 2004, we are a global specialty property and casualty reinsurer headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with\na reinsurance and investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. We conduct our operations\nprincipally through two licensed and regulated entities: Greenlight Re, based in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, and GRIL,\nbased in Dublin, Ireland, in addition to our Lloyd’s platform, Syndicate 3456. Greenlight Re provides multi-line property and\ncasualty reinsurance globally, while GRIL focuses mainly on specialty business. Our Syndicate 3456 supports innovative,\ntechnology-driven insurance partners (“insurtechs”).\nThe London market specialty business is central to our underwriting portfolio. In 2020, we established a UK marketing\nCompany, Greenlight Re UK, to increase our London market presence. On January 1, 2023, we acquired a Lloyd’s corporate\nmember, GCM, that provides underwriting capacity for various syndicates (including Syndicate 3456) that underwrite general\ninsurance and reinsurance business at Lloyd’s. Prior to acquiring GCM, we sourced our Funds at Lloyd’s (“FAL”) business\nthrough the same corporate member. The ownership of GCM complements our Syndicate 3456 and provides us more control\nover the FAL business.\nThrough our Greenlight Re Innovations unit, we also make long-term strategic investments in early-stage insurance\ncompanies and managing general agents (“MGAs”) to complement our strategy and strengthen our client relationships. In\nDecember 2023, we incorporated Viridis Re as an exempted segregated portfolio company (“SPC”) in the Cayman Islands.\nThrough segregated portfolios of Viridis Re, we plan to offer cost-effective insurance and reinsurance solutions to current and\nfuture insurtechs and MGA partners.\nOur goal is to build long-term shareholder value by providing risk management products and services to the insurance,\nreinsurance, and other risk marketplaces. We focus on delivering risk solutions to clients and brokers who value our expertise,\nanalytics, and customer service offerings, while complementing our underwriting activities with a non-traditional investment\napproach designed to achieve higher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that exclusively employ\nmore traditional investment strategies.\nCompany Organization and History\nSince our inception in 2004, we had two classes of common stock: (i) our Class A ordinary shares, which were traded\non the NASDAQ; and (ii) our Class B ordinary shares. The rights of the holders of Class A and Class B shares were identical,\nexcept for voting and conversion rights.\n5\nLink to Table of Contents\nOn July 25, 2023, at the Company’s Annual General Meeting (“2023 AGM”), our shareholders approved the re-\ndesignation of Class B ordinary shares as Class A ordinary shares. Such re-designation, alongside the approved reclassification\nof the Class A ordinary shares as simply “ordinary shares,” resulted in the elimination of the dual-class structure. We have one\nclass of common stock, our ordinary shares, which trades on the NASDAQ. Each ordinary share is entitled to one vote per\nshare. However, except upon unanimous consent of our Board pursuant to Section 11(1)(c) of our Fourth Amended and\nRestated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “Articles”), no holder is permitted to acquire an amount of shares\nwhich would cause any person to own (directly, indirectly or constructively under applicable United States tax attribution and\nconstructive ownership rules) 9.9% or more of the total voting power of the total issued and outstanding ordinary shares. In\nconnection with certain proposals that passed at our 2023 AGM relating to the elimination of our former dual-class share\nstructure, our Board consented pursuant to Section 11(1)(c) of the Articles to David Einhorn beneficially owning more than\n9.9% of the total voting power of the total issued and outstanding ordinary shares, up to the amount of ordinary shares\nbeneficially owned by David Einhorn at the time of the consent (i.e., 6,254,715 ordinary shares, which represents 17.7% of the\noutstanding ordinary shares as of December 31, 2023).\nBusiness Strategy\nOverall, we measure our success by long-term growth in book value per share, which we believe is the most\ncomprehensive gauge of our performance. We also measure our short and long-term underwriting performance based on our net\nunderwriting income. We have incorporated these two key performance metrics in our incentive compensation plan to align\nemployee and shareholder interests.\nReinsurance operations:\nWe strive to grow our diverse book of business by responding timely to changing market conditions, prudently managing\nour chosen lines of business, and driving sustainable shareholder returns. We execute our reinsurance business through a two-\npillar strategy:\nOpen market underwriting: We offer a diverse range of risk management products and services across market segments\nand geographies. Our small scale, relative to our global competitors, enables us to be more agile in allocating capacity to the\nmost promising risks and classes. We write business on a non-proportional (or excess of loss) and proportional basis (also\nknown as pro rata reinsurance, quota share reinsurance or participating reinsurance) across a range of classes in the property\nand casualty market. Our underwriting approach varies by class and type of opportunity:\n• Where our expertise is sufficient to evaluate the risk thoroughly, we will generally seek to participate in syndicated\nplacements negotiated and priced by another party that we judge to have market-leading expertise in the class or as a\nquota share retrocessionaire of a market-leading reinsurer; and\n• Where we have domain-specific expertise and a high level of market access, we may seek to act as the lead\nunderwriter to achieve greater influence in negotiating pricing, terms, and conditions.\nFurther, the size and diversification of our underwriting portfolio will vary based on our perception of the opportunities\navailable in each line of business at each point in time. As our focus on certain lines fluctuates based on market conditions, we\nmay only offer or underwrite a limited number of lines in any given period. We seek to:\n• mitigate underwriting volatility over the long term by focusing on short and medium tail risk;\n• target markets and lines of business where we believe an appropriate risk/reward profile exists;\n• attract and retain clients with expertise in their respective lines of business;\n• employ strict underwriting discipline; and\n• select reinsurance opportunities with anticipated favorable returns on capital.\nInnovations and strategic partnerships: Our strategic investments in insurtech positions us to access a stream of new\nunderwriting business, in addition to potential fee income and investment return on early stage investments. We refer to this\npillar as Greenlight Re Innovations (“Innovations”). In evaluating Innovations opportunities, we generally ensure that each\ninvestment meets at least one of the following criteria:\n6\nLink to Table of Contents\n● The value we add to a partnership is derived primarily from the application of our risk expertise, not solely capital\nor reinsurance support;\n● The partnership adds expertise to our company in specific risk areas, technology, product innovation, or other\nareas;\n● The partnership approach provides access to a pool of capital, products, or distribution;\n● Overall, the partnership approach creates a combined effort that generates a durable strategic or competitive\nposition in one or more markets and increases our opportunities to achieve revenue growth and margin expansion.\nIn 2022, Syndicate 3456 commenced insurance operations under the Lloyd’s syndicate-in-a-box model, with Greenlight\nRe as the sole capital provider. This enables us to capitalize on global insurtech opportunities, while leveraging Lloyd’s strong\ncredit ratings (see Ratings below). Further, in late 2023, we incorporated Viridis Re as an SPC in the Cayman Islands. Through\nsegregated portfolios of Viridis Re, we plan to offer cost-effective insurance and reinsurance solutions for current and future\ninsurtech and MGA partners.\nInvestment:\nOur investment strategy is designed to maximize returns over the long term while minimizing the risk of capital loss.\nUnlike the investment strategies of many of our competitors, which invest primarily in fixed-income securities either directly or\nthrough fixed-fee arrangements with one or more investment managers, our investment strategy is focused mainly on long and\nshort positions, primarily in publicly-traded equity and corporate debt instruments. See “- Investments” within this Item 1.\nBusiness for further information.\nOperations\nWe have one operating segment: property and casualty reinsurance, which also represents our reporting segment. We\nanalyze our business based on the following lines of business:\n• Property: covers personal lines, commercial lines exposures and automobile physical damage. Property\nbusiness includes both catastrophe and non-catastrophe coverage.\n• Casualty: covers general liability, motor liability, professional liability, and workers’ compensation\nexposures. Our multi-line business includes the FAL business. As our Lloyd’s syndicate contracts incorporate property\n(including incidental catastrophe), casualty, and other exposures, we categorize them as multi-line (and therefore\ncasualty) business. However, these contracts are composed of primarily short-tailed risks.\n• Other: covers accident and health, financial (including transactional liability, mortgage insurance, surety, and\ntrade credit), marine, energy, as well as other specialty business such as aviation, crop, cyber, political, and terrorism\nexposures.\nThe following table presents our gross premiums written by lines of business for the most recent three years:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022 2021\n($ in thousands)\nProperty $ 113,291 17.8 % $ 85,323 15.2 % $ 52,947 9.4 %\nCasualty 351,037 55.1 325,103 57.7 379,113 67.1\nOther 172,482 27.1 152,745 27.1 133,333 23.6\nTotal $ 636,810 100.0 % $ 563,171 100.0 % $ 565,393 100.0 %\nRefer to “Part II, Item 7.

Our consolidated financial\nstatements are located in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n7\nLink to Table of Contents\nMarketing and Distribution\nWe source a majority of our business through reinsurance brokers. Brokerage distribution channels provide us with\naccess to an efficient, variable cost and global distribution system. In some cases, intermediaries also provide other services,\nincluding risk analytics, processing, and clearing.\nWe aim to build and strengthen long-term relationships with global reinsurance brokers. Our management team has\nrelationships with most primary and specialty broker intermediaries in the reinsurance marketplace. By maintaining close\nrelationships with brokers, we believe that we will continue to obtain access to a broad range of reinsurance clients and\nopportunities.\nWe seek to strengthen our broker relationships and become the preferred choice of brokers and clients by providing,\nwhere applicable:\n● demonstrated expertise in the underlying reinsured exposures and the operation of the contracts;\n● rapid responses to risk submissions;\n● timely claims payments;\n● customized solutions that address the specific business needs of our clients;\n● financial security; and\n● a clear indication of risks we will and will not underwrite.\nWe focus on the quality and financial strength of any brokerage firm we conduct business with. Brokers do not have the\nauthority to bind us to any reinsurance contract. Their commissions are generally determined based on a percentage of gross\npremiums written.\nGross premiums written by broker, shown individually where premiums by broker (including their subsidiaries and\naffiliates) were 10% or more of the total in any of the last three years, were as follows:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022 2021\n($ in thousands)\nGuy Carpenter (Marsh) $ 122,766 19.3 % $ 50,626 9.0 % $ 178,336 31.5 %\nAon Benfield 91,642 14.4 159,421 28.3 139,044 24.6\nGallagher Re 57,731 9.1 91,239 16.2 27,596 4.9\nBMS Group 20,277 3.2 51,435 9.1 63,958 11.3\nTotal of largest brokers $ 292,416 45.9 % $ 352,721 62.6 % $ 408,934 72.3 %\nAll other brokers, MGAs\nand direct placements 344,394 54.1 210,450 37.4 156,459 27.7\nTotal $ 636,810 100.0 % $ 563,171 100.0 % $ 565,393 100.0 %\nWe frequently meet in the Cayman Islands, Ireland, U.K. and elsewhere with brokers and senior representatives of\nclients and prospective clients. We review and (when we deem appropriate) approve all contract submissions in the Cayman\nIslands or Ireland. Due to our dependence on brokers, the inability to obtain business from them could adversely affect our\nbusiness strategy. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — The loss of significant brokers could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.” We may assume a degree of the\ncredit risk of our reinsurance brokers. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — We are subject to the\ncredit risk of our brokers, cedents, agents and other counterparties.”\nWhile most of our business is sourced through reinsurance brokers, we also write some insurance and reinsurance\nbusiness on a direct basis. Our Innovations partnerships are a growing source of directly placed business. Our MGA partners\nare a key source of premium flow and a vital component of our Innovations strategy. We work closely with our MGA partners\n8\nLink to Table of Contents\nwho wish to attain Lloyd’s coverholder status, which allows them to conduct business with our Syndicate 3456. We also use\nMGAs to transact business on other classes of business within the constraints of prescribed underwriting guidelines.\nPrior to January 1, 2023, our FAL business was generated through a Lloyd’s corporate member, which we subsequently\nacquired effective January 1, 2023. FAL represented approximately 35%, 33%, and 26% of our gross premiums written for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nUnderwriting and Risk Management\nWe have established an underwriting platform composed of experienced underwriters and actuaries. We have\nunderwriting operations in three locations: the Cayman Islands, Dublin, Ireland, and London, U.K. These platforms provide\naccess to key markets in the U.S., Europe, Middle East, and Asia. Our experienced team allows us to deploy our capital in\nvarious lines of business and capitalize on opportunities that we believe offer favorable returns on equity over the long term.\nOur underwriters and actuaries have expertise in multiple lines of business. We generally apply the following underwriting and\nrisk management principles:\nEconomics of Results\nOur primary underwriting goal is to build a (re)insurance portfolio that maximizes profitability, subject to risk and\nvolatility constraints.\nUnderwriting Analysis\nOur approach to underwriting analysis begins at the class-of-business level. This analysis includes identifying and\nassessing the structural drivers of risk and emerging loss trends and understanding the market participants and results, capacity\nconditions for supply and demand, and other factors. Our underwriting professionals specialize in business lines, and our\nquantitative professionals (pricing actuaries) assist in evaluating all risks we underwrite. Combined with cross-line\nmanagement, we believe this approach enables us to build and deploy expertise and insight into the business line’s risk\ndynamics and external factors that will affect each transaction.\nWe assign a deal team composed of underwriting and quantitative professionals to evaluate each potential transaction’s\npricing and structure. Before committing capital to any transaction, the deal team and the regional Chief Underwriting Officer\nmust obtain approval from at least one of, the group Chief Executive Officer, GRIL Chief Executive Officer, or Chief Risk\nOfficer. In seeking this approval, the deal team presents the key components of the proposed transaction, including\nassumptions and threats, market and individual deal risk factors, market capacity dynamics, transaction structure and pricing,\nmaximum downside, and other factors.\nWe collaborate with our current and prospective clients and brokers to understand the risks associated with each potential\ntransaction. For most of our business, we follow terms set by recognized market leads. We consider the remainder of our\nunderwriting portfolio, including contracts linked to our Innovations partners or in areas where we have significant market\nexpertise, to be “lead business.” When underwriting lead business, we generally structure the reinsurance agreements to ensure\nthat our cedents’ interests and ours are aligned. Where appropriate, we conduct or contract for on-site audits or reviews of the\nclients’ underwriting files, systems, and operations. We usually obtain substantial data from our clients to conduct a thorough\nactuarial modeling analysis. As part of our pricing and underwriting process, we assess, among other factors:\n● the client’s and industry’s historical loss data;\n● the expected duration for claims to fully develop;\n● the client’s pricing and underwriting strategies;\n● the geographic areas in which the client is doing business and its market share;\n● the reputation and financial strength of the client and its management and underwriting teams;\n● the reputation and expertise of the broker; and\n● reports provided by independent industry specialists.\n9\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe develop proprietary quantitative models and use several commercially available tools to price our business. Our\nmodels consider conventional underwriting and risk metrics and incorporate various class-specific and market-specific aspects\nfrom our line-of-business analyses. We use models to evaluate the quantitative work’s quality and predictive power and\nundertake a detailed assessment of the data quality.\nUnderwriting Authorities\nThe Underwriting Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Underwriting Committee”) sets parameters for aggregate\nproperty catastrophic caps and limits for maximum loss potential under any individual contract. The Underwriting Committee\nmust approve any exceptions to the established limits. The Underwriting Committee may amend the maximum underwriting\nauthorities periodically to align with our capital base. The Underwriting Committee designs our underwriting authorities to\nensure the underwriting portfolio is appropriate on a risk-adjusted basis.\nRefer to “Part II, Item 5. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -\nFinancial Condition” for a summary of our catastrophe loss exposure in terms of our probable maximum loss (“PML”), net of\nretrocession and reinstatement premiums, as at January 1, 2024.\nRetrocessional Coverage\nWe opportunistically purchase retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to manage our overall\ncatastrophe events or aggregate exposure, reduce our net liability on individual risks, obtain additional underwriting capacity,\nand balance our underwriting portfolio.\nThe retrocessional coverage we purchase varies based on numerous factors, including the inherent volatility and risk\naccumulation of our underwriting portfolio and capital base. Our portfolio, and by extension our gross risk position, will change\nin size from year to year depending on market opportunities, so it is difficult to predict the level of retrocessional coverage that\nwe will purchase in any future year.\nWe generally purchase uncollateralized retrocessional coverage from reinsurers with a minimum financial strength rating\nof “A- (Excellent)” from A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) or an equivalent rating from a recognized rating service. For\nlower-rated or non-rated reinsurers, we endeavor to obtain and monitor collateral in the form of cash, funds withheld, letters of\ncredit, regulatory trusts, or other collateral in the form of guarantees. At December 31, 2023, the aggregate amount due from\nreinsurers from retrocessional coverages represented 3.9% (2022: 2.4%) of our gross loss reserves. For further details, please\nsee Note 8 “Retrocession” to the consolidated financial statements.\nClaims Management\nOur claims management process begins upon receiving claims notifications from our clients or third-party\nadministrators. We review reserving and settlement authority under the individual contract requirements and, as necessary,\ndiscuss with the contract’s underwriter. Our in-house claims team oversees claims reviews and approves all claim settlements.\nClaims above the claims officer’s authority are referred to the General Counsel, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive\nOfficer, or Chief Risk Officer together with the claims officer’s recommendations, for secondary approval. We believe that this\nprocess ensures that we pay claims in accordance with each contract's terms and conditions.\nWhere appropriate, we conduct or contract for on-site claims audits at cedents and third-party administrators, particularly\nfor large accounts, Innovations partners, and those whose performance differs from our expectations. Through these audits, we\nevaluate and monitor the third-party administrators’ and the ceding companies’ organization and claims-handling practices.\nThese practices include:\n• fact-finding and investigation techniques;\n• loss notifications;\n• reserving;\n• claims negotiation and settlement;\n• adherence to claims-handling guidelines.\nThe results of these claim reserves are shared with the underwriters and actuaries to assist them in pricing products and\nestablishing loss reserves.\n10\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe recognize that the fair interpretation of our reinsurance agreements and timely payment of covered claims are\nessential components of the service we provide to our clients.\nReserves\nOur reserving philosophy is to set reserves at the level representing our best estimate of the amount we will ultimately be\nrequired to pay in connection with risks we have underwritten. Our actuarial staff performs quarterly reviews of our portfolio\nand provides reserving estimates according to our stated reserving philosophy. In doing so, our team groups our portfolio into\nreserving analysis segments based primarily on homogeneity considerations. Currently, this process involves analysis at the\nindividual client or transaction level.\nWe engage an independent actuarial firm who reviews and provides opinions on these reserve estimates at least once a\nyear. Due to the use of different assumptions and loss experience, the amount we establish as reserves with respect to individual\nrisks, clients, transactions, or business lines may be greater or less than those set by our clients or ceding companies. Reserves\ninclude claims reported but not yet paid, claims incurred but not reported, and claims in the process of settlement. Additional\nunderwriting liabilities include unearned premiums, premium deposits, and profit commissions earned but not yet paid.\nReserves represent an estimate rather than an exact quantification. Although the methods for establishing reserves are\nwell established, many assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. We base\nour estimates on our assessment of facts and circumstances, future trends in claim severity and frequency, judicial theories of\nliability, and other factors, including inflation, interest rate changes, political risks and the actions of third parties, which are\nbeyond our control.\nAnother significant component of reserving risk relates to the estimation of losses in the aftermath of a major catastrophe\nevent. Accordingly, we believe the most significant accounting judgment made by management is our estimate of loss and loss\nadjustment expense reserves. For more information on our reserving process and methodology, refer to the “Critical Accounting\nPolicies and Estimates - Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves” under “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nSee Note 7 “Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves” of the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of\nclaims reserves, loss development tables by accident year, and explanations of significant prior period loss development\nmovements. For a discussion on risk factors relating to loss reserves, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our\nBusiness — If our losses and LAE greatly exceed our loss reserves, our financial condition may be materially and adversely\naffected.”\nCollateral Arrangements and Letter of Credit Facilities\nWe are licensed and admitted as a reinsurer only in the Cayman Islands and the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).\nMany jurisdictions, including the United States, do not permit clients to take credit for reinsurance on their statutory financial\nstatements if they obtain such reinsurance from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers without appropriate collateral. As a result,\nour U.S. clients and some non-U.S. clients require us to provide collateral for the contracts we bind with them. We provide\ncollateral as funds withheld, trust arrangements, or letters of credit (“LOC”). For further information, see Note 9 - “Debt and\nCredit Facilities” of the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.\nCompetition\nThe reinsurance industry is highly competitive. Competition is generally focused on available capacity, service, financial\nstrength, and price. We compete with major global reinsurers, most of which are well-established and have significant operating\nhistories, strong financial strength ratings, and long-standing client relationships. Competitors also provide protection in the\nform of catastrophe bonds, industry loss warranties, and other risk-linked products that are outside of the traditional reinsurance\ntreaty market. This may lead to reduced pricing and/or reduced participation levels in certain reinsurance products.\nOur competitors vary according to the individual market and situation. Generally, they include Arch Capital, AXIS,\nEverest Re, Hamilton Re, Hannover Re, RenaissanceRe, SiriusPoint, and smaller companies, other niche reinsurers, and\nLloyd’s syndicates and their related entities. Although we seek to provide coverage where capacity and alternatives are limited,\nwe directly compete with these and other larger companies due to the breadth of their coverage across the property and casualty\nmarket in substantially all lines of business. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business – Competitors\nwith greater resources may make it difficult for us to effectively market our products or offer our products at a profit.”\n11\nLink to Table of Contents\nRatings\nOn September 29, 2023, A.M. Best re-affirmed our “A- (Excellent)” rating with a stable outlook, the fourth highest of 13\nratings, for our two principal operating subsidiaries: GLRE and GRIL. We believe a strong rating is important to compete and\nmarket reinsurance products to clients and brokers. These ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of our reinsurance\nsubsidiaries’ financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet obligations. It is not an evaluation directed toward\nthe investors’ protection or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our ordinary shares.\nAdditionally, A.M. Best assessed our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) practices as appropriate for the Company’s\nbusiness complexity and overall risk profile.\nA.M. Best periodically reviews the financial positions of our operating subsidiaries and therefore our rating may be\nsubsequently revised or revoked by the agency. The failure to maintain our current “A-” A.M. Best rating may significantly\nand negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our\nBusiness — A downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings would materially and adversely affect our ability to\nimplement our business strategy.”\nFurther, by being part of the Lloyd’s market, Syndicate 3456 benefits from the following four Lloyd’s financial strength\nratings: “A” (Excellent) from A.M. Best; AA- (Very Strong) from Fitch Ratings; AA- (Very Strong) from Kroll Bond Rating\nAgency; and AA- (Very Strong) from Standard & Poor’s.\nRegulations\nCayman Islands Insurance Regulation\nThe legislative framework for conducting insurance and reinsurance business in and from within the Cayman Islands is\ncomposed of The Insurance Act, 2010 (as amended) and underlying regulations thereto (the “Act”), which became effective in\nthe Cayman Islands on November 1, 2012.\nGreenlight Re holds a Class D insurer license issued in accordance with the terms of the Act and is subject to regulation\nand supervision by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (“CIMA”).\nAs the holder of a Class D insurer license, Greenlight Re is permitted to carry on reinsurance business from the Cayman\nIslands but, except with the prior written approval of CIMA, may not carry on any insurance or reinsurance business where the\nunderlying risk originates and resides in the Cayman Islands.\nGreenlight Re is required to comply with the following principal requirements under the Act:\n12\nLink to Table of Contents\n● to maintain capital and a margin of solvency in accordance with the capital and solvency requirements\nprescribed by the Act;\n● to carry on its business in accordance with its business plan and the laws of the Cayman Islands, including the\nregulatory laws, regulations, rules, and statements of guidance, where applicable;\n● to maintain adequate arrangements, including internal controls, for the management of risks and a system of\ngovernance as approved by CIMA;\n● to maintain a minimum of at least two directors and to seek the prior approval of CIMA in respect of the\nappointment of directors and officers and to provide CIMA with information in connection therewith and\nnotification of any changes thereto;\n● to have a place of business in the Cayman Islands and to maintain such resources, including staff and facilities,\nbooks and records as CIMA considers appropriate, having regard for the nature and scale of the business of\nGreenlight Re;\n● to submit to CIMA an annual return in the prescribed form together with:\n- financial statements prepared in accordance with internationally recognized accounting standards, audited by\nan independent auditor approved by CIMA;\n- an actuarial valuation of Greenlight Re’s assets and liabilities, certified by an actuary approved by CIMA;\n- certification of solvency prepared by a person approved by CIMA in accordance with the prescribed\nrequirements;\n- confirmation that the information contained in Greenlight Re’s license application, as modified by any\nsubsequent changes, remains correct and up to date;\n- such other information as may be prescribed by CIMA; and\n● to pay an annual license fee.\nIt is the duty of CIMA:\n● to maintain a general review of insurance practices in the Cayman Islands;\n● to examine the affairs or business of any licensee or other person carrying on, or who has carried on, insurance\nbusiness to ensure that the Act has been complied with and that the licensee is in a sound financial position and\nis carrying on its business in a fit and proper manner;\n● to examine and report on the annual returns delivered to CIMA in terms of the Act; and\n● to examine and make recommendations with respect to, among other things, proposals for the revocation of\nlicenses and cases of suspected insolvency of licensed entities.\nGreenlight Re is also required to comply with, amongst other standards, the Rule on Corporate Governance for Insurers,\nthe Rule on Risk Management for Insurers, and the Rule on Investment Activities for Insurers and the associated Statement of\nGuidance. Respectively, these rules require regulated insurers to establish and maintain (a) a corporate governance framework\nthat provides for the sound and prudent management and oversight of the insurer's business, including outsourcing and internal\ncontrols, and which adequately recognizes and protects the interests of its policyholders, and (b) a risk management framework\nthat is capable of promptly identifying, measuring, assessing, reporting, monitoring and controlling all sources of risks that\ncould have a material impact on its operations, and (c) implement investment activities that consider all of Greenlight Re’s risks\nand solvency requirements.\nThe Act provides that where CIMA believes a licensee is committing, or is about to commit or pursue, an act that is an\nunsafe or unsound business practice, CIMA may direct the licensee to cease or refrain from committing the act or pursuing the\noffending course of conduct. Failure to comply with such a CIMA direction may be punishable on summary conviction by a\nfine of up to 100,000 Cayman Islands dollars (US$120,000) or to imprisonment for a term of five years or to both, and on\nconviction on indictment to a fine of 500,000 Cayman Islands dollars (US$600,000) or to imprisonment for a term of ten years\nor to both and to an additional 10,000 Cayman Islands dollars ( US$12,000) for every day after conviction that the breach\ncontinues.\nThe Monetary Authority Act (“MAA”) also provides CIMA with the authority to impose administrative fines on\nlicensees. The recent Monetary Authority (Administrative Fines) (Amendment) Regulations, 2020 (the “Amendment\nRegulations”) came into force on 26 June 2020. They extended the scope of the fines CIMA may impose for breaches of a\nrange of regulatory laws, including the Act. Breaches are categorized as minor, serious, or very serious, and, depending on the\ncategory of the breach, fines range from $6,100 to $1,220,000 per breach for very serious breaches. Where a breach is\ncommitted by a corporate entity and is shown to have been committed with the consent, connivance, knowledge, or neglect of\nan individual, that individual may also be subject to an administrative fine.\n13\nLink to Table of Contents\nWhenever CIMA believes that a licensee is or may become unable to meet its obligations as they fall due, is carrying on\nbusiness in a manner likely to be detrimental to the public interest or the interests of its creditors or policyholders, has\ncontravened the terms of the Act or has otherwise behaved in such a manner to cause CIMA to call into question the licensee’s\nfitness, CIMA may take one of several steps. The steps include requiring the licensee to rectify the matter, suspending the\nlicense of the licensee, revoking the license, imposing conditions upon the license and amending or revoking any such\ncondition, requiring the substitution of any director, manager, or officer of the licensee, at the expense of the licensee,\nappointing a person to advise the licensee on the proper conduct of its affairs and to report to CIMA thereon, at the expense of\nthe licensee, appointing a person to assume control of the licensee’s affairs or otherwise requiring such action to be taken by the\nlicensee as CIMA considers necessary. We have not been subject to any such actions from CIMA to date.\nOther Regulations in the Cayman Islands\nAs Cayman Islands exempted companies, Greenlight Capital Re and Greenlight Re may not carry on business or trade\nlocally in the Cayman Islands except in furtherance of their business outside the Cayman Islands and are prohibited from\nsoliciting the public of the Cayman Islands to subscribe for any of their securities or debt. These companies are further required\nto file a return with the Registrar of Companies in January of each year (“Annual Return”) and to pay an annual registration fee\nat that time. Additionally, these companies must comply with the “Anti-Money Laundering Regulations (2023 Revision)” in\nthe Cayman Islands.\nEconomic substance law requiring a “relevant entity” conducting “relevant activity” to file notifications and, unless\nexempt, to report to the Tax Information Authority (“TIA”) and maintain economic substance has been introduced in the\nCayman Islands.\nThe International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act (2021 Revision) and International Tax Co-operation\n(Economic Substance) Regulations, 2020, were published on February 5, 2021, and August 11, 2020, respectively, and\nsubsequently amended (together, the “ES Act”). The latest version of the Guidance on Economic Substance for Geographically\nMobile Activities (“ES Guidance”) was published in July 2022.\nAs of January 2020, Greenlight Capital Re and Greenlight Re must confirm their economic substance classification on an\nannual basis and submit this classification to the TIA as a prerequisite to the Annual Return filing.\nThe Cayman Islands has no exchange controls restricting dealings in currencies or securities.\nCayman Islands Status with the European Union (“EU”) and Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) Compliance\nIn February 2021, the Cayman Islands was added to the FATF’s “grey list”, a list of jurisdictions under increased\nmonitoring to address strategic deficiencies in their Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) / Counter Terrorist Financing regimes,\nafter the FATF identified deficiencies in three main areas. In January 2022 the Cayman Islands was subsequently added to the\nEU’s list of jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their Anti-Money Laundering / Counter Terrorist Financing regimes\n(commonly known as the “EU AML List”), with the FATF recommended actions being cited by the EU Commission at the\ntime as the justification for adding the Cayman Islands to the EU AML List.\nOn May 17, 2022, the EU confirmed that it would not require any further measures to be taken in order for the\nCayman Islands to be removed from the EU AML List once the jurisdiction has addressed the remaining FATF action items.\nOn June 23, 2023, the FATF advised that the Cayman Islands had fulfilled the remaining action items and was eligible for\nremoval from the EU AML List. Following an on-site FATF visit in October 2023, it was announced at the FATF Plenary on\nOctober 27, 2023 that the Cayman Islands has been delisted from the FATF grey list. As a result, the Cayman Islands was\nsubsequently removed from the EU AML List on February 7, 2024.\nIreland Insurance Regulations\nOur Irish subsidiary, GRIL, is authorized as a non-life reinsurance undertaking by the Central Bank of Ireland “CBI” in\naccordance with the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 (the \"Irish Regulations\"). The Irish\nRegulations give effect in Ireland to EU Directive 2009/138/EC (known as \"Solvency II\"), which introduced a new European\nregulatory regime for insurers and reinsurers with effect from January 1, 2016. Solvency II is supplemented by the European\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, other European Commission “delegated acts” and binding technical\nstandards, and guidelines issued by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (“Delegated Acts and\nGuidelines”). GRIL is required to comply at all times with the Irish Regulations, the Irish Insurance Acts 1909 to 2018,\nregulations relating to insurance business or reinsurance business promulgated under the European Communities Act 1972, the\nIrish Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2018 as amended, regulations promulgated thereunder and directions, guidelines and codes of\n14\nLink to Table of Contents\nconduct issued by the CBI (collectively the “Irish Insurance Acts and Regulations”). In addition, GRIL is required to comply\nwith the Delegated Acts and Guidelines and must meet risk-based solvency requirements imposed under Solvency II on\ninsurers and reinsurers across all member states, including Ireland. Solvency II and the Delegated Acts and Guidelines set out\nclassification and eligibility requirements, including the characteristics that capital, including any capital contribution, must\ndisplay to qualify as regulatory capital.\nGRIL is also required to comply with the European Union (Insurance Distribution) Regulations 2018 (the \"2018\nRegulations\"), which apply to distributors of insurance and reinsurance products (including insurers and reinsurers). The 2018\nRegulations give effect in Ireland to Directive (EU) 2016/97 (known as the \"IDD\") and strengthen the regulatory regime\napplicable to distribution activities through increased transparency, information, and conduct requirements. On May 25, 2018,\nthe General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") came into force across the EU. The GDPR significantly increases\norganizations’ obligations and responsibilities in collecting, using, storing, and protecting personal data. Organizations in\nbreach of the GDPR may incur sizable financial penalties up to, the higher of €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover.\nUK Regulations\nLloyd’s Oversight\nSyndicate 3456 is subject to oversight by Lloyd’s, substantially effected through the Lloyd’s Council. Our business plan\nfor Syndicate 3456, including maximum underwriting capacity, requires annual approval by Lloyd’s. Lloyd’s may require\nchanges to any business plan presented to it or additional capital to be provided to support the underwriting plan. We have\ndeposited certain assets with Lloyd’s to support GCM’s underwriting business at Lloyd’s.\nBy entering into a membership agreement with Lloyd’s, GCM has undertaken to comply with all Lloyd’s by-laws and\nregulations as well as the provisions of the Lloyd’s Acts and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended by the\nFinancial Services Act 2012 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023. This arrangement subjects us to the following:\n● Capital Requirements. The underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd’s must be supported by providing a\ndeposit, referred to as FAL, in an amount determined on the basis of such entity’s solvency and capital\nrequirements. The amount of such deposit is calculated for each member through the completion of an annual\ncapital adequacy exercise. In addition, if the FAL are not sufficient to cover all losses, the Lloyd’s Central Fund\nprovides an additional level of security for policyholders. Dividends from a Lloyd’s managing agent and a\nLloyd’s corporate member can be declared and paid provided the relevant company has sufficient profits\navailable for distribution.\n● Ratings. The financial security of the Lloyd’s market as a whole is regularly assessed by four independent\nrating agencies (A.M. Best, S&P, Kroll Bond and Fitch). Syndicates at Lloyd’s take their financial security\nrating from the rating of the Lloyd’s market. A satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating agency\nis necessary for Lloyd’s syndicates to be able to trade in certain classes of business at current levels.\n● Intervention Powers. The Lloyd’s Council has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting at\nLloyd’s, including, the power to withdraw a member’s permission to underwrite business or to underwrite a\nparticular class of business and to change the basis on which syndicate expenses are allocated.\n● Assessments. If Lloyd’s determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it has the power to assess\npremium levies on current Lloyd’s members up to 5% of a member’s underwriting capacity in any one year.\nPrudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) Regulation.\nThe PRA is part of the Bank of England and responsible for the prudential regulation and supervision of banks,\nbuilding societies, credit unions, insurers, and major investment firms authorized in the UK. The FCA has responsibility for\nmarket conduct regulation. Lloyd’s as a whole is authorized by the PRA and regulated by both the FCA and the PRA, which\nboth have substantial powers of intervention in relation to regulated firms. Lloyd’s is required to implement certain rules\nprescribed by the PRA and the FCA. If it appears to either the PRA or the FCA that either Lloyd’s is not fulfilling its delegated\nregulatory responsibilities or that managing agents are not complying with the applicable regulatory rules and guidance, the\nPRA or the FCA may intervene at their discretion. To minimize duplication, both regulators have arrangements with Lloyd’s\nfor co-operation on supervision and enforcement.\nLloyd’s is subject to an annual PRA solvency test which measures whether Lloyd’s has sufficient assets in the\naggregate to meet all outstanding liabilities of its members, both current and run-off. If Lloyd’s fails this test, the PRA may\nrequire the entire Lloyd’s market to cease underwriting or individual Lloyd’s members may be required to cease or reduce their\nunderwriting.\n15\nLink to Table of Contents\nInvestments\nAt December 31, 2023, our total investments were $332.2 million, of which 77.9% (2022 - 71.7%) was invested in\nSILP and 22.1% (2022 - 28.3%) in Innovation-related investments.\nInvestment in SILP\nOur investment portfolio is managed by DME Advisors, LP (“DME Advisors”), a value-oriented investment advisor that\nanalyzes companies’ available financial data, business strategies, and prospects to identify undervalued and overvalued\nsecurities. DME Advisors is a related party as it is controlled by David Einhorn, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and the\nPresident of Greenlight Capital, Inc. Refer to Note 15 “Related Party Transactions” of the consolidated financial statements.\nEffective September 1, 2018, we have entered into an amended and restated exempted limited partnership agreement of\nSILP (the “SILP LPA”), as amended from time to time, with DME Advisors II, LLC (“DME II”), as General Partner,\nGreenlight Re, GRIL and the initial limited partner (each, a “Partner”). Effective January 1, 2023, we increased the maximum\nInvestment Portfolio, as defined in the SILP LPA, to 60% from 50% of GLRE Surplus, as defined in the SILP LPA. We present\nour investment in SILP under the caption “Investment in related party investment fund” in our consolidated balance sheets.\nOn September 1, 2018, SILP entered into an investment advisory agreement (the “IAA”) with DME Advisors, with an\ninitial term ending on August 31, 2023, subject to automatic extensions for successive three-year terms. DME Advisors has the\ncontractual right to manage substantially all of our investable assets and is required to follow our investment guidelines and act\nin a fair and equitable manner in allocating investment opportunities to SILP. However, DME Advisors is not otherwise\nrestricted with respect to the nature or timing of making investments for SILP.\nDME Advisors receives a monthly management fee at an annual rate of 1.5% of each limited partner’s Investment\nPortfolio, as provided in the SILP LPA. DME II receives a performance allocation based on the positive performance change of\neach limited partner’s capital account equal to 20% of net profits calculated per annum, subject to a loss carryforward provision.\nThe loss carryforward provision allows DME II to earn a reduced performance allocation of 10% on net profits in any\nyear after the year in which a limited partner’s capital account incurs a loss until the limited partner has recouped all losses and\nhas earned an additional amount equal to 150% of the loss. DME II is not entitled to a performance allocation in a year in which\na capital account incurs a loss. At December 31, 2023, we estimate the reduced performance allocation of 10% to continue to be\napplied until SILP achieves additional investment returns of 113.7%, at which point the performance allocation will revert to\n20%.\nDME Advisors is required to follow our investment guidelines and act in a manner that it considers fair and equitable in\nallocating investment opportunities to us and SILP. However, the IAA does not otherwise impose any specific obligations or\nrequirements concerning the allocation of time, effort, or investment opportunities to us and SILP or any restrictions on the\nnature or timing of investments for our or SILP’s account or other accounts that DME Advisors or its affiliates may manage.\nDME Advisors can outsource to sub-advisors without our consent or approval. If DME Advisors and any of its affiliates\nattempt to invest in the same opportunity simultaneously, DME Advisors and its affiliates may allocate the opportunity as they\ndetermine reasonably. Affiliates of DME Advisors presently serve as the general partner or the investment advisor of\nGreenlight Capital LP, Greenlight Capital Offshore, Ltd., GCOI Intermediate, LP, Greenlight Capital Offshore Master, Ltd.,\nGreenlight Masters, LP, Greenlight Masters Qualified, LP, Greenlight Masters Offshore, Ltd., Greenlight Masters Offshore I,\nLtd., Greenlight Masters Offshore Partners, Greenlight Masters Partners and several separately managed accounts (collectively,\nthe “Greenlight Funds”).\nWe have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all our current and future subsidiaries to enter into the\nSILP LPA. Under the SILP LPA, we are contractually obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause substantially\nall investable assets of Greenlight Re and GRIL, with limited exceptions, to be contributed to SILP.\nWe have agreed to release DME II and DME Advisors and their affiliates from any liability arising out of the IAA or the\nSILP LPA, subject to certain exceptions. Furthermore, DME II has agreed to indemnify us against any liability incurred in\nconnection with certain actions.\nUnder the SILP LPA, either GLRE Limited Partner may voluntarily withdraw all or part of its capital account for its\noperating needs by giving DME II at least three business days’ notice. Either of the GLRE Limited Partners may withdraw as a\npartner and fully withdraw all of its capital account from SILP on three business days’ notice if the limited partner’s board\ndeclares that a cause for withdrawal exists as per the SILP LPA.\n16\nLink to Table of Contents\nInvestment Strategy\nDME Advisors implements a value-oriented investment strategy by taking long positions in perceived undervalued\nsecurities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities. DME Advisors aims to achieve high absolute returns while\nminimizing the risk of capital loss. DME Advisors attempts to determine the risk/return characteristics of potential investments\nby analyzing factors such as the risk that expected cash flows would not be achieved, the volatility of the cash flows, the\nleverage of the underlying business, and the security’s liquidity, among others.\nOur Board of Directors reviews our investment portfolio activities and oversees our investment guidelines to meet our\ninvestment objectives. These investment guidelines, which may be amended, modified, or waived from time to time, take into\naccount restrictions imposed on us by regulators, our liability mix, requirements to maintain an appropriate claims-paying rating\nby ratings agencies and requirements of lenders. We believe our investment approach, while generating returns less predictable\nthan those of traditional fixed-income portfolios, complements our reinsurance business and will achieve higher rates of return\nover the long term than reinsurance companies that invest predominantly in fixed-income securities. We have designed our\ninvestment guidelines to maintain adequate liquidity to fund our reinsurance operations.\nDME Advisors is contractually obligated to adhere to our investment guidelines and make investment decisions on our\nbehalf. These decisions may include buying publicly listed equity securities and corporate debt, selling securities short, and\ninvesting in private placements, futures, currencies, commodities, credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, sovereign debt,\nderivatives, and other instruments.\nInvestment returns for SILP\nIn accordance with the SILP LPA, DME Advisors constructs a levered investment portfolio as agreed with the Company\n(the “Investment Portfolio” as defined in the SILP LPA). Investment returns, net of all fees and expenses, by quarter for the last\nfive years are as follows: (1)\nQuarter 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019\n1st (1.1) % 1.7 % 1.5 % (8.1) % 6.2 %\n2nd 10.9 4.9 (0.9) 0.3 2.7\n3rd (0.6) 3.6 (2.7) 1.4 1.2\n4th 0.3 13.4 9.9 8.4 (1.0)\nFull Year 9.4 % 25.3 % 7.5 % 1.4 % 9.3 %\n(1) Investment returns are calculated monthly and compounded to calculate the quarterly and annual returns generated by our\nInvestment Portfolio. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. The monthly investment return is\ncalculated by dividing the investment income/loss (net of fees and expenses) by the Investment Portfolio. Effective January 1,\n2021, the Investment Portfolio is calculated on the basis of 50% of GLRE Surplus, or the shareholders’ equity of Greenlight\nCapital Re, Ltd., as reported in Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd.’s then most recent quarterly financial statements prepared in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). It is adjusted\nmonthly for our net profits and net losses as reported by SILP during any intervening period. This basis was increased to 60%\neffective January 1, 2023. Prior to January 1, 2021, the Investment Portfolio was calculated on the basis of several factors,\nincluding the Companies’ shares of SILP’s net asset value, collateral posted by the Companies, and the Companies’ net\nreserves.\nInnovation-related Investments\nAs previously noted, we make strategic investments in promising private insurtech companies, subject to investment\nguidelines as approved by our Board of Directors, in addition to providing reinsurance capacity on a case by case basis. These\nprivate investments consist primarily of unlisted equities (mostly preferred shares) and debt instruments. See Item 1A. Risk\nFactors - Risks Relating to Our Innovations Strategy - Investments in privately held early-stage companies involve significant\nrisks. ”\nFor further information about our total investments and investment income, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition” and “Note 3 - Investments in\nRelated Party Investments Fund and Note 4 - Other Investments” of the consolidated financial statements.\n17\nLink to Table of Contents\nEnterprise Risk Management\nEnterprise risk management (“ERM”) is at the core of our corporate culture and is a shared responsibility across all\nbusiness functions. Our ERM processes are in place to accurately identify, assess, manage, and monitor risks in line with our\nstrategic objectives and risk appetite.\nWe maintain an Executive Risk Committee (ERC) which oversees the ERM function and is responsible for the design\nand review of risk management framework (RMF). The ERC is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), with the Chief\nExecutive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), GRIL Chief Executive Officer Ireland, and Chief Actuary as\nmembers. The Board of Directors approves the RMF on an annual basis or as appropriate.\nThe RMF sets out the risk management roles and responsibilities for all stakeholders across the organization, and sets the\nquantitative and qualitative metrics of our risk appetite, risk monitoring, and risk mitigation measures. The CRO collates risk\nmetrics from risk owners on at least a quarterly basis and presents a risk grid to the ERC and the Audit Committee of the Board\nof Directors.\nOne of the key objectives of our ERM function is to ensure that our underwriting efforts comply with explicitly stated\nunderwriting appetite. We establish limits to balance our risk position size with our expertise while containing the cost of\nincorrectly assessing risks and rewards. We believe that an informed, disciplined risk selection approach ties directly into our\nbusiness strategy. To achieve this, we encourage a collaborative, open work environment and group decision making. We\nclosely monitor our accumulations of exposure and frequently review our investment and underwriting portfolios to assess the\nimpact on capital under stressed scenarios. With the assistance of DME Advisors, we analyze our investment assets and\nliabilities, including the numerous risk components in our portfolio, such as concentration and liquidity risks.\nWe strive to encourage a culture of operational risk management, providing training and resources to all staff,\nmaintaining robust business continuity protocols, and establishing HR practices to motivate and retain talent. We maintain and\nclosely monitor our outsourcing, regulatory, and anti-money laundering policies and procedures. We recognize the impact of\nenvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks across the organization and have formed the Sustainability Management\nCommittee to address these, working closely with members of the ERC.\nInformation Technology (“IT”)\nWe employ a cloud-centric IT strategy, which allow us to scale our infrastructure dynamically based on demand. The\nstrategy prioritizes the use of cloud services for hosting applications, data storage, and other IT resources. With the use of\ncloud-based services, our security and systems reliability have proven cost-effective and have provided the required levels of\nservice and redundancy.\nWe have implemented backup procedures to ensure that key services are saved daily and can be restored as needed.\nWe have a disaster recovery plan for our IT infrastructure that includes data and system snapshots with restore points.\nWe conduct regular disaster recovery testing, and can access our core systems with minor outages and restore our primary\nsystems within our mean time to restore (MTTR).\nWe protect our information systems with physical, electronic, and software safeguards considered appropriate by our\nmanagement. We employ a specialist vendor to continuously monitor our systems for security events and risks within our\nnetwork. We regularly provide security risk awareness education and training to our staff and to the Board of Directors. Despite\nthese efforts, computer viruses, hackers, employee misuse or misconduct, and other internal or external hazards could expose\nour data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks, or other disruptions. Refer to “Item 1C. Cybersecurity” for more\ninformation on our cybersecurity risk management.\nSee “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Modeling risks are inherent in our business.”\nand “— Technology breaches or failures, including those resulting from a malicious ransomware or cyber-attack on us or\nour business partners and service providers, could disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our business.”\n18\nLink to Table of Contents\nHuman Capital Management\nHuman Capital Resources Oversight\nOur employees are our most valuable asset and are core to our success. We are focused on building a performance and\nresults-driven culture, which strives to get the best out of all employees and to help them to maximize their full potential. We\nbelieve in fostering an open and collaborative culture that encourages employees to take ownership of their performance and\ndevelopment. Our executive management team is committed to creating an environment where every employee can succeed.\nThe Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is actively engaged in the oversight of our employees, work\nenvironment, and compensation practices and receives regular updates from management on progress and developments.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) Initiatives\nDEI is core to our culture and business. We believe an inclusive and diverse workforce contributes different perspectives\nthat enable us to continue to succeed. We strive to create an environment of inclusion that is grounded in the strength and\ndiversity of our employees. As of December 31, 2023, 43% of our total global employees were female. In January 2024, we\nconducted a survey completed by 80% of our employees, with approximately 39% of employees identifying as racially or\nethnically diverse.\nEmployees\nAt March 1, 2024, we had 64 total employees worldwide, 36 of whom were based in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, 16\nin Dublin, Ireland, and 12 in London, United Kingdom. From time to time, we also engage consultants and contract with third\nparties, as needed, to provide additional resources to support our business activities.\nTalent Development\nWe recognize that our strength lies in our people and therefore we strive to hire talented people and invest significantly\nin our employees’ professional development and personal growth. We have implemented an employee training and\ndevelopment policy to encourage our employees to take advantage of training and development opportunities.\nWe also invest in the professional growth of our leaders through customized executive coaching to build advanced skills\nand capabilities.\nCompensation Practices\nWe have designed our performance-driven compensation policy to attract, motivate, reward and retain the best people.\nWe use short-term compensation composed of base salary and annual cash bonuses and long-term compensation composed of\nstock options, restricted share units, and restricted shares, as applicable, to align our employees’ and executive officers’\ninterests with those of our shareholders. In addition, from time to time and under certain circumstances, we award sign-on\nbonuses, retention bonuses, and other bonus opportunities. We also offer welfare benefits and other perquisites, including a\ndefined contribution pension plan and medical insurance coverage for our employees. As part of our commitment to supporting\nour employees, we match any contributions made by our employees to charities and not-for-profit organizations.\nWe believe our employees are fairly compensated without regard to gender, race, and ethnicity.\nWork Environment\nWe are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our workforce, including maintaining a workplace free from\ndiscrimination and harassment.

Capacity\nmay apply to a single risk, a program, a business line, or an entire book of\nbusiness. Capacity may be constrained by legal restrictions, corporate restrictions,\nor indirect financial restrictions such as capital adequacy requirements.\nCasualty reinsurance Casualty reinsurance is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to\nthird persons (persons other than the policyholder) and the legal liability imposed\non the policyholder resulting therefrom. Casualty reinsurance includes but is not\nlimited to workers’ compensation, automobile liability, and general liability. A\ngreater degree of unpredictability is generally associated with casualty risks known\nas ‘‘long-tail risks,’’ where losses take time to become known, and a claim may be\nseparated from the circumstances that caused it by several years. An example of a\nlong-tail casualty risk includes the use of certain drugs that may cause cancer or\nbirth defects. There tends to be a greater delay in the reporting and settlement of\ncasualty reinsurance claims due to the long-tail nature of the underlying casualty\nrisks and their greater potential for litigation.\nCatastrophe A severe loss, typically involving multiple claimants. Common perils include\nearthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, hailstorms, tornados, derechos, severe winter\nweather, floods, fires, explosions, volcanic eruptions, and other natural or human-\nmade disasters. Catastrophe losses may also arise from acts of war, acts of\nterrorism, and geopolitical instability.\nCede; cedent When a party reinsures its liability to another party, it ‘‘cedes’’ business to the\nreinsurer and is referred to as the ‘‘client.’’\nClaim Request by an insured or reinsured for indemnification by an insurance or\nreinsurance company for loss incurred from an insured peril or event.\nClient A party whose liability is reinsured by a reinsurer, also known as a cedent.\nCombined ratio The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio, acquisition cost ratio, and\nunderwriting expense ratio.\nComposite ratio The composite ratio is the ratio of underwriting losses incurred, loss adjustment\nexpenses, and acquisition costs, excluding underwriting-related general and\nadministrative expenses, to net premiums earned, or equivalently, the sum of the\nloss ratio and acquisition cost ratio.\nCorporate expenses Corporate expenses include those costs associated with operating as a publicly\nlisted entity and an allocation of other general and administrative expenses.\nDelegated authority A contractual arrangement between an insurer or reinsurer or an agent whereby the\nagent is authorized to bind insurance or reinsurance on behalf of the insurer or\nreinsurer. The authority is generally limited to a particular class or classes of\nbusiness and a particular territory. The exercise of the authority to bind insurance\nor reinsurance is generally subject to underwriting guidelines and other restrictions\nsuch as maximum premium income. Under the delegated authority, the agent is\nresponsible for issuing policy documentation, the collection of premium and may\nalso be responsible for the settlement of claims.\nDeposit assets and liabilities Assets (or liabilities) representing the consideration paid (or received) in\nconnection with contracts that do not incorporate sufficient risk transfer to merit\nreinsurance accounting.\n20\nLink to Table of Contents\nDevelopment The difference between the amount of reserves for losses and loss adjustment\nexpenses initially estimated by an insurer or reinsurer and the amount re-estimated\nin an evaluation at a later date.\nExcess of loss reinsurance Reinsurance that indemnifies the reinsured against all or a specified portion of\nlosses above a specified dollar or percentage loss ratio amount.\nFinancial strength rating The opinion of rating agencies regarding an insurance or reinsurance company’s\nfinancial ability to meet its financial obligations under its policies.\nFunds at Lloyd’s (FAL) Funds of an approved form that are lodged and held in trust at Lloyd's as security\nfor a member’s underwriting activities. They comprise the member’s deposit,\npersonal reserve fund, and special reserve fund. They may be drawn down if the\nmember’s syndicate-level premium trust funds are insufficient to cover its\nliabilities. The amount of the deposit is related to the member's premium income\nlimit and also the nature of the underwriting account.\nGross premiums written Total premiums for assumed reinsurance during a given period.\nHealth insurance Insurance against loss by illness or bodily injury. Health insurance covers\nmedicine, visits to the doctor or emergency room, hospital stays, and other medical\nexpenses.\nIncurred but not reported (IBNR) Reserves for estimated loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by insureds and\nreinsureds but not yet reported to the insurer or reinsurer, including unknown\nfuture developments on loss and loss adjustment expenses known to the insurer or\nreinsurer.\nLloyd’s Depending on the context, this term may refer to - (a) the society of individual and\ncorporate underwriting members that insure and reinsure risks as members of one\nor more syndicates. Lloyd’s is not an insurance company; (b) the underwriting\nroom in the Lloyd’s Building in which managing agents underwrite insurance and\nreinsurance on behalf of their syndicate members. In this sense, Lloyd’s should be\nunderstood as a marketplace; or (c) the Corporation of Lloyd’s, which regulates\nand provides support services to the Lloyd’s market.\nLoss adjustment expenses (LAE) The expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees, and the portion of\ngeneral expenses allocated to claim settlement costs. Also known as claim\nadjustment expenses.\nLoss ratio The loss ratio is calculated by dividing net loss and loss adjustment expenses\nincurred by net premiums earned.\nLoss reserves and loss adjustment Liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect the estimated cost of\nexpense reserves claims payments and the related expenses that the insurer or reinsurer will\nultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance or reinsurance contracts it has\nwritten.

This coverage includes errors and omissions policies,\ndirectors and officers coverage, and specialty coverage like employment practices\nliability insurance.\nProfit commission A commission paid by a reinsurer to a ceding insurer based on a predetermined\npercentage of the profit realized by the reinsurer on the ceded business.\n21\nLink to Table of Contents\nProperty insurance Property insurance covers a business’s building and its contents—money and\nsecurities, records, inventory, furniture, machinery, supplies, and even intangible\nassets such as trademarks—when damage, theft, or loss occurs.\nProperty catastrophe reinsurance Property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are typically ‘‘all risk’’ in nature,\nprotecting against losses from natural and human-made catastrophes. Losses on\nthese contracts typically stem from direct property damage and business\ninterruption.\nProportional reinsurance All forms of reinsurance in which the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the\noriginal premiums and losses of the reinsured. In proportional reinsurance, the\nreinsurer generally pays the client a ceding commission. The ceding commission is\ngenerally based on the client’s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured\n(including commissions, premium taxes, assessments, and miscellaneous\nadministrative expenses) and may include a profit component. Frequently referred\nto as quota-share reinsurance.\nQuota-share reinsurance A form of proportional reinsurance in which the reinsurer assumes an agreed\npercentage of each underlying insurance contract being reinsured.\nReinstatement premium Premium charged for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage to\nits full amount otherwise reduced as a result of a reinsurance loss payment.\nReinsurance An arrangement in which a reinsurer agrees to indemnify an insurance company,\nthe client, against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the client\nunder one or more policies. Reinsurance can provide a client with several benefits,\nincluding reducing net liability on individual risks and catastrophe protection from\nlarge or multiple losses. Reinsurance also provides a client with additional\nunderwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more\nbusiness than would be possible without a related increase in capital and surplus,\nand facilitates the maintenance of acceptable financial ratios by the client.\nReinsurance does not legally discharge the client from its liability with respect to\nits obligations to the insured.\nReinsurer An insurance company that assumes part of the risk in exchange for part of the\npremium to a primary insurer.\nRetrocession; retrocessional coverage A transaction whereby a reinsurer cedes to another reinsurer, commonly referred to\nas the retrocessionaire, all or part of the reinsurance that the first reinsurer has\nassumed. Retrocessional reinsurance does not legally discharge the ceding\nreinsurer from its liability with respect to its obligations to the reinsured.\nRisks A term used to denote the physical units of property at risk or the object of\ninsurance protection that are not perils or hazards. Also defined as chance of loss\nor uncertainty of loss.\nRisk-free rate The interest rate on a riskless or safe asset, usually taken to be a short-term U.S.\ngovernment security.\nRisk transfer The shifting of all or a part of a risk to another party.\nSeverity business Insurance/reinsurance characterized by contracts containing the potential for\nsignificant losses emanating from one event.\nSurety and fidelity insurance Surety and fidelity insurance includes (1) insurance guaranteeing the fidelity of\npersons holding positions of public or private trust; (2) insurance guaranteeing the\nperformance of contracts other than insurance policies and guaranteeing and\nexecuting bonds, undertakings, and contracts of suretyship; and (3) insurance\nindemnifying banks, bankers, brokers, financial or moneyed corporations or\nassociations against loss.\nSystem and Organizational Controls It is a reporting framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public\n(SOC) 2 Type II Report (“SOC 2 Accountants (“AICPA”) for independent audits of controls over information and\nReport”) systems relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and\nprivacy.\nSyndicate A member or group of members underwriting (re)insurance business at Lloyd’s\nthrough the agency of a managing agent or substitute agent to which a syndicate\nnumber is assigned.\nTreaty A reinsurance agreement covering a book or class of business that is automatically\naccepted on a bulk basis by a reinsurer. A treaty contains common contract terms\nalong with a specific risk definition, data on limit and retention, and provisions for\npremium and duration.\nUnderwriter An insurance or reinsurance company employee who examines, accepts, or rejects\nrisks and classifies risks to charge an appropriate premium for each accepted risk.\n22\nLink to Table of Contents\nUnderwriting The process of evaluating, defining, and pricing reinsurance risks including, where\nappropriate, the rejection of such risks, and the acceptance of the obligation to pay\nthe reinsured under the terms of the contract.\nUnderwriting expense Underwriting expenses include those expenses directly related to underwriting\nactivities that are not eligible to be capitalized and an allocation of other general\nand administrative expenses.\nUnderwriting expense ratio The underwriting expense ratio includes those expenses directly related to\nunderwriting activities and an allocation of other general and administrative\nexpenses. Therefore, the underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting\nexpenses to net premiums earned.

RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial\ncondition.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur results of operations fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\nOur results of operations fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including:\n● our assessment of the quality of available reinsurance and renewal opportunities;\n● loss experience on our reinsurance contracts;\n● reinsurance contract pricing;\n● the volume and mix of reinsurance products we underwrite; and\n● our ability to assess and integrate our risk management strategy.\nIn addition, our SILP investment strategy and Innovations investments are likely to be more volatile than traditional\nfixed-income portfolios composed primarily of investment-grade bonds. See “— Risks Relating to Our SILP Investment\nStrategy” and “— Risks Relating to Our Innovations Strategy.” Accordingly, our short-term results of operations may not be\nindicative of our long-term prospects.\nA downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our\nbusiness strategy.\nIf A.M. Best downgrades or withdraws either of our ratings, we could be severely limited or prevented from writing any\nnew reinsurance contracts, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy.\nAdditionally, if A.M. Best downgrades or withdraws our ratings, we cannot provide assurance that our regulators, CIMA and\nthe Central Bank of Ireland, would continue to authorize our current business strategy and investment strategy. See “—Risks\nRelating to Insurance and Other Regulations – Any suspension or revocation of our reinsurance licenses would materially and\nadversely impact our ability to do business and implement our business strategy.”\nGreenlight Re’s A.M. Best rating of “A- (Excellent)” with a stable outlook is the fourth highest of 13 ratings that A.M.\nBest issues. A.M. Best periodically reviews our ratings and may revise one or more of our ratings downward or revoke them at\nits sole discretion based primarily on its analysis of our balance sheet strength, operating performance, and business profile.\nPotential developments that may affect such an analysis include:\n● if A.M. Best alters its capital adequacy assessment methodology in a manner that would adversely affect the rating of\nour reinsurance entities;\n● if A.M. Best alters its approach regarding our SILP investment strategy or our Innovations investments;\n● if our actual losses significantly exceed our loss reserves;\n● if unfavorable financial or market trends impact us;\n● if we change our business practices from our organizational business plan in a manner that no longer supports our\nA.M. Best ratings;\n● if we are unable to retain our senior management and other key personnel or implement succession plans; or\n● if our investments incur significant losses.\n24\nLink to Table of Contents\nSubstantially all of our assumed reinsurance contracts contain provisions that permit our clients to cancel the contract or\nrequire additional collateral in the event of a downgrade in our A.M. Best ratings below specified levels or a reduction of our\ncapital or surplus below specified levels over the course of the agreement. Contracts containing such cancellation rights\nrepresented approximately 26% of gross premiums written during 2023. Additional collateral in the event of a downgrade in\nour A.M. Best ratings would be approximately $133.2 million at December 31, 2023.\nWe expect that similar provisions will also be included in future contracts. Whether a client would exercise such\ncancellation rights would likely depend on, among other things, the prevailing market conditions, the degree of unexpired\ncoverage, and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage. We cannot predict how many of our clients\nwould ultimately exercise such rights. The exercise of such rights in the aggregate could significantly affect our financial\ncondition, results of operations, and our underwriting capacity.\nIf our losses and LAE greatly exceed our loss reserves, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to accurately assess the potential losses and loss\nadjustment expenses associated with the risks we reinsure. Reserves are liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to\nreflect the estimated cost of claims payments and the related expenses that the insurer or reinsurer will ultimately be required to\npay in respect of insurance or reinsurance contracts it has written. The Company estimates these reserves based upon facts and\ncircumstances then known, estimates of future trends in claim severity, and other variable factors. The inherent uncertainties\nassociated with estimating loss reserves are generally greater for reinsurance companies than for primary insurance companies\ndue primarily to:\n● the lapse of time from the occurrence of an event to the reporting of the claim and the ultimate resolution or settlement\nof the claim;\n● the settlement delays associated with the reporting delays;\n● the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties;\n● the necessary reliance on clients for information regarding claims; and\n● other macro-economic changes which may impact reserves generally.\nOur reserve estimates may be less reliable than the reserve estimations of a reinsurer with a greater volume of business\nand more established loss history. Actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid may deviate substantially from the estimates\nof our loss reserves contained in our financial statements and could negatively affect our results of operations. If we determine\nour loss reserves to be inadequate, we will increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income and\ncapital in the period in which we identify the deficiency. If our losses and loss adjustment expenses greatly exceed our loss\nreserves, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. For a summary of the effects of reserve re-\nestimation on prior year reserves and net income, see “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates, Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves”.\nWe may need additional capital in the future in order to operate our business, and such capital may not be available to us or\nmay not be available to us on favorable terms.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future through public or private equity or debt offerings or otherwise in\norder to:\n● repay our debt;\n● fund liquidity needs or replace lost capital resulting from underwriting or investment losses;\n● meet rating agency capital requirements;\n● satisfy collateral requirements that may be imposed by our clients or by regulators;\n● meet applicable statutory jurisdiction requirements; or\n● respond to competitive pressures.\nAdditional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. Increases in interest rates could result in higher\ninterest expense on our outstanding debt. Further, any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute existing\nownership interest in our company and may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline. Additional capital raised\nthrough the issuance of debt may result in creditors having rights, preferences, and privileges senior or otherwise superior to\nthose of our ordinary shares.\n25\nLink to Table of Contents\nCompetitors with greater resources may make it difficult for us to effectively market our products or offer our products at a\nprofit.\nThe reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete with major reinsurers, many of which have substantially\ngreater financial, marketing, and management resources than we do, including Arch Capital, AXIS, Everest Re, Hamilton Re,\nHannover Re, Renaissance Re, and Sirius Point, as well as smaller companies, other niche reinsurers, and Lloyd’s syndicates\nand their related entities. Competition in the types of business that we underwrite is based on many factors, including:\n● the perceived financial strength and general reputation of the reinsurer, including its level of service, trustworthiness,\nbusiness practices, and other subjective matters;\n● ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;\n● relationships with reinsurance brokers;\n● pricing;\n● terms and conditions of products offered;\n● speed of claims payment; and\n● the experience and reputation of the members of our underwriting team in the particular lines of reinsurance we seek\nto underwrite.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the reinsurance market. Our failure to compete\neffectively could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and may increase the\nlikelihood that we will be deemed a passive foreign investment company or an investment company. See “— Risks Relating to\nTaxation — United States persons who own ordinary shares may be subject to United States federal income taxation on our\nundistributed earnings and may recognize ordinary income upon disposition of ordinary shares.” and “—Risks Relating to\nInsurance and Other Regulations — We are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under U.S. federal\nsecurities law.”\nConsolidation in the reinsurance industry could adversely affect us.\nThe reinsurance industry, including our competitors, customers, and insurance and reinsurance brokers, has experienced\nsignificant consolidation over the last several years. Consolidated entities may try to use their enhanced market power to\nnegotiate price reductions for our products and services. If competitive pressures reduce our prices, we would expect to write\nless business. If the insurance industry further consolidates, competition for customers may intensify, and the importance of\nacquiring and servicing each customer may become greater. We could incur greater expenses relating to customer acquisition\nand retention, further reducing our operating margins. In addition, insurance companies that merge may be able to spread their\nrisks across a larger capital base so that they require less reinsurance. The number of companies offering retrocessional\nreinsurance may decline. Reinsurance intermediaries could also consolidate, potentially adversely impacting our ability to\naccess business and distribute our products. We could also experience more robust competition from larger, better-capitalized\ncompetitors. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nChallenging economic or political conditions may adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by a challenging economic\nmarket, such as a highly inflationary environment. Our operations are susceptible to inflation, and underestimating inflation\nlevels could result in underpricing the risks we reinsure because premiums are established before the ultimate amounts of losses\nand LAE are known. While we consider the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates, our premiums may not\nfully offset the ultimate effects of inflation. Additionally, our reserving models include assumptions about future payments for\nthe settlement of claims and claims-handling expenses, such as the value of replacing property, associated labor costs for the\nproperty business we write, and litigation costs. The global inflationary environment in the last couple years has resulted in an\nincrease in our projected future claim costs, resulting in adverse loss reserve development. While the global inflationary\npressures have abated from their recent highs, any subsequent increase in inflation may lead to an increase in our loss reserves\nwith a corresponding reduction in net income in the period the deficiency is identified, which may have a material adverse\neffect on our results of operations and financial condition. Unanticipated higher inflation could also lead to higher interest rates,\npotentially negatively impacting the value of any rate-sensitive financial instruments held by SILP and could also impact our\nInnovations investments and cause us to incur higher interest expense on our debt. See “—Risks Related to Our SILP Investment\nStrategy” and “—Risks Related to Our Innovations Investments.”\n26\nLink to Table of Contents\nFurther, our results of operations and financial condition may also be materially adversely affected by a challenging\npolitical climate, including events such as military actions, invasions, wars, civil unrest and terrorist activities and the\nimposition of sanctions and importation limitations. For example, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the\nresulting responses have led to disruption, instability and volatility in global markets and industries. Although the severity and\nduration of the ongoing Ukraine conflict is impossible to predict, the continuing active conflict could lead to further economic\nuncertainty, represented by significant and prolonged volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as\nsupply chain interruptions. Due to the widespread impact of the ongoing conflict, it is likely to indirectly impact the markets in\nwhich we operate.\nThe effect of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business is uncertain.\nAs industry practices and social, political, legal, judicial, and regulatory conditions change, unexpected issues related to\nclaims and coverage have emerged and adversely affected our results. Examples of emerging claims and coverage issues\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n● new theories of liability and disputes regarding medical causation with respect to certain diseases;\n● assignment-of-benefits agreements, where rights of insurance claims and benefits of the insurance policy are\ntransferred to third parties, which can result in inflated repair costs and legal expenses to insurers and reinsurers;\n● claims related to political unrest, geopolitical instability, or other politically driven events, such as the conflict in the\nMiddle East, and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including loss claims relating to expropriation,\nforced abandonment, license cancellation, trade embargo, contract frustration, non-payment, war on land or political\nviolence (including terrorism, revolution, insurrection, and civil unrest);\n● claims related to data security breaches, information system failures, or cyber-attacks; and\n● claims related to business interruption including protocols enlisted by governments in connection with pandemics,\nand ransomware and cyber-attacks.\nAdditionally, various provisions of our contracts, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum,\nmay be difficult to enforce in the manner we intend due to, among other things, disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal\nforum. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond the period that we intended or by\nincreasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not manifest themselves until many years after\nwe have issued reinsurance contracts that are affected by these changes. As a result, we may not be able to ascertain the full\nextent of our liabilities under our reinsurance contracts for many years following the issuance of our contracts.\nThe property and casualty reinsurance market may be affected by cyclical trends.\nWe write reinsurance in the property and casualty markets, which are subject to pricing cycles. These cycles, as well as\nother factors that influence aggregate supply and demand for property and casualty reinsurance products, are outside our\ncontrol. Primary insurers’ underwriting results, prevailing general economic and market conditions, liability retention decisions\nof companies, and primary insurers and reinsurance premium rates influence the demand for property and casualty reinsurance.\nPrevailing prices and available surplus to support assumed business influence reinsurance supply. Supply may fluctuate in\nresponse to changes in return on capital realized in the reinsurance industry, the frequency and severity of losses, and prevailing\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nAs a result, the reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price\ncompetition due to high levels of available underwriting capacity and periods when shortages of capacity have permitted\nfavorable premium levels and changes in terms and conditions. The supply of available reinsurance capital could increase in\nfuture years, either due to capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or\nreinsurers.\nContinued increases in the supply of reinsurance may have consequences for the reinsurance industry generally and for\nus, including fewer contracts written, lower premium rates, increased expenses for customer acquisition and retention, less\nfavorable policy terms and conditions, and/or lower premium volume. The effects of cyclicality could materially and adversely\naffect our financial condition and results of operations.\n27\nLink to Table of Contents\nModeling risks are inherent in our business.\nWe believe that our modeling is critical to our business. We utilize modeling tools to facilitate the pricing, reserving, and\nrisk management of our reinsurance portfolio. These models help us to control risk accumulation, inform management and\nother stakeholders of capital requirements and to improve the risk/return profile or minimize the amount of capital required to\ncover the risks in each reinsurance contract. However, given the inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the\napplication of such techniques, these models and databases may not accurately address the emergence of a variety of matters\nthat might be deemed to impact certain of our coverages. These models have been developed internally, and in some cases, they\nmake use of third-party software. The construction of these models and the selection of assumptions require significant actuarial\njudgment. Furthermore, these models typically rely on either cedent or industry data, which may be incomplete or may be\nsubject to errors. Accordingly, these models, and the assumptions and judgements made in connection therewith, may\nunderstate the exposures we are assuming, and our financial results may be materially and adversely impacted.\nTechnology breaches or failures, including those resulting from a malicious ransomware or cyber-attack on us or our\nbusiness partners and service providers, could disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nOur information technology and application systems have been an important part of our underwriting process and our\nability to compete successfully. We have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties. We cannot be certain that we\nwill have access to these service providers or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as\nintended. In addition, we cannot be certain that we would be able to replace these systems without slowing our underwriting\nresponse time. Like all companies, we have information technology and application systems that are vulnerable to data\nbreaches, interruptions or failures due to events that may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters,\ntheft, terrorist attacks, malicious ransomware cyber-attacks, computer viruses, hackers and general technology failures.\nA major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could result in\nmanagement distraction, a violation of applicable privacy or other laws, harm our reputation, a loss of customers, or monetary\nfines or penalties or otherwise increased expenses. We believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to\nprevent significant data breaches, interruptions, or failures in, information technology and application systems. However,\ninternal controls provide only a reasonable, not absolute, assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities, and the\nineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe cybersecurity regulatory environment is evolving, and we expect the costs of complying with new or developing\nregulatory requirements to increase. These laws and regulations vary country to country and state to state, but they generally\nrequire the establishment of programs to detect and prevent unauthorized access to personal data and to mitigate theft of\npersonal data. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which establishes uniform data privacy laws\nacross the European Union (“EU”) is effective for all EU member states. The GDPR anticipates the processing of data for\nreinsurance and other purposes and applies standards and rules that covered entities must establish and monitor with respect to\nsuch processing and use. As our operations expand to other jurisdictions, we will be required to comply with cybersecurity laws\nin those jurisdictions, which will further increase our cost of compliance. See “Part 1, Item 1. Business - Regulations” and\n“Part 1C. Cybersecurity.”\nOur property and casualty reinsurance operations make us vulnerable to losses from catastrophes and may cause our results\nof operations to vary significantly from period to period.\nCertain of our reinsurance operations expose us to claims arising out of unpredictable catastrophic events, including\nlosses from severe weather and other natural catastrophes and man-made disasters such as acts of war or terrorism. The\nincidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, with climate change continuing to add to that inherent\nunpredictability as well as increasing the frequency and severity of events. To the extent climate change produces extreme\nchanges in temperatures and weather patterns, it could impact the frequency or severity of weather including, but not limited to,\nhurricanes, tornadoes, freezes, droughts, other storms, and wildfires. These changes in weather patterns could also affect the\nfrequency and severity of other natural catastrophe events to which we may be exposed. Further, such catastrophes could\nimpact the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, which could impact pricing. Additionally, increases in the\nvalue and geographic concentration of insured property, particularly along coastal regions, could cause the cost of such losses to\nincrease.\nCatastrophic losses are a function of the insured exposure in the affected area and the event’s severity. Claims from\ncatastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially\nand adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n28\nLink to Table of Contents\nFinally, given the scientific uncertainty of predicting the effect of climate cycles and global climate change on the\nfrequency and severity of natural catastrophes and the lack of adequate predictive tools, we may not be able to adequately\nmodel the associated exposures and potential losses in connection with such catastrophes which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nThe loss of significant brokers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nA significant portion of our business is placed through brokered transactions, which involve a limited number of\nreinsurance brokers, which has continued to decrease in recent years as a result of consolidation in the broker sector. Our\ntwo largest brokers each accounted for more than 10% of our gross written premiums, and in the aggregate, they accounted for\napproximately 33.7% of our gross premiums written in 2023. Because broker-produced business is concentrated with a small\nnumber of brokers, we are exposed to concentration risk. To lose or fail to expand all or a substantial portion of the business\nprovided through brokers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our clients’ evaluations of the risks associated with their insurance underwriting, which may subject us to\nreinsurance losses.\nIn our proportional reinsurance business, we do not expect to separately evaluate each of the original individual risks\nassumed under these reinsurance contracts. Therefore, we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by\nceding companies. We are subject to the risk that the clients may not have adequately evaluated the insured risks and that the\npremiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume. We also do not separately evaluate each of the\nindividual claims made on the underlying insurance contracts under quota share contracts, rendering us dependent on the claims\ndecisions our clients make.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our brokers, cedents, agents and other counterparties.\nIn accordance with industry practice, we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our policies to reinsurance\nbrokers, and these brokers, in turn, remit these amounts to the ceding companies that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities\nwith us. In some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a payment, we might remain liable to the client for the deficiency,\nnotwithstanding the broker’s obligation to make such payment. Conversely, in certain jurisdictions, when the client pays\npremiums for policies to reinsurance brokers for payment to us, these premiums are considered to have been paid, and the client\nwill no longer be liable to us for these premiums, whether or not we have actually received them. Consequently, we assume a\ndegree of credit risk associated with brokers.\nWe are also exposed to the credit risk of our cedents and agents, who, pursuant to their contracts with us, may be\nrequired to pay us profit commission, additional premiums, reinstatement premiums, and adjustments to ceding commissions\nover a period of time, which in some cases may extend beyond the initial period of risk coverage. Insolvency, liquidity\nproblems, distressed financial condition, or the general effects of an economic recession may increase the risk that our cedents\nor agents may not pay some or all of their obligations to us. To the extent our cedents or agents become unable to pay us, we\nwould be required to recognize a downward adjustment to our reinsurance balances receivable or loss and loss expenses\nrecoverable, as applicable, in our financial statements. While we generally seek to mitigate this risk through, among other\nthings, collateral agreements, funds withheld, corporate guarantees, and the right to offset receivables against any losses\npayable, an increased inability of customers to fulfill their obligations to us could have an adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur reinsurance balances receivable from brokers and cedents at December 31, 2023 totaled $619.4 million, which\nincluded premiums, ceding commissions receivable, and funds at Lloyd’s, a majority of which are not collateralized. We cannot\nprovide assurance that such receivables will be collected or that valuation allowances or write-downs for uncollectible balances\nwill not be required in future periods.\nWe may not successfully alleviate risk through reinsurance arrangements. Additionally, we may be unable to collect, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs part of our risk management, from time to time, we seek to purchase reinsurance for certain liabilities we reinsure to\nmitigate the effect of a potential concentration of losses upon our financial condition. The insolvency or inability or refusal of a\nretrocessionaire to make payments under the terms of its agreement with us could have an adverse effect on us because our\nobligations to our clients would remain. At certain times, market conditions have limited, and in some cases have prevented,\nreinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of retrocessional coverage they consider necessary for their business needs.\nAccordingly, we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of retrocessional coverage, negotiate terms that we deem\n29\nLink to Table of Contents\nappropriate or acceptable, or obtain retrocessional coverage from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness. Our inability to\nestablish adequate retrocessional arrangements or the failure of our retrocessional arrangements to protect us from overly\nconcentrated risk exposure could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with restrictive covenants contained in our current or future credit facilities could trigger prepayment\nobligations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur credit facility requires us and/or certain of our subsidiaries to comply with certain covenants, including restrictions\non our ability to place a lien or charge on pledged assets, issue debt, and in certain circumstances, on the payment of dividends.\nFor more details, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n- Liquidity”. Our failure to comply with these or other covenants could result in an event of default under the credit facility or\nany credit facility we may enter into in the future, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay the\namounts outstanding under these facilities prior to maturity. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not successfully obtain the necessary credit facilities to support our business strategy.\nAs noted in “Part 1, Item 1. Business - Regulations”, we are required to provide letters of credit or collateral to\njurisdictions in which we are not licensed or admitted as a reinsurer. While we have expanded our credit facilities with the\naddition of the CIBC LOC facility in late 2023, there is no assurance that the Citi LOC facility will be renewed in 2024 (see\nNote 16 “Commitments and Contingencies - Letters of Credit and Trusts” of the consolidated financial statements).\nIf we lose or are unable to retain or implement succession plans for our senior management and other key personnel, our\nability to implement our business strategy could be delayed or hindered, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on the efforts of our senior management and other key personnel to\nimplement our business strategy. We believe there are only a limited number of available qualified executives with substantial\nexperience in our industry and we currently do not maintain key life insurance with respect to any of our senior management.\nWe could face challenges and incur expenses in attracting and retaining personnel in the Cayman Islands, U.K., and Ireland.\nAccordingly, the loss of the services of one or more of the members of our senior management or other key personnel, or our\ninability to implement succession plans or hire and retain other key personnel, could prevent us from continuing to implement\nour business strategy and, consequently, materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy could be adversely affected by Cayman Islands employment restrictions.\nUnder Cayman Islands law, persons who are not Caymanian, do not possess Caymanian status, or are not otherwise\nentitled to reside and work in the Cayman Islands pursuant to provisions of the Immigration Act (as amended) of the Cayman\nIslands, which we refer to as the Immigration Act, may not engage in any gainful occupation in the Cayman Islands without an\nappropriate governmental work permit. Such a work permit may be granted or extended on a continuous basis for a maximum\nperiod of nine years (after having been legally and ordinarily resident in the Cayman Islands for a period of eight years a person\nmay apply for permanent residence in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act) upon showing that, after proper\npublic advertisement, no Caymanian or person of Caymanian status, or other person legally and ordinarily resident in the\nCayman Islands who meets the minimum standards for the advertised position is available. The failure of these work permits to\nbe granted or extended could prevent us from continuing to implement our business strategy.\nWe may face risks arising from future strategic transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, or joint ventures.\nWe may pursue strategic transactions from time to time, which could involve acquisitions or dispositions of businesses\nor assets. Any strategic transactions could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operation, or financial\ncondition. Sources of risk arising from these types of transactions include financial, accounting, tax, and regulatory challenges;\ndifficulties with integration, business retention, execution of strategy, unforeseen liabilities or market conditions; and other\nmanagerial or operating risks and challenges. Any future transactions could also subject us to risks such as failure to obtain\nappropriate value, post-closing claims being levied against us, and disruption to our other businesses during the negotiation or\nexecution process or thereafter. Accordingly, these risks and difficulties may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits\nfrom such strategic transactions. For example, businesses that we acquire or our strategic alliances or joint ventures may\nunderperform relative to the price paid or resources committed by us; we may not achieve anticipated cost savings; we may\notherwise be adversely affected by transaction-related charges; we may assume unknown or undisclosed business, operational,\ntax, regulatory and other liabilities; fail to accurately assess known contingent liabilities; or assume businesses with internal\ncontrol deficiencies. Risk-mitigating provisions that we put in place in the course of negotiating and executing these\n30\nLink to Table of Contents\ntransactions, such as due diligence efforts and indemnification provisions, may not be sufficient to fully address these risks and\ncontingencies.\nNon-compliance with laws, regulations, and taxation regarding transactions with international counterparties may adversely\naffect our business.\nAs we provide reinsurance on a worldwide basis, we are subject to an expanding legal, regulatory, and tax environment\nintended to help detect and prevent anti-trust activity, money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing, fraud, tax\navoidance, and other illicit activity. These requirements include, among others, regulations promulgated and administered by\nCIMA, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the\nIran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012, and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. These and other programs\nprohibit or restrict dealings with certain persons, entities, countries, governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals\nand may require detailed reporting to various administrative parties. Non-compliance with any of these regulations could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nCurrency fluctuations could result in exchange rate losses and negatively impact our business.\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar. However, we expect to write a portion of our business in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar. We may incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses as we ultimately receive premiums and settle claims in\nforeign currencies. In addition, SILP may invest in securities or cash denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nConsequently, we may experience exchange rate losses to the extent that our foreign currency exposure is not hedged, which\ncould materially and adversely affect our business. If we or SILP hedge our foreign currency exposure through forward foreign\ncurrency exchange contracts or currency swaps, we will be subject to the risk that the hedging counterparties to such\narrangements may fail to perform.\nRisks Relating to Insurance and Other Regulations\nAny suspension or revocation of any of our licenses would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nGreenlight Re is licensed as a reinsurer in the Cayman Islands and the EEA. We are also licensed to write insurance\nbusiness in the U.K. and the EEA through our Syndicate 3456. The suspension or revocation of any of our licenses to do\nbusiness in either of these jurisdictions for any reason would mean that we would not be able to enter into any new reinsurance\ncontracts in that jurisdiction until the suspension ended or we became licensed in another jurisdiction. The process of obtaining\nlicenses is time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to become licensed in another jurisdiction in the event we\nchoose to. Any such suspension or revocation of our license would negatively impact our reputation in the (re)insurance\nmarketplace, could have a material adverse effect on any potential license application and would materially and adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCIMA and the CBI may take a number of actions, including suspending or revoking a reinsurance license whenever the\nregulatory body believes that a licensee is or may become unable to meet its financial obligations, is carrying on business in a\nmanner likely to be detrimental to the public interest or the interest of its creditors or policyholders, has contravened the terms\nof the Act, or has otherwise behaved in such a manner so as to cause such regulatory body to call into question the licensee’s\nfitness to conduct regulated activity.\nFurther, based on statutes, regulations, and policies in their respective jurisdictions, CIMA and CBI may suspend or\nrevoke our licenses if certain events occur, including without limitation:\n● we cease to carry on reinsurance business;\n● the direction and management of our reinsurance business have not been conducted in accordance with laws and\nregulations;\n● we cease to meet certain capital and surplus requirements;\n● a person holding a position as a director, manager or officer is not deemed to be a fit or proper person to hold the\nrespective position; or\n● we become bankrupt, go into liquidation, or are wound up or otherwise dissolved.\nSimilarly, if either CIMA or the CBI suspended or revoked our licenses, we could lose our exemption under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) (See “— We are subject to the risk of\npossibly becoming an investment company under U.S. federal securities law.”)\n31\nLink to Table of Contents\nOur reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these\nrequirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nThe Insurance (Capital and Solvency) (Classes B, C, and D Insurers) Regulations (2018 Revision) (the “Capital and\nSolvency Regulations”) impose on Greenlight Re to maintain minimum statutory capital and surplus equal to the greater of: a)\nthe minimum capital requirement of $50 million and b) the prescribed capital requirement (the “Capital Requirements”). At\nDecember 31, 2023, Greenlight Re was in compliance with the Capital Requirements - see Note 18 “Statutory Requirements” of\nthe consolidated financial statements.\nGRIL, our Irish subsidiary, is required to comply with risk-based solvency requirements under the European legislation\nknown as “Solvency II,” including calculating and maintaining a minimum capital requirement and solvency capital\nrequirement. At December 31, 2023, GRIL’s minimum capital requirement and solvency capital requirement was\napproximately $9.8 million and $39.4 million, respectively. At December 31, 2023, GRIL was in compliance with the capital\nrequirements required under the Irish Insurance Acts and Regulations.\nAny failure to meet applicable requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements could subject us to further\nexamination or action by regulators, including restrictions on dividend payments, limitations on our writing of additional\nbusiness or engaging in financial or other activities, enhanced supervision, financial or other penalties, or liquidation. Further,\nany changes in existing risk-based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements may require us to increase\nour statutory capital levels, which we might be unable to do.\nWe are a holding company that depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends.\nWe are a holding company and do not have any significant operations or assets other than our ownership of the shares of\nour subsidiaries. Dividends and other permitted distributions from our subsidiaries are our primary source of funds to meet\nongoing cash requirements, including future debt service payments, if any, and other corporate expenses, and to repurchase\nshares or pay dividends to our shareholders if we choose to do so. Some of our subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory\nrestrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends. The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount\nsufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have an adverse effect on our\noperations and our ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends to our shareholders if we choose to do so and/or meet our debt\nservice obligations, if any.\nTo the extent any of our subsidiaries located in jurisdictions other than the Cayman Islands consider declaring dividends,\nsuch subsidiaries are required to comply with restrictions set forth under applicable law and regulations in such other\njurisdictions. These restrictions could adversely impact the Company.\nWe are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under U.S. federal securities law.\nIn the United States, the Investment Company Act regulates certain companies that invest in or trade securities. We rely\non an exemption under the Investment Company Act for an entity organized and regulated as a foreign insurance company\nwhich is engaged primarily and predominantly in the reinsurance of risks on insurance agreements. As we hold ourselves out as\na global specialty property and casualty reinsurer and we do not propose to engage primarily in the business of investing or\ntrading in securities, we believe the exemption applies. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are, or are likely to become in\nthe future, an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Nonetheless, the law in this area is not well developed,\nand there is a lack of definitive guidance as to the meaning of “primarily and predominantly” under the relevant exemption to\nthe Investment Company Act. If this exemption were deemed inapplicable, we would have to register under the Investment\nCompany Act as an investment company. Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive, and potentially\nadverse regulation relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, leverage, dividends, and\ntransactions with affiliates. Registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which\nwe operate our business, nor are registered investment companies permitted to have many of the relationships that we have with\nour affiliated companies. Any changes to our investment strategy necessitated by being labeled a registered investment\ncompany could materially and adversely impact our investment results, financial condition, and ability to implement our\nbusiness strategy.\nIf at any time it were established that we had been operating as an investment company in violation of the registration\nrequirements of the Investment Company Act, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could\nbecome subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, or that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third\nparties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period in which it was\nestablished that we were an unregistered investment company.\n32\nLink to Table of Contents\nTo the extent that the laws and regulations change in the future so that contracts we write are deemed not to be\nreinsurance contracts, we will be at greater risk of not qualifying for the Investment Company Act exception. Additionally, it is\npossible that our classification as an investment company would result in the suspension or revocation of our reinsurance\nlicense.\nInsurance regulations to which we are, or may become, subject, and potential changes thereto, could have a significant and\nnegative effect on our business.\nWe currently are admitted to do reinsurance business in the Cayman Islands and the European Economic Area. We are\nalso licensed to write insurance business in the U.K. and the EEA through our Syndicate 3456. Our operations in these\njurisdictions are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision. The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which\nour subsidiaries are domiciled require that, among other things, these subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of statutory or\nregulatory capital, surplus, and liquidity, meet solvency standards, submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition,\nand restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital. Statutes, regulations, and policies that our subsidiaries are subject\nto may also restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to write insurance and reinsurance policies, make certain investments, and\ndistribute funds.\nMore specifically, with respect to GRIL, Solvency II governs the prudential regulation of insurers and reinsurers, and\nrequires insurers and reinsurers in Europe to meet risk-based solvency requirements. It also imposes group solvency and\ngovernance requirements on groups with insurers and/or reinsurers operating in the European Economic Area. A number of\nEuropean Commission delegated acts and technical standards have been adopted, which set out more detailed requirements\nbased on the overarching provisions of the Solvency II Directive. However, further delegated acts, technical standards, and\nguidance are likely to be published on an ongoing basis.\nAlthough we presently are admitted to do business in the Cayman Islands, U.K. and the EEA, we cannot provide\nassurance that insurance regulators in the United States or elsewhere will not review our activities and claim that we are subject\nto such jurisdiction’s licensing requirements. In addition, we are subject to indirect regulatory requirements imposed by\njurisdictions that may limit our ability to provide reinsurance. For example, our ability to write reinsurance may be subject, in\ncertain cases, to arrangements satisfactory to applicable regulatory bodies, and proposed legislation and regulations may have\nthe effect of imposing additional requirements upon, or restricting the market for, non-U.S. reinsurers such as Greenlight Re\nand GRIL, with whom domestic companies may place business. We do not know of any such proposed legislation pending at\nthis time.\nWe may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain desired exemptions from, revised statutes, regulations, and policies\nthat currently, or may in the future, govern the conduct of our business. Failure to comply with, or to obtain desired\nauthorizations and/or exemptions under, any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or\nundertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines and\nother sanctions. The MAA includes amendments that provide for a specific administrative fines framework whereby CIMA has\nbeen granted the power to issue monetary penalties of up to 1 million Cayman Islands Dollars for a very serious breach.\nIn addition, governmental authorities worldwide have become increasingly interested in potential risks posed by the\ninsurance industry as a whole, and to the commercial and financial systems in general. While we cannot predict the exact\nnature, timing, or scope of possible governmental initiatives, there may be increased regulatory intervention in our industry in\nthe future. Changes in the laws or regulations to which our subsidiaries are subject or may become subject, or in the\ninterpretations thereof by enforcement or regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere are differences between Cayman Islands corporate law and Delaware corporate law with respect to interested party\ntransactions, which may benefit certain of our shareholders at the expense of other shareholders.\nAs a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect\nto the company and therefore it is considered that they owe certain duties to the company, including: a duty to act in\ngood faith and in what they consider to be in the best interests of the company; a duty not to make a profit out of their position\nas director (unless the company permits them to do so); a duty to exercise their powers for the purposes for which they are\nconferred; and a duty not to put themselves in a position where the interests of the company conflict with their personal interest\nor their duty to a third party. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. A\ndirector will need to exhibit in the performance of their duties both the degree of skill that may reasonably be expected from a\nsubjective perspective determined by reference to their knowledge and experience and the skill and care objectively to be\nexpected from a person occupying office as a director of the company.\n33\nLink to Table of Contents\nUnder Cayman Islands corporate law and pursuant to our Articles, a director may vote on a contract or transaction where\nthe director has an interest as a shareholder, director, officer, or employee, provided such interest is duly disclosed to the Board.\nIn exercising any such vote, such director's duties remain as described above. Pursuant to our Articles none of our contracts will\nbe deemed to be void purely because any director is an interested party in such transaction and in such circumstances, interested\nparties will generally not be held liable for monies owed to the Company. Under Delaware law, interested party transactions are\nvoidable.\nA failure by our Syndicate 3456 to comply with rules and regulations could materially and adversely interfere with our\nbusiness strategy.\nSyndicate 3456 is subject to Lloyd’s oversight. The PRA and the FCA regulate all financial services firms in the U.K.,\nincluding Lloyd’s and Syndicate 3456. Both the PRA and the FCA have substantial powers of intervention in relation to\nLloyd’s Syndicates, including the power to remove Lloyd’s authorization to manage such Syndicates. See “— Item 1. Business\n— Regulations — UK Regulations” for further discussion of such regulations.\nFailure to comply with, or any future regulatory changes or rulings to, the regulations of the PRA and/or the FCA could\ninterfere with the business strategy of Syndicate 3456, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our SILP Investment Strategy\nOur investment performance depends in part on the performance of SILP and may suffer as a result of adverse financial\nmarket developments or other factors that impact SILP’s liquidity, which could materially and adversely affect our\ninvestment results, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results depend in part on the performance of SILP. We cannot provide assurance that DME Advisors, on\nbehalf of SILP, will successfully structure investments in relation to our liquidity needs or liabilities. Failure to do so could\nforce us to make redemptions from SILP that cause DME Advisors to liquidate investments at a significant loss or at prices that\nare not optimal, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe risks associated with the value-oriented investment strategy expected to be employed by SILP may be substantially\ngreater than the risks associated with traditional fixed-income investment strategies. In addition, long equity investments may\ngenerate losses if the market declines. Similarly, short equity investments may generate losses in a rising market. The success of\nthe investment strategy may also be affected by general economic conditions. Unexpected market volatility and illiquidity\nassociated with our investment in SILP could materially and adversely affect our investment results, financial condition, or\nresults of operations.\nSILP may be concentrated in a few large positions, which could result in material adverse valuation movements.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted our investment guidelines, which provide that SILP may commit up to, but not more\nthan, 10% of Greenlight Re Surplus (as defined in the SILP LPA) and 7.5% of GRIL Surplus (as defined in the SILP LPA) to\nany single investment, unless a waiver has been obtained by the board of directors of Greenlight Re or GRIL, as applicable. At\nDecember 31, 2023, SILP, along with certain affiliates of DME Advisors, collectively owned 27.1% of Green Brick Partners,\nInc., a publicly traded company (NYSE: GRBK), or the “GRBK Shares”, which was subsequently reduced by approximately\n2% in January 2024. At December 31, 2023, SILP had invested more than 10% of Greenlight Re Surplus in GRBK. Under\napplicable securities laws, DME Advisors may be unable to, or limited in its ability to trade GRBK Shares on behalf of SILP.\nAs of the date of this filing, the board of directors of Greenlight Re had waived the applicable investment guidelines to allow\nSILP’s investment in the GRBK Shares to exceed the 10% threshold. The board of directors of Greenlight Re and GRIL may\ngrant future waivers relating to the GRBK Shares.\nIn addition, GRIL’s investment guidelines require that the ten largest investments shall not constitute more than 40% of\nthe GRIL Surplus, and GRIL’s investment portfolio shall at all times, unless waived by the GRIL board of directors, be\ncomposed of a minimum of 50 debt or equity securities of publicly traded companies. From time to time, SILP may hold a\nsmall number of relatively large security positions in relation to our capital accounts. Since SILP may not be widely diversified\nby security or by industry, it may be subject to more rapid changes in value than would be the case if our investment portfolio\nwere required to maintain a wide diversification among companies, securities industries, and types of securities.\n34\nLink to Table of Contents\nUnder the SILP LPA, we are contractually obligated to invest substantially all our assets in SILP with certain exceptions.\nSILP’s performance depends on the ability of DME Advisors to select and manage appropriate investments.\nDME Advisors acts as the exclusive investment advisor for SILP. Apart from funds required for collateral purposes,\nfunds allocated to our Innovations investment strategy, risk management, and other operational needs, we are contractually\nobligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause substantially all investable assets of Greenlight Re and GRIL to be\ncontributed to SILP. Additionally, we are restricted from making additional contributions of assets that would cause the capital\naccount balances of Greenlight Re and GRIL to represent more than 90% of the aggregate capital account balances of all of the\npartners of SILP. Although DME Advisors is contractually obligated to follow the investment guidelines of both Greenlight Re\nand GRIL, we cannot provide assurance as to how DME Advisors will allocate our investable assets to different investment\nopportunities. DME Advisors may allocate our capital accounts to long and short equity positions, debt, and derivatives, which\ncould increase the level of risk to which our investment portfolio will be exposed.\nThe performance of the SILP investment portfolio depends to a great extent on the ability of DME Advisors to select and\nmanage appropriate investments for SILP. We cannot assure you that DME Advisors will successfully meet our investment\nobjectives. The diminution or loss of the services of DME Advisors’ principals (or loss or diminution of their market\nreputation) or the failure of DME Advisors to perform adequately could materially and adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. In addition, the loss of DME Advisors’ key personnel, or DME Advisors’ inability to hire\nand retain other key personnel, over which we have no control, could delay or prevent DME Advisors from fulfilling its\nobligations, which could materially and adversely affect SILP’s performance and, correspondingly, our business and financial\nperformance.\nUnder our investment management structure, we have limited control over SILP.\nUnder the SILP LPA, subject to our investment guidelines and certain other conditions, DME II, as the general partner of\nSILP, has complete and exclusive power and responsibility for all investment and investment management decisions to be\nundertaken on behalf of SILP and for managing and administering the affairs of SILP. DME II has the power and authority to\ndo all things that it considers necessary or desirable to carry out its duties thereunder, including the power to delegate its\nauthorities. While SILP is not, and is not expected to be registered as an “investment company” under the Investment Company\nAct or any comparable U.S. regulatory requirements, the general partner, or its designee, may resign or withdraw from SILP\nand may admit new limited partners to SILP without our consent, which may cause SILP to be deemed an “investment\ncompany” under the Investment Company Act.\nThe SILP LPA limits our ability to use another investment manager.\nThe SILP LPA contains exclusivity and limited termination provisions. Accordingly, we are unable to use other\ninvestment managers for so long as Greenlight Re and GRIL are limited partners in SILP. Greenlight Re and GRIL, as limited\npartners of SILP may withdraw upon notice only on the Greenlight Re Relevant Date or the GRIL Relevant Date or “for\ncause” (each as defined in the SILP LPA). Additionally, while GRIL may withdraw as a limited partner in SILP due to\nunsatisfactory long-term performance of DME II or DME Advisors, as determined solely by the Board of Directors of GRIL at\nthe end of each fiscal year during the term of the SILP LPA, Greenlight Re may not.\nThe historical performance of DME Advisors and its affiliates should not be considered indicative of the future results of the\nSILP investment portfolio, our future results, or any returns expected on our ordinary shares.\nThe historical returns of SILP and other funds managed by DME Advisors and its affiliates are not directly linked to our\nordinary shares. Results for the SILP investment portfolio could differ from those of other funds managed by DME Advisors\nand its affiliates due to restrictions imposed by our investment guidelines and other factors.\nPotential conflicts of interest with DME Advisors and its affiliates may exist that could adversely affect us.\nDME Advisors and its affiliates, in addition to managing SILP, may engage in investment and trading activities for their\nown accounts and/or for the accounts of third parties. None of DME Advisors or its affiliates, including David Einhorn,\nChairman of our Board of Directors and the President of Greenlight Capital, Inc., is obligated to devote any specific amount of\ntime, effort or allocation, or prioritize any investment opportunity, to SILP or to address possible or actual conflicts among the\naccounts they may manage, which may adversely affect SILP’s investment returns, and, correspondingly, our investment\nreturns.\nIn addition, under Cayman Islands laws, Mr. Einhorn is not legally restricted from participating in making decisions with\nrespect to Greenlight Re’s investment guidelines. Accordingly, his involvement as a member of the Boards of Directors of\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd. and Greenlight Re may lead to a conflict of interest.\n35\nLink to Table of Contents\nDME Advisors and its affiliates may also manage accounts whose advisory fee schedules, investment objectives, and\npolicies differ from those of SILP, which may cause DME Advisors and its affiliates to effect trading in one account that may\nhave an adverse effect on another account, including SILP. We do not have the contractual right to inspect the trading records\nof DME Advisors or its principals.\nCertain investments made by SILP may have limited liquidity and lack valuation data which could create a conflict of\ninterest.\nOur investment guidelines allow SILP to invest in certain securities with limited liquidity or no public market. This lack\nof liquidity may adversely affect the ability of SILP to execute trade orders at desired prices and may impact our ability to\nfulfill our underwriting payment obligations. To the extent that SILP invests in securities or instruments for which market\nquotations are not readily available, the valuation of such securities and instruments for purposes of compensation will be\ndetermined by DME Advisors, whose determination, subject to audit verification, will be conclusive and binding in the absence\nof bad faith or manifest error.\nIn addition, for all securities traded on public exchanges, each exchange typically has the right to suspend or limit trading\nin all securities it lists. Such a suspension could render it impossible to liquidate positions and thereby expose SILP and,\ncorrespondingly us, to losses.\nIf DME Advisor’s risk management methodologies are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.\nDME Advisors and its affiliates continually refine its risk management techniques, strategies, and assessment methods.\nHowever, its risk management techniques and strategies do not fully mitigate the risk exposure of its funds and managed\naccounts, including SILP, in all economic or market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that it might fail to\nidentify or anticipate. Any failures in DME Advisors’ risk management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify risk\nexposure could affect the risk-adjusted returns of SILP. In addition, any risk management failures could cause losses to be\nsignificantly greater than historical measures predict. DME Advisors’ approach to managing those risks could prove\ninsufficient, exposing SILP, and correspondingly our SILP investment portfolio, to material unanticipated or material losses.\nThe compensation arrangements of SILP may create an incentive to effect transactions that are risky or speculative.\nPursuant to the SILP LPA, each of Greenlight Re and GRIL is obligated to pay a performance allocation of 20% to DME\nII at the end of each performance period based on its positive performance change to its capital account, subject to a modified\nloss carry forward provision.\nThe loss carry forward provision contained in the SILP LPA allows DME II to earn a reduced performance allocation of\n10% of profits in any year subsequent to the year in which SILP has incurred a loss until all losses are recouped and an\nadditional amount equal to 150% of the loss is earned.\nWhile the performance compensation arrangement contained in the SILP LPA provides that losses will be carried\nforward as an offset against net profits in subsequent periods, DME II and DME Advisors generally will not otherwise be\npenalized for losses or decreases in the value of our portfolio under the SILP LPA. These performance compensation\narrangements may incentivize DME Advisors to engage in transactions that focus on the potential for short-term gains rather\nthan long-term growth or that are particularly risky or speculative.\nDME Advisors’ representatives’ service on boards and committees may place trading restrictions on our investments and\nmay subject us to indemnification liability.\nDME Advisors may, from time to time, place its or its affiliates’ representatives on creditors’ committees and/or boards\nof certain companies in which SILP has invested. While such representation may enable DME Advisors to enhance the sale\nvalue of SILP’s investments, it may also prevent SILP from freely disposing of investments. The IAA provides for the\nindemnification of DME Advisors or any other person designated by DME Advisors for claims arising from such board\nrepresentation.\nThe ability to use “soft dollars” may provide DME Advisors with an incentive to select certain brokers that may take into\naccount benefits to be received by DME Advisors.\nDME Advisors is entitled to use so-called “soft dollars” generated by commissions paid in connection with transactions\nfor SILP to pay for certain of DME Advisors’ operating and overhead costs, including the payment of all or a portion of its\ncosts and expenses of operation. “Soft dollars” are a means of paying brokerage firms for their services through commission\nrevenue rather than through direct payments. DME Advisors only uses soft dollars to pay for expenses that would otherwise be\nborne by SILP and certain other co-managed funds. However, DME Advisors’ right to use soft dollars may give DME Advisors\nan incentive to select brokers or dealers for our transactions or to negotiate commission rates or other execution terms in a\n36\nLink to Table of Contents\nmanner that takes into account the soft dollar benefits received by DME Advisors rather than giving exclusive consideration to\nthe interests of our investment portfolio and, accordingly, may create a conflict.\nIncreased regulation or scrutiny of alternative investment advisors may affect DME Advisors’ ability to manage SILP or\naffect our business reputation.\nThe regulatory environment for investment managers is evolving, and changes in the regulation of managers may\nadversely affect the ability of DME Advisors to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its trading\nstrategies. In addition, the securities and futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin\nrequirements. The SEC, other regulators, and self-regulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary\nactions in the event of market emergencies. The regulation of derivatives transactions and funds that engage in such transactions\nis an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. Any future regulatory change could\nhave a significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and SILP are exposed to credit risk from counterparties that may default on their obligations to us.\nWe and SILP are exposed to credit risk from counterparties that may default on their obligations to us or it. The amount\nof the maximum exposure to credit risk is indicated by the carrying value of our and SILP’s financial assets. In addition, SILP\nholds the securities of our investment portfolio with prime brokers and has credit risk from the possibility that one or more of\nthem may default on their obligations to SILP. Other than our investment in derivative contracts and corporate debt, if any, and\nthe fact that our investments are held by prime brokers and custodians on our behalf, we have no other significant\nconcentrations of credit risk in our investment portfolio.\nIssuers or borrowers whose securities or debt SILP holds, customers, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing\nhouses, and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us and/or SILP due to bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. Such defaults could have\na significant and negative effect on us and/or SILP and, correspondingly, our investment portfolio and our results of operations,\nfinancial condition, and cash flows.\nSILP effectuates short sales that subject our capital accounts to material and adverse loss potential.\nSILP enters into transactions in which it sells a security it does not own, which we refer to as a short sale, in anticipation\nof a decline in the market value of the security. Short sales subject our capital accounts in SILP to material and adverse loss\npotential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase.\nShort-sale transactions have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, including the imposition of restrictions on\nshort selling certain securities and reporting requirements. SILP’s ability to execute a short selling strategy may be materially\nand adversely impacted by new temporary and/or permanent rules, interpretations, prohibitions, and restrictions adopted in\nresponse to these adverse market events. Temporary restrictions and/or prohibitions on short selling activity may be imposed by\nregulatory authorities with little or no advance notice and may impact prior and future trading activities of our investment\nportfolio. Additionally, the SEC, its non-U.S. counterparts, other governmental authorities, and/or self-regulatory organizations\nmay at any time promulgate permanent rules or interpretations consistent with such temporary restrictions or that impose\nadditional or different permanent or temporary limitations or prohibitions.\nFurther, regulatory authorities may, from time to time, impose restrictions that adversely affect SILP’s ability to borrow\ncertain securities in connection with short sale transactions. As a result, SILP may be unable to effectively pursue a short-selling\nstrategy which may adversely affect SILP’s investment returns, and correspondingly, our investment returns.\nSILP may trade on margin and use other forms of financial leverage, which may increase the risk of our investment\nportfolio.\nOur investment guidelines allow SILP to trade on margin and use other forms of financial leverage. SILP relies on prime\nbrokers to extend leverage and such prime brokers may elect not to provide leverage to SILP. Fluctuations in the market value\nof our investment in SILP could have a disproportionately large effect in relation to our capital. Any event which may adversely\naffect the value of positions SILP holds could materially and adversely affect the net asset value of our investment portfolio and\nour results of operations.\n37\nLink to Table of Contents\nSILP may transact in derivatives trading, which may increase the risks associated with our investment portfolio.\nDerivative instruments, or derivatives, include futures, options, swaps, structured securities, and other instruments and\ncontracts that derive their value from one or more underlying securities, financial benchmarks, currencies, commodities, or\nindices. There are a number of risks associated with derivatives trading. Because many derivatives are leveraged, a relatively\nsmall adverse market movement may result in a substantial loss and may expose us to a loss exceeding the original amount\ninvested. Derivatives may also expose SILP, and correspondingly, our investment portfolio, to liquidity risk as there may not be\na liquid market within which to close or dispose of outstanding derivative contracts. The counterparty risk lies with each party\nwith whom SILP contracts for the purpose of making derivative investments. In the event of the counterparty’s default, SILP\nwill generally only rank as an unsecured creditor and risk the loss of all or a portion of the amounts SILP is contractually\nentitled to receive.\nSILP may invest in securities based outside the United States, which may be riskier than securities of United States issuers.\nUnder our investment guidelines, SILP may invest in securities of issuers organized or based outside the United States.\nThese investments may be subject to a variety of risks and other special considerations not affecting securities of U.S. issuers.\nMany foreign securities markets are not as developed or efficient as those in the United States. Securities of some foreign\nissuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. issuers. Similarly, volume and liquidity in many\nforeign securities markets are less than in the United States and, at times, price volatility can be greater than in the United\nStates. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less stringent financial reporting and informational disclosure standards, regulatory\noversight, practices, and requirements than those applicable to U.S. issuers.\nRisks Relating to Our Innovations Strategy\nThe carrying values of our Innovations investments may differ significantly from those that would be used if we carried\nthese investments at fair value. Additionally, we have a material concentration in our top five holdings at December 31,\n2023.\nOur Innovations investments include private investments and unlisted equities in early-stage or start-up entities for which\nno active market may exist. We carry these investments on our consolidated balance sheets at cost, less impairment, plus or\nminus observable price changes (see “Critical Accounting Estimates - “Investments” under “Part II, Item 8. Management\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”). These carrying values may differ significantly\nfrom those that would be used if we carried them at fair value. If we were required to liquidate all or a portion of these\ninvestments quickly, we could realize significantly less than the carrying value. The carrying value of our Innovations\ninvestments may become concentrated in a limited number of entities as a result of subsequent remeasurement and/or have\nsignificant exposure to certain geographic areas or economic sectors. The concentration of investments can increase investment\nrisk and volatility. At December 31, 2023, our top five holdings accounted for 67% of the total carrying value. Any of the\nforegoing could result in a decline in our investment performance and capital resources and, accordingly, could materially and\nadversely affect our financial results and results of operations.\nOur Innovations investments carry higher risks due to illiquidity.\nWe invest in illiquid equity and debt instruments of early-stage companies in our Innovations investments portfolio.\nFurthermore, our Innovations investments are generally subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales that limit our ability to\nliquidate these investments in the short term. As such, there is a high liquidity risk due to the lack of active markets. We may\nnot be able to sell timely, or at all, illiquid holdings of early-stage companies facing significant challenges operationally and\nfinancially subsequent to our initial investment (see below “Investments in privately held early-stage companies involve\nsignificant risks”). Accordingly, this could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur Innovations investments support our underwriting operations and the failure to identify and consummate investment\nopportunities may materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy.\nWe operate in a competitive market for Innovations investment opportunities. Many of our competitors have\nconsiderably greater resources than we do. If we fail to compete for or otherwise lose the opportunity to make Innovations\ninvestments, which support our underwriting strategy, our ability to implement our business strategy may be materially and\nadversely impacted.\nInvestments in privately held early-stage companies involve significant risks.\nOur Innovations unit primarily invests in privately held early-stage companies. Investments in privately held early-stage\ncompanies involve a number of significant risks, including the following:\n38\nLink to Table of Contents\n• these companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their operating obligations;\n• they typically have limited operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger\nbusinesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors’ actions and market conditions, as well as\ngeneral economic downturns;\n• they typically depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons. Therefore, the death,\ndisability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on such\ninvestment and, in turn, on us;\n• they may not have adequate internal controls which would make them susceptible to fraud or mismanagement;\n• there is generally little public information about these companies. These companies and their financial information are\ngenerally not subject to the Exchange Act and other regulations that govern public companies, and we may be unable\nto uncover all material information about these companies, which may prevent us from making a fully informed\ninvestment decision and cause us to lose money on our investments;\n• they generally have less predictable operating results and may require substantial additional capital to support their\noperations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position;\n• changes in laws and regulations (including applicable tax laws), as well as their interpretations, may adversely affect\ntheir business, financial structure or prospects; and\n• they may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs.\nEconomic recessions or downturns could impair our Innovations investment and harm our operating results.\nThe current macroeconomic environment is characterized by record-high inflation, supply chain challenges, labor\nshortages, high interest rates, foreign currency exchange volatility, volatility in global capital markets and growing recession\nrisk. The risks associated with our Innovations investments and the businesses of the entities in which we have invested are\nmore severe during periods of economic slowdown or recession.\nMany of our Innovations investments may be susceptible to economic downturns or recessions. Therefore, during these\nperiods the carry values of our Innovations portfolio may decrease if we are required to write down the values of our\ninvestments. Adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of our investments. Economic slowdowns or\nrecessions could lead to financial losses in our Innovations portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets.\nOur Innovations investments are made in entities that may incur debt or issue equity securities that rank equally with, or\nsenior to, our investments in such companies.\nOur Innovations investments are made in entities that have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt, or issue other equity\nsecurities, that rank equally with, or senior to, our investments. By their terms, such instruments may provide that the holders\nare entitled to receive payment of dividends, interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive\npayments in respect of our investments. These debt instruments would usually prohibit the investments from paying interest on\nor repaying our investments in the event and during the continuance of a default under such debt. Also, in the event of\ninsolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of an entity, holders of securities ranking senior to our\ninvestment typically are entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After\nrepaying such holders, the entity may not have any remaining assets for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of securities\nranking equally with our investments, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other security holders in\nthe event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant entity.\nAs a minority equity investor, we are often not in a position to influence the entity, and other equity holders and\nmanagement of such entity may make decisions that could decrease the value of our investment in such entity.\nWhen we make a minority equity investment through our Innovations unit, we are subject to the risk that an entity may\nmake business decisions with which we disagree. The other equity holders and management of the entity may take risks or\notherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests. As a result, an entity may make decisions that could decrease the value of\nour investment.\nOur Innovations investments are in entities that may be highly leveraged.\nSome of our Innovations investments are made in entities that may be highly leveraged, which may have adverse\nconsequences for those companies and for us as a shareholder. The entity may be subject to restrictive financial and operating\ncovenants and their leverage may impair the ability to finance their future operations and capital needs. As a result, such\n39\nLink to Table of Contents\nentity’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to take advantage of business opportunities\nmay be limited.\nOur failure to make follow-on investments in our existing Innovations investments could impair the value of our\nportfolio.\nFollowing an initial investment in an entity, we may make additional investments in the entity as “follow-on”\ninvestments to: (1) increase or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage; (2) exercise warrants, options or\nconvertible securities that we acquired in the original or subsequent financing or (3) attempt to preserve or enhance the value of\nour investment.\nWe may elect not to make follow-on investments, be constrained in our ability to employ available funds, or otherwise\nlack sufficient funds to make those investments. We have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the\navailability of capital resources. The failure to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the\ncontinued viability of an entity, dilute our investment, or result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a\nsuccessful operation. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a follow-on investment, we may elect not to make it because\nwe may not want to increase our concentration of risk, we prefer other opportunities, or we are constrained under the\nInvestment Company Act. See “–Risks Relating to Insurance and Other Regulations – We are subject to the risk of possibly\nbecoming and investment company under U.S. federal securities laws.”\nRisks Relating to Our Ordinary Shares\nOur ability to achieve our business objectives depends on our ability to manage and deploy capital.\nOur ability to achieve our business objectives depends on our ability to manage and deploy capital, which depends, in\nturn, on our management’s ability, with oversight from our Board of Directors, to identity, evaluate and monitor our\nunderwriting and investment results, our liquidity and competing needs for capital. We cannot assure you that our management\nand deployment of capital will enable us to achieve our business objectives, and our failure to effectively manage and deploy\nour capital could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur level of debt may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, restrict our current and future operations, particularly our\nability to respond to business opportunities, and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $73.3 million of debt outstanding (December 31, 2022: $80.5 million) that matures on\nAugust 1, 2026. Our level of debt and the provisions of such debt could have significant consequences, which include, but are\nnot limited to, the following:\n•\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures,\nacquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;\n•\nrequire a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other\npurposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures,\nacquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n•\ndiscourage an acquisition of us by a third party;\n•\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors carrying less debt; and\n•\nmake us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures or\ntake advantage of new opportunities to grow our business.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness debt upon maturity on acceptable terms or at all.\nA shareholder may be required to sell its ordinary shares.\nOur Articles provide that we have the option, but not the obligation, to require a shareholder to sell its ordinary shares for\ntheir fair market value to us, to other shareholders or to third parties if our Board of Directors determines that ownership of our\nordinary shares by such shareholder may result in adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to us, any of our subsidiaries or\nany of our shareholders and that such sale is necessary to avoid or cure such adverse consequences.\n40\nLink to Table of Contents\nProvisions of our Articles, the Companies Act of the Cayman Islands (the “Companies Act”) and our corporate structure\nmay each impede a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares.\nOur Articles contain certain provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would\nbe beneficial to our shareholders. Our Articles provide that a director may only be removed for “cause” as defined in the\nArticles, upon the affirmative vote of not less than 50% of the votes cast at a meeting at which more than 50% of our issued and\noutstanding ordinary shares are represented. Further, under the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation of Greenlight Re, a director may only be removed without cause upon the affirmative vote of not less than 80% of\nthe votes cast at a meeting at which more than 50% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares are represented.\nOur Articles permit our Board of Directors to issue preferred shares from time to time, with such rights and preferences\nas they consider appropriate. Our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions\nand under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction, deny shareholders the receipt\nof a premium on their ordinary shares in the event of a tender or other offer for ordinary shares and have a depressive effect on\nthe market price of the ordinary shares.\nAs compared to mergers under corporate law in the United States, it may be more difficult to consummate a merger of\ntwo or more companies in the Cayman Islands or the merger of one or more Cayman Islands companies with one or more\noverseas companies, even if such transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders. For example, a merger or consolidation\ngenerally requires the consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest, unless the court waives such requirement,\nand a formal declaration must be made, meeting enumerated requirements, if the transaction involves a foreign company or\nwhere the surviving company is the Cayman Islands exempted company.\nThe Companies Act also includes statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies,\nprovided that such a scheme of arrangement is approved by (i) in respect of shareholders, 75% in value of the shareholders or\neach class of shareholder who attend and vote, either in person or by proxy, at a meeting or meetings convened for that purpose;\nor (ii) in respect of creditors, a majority in number representing 75% in value of creditors or each class of creditors who attend\nand vote, either in person or by proxy, at a meeting or meetings convened for that purpose.\nThe convening of the scheme meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand\nCourt of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction\nought not to be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that:\n● the company is not proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of its corporate authority and the statutory\nprovisions as to majority vote have been complied with;\n● the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the classes properly delineated;\n● the scheme of arrangement is such as a businessperson would reasonably approve; and\n● the scheme of arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the\nCompanies Act or that would amount to a “fraud on the minority”.\nIf a scheme of arrangement is thus approved, the dissenting shareholders would have no rights comparable to appraisal\nrights, which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\nHolders of ordinary shares may have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us, and they may face difficulties\nin protecting their interests because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law.\nWe are an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and conduct a\nmajority of our operations outside the United States. A significant amount of our assets are located outside the United States. A\nmajority of our officers and directors reside outside the United States and substantial portion of the assets of those persons are\nlocated outside of the United States. As a result, it could be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or\nagainst these individuals outside of the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed upon\nunder the applicable securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the\nCayman Islands could render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our Articles, the Companies Act and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The\nrights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors and us, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary\nresponsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the\nCayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as\n41\nLink to Table of Contents\nwell as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The\nrights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under the laws of the Cayman Islands are not as\nclearly defined as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the United States. Therefore, you may have\nmore difficulty protecting your interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United\nStates, due to the comparatively less well developed Cayman Islands law in this area.\nShareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies such as ours have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to\ninspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders. Our directors have discretion under our\nArticles to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders,\nbut are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the\ninformation needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in\nconnection with a proxy contest.\nThe courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United\nStates predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in\noriginal actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of\nthe federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in\nnature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the\nUnited States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of\ncompetent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes\nupon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met.\nFor a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated\nsum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the\nsame matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is,\ncontrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held\nto be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are\nbeing brought elsewhere.\nWe are not aware nor have we been advised of any reported class action having been brought in a Cayman Islands court.\nDerivative actions have been brought in the Cayman Islands courts, and the Cayman Islands courts have confirmed the\navailability for such actions. In most cases, we will be the proper plaintiff in any claim based on a breach of duty owed to us,\nand a claim against (for example) our officers or directors usually may not be brought by a shareholder. However, based both\non Cayman Islands authorities and on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority and be\napplied by a court in the Cayman Islands, exceptions to the foregoing principle apply in circumstances in which:\n● a company is acting, or proposing to act, illegally or beyond the scope of its authority;\n● the act complained of, although not beyond the scope of the authority, could be effected if duly authorized by more\n● than the number of votes which have actually been obtained; or\n● those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.”\nA shareholder may have a direct right of action against us where the individual rights of that shareholder have been\ninfringed or are about to be infringed.\nSubject to limited exceptions, under Cayman Islands law, a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action\nagainst our Board of Directors.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your\ninvestment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common shares.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our ordinary shares for the foreseeable future. Therefore, you are not\nlikely to receive any dividends on your ordinary shares for the foreseeable future. The success of an investment in our ordinary\nshares will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that our ordinary shares will appreciate in\nvalue or even maintain the price at which our shareholders have purchased their shares.\nIn the event that we did declare a dividend, such dividends and other distributions on issued and outstanding ordinary\nshares may only be paid out of the funds of the Company lawfully available for such purpose. Dividends and other distributions\nwill be distributed among the holders of our ordinary shares on a pro rata basis.\n42\nLink to Table of Contents\nRisks Relating to Taxation\nWe may become subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands, which would negatively affect our results.\nUnder current Cayman Islands law, we are not obligated to pay any taxes in the Cayman Islands on either income or\ncapital gains. The Governor-in-Cabinet of Cayman Islands has granted us an exemption from the imposition of any such tax on\nus until February 1, 2025. We cannot be assured that after such date we would not be subject to any such tax. As the law\ncurrently stands, upon the expiration of the current exemption, it will be possible for us to apply for another 20 year exemption,\nwhich we plan to do. If we were to become subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands, our financial condition and results of\noperations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to United States federal income taxation.\nGreenlight Capital Re and Greenlight Re are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and GRIL is\nincorporated under the laws of Ireland. These entities intend to operate in a manner that will not cause us to be treated as\nengaging in a trade or business within the United States and will not cause us to be subject to current United States federal\nincome taxation on Greenlight Capital Re’s, Greenlight Re’s and/or GRIL’s net income. However, because there are no\ndefinitive standards provided by the Internal Revenue Code, regulations or court decisions as to the specific activities that\nconstitute being engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, and as any such determination is\nessentially factual in nature, we cannot provide assurance that the United States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), will not\nsuccessfully assert that Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re and/or GRIL are engaged in a trade or business within the United\nStates. If the IRS were to successfully assert that Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re, and/or GRIL have been engaged in a\ntrade or business within the United States in any taxable year, various adverse tax consequences could result, including the\nfollowing: Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re and/or GRIL may become subject to current United States federal income\ntaxation on its net income from sources within the United States; Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re and/or GRIL may be\nsubject to United States federal income tax on a portion of its net investment income, regardless of its source; and Greenlight\nCapital Re, Greenlight Re and/or GRIL may be subject to United States branch profits tax on profits deemed to have been\ndistributed out of the United States.\nUnited States persons who own ordinary shares may be subject to United States federal income taxation on our\nundistributed earnings and may recognize ordinary income upon disposition of ordinary shares.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company. Potential adverse United States federal income tax consequences, including\ncertain reporting requirements, generally apply to any United States person who owns shares in a passive foreign investment\ncompany, or a “PFIC”. We believe that based upon implementation of our business plan, none of Greenlight Capital Re,\nGreenlight Re, or GRIL will be, or should be, a PFIC for the current taxable year or for any foreseeable future years.\nIn general, any of Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re or GRIL would be a PFIC for a taxable year if either (i) 75% or\nmore of its income constitutes “passive income” or (ii) 50% or more of its assets produce “passive income”, or are held for the\nproduction of passive income. Passive income generally includes interest, dividends and other investment income. However,\nunder an “active insurance” exception, income is not treated as passive if it is derived in the active conduct of an insurance\nbusiness by a qualifying insurance corporation. A qualifying insurance corporation is an insurance company which has\napplicable insurance liabilities, as reported on its annual financial statement, exceeding 25% of its total assets. Applicable\ninsurance liabilities means, with respect to our property and casualty reinsurance business, reserves for loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses, and excluding unearned premium reserves.\nThe exception for insurance companies is intended to ensure that a qualifying insurance entity’s income is not treated as\npassive income, except to the extent such income is attributable to financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of the\ninsurance business. We intend to operate our business with financial reserves and applicable insurance liabilities at levels that\nshould not cause us to be deemed PFICs, although we cannot provide definitive assurance that we will be successful in\nstructuring our operations to meet such levels nor can we ensure that the IRS will not successfully challenge our status. If we\nare unable to underwrite sufficient amount of risks and maintain a sufficient amount of applicable insurance liabilities, any of\nGreenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re or GRIL may become a PFIC.\nIn addition, sufficient risk must be transferred under an insurance entity’s contracts with its insureds in order to qualify\nfor the insurance exception. Whether our insurance contracts possess adequate risk transfer for purposes of determining whether\nincome under our contracts is insurance income, and whether we are predominantly engaged in an insurance business, are\nsubjective in nature and there is little authoritative tax guidance on these issues. We cannot provide assurance that the IRS will\nnot successfully challenge our interpretation of the scope of the active insurance company exception and our qualification for\n43\nLink to Table of Contents\nthe exception. Further, the IRS may issue regulatory or other guidance that causes us to fail to qualify for the active insurance\ncompany exception on a prospective or retroactive basis. Therefore, we cannot provide definitive assurance that we will satisfy\nthe exception for insurance companies and will not be treated as PFICs currently or in the future.\nControlled Foreign Corporation (“CFC”). United States persons who, directly or indirectly or through attribution rules,\nown 10% or more of the total combined voting power or value of our shares, which we refer to as United States 10%\nshareholders, may be subject to the controlled foreign corporation, or CFC, rules. Under the CFC rules, each United States 10%\nshareholder must annually include their pro-rata share of the CFC’s “subpart F income” and “global intangible low-tax income”\nin their gross income in the year earned by the CFC, even if no distributions are made. In general, a foreign insurance company\nwill be treated as a CFC only if during the taxable year United States 10% shareholders collectively own more than 25% of the\ntotal combined voting power or total value of the entity’s shares. We believe that the dispersion of our ordinary shares among\nholders and the restrictions placed on transfer, issuance or repurchase of our ordinary shares, will in most cases prevent\nshareholders who acquire ordinary shares from being United States 10% shareholders. We cannot provide assurance, however,\nthat these rules will not apply to you if you are or become a United States 10% shareholder. In particular, recent changes to the\ndefinition of a United States 10% Shareholder, whereby both vote and value are tested, and recent changes to the constructive\nownership rules, whereby shares owned by non-United States persons can be attributed to United States persons, may increase\nthe likelihood of these rules applying. If you are a United States person, we strongly urge you to consult your own tax advisor\nconcerning the CFC rules.\nRelated Person Insurance Income. If:\n● our gross income attributable to insurance or reinsurance policies where the direct or indirect insureds are our direct or\nindirect United States shareholders or persons related to such United States shareholders equals or exceeds 20% of our\ngross insurance income in any taxable year; and\n● direct or indirect insureds and persons related to such insureds owned directly or indirectly 20% or more of the voting\npower or value of our stock,\na United States person who owns ordinary shares directly or indirectly on the last day of the taxable year would most likely be\nrequired to include their pro-rata share of our related person insurance income for the taxable year in their income. This amount\nwould be determined as if such related person insurance income were distributed proportionally to United States persons at that\ndate. We do not expect that we will knowingly enter into reinsurance agreements in which, in the aggregate, the direct or\nindirect insureds are, or are related to, owners of 20% or more of the ordinary shares. We do not believe that the 20% gross\ninsurance income threshold will be met. However, we cannot provide assurance that this is or will continue to be the case.\nConsequently, we cannot provide assurance that a person who is a direct or indirect United States shareholder will not be\nrequired to include amounts in its income in respect of related person insurance income in any taxable year.\nIf a United States shareholder is treated as disposing of shares in a foreign insurance corporation that has related person\ninsurance income and in which United States persons own 25% or more of the voting power or value of the entity’s shares, any\ngain from the disposition will generally be treated as a dividend to the extent of the United States shareholder’s portion of the\ncorporation’s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the United States shareholder\nowned the shares. In addition, the shareholder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, regardless of the\namount of shares owned by the direct or indirect United States shareholder. Although not free from doubt, we believe these\nrules should not apply to dispositions of ordinary shares because Greenlight Capital Re is not directly engaged in the insurance\nbusiness and because proposed United States Treasury regulations applicable to this situation appear to apply only in the case of\nshares of corporations that are directly engaged in the insurance business. We cannot provide assurance, however, that the IRS\nwill interpret the proposed regulations in this manner or that the proposed regulations will not be promulgated in final form in a\nmanner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of ordinary shares.\nUnited States tax-exempt organizations who own ordinary shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income.\nIf you are a United States tax-exempt organization you may recognize unrelated business taxable income if a portion of\nour subpart F insurance income is allocated to you. In general, subpart F insurance income will be allocated to you if we are a\nCFC as discussed above and you are a United States 10% shareholder or there is related person insurance income and certain\nexceptions do not apply. Although we do not believe that any United States persons will be allocated subpart F insurance\nincome, we cannot provide assurance that this will be the case. If you are a United States tax-exempt organization, we advise\nyou to consult your own tax advisor regarding the risk of recognizing unrelated business taxable income.\n44\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) may cause us to undertake changes to the manner in which we conduct our business\nand could subject United States persons who own ordinary shares to United States income taxation on our undistributed\nearnings.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA provides a bright-line test that a non-U.S. insurance\ncompany only will receive the benefit, for passive foreign investment company purposes, of being engaged in the active\nconduct of an insurance business if its applicable insurance liabilities constitute more than 25% of its total assets. For this\npurpose, the term “applicable insurance liabilities” does not include unearned premium reserves. One of the TCJA’s potential\nimpacts is that this limitation could result in the treatment of offshore insurers or reinsurers that write business on a low\nfrequency/high severity basis, such as property catastrophe companies and financial guaranty companies, as PFICs, as\nsignificant reserves for losses may not be recorded until a catastrophic event actually occurs. Accordingly, subject to any future\ncorrections or clarifications that may be made to the TCJA, or any additional regulations that may be promulgated thereunder,\nthe Company will be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year in which it does not meet the bright-line applicable insurance\nliabilities requirement of the TCJA.\nAt December 31, 2023, we met the bright-line applicable insurance liabilities test. However, there is still substantial\nuncertainty regarding the application of the test. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to meet the bright-line applicable\ninsurance liabilities test in future periods. In the event that we cannot meet this test, shareholders that are United States persons\nwill be subject to United States income taxation on our undistributed earnings.\nFurther changes in United States tax regulations and laws including the rules regarding passive foreign investment\ncompanies could have a material impact on our ability to qualify for the insurance company exemption and/or change our\nstatus for United States persons who own ordinary shares.\nA non-U.S. corporation will generally be considered a passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”), for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes, in any taxable year if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income or (ii) at\nleast 50% of the value of its assets is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income.\nBased on our past and current projections of our income and assets, we do not expect the Company to be a PFIC for the\n2023 taxable year or for the foreseeable future. However, since our projections may differ from our actual business results and\nour market capitalization and value of our assets may fluctuate, we cannot definitively assure you that we will not be or become\na PFIC in the current taxable year or any future taxable year.\nWe are monitoring developments with respect to both the applicable insurance liabilities test and the IRS regulations. At\nthis time, we cannot predict whether or what, if any, additional regulations will be adopted or additional legislation will be\nenacted. If regulations are adopted or legislation enacted that cause us to fail to meet the requirements of the insurance company\nexception, or if we fail to meet the applicable insurance liabilities test such failure could have a material adverse effect on the\ntaxation of our shareholders who are U.S. persons. In that event we may undertake further changes to the manner in which we\nconduct our business, which also could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nThe tax laws and interpretations regarding whether an entity is engaged in a United States trade or business, is a CFC,\nhas related party insurance income or is a PFIC are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. New regulations or\npronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be forthcoming from the IRS. We are not able to predict if, when or\nin what form such guidance will be provided and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect.\nThe TCJA may have a detrimental effect on the Company and its assets.\nThe regulatory and tax environment globally is evolving, and changes in the regulation or taxation of the Company and\nits assets may materially adversely shareholders. The TCJA among other things, made significant changes to the rules\napplicable to the taxation of the Company and its assets, such as changing the rules applicable to active insurance income for\npassive foreign investment company purposes (discussed above), changing rules applicable to controlled foreign investment\ncompany purposes, new base erosion rules, changing the general corporate tax rate to a flat 21% rate, modifying the rules\nregarding limitations on certain deductions, introducing a capital investment deduction in certain circumstances, placing certain\nlimitations on the interest deduction, modifying the rules regarding the usability of certain net operating losses, and the\nmigration from a worldwide system of taxation to a modified territorial system. At this time the ultimate outcome of the\nlegislation on the Company and its shareholders is uncertain and could be adverse. Shareholders should consult their own tax\nadvisors regarding potential changes in tax laws.\n45\nLink to Table of Contents\nIf investments held by GRIL are determined not to be integral to the reinsurance business carried on by GRIL, additional\nIrish tax could be imposed and our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nBased on administrative practice, taxable income derived from investments made by GRIL is generally taxed in Ireland\nat the rate of 12.5% on the grounds that such investments either form part of the permanent capital required by regulatory\nauthorities, or are otherwise integral to the reinsurance business carried on by GRIL. GRIL intends to operate in such a manner\nso that the level of investments held by GRIL does not exceed the amount that is integral to the reinsurance businesses carried\non by GRIL. If, however, investment income earned by GRIL exceeds these thresholds or if the administrative practice of the\nIrish Revenue Commissioners changes, Irish corporation tax could apply to such investment income at a higher rate (currently\n25%) instead of the general 12.5% rate, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe impact of the initiative of the OECD and the EU to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely\naffect our tax status in the Cayman Islands where we are exempt from income taxes.\nThe OECD has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non-member countries on\nmeasures to limit harmful tax competition. These measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax neutral\njurisdictions and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world. The Cayman Islands was removed from the EU’s list of\nnon-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes in October 2020 following the introduction of economic substance and private\nfunds legislation and it is considered to be a country which co-operates with the EU with no pending commitments. While the\nCayman Islands is currently on the list of co-operative jurisdictions, we are not able to predict if additional requirements will be\nimposed, and if so, whether changes arising from such additional requirements will subject us to additional taxes. The Cayman\nIslands’ economic substance legislation had already been evaluated in June 2019 by the OECD’s Forum on Harmful Tax\nPractices as “not harmful”, which is the highest rating possible. There are no immediate regulatory, tax, trade or other legal\nimpacts to the Company, but we are not able to predict any future EU actions.\nOn October 8, 2021, the OECD announced an accord endorsing and providing an implementation plan for a global\nminimum tax rate of at least 15% for large multinational corporations on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, known as the “two\npillar plan.” While the Company is not currently aware of any definitive actions being taken in the Cayman Islands to\nimplement a minimum tax, in Ireland, a bill implementing the two pillar plan was signed into law on December 18, 2023,\nincluding an “undertaxed profit rule” that will come into effect in 2025. In the United Kingdom, there was an announcement on\nNovember 17, 2023 that the government intends to implement an “undertaxed profit rule” with effect no earlier than 2025 as\npart of its legislation implementing the two pillar plan. If the Cayman Islands does not adopt a minimum tax, the undertaxed\nprofits rule may allow Irish or United Kingdom tax authorities to collect more tax from our Irish or United Kingdom\ncompanies. The global minimum tax rules implemented in different jurisdictions (including the undertaxed profit rule) would\napply to overseas profits of multinational firms with annual revenue of more than €750 million. While these global minimum\ntax rules are not expected to apply to the Company as currently proposed and being implemented in jurisdictions applicable to\nthe Company’s operations, due to the Company’s revenues currently falling below the proposed annual revenue threshold,\nadjustments to the threshold or continued growth of the Company’s revenues could impact the Company in future periods.\nFurther, even if the Company did eventually meet the applicable threshold due to continued revenue growth or otherwise, then\ngiven the size and structure of the Company, the Company may be eligible to meet an initial phase transitional safe harbor\nprovided for in the model rules of the accord (and incorporated into the Irish legislation), which provides relief from taxation\nunder the accord for a period of up to five additional years after the Company comes within the scope of the rules.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity is a complex and constantly evolving risk that we are committed to understanding and mitigating. The\nfoundation of our information security practices is rooted in the principles set forth by the National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (\"NIST\"), ensuring a robust and comprehensive approach to safeguarding our digital assets. This program provides\nstandards, guidelines, and best practices for improving our cybersecurity risk management. To effectively manage our\ncybersecurity risk, we employ a comprehensive approach encompassing risk assessment, identification, and mitigation, all\naligned with the rigorous standards and principles. Cybersecurity and IT compliance risk metrics are monitored regularly to\nassess, identify, manage and protect our environment. Periodic audits of IT and Cybersecurity are carried out as part of internal\nand external audits and are performed by professionals.\nOur approach to third-party cybersecurity underscores a commitment to robust risk management and adherence to\nindustry best practices. By implementing comprehensive measures in line with recognized standards, we ensure that our third-\nparty cybersecurity protocols are aligned with rigorous standards. Regular assessments, SOC reviews, and collaborative efforts\n46\nLink to Table of Contents\nare integral components of our strategy, aimed at fostering a secure and resilient ecosystem that safeguards sensitive\ninformation and maintains the integrity of our digital infrastructure in partnership with external entities.\nWe have a Chief Information Security Officer (\"CISO\") and have an IT Steering Committee (\"ITSC\"). Our CISO is\nresponsible for establishing the cybersecurity vision for the Company, determining and prioritizing cybersecurity initiatives,\nand keeping abreast of developing security threats. The ITSC reports to the Board and Audit Committee, is chaired by our Chief\nRisk Officer (“CRO”), and has our CISO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), and GRILChief Executive Officer, and SEC\nReporting Officer as some of its members. Our CISO brings over three decades of expertise in the IT Industry and is a member\nof ISACA, showcasing a rich portfolio of industry certifications like the Certified Information Security Manager (“CISM”),\nCertified Data Privacy Solutions Engineer (“CPDSE”), and Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (“MCSE”). The CISO also\nholds accreditations from vendors such as CISCO and Microsoft. Our CRO has over 20 years’ experience in the property and\ncasualty reinsurance industry, and significant expertise in the field of risk management. He holds a CISM certification, as well\nas a B.Sc. in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Salford. Other members of the ITSC hold\nrelevant qualifications and collectively, the ITSC has substantial experience and expertise in cybersecurity, risk, strategy, and\nmanagement.\nThe ITSC meets at least quarterly to discuss and approve IT and Cybersecurity matters. The ITSC produces and approves\nan annual IT budget, as well as an Incident Management and Response plan through which the CISO and the ITSC are\ninformed about cybersecurity incidents.\nTo assist with mitigating the risks of cybersecurity threats, periodic cybersecurity training is provided to employees,\nvendors, and members of the Board. Further, to mitigate risk arising from our relationships with third-parties, key vendors must\nbe SOC 2 compliant, as determined in accordance with the framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public\nAccountants, or undertake the Company’s enhanced due diligence process. Periodic testing is performed, and all material\nincidents are reported to the Board.\nIT and cybersecurity are a standing Board agenda item, with quarterly presentations to the Board from the IT leadership\nquarterly. Our Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight responsibilities regarding our systems, policies, and\nprocedures relating to technology and cybersecurity. The Audit Committee’s charter mandates that the Audit Committee\nreviews our technology and cybersecurity systems, policies, and procedures (including those relating to our assessment of third-\nparty provider cybersecurity controls) with management. The Audit Committee is further tasked with discussing with\nmanagement the policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including those related to technology and\ncybersecurity. The CRO presents an IT and Cybersecurity update to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis and additionally\nas needed, to inform it of any new or emerging cybersecurity threats or risks.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we have not identified or experienced any cybersecurity threats or incidents\nlikely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial conditions.\nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — Technology breaches or failures, including those\nresulting from a malicious ransomware or cyber-attack on us or our business partners and service providers, could disrupt\nor otherwise negatively impact our business.”\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe lease office space in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, where our principal executive office is located. Additionally,\nwe lease office spaces in the United Kingdom and Ireland. We renew and enter into new leases in the ordinary course of\nbusiness.\nWe believe that our office space is sufficient for us to conduct our operations for the foreseeable future. For further\ndiscussion of our lease commitments at December 31, 2023, refer to Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” of the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, we may be involved in formal and informal dispute resolution\nprocedures, which may include arbitration or litigation, the outcomes of which determine our rights and obligations under our\nreinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, we may seek to enforce our rights under an\nagreement or to collect funds owing to us. In other matters, we may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged\nrights. While the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of our existing\ncontractual disputes, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults.\n47\nLink to Table of Contents\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information and number of holders\nOur ordinary shares are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE.” During 2023, we\neliminated our dual-class share structure (see Note 10 “Share Capital” of the consolidated financial statements).\nOn March 1, 2024, there were 57 holders of record of our ordinary shares. This figure does not include the beneficial\nowners of our ordinary shares held in “street name” or held through participants in depositories, such as the Depository Trust\nCompany.\nDividends\nSince inception, we have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares.\nHolders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors in\naccordance with the provisions of our Articles and the Companies Law. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up\nof the Company, the holders of ordinary shares are entitled to share equally and ratably in our assets, if any remain after the\npayment of all of our debts and liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding preferred shares.\nWe currently do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. Our Board of\nDirectors would only approve a dividend after taking into account our capital and liquidity position. In addition, a letter of\ncredit facility prohibits us from paying dividends during an event of default as defined in the letter of credit agreement. Our\nfuture dividend policy will also depend on the requirements of any future financing agreements to which we may be a party and\nother factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors, such as our results of operations and cash flows, our financial\nposition, and capital requirements, general business conditions, rating agency guidelines, legal, tax, regulatory and any\ncontractual restrictions on the payment of dividends. Further, any future declaration and payment of dividends are discretionary,\nand our Board of Directors may, at any time, modify or revoke our dividend policy on our ordinary shares. Finally, our ability\nto pay dividends also depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. Although Greenlight Capital Re is not\nsubject to any significant legal prohibitions on the payment of dividends, Greenlight Re and GRIL are subject to regulatory\nconstraints that affect their ability to pay dividends and include minimum net worth requirements. At December 31, 2023,\nGreenlight Re and GRIL both exceeded the minimum statutory capital requirements. Any dividends we pay will be declared\nand paid in U.S. dollars.\n48\nPerformance Graph\nPresented below is a line graph comparing the yearly change in the cumulative total shareholder return on our ordinary\nshares for the five year period commencing December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2023 against the total return index for\nthe Russell 2000 Index, or RUT, and the S&P 500 Property & Casualty Insurance Index, or S&P Insurance Index, for the same\nperiod.

On May 2, 2023, our Board of Directors re-approved the share repurchase plan effective from July 1, 2023 until\nJune 30, 2024, authorizing us to repurchase up to $25.0 million of ordinary shares or securities convertible into ordinary shares\nin the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans. Any shares repurchased are\ncanceled immediately upon repurchase. We are not required to repurchase any of the ordinary shares. The repurchase plan may\nbe modified, suspended, or terminated at the election of our Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nThere were no share repurchases made under the plan during the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.\n49\nLink to Table of Contents\nITEM 6.

Tabular dollars are presented in thousands, with the\nexception of per share amounts or as otherwise noted.\n50\nLink to Table of Contents\nOverview\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a global specialty property and casualty reinsurer headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with an underwriting\nand investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. Our goal is to build long-term\nshareholder value by providing risk management solutions to the insurance, reinsurance, and other risk marketplaces. Refer to\n“Part 1, Item 1. Business” for additional information.\nWe earned a net income of $86.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $61.5 million, or 243%\nover the prior year, as a result of favorable reinsurance pricing conditions with lower losses from catastrophe and weather-\nrelated events (collectively referred as “CAT losses”), coupled with favorable rising interest rate environment for our cash and\nfixed maturity investments (relating to the Lloyd’s syndicates) as well as favorable foreign exchange movement in 2023.\nThe following is a summary of our financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the prior\nyear:\n• Gross premiums written was $636.8 million, an increase of 13.1%;\n• Net premiums earned was $583.1 million, an increase of 24.2%;\n• Net underwriting income (1) was $32.0 million, compared to an underwriting loss of $10.7 million;\n• Total investment income was $66.1 million, a decrease of 4.2% (include 9.4% net return from our investment\nin SILP, compared to 25.3%);\n• Diluted EPS was $2.50, an increase of 242%; and\n• Fully diluted book per share(1) was $16.74, an increase of 16.8%.\n(1) See “Key Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures” section of this MD&A.\nOutlook and Trends\nFollowing strong pricing improvements at the January 1, 2023 renewal season and throughout 2023 (primarily in\nproperty catastrophe, aviation, war and terror and marine), we witnessed a more disciplined but still attractive January 1, 2024\nrenewal season. In the property market we noted additional capacity entering the market, but we still saw favorable market\nconditions to grow our book. On our Specialty and FAL books, we noted a healthy amount of competitive interest but we were\nsuccessful in securing the accounts we targeted for both renewal and new business with some modest rate increases.\nThe global inflationary pressures have abated from their recent highs. However, we believe loss cost inflation will\ncontinue to be a significant concern within the (re)insurance industry, as it can add uncertainty to the cost of claims, particularly\nfor classes of business with long payout tails. As a result, it creates pricing challenges for new business and valuation\nchallenges in claims reserves. We continue to manage these concerns and risks in multiple ways:\n• Our underwriting strategy focuses on relatively shorter-tailed business, which is inherently less exposed to\ninflation than longer-tailed lines. We estimate the payout duration of our existing reserves at less than three years.\n• We incorporate inflation assumptions in all our pricing and reassess these assumptions frequently.\n• We are minimizing our exposure to classes that are experiencing severe supply-chain-driven inflation.\nThe rising interest rate environment over the last two years has had a mixed impact on our financial results. The Term\nLoans we secured in 2023 are partially exposed to fluctuations in the SOFR interest rate, and we stand to benefit if the interest\nrates start decreasing. The higher interest rates have improved the yield on our restricted cash and cash equivalents and our\nfunds held at Lloyd’s. To the extent interest rates begin to decrease, we may see some of these trends reverse. The SILP\ninvestment portfolio is positioned to benefit from an inflationary environment.\nRevenues and Expenses\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues from two principal sources:\n• premiums from reinsurance on property and casualty business assumed (net of any premiums ceded) - see “Critical\nAccounting Estimates” section of this MD&A; and\n51\nLink to Table of Contents\n• income from investments, including:\n• income (or loss) generated from our investment in SILP, net of management fee and performance\ncompensation;\n• gains (or losses) from our other investments, including Innovations-related investments; and\n• interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and FAL.\nIn addition, we may from time to time derive other income from foreign exchange gains (or losses) relating to\nunderwriting balances, net investment income from Lloyd’s syndicates, fees generated from advisory services, and fees relating\nto overrides, profit commissions, and fees due upon the early termination of contracts.\nExpenses\nOur expenses consist primarily of the following:\n● underwriting losses and LAE;\n● acquisition costs;\n● general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses; and\n● interest expense on deposit-accounted contracts and debt.\nThe extent of our net losses and LAE incurred is a function of the amount and type of reinsurance contracts we write and\nthe loss experience of the underlying coverage. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of this MD&A.\nAcquisition costs consist primarily of brokerage fees, ceding commissions, premium taxes, profit commissions, letters of\ncredit and trust fees, and federal excise taxes. We amortize deferred acquisition costs relating to successfully bound reinsurance\ncontracts over the related contract term.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and related costs, including costs\nassociated with our incentive compensation plan, bonuses, and stock compensation expenses. General and administrative\nexpenses also include professional fees (non-claim related), travel and entertainment, information technology, rent, and other\ngeneral operating costs. General and administrative expenses reported in our consolidated statements of operations include both\nunderwriting and corporate expenses.\nDeposit interest expense relates to the accretion costs for deposit-accounted contracts that did not meet the risk transfer\ncondition for reinsurance accounting under U.S. GAAP.\nInterest expense consists of interest paid and accrued on our debt and the amortization of the related deferred financing\ncosts.\nKey Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement uses certain key financial measures, some of which are not prescribed under U.S. GAAP rules and\nstandards (“non-GAAP financial measures”), to evaluate our financial performance, financial position, and the change in\nshareholder value. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in SEC Regulation G, is a numerical measure of a\ncompany’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts\nthat are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented under U.S. GAAP.\nWe believe that these measures, which may be calculated or defined differently by other companies, provide consistent and\ncomparable metrics of our business performance to help shareholders understand performance trends and facilitate a more\nthorough understanding of the Company’s business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for\nthose determined under U.S. GAAP.\nThe key non-GAAP financial measures used in this Annual Report are:\n• Fully diluted book value per share; and\n• Net underwriting income (loss).\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are described below.\n52\nLink to Table of Contents\nFully Diluted Book Value Per Share\nOur primary financial goal is to increase fully diluted book value per share over the long term. We use fully diluted\nbook value as a financial measure in our incentive compensation plan.\nWe believe that long-term growth in fully diluted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial\nperformance because it provides management and investors a yardstick to monitor the shareholder value generated. Fully\ndiluted book value per share may also help our investors, shareholders, and other interested parties form a basis of comparison\nwith other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry. Fully diluted book value per share should not be\nviewed as a substitute for the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, which in our view is the basic book value per share.\nWe calculate basic book value per share as (a) ending shareholders' equity, divided by (b) the total ordinary shares\nissued and outstanding, as reported in the consolidated financial statements. In prior years, we calculated the basic book value\nper share by modifying the denominator to exclude unearned performance-based restricted shares granted after December 31,\n2021. We have revised this calculation in 2023 to eliminate the basic book value per share non-GAAP financial measure and\nhave restated the 2022 comparative basic book value per share in the table below and elsewhere in this Annual Report to\nconform with the current presentation.\nFully diluted book value per share represents basic book value per share combined with any dilutive impact of in-the-\nmoney stock options and all outstanding restricted stock units “RSUs”. We believe these adjustments better reflect the ultimate\ndilution to our shareholders.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the fully diluted book value per share to basic book value per share\n(the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure):\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nNumerator for basic and fully diluted book value per share:\nTotal equity as reported under U.S. GAAP $ 596,095 $ 503,120\nDenominator for basic and fully diluted book value per share:\nOrdinary shares issued and outstanding as reported and denominator for basic book value\nper share 35,336,732 34,824,061\nAdd: In-the-money stock options and all outstanding RSUs 264,870 277,960\nDenominator for fully diluted book value per share 35,601,602 35,102,021\nBasic book value per share $ 16.87 $ 14.45\nIncrease in basic book value per share ($) $ 2.42 $ 0.40\nIncrease in basic book value per share (%) 16.8 % 2.8 %\nFully diluted book value per share $ 16.74 $ 14.33\nIncrease in fully diluted book value per share ($) $ 2.41 $ 0.34\nIncrease in fully diluted book value per share (%) 16.8 % 2.4 %\nNet Underwriting Income (Loss)\nOne way that we evaluate the Company’s underwriting performance is by measuring net underwriting income (loss). We\ndo not use premiums written as a measure of performance. Net underwriting income (loss) is a performance measure used by\nmanagement to evaluate the fundamentals underlying the Company’s underwriting operations. We believe that the use of net\nunderwriting income (loss) enables investors and other users of the Company’s financial information to analyze our\nperformance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. Management also believes this measure follows\nindustry practice and allows the users of financial information to compare the Company’s performance with that of our industry\npeer group.\n53\nLink to Table of Contents\nNet underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used to calculate\nnet income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. We calculate net underwriting income (loss) as net premiums earned less net loss\nand loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs, underwriting expenses (including related G&A expenses), and deposit interest\nexpense. The measure excludes, on a recurring basis: (1) investment income (loss); (2) other income (expense) not related to\nunderwriting, including foreign exchange gains or losses, and Lloyd’s interest income and expense; (3) corporate G&A\nexpenses; and (4) interest expense. We exclude total investment income or loss, foreign exchange gains or losses, and Lloyd’s\ninterest income or expense as we believe these items are influenced by market conditions and other factors unrelated to\nunderwriting decisions. Additionally, we exclude corporate G&A and interest expenses because these costs are generally fixed\nand not incremental to or directly related to our underwriting operations. We believe all of these amounts are largely\nindependent of our underwriting process, and including them could hinder the analysis of trends in our underwriting operations.\nNet underwriting income (loss) should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income before income taxes.\nThe reconciliations of net underwriting income (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes (the most directly comparable\nU.S. GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis are shown below:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022\nIncome (loss) before income tax $ 86,930 $ 24,526\nAdd (subtract):\nTotal investment (income) loss (66,063) (68,983)\nOther non-underwriting (income) expense (17,872) 11,777\nCorporate expenses 23,653 17,793\nInterest expense 5,344 4,201\nNet underwriting income (loss) $ 31,992 $ (10,686)\n54\nLink to Table of Contents\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe table below summarizes our consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31:\n2023 2022\nUnderwriting revenue\nGross premiums written $ 636,810 $ 563,171\nGross premiums ceded (42,762) (33,429)\nNet premiums written 594,048 529,742\nChange in net unearned premium reserves (10,901) (60,265)\nNet premiums earned 583,147 469,477\nUnderwriting related expenses\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred:\nCurrent year 348,798 316,367\nPrior year (1) 11,206 118\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 360,004 316,485\nAcquisition costs 168,877 143,148\nUnderwriting expenses 19,587 13,813\nDeposit interest expense 2,687 6,717\nNet underwriting income (loss) (2) 31,992 (10,686)\nIncome from investment in SILP 28,696 54,844\nNet investment income 37,367 14,139\nTotal investment income 66,063 68,983\nCorporate expenses 23,653 17,793\nForeign exchange (gains) losses (11,566) 5,988\nOther (income) expense, net (6,306) 5,789\nInterest expense 5,344 4,201\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 100 (816)\nNet income $ 86,830 $ 25,342\nEarnings per share:\nBasic $ 2.55 $ 0.75\nDiluted $ 2.50 $ 0.73\nUnderwriting ratios:\nLoss ratio - current year 59.8 % 67.4 %\nLoss ratio - prior year 1.9 % — %\nLoss ratio 61.7 % 67.4 %\nAcquisition cost ratio 29.0 % 30.5 %\nComposite ratio 90.7 % 97.9 %\nUnderwriting expense ratio 3.8 % 4.4 %\nCombined ratio 94.5 % 102.3 %\n1 The net financial impacts associated with changes in the estimate of losses incurred in prior years, which incorporate earned reinstatement\npremiums assumed and ceded, adjustments to assumed and ceded acquisition costs, and deposit interest expense, were a loss of\n$15.7 million in 2023 (2022: $12.2 million).\n2 Net underwriting income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “ Key Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures” above for\ndiscussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\n55\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe following provides further details on the significant variances for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022.\nOverview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, fully diluted book value per share increased by $2.41, or 16.8%, to $16.74 per\nshare and basic book value per share increased by $2.42, or 16.8%, to $16.87 per share since December 31, 2022 driven by\nstrong underwriting performance.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, our net income increased by $61.5 million to $86.8 million, driven mainly by\nthe following:\n• Underwriting income: Increased by $42.7 million to $32.0 million, primarily driven by combined ratio\nimproving 7.8 percentage points mainly due to lower CAT losses and favorable pricing in 2023, partially offset by\nan increase in adverse loss development from prior years. For further information on CAT losses and prior year\nloss development, refer to Note 7 - Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves of the consolidated financial\nstatements.\n• Investment income: Declined by $2.9 million to $66.1 million. While we benefited from the rising U.S. interest\nrates on our cash and short-term investment holdings, this was offset by a decline in SILP’s net income. SILP\ngenerated a net return of 9.4% in 2023, compared to 25.3% in 2022.\n• Foreign exchange gains: Increased by $17.6 million driven mainly by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over\nthe pound sterling.\n• Other income: Increased by $12.1 million driven primarily by an increase in investment income on funds\nwithheld by third party Lloyd’s syndicates. The Lloyd’s syndicates invest a portion of these funds in fixed-\nmaturity securities and investment funds. We record our share of the investment income and fair value\nadjustments on these securities when the syndicates report them to us, generally on a quarter in arrears.\n• Corporate expenses: Increased by $5.9 million primarily driven by $4.3 million of severance relating to the\nseparation agreement entered with our former CEO. For further details, see “Separation Agreement with CEO” in\nNote 15 - “Related Party Transactions” in the consolidated financial statements.\nUnderwriting Results by Segment\nFor our Property and Casualty Reinsurance segment, we analyze it based on three lines of business: “property,”\n“casualty,” and “other.”\nGross Premiums Written\nDetails of gross premiums written are provided in the following table:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022\nProperty $ 113,291 17.8 % $ 85,323 15.2 %\nCasualty 351,037 55.1 325,103 57.7\nOther 172,482 27.1 152,745 27.1\nTotal $ 636,810 100.0 % $ 563,171 100.0 %\nAs a result of our underwriting philosophy, the total premiums we write and the mix of premiums between property,\ncasualty, and other business, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the market opportunities we identify.\n56\nLink to Table of Contents\nOur gross premiums written increased by $73.6 million, or 13.1%, compared to the same period in 2022. The\nfollowing table provides a further analysis of this overall increase:\nGross Premiums Written\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nIncrease\n(decrease) % change Explanation\n($ in millions)\nProperty $28.0 32.8% The increase was driven from growth in our Commercial class, mainly due to\nnew quota share treaties bound in mid-2022 and new Innovations contracts via\nSyndicate 3456 in 2023. This resulted in a change in business mix for Property,\npredominantly with Commercial and Personal which accounted for 46% and\n54%, respectively, of total Property, compared to 17% and 80%, respectively,\nfor the same period in 2022.\nCasualty $25.9 8.0% The increase was driven mainly from growth in General Liability, Professional\nLiability, and Motor Liability from new contracts and premiums written from\nquota share treaties bound in 2022. This growth was partially offset by a\nreduction in the Workers’ Compensation class, where we have significantly\nreduced our appetite for quota share treaties beginning in 2022, coupled with a\npremium decrease in the Multi-line class.\nAs a result, the business mix within our Casualty line of business has shifted\nbetween General Liability and Multi-line classes, accounting for 27% and 62%\nof total Casualty, respectively, compared to 19% and 69%, respectively, in same\nperiod in 2022.\nOther $19.7 12.9% The increase was driven mainly by new contracts within our Marine class and\nOther Specialty class, primarily in energy, aviation and cyber risk. This was\npartially offset by a reduction in premiums from our Financial class,\npredominantly due to lower merger and acquisition activity in 2023 impacting\npremium from transactional liability programs, partially offset by new\npremiums from credit and surety contracts.\nAs a result, the change in business mix was follows: Other Specialty, Financial,\nand Marine represented 45%, 33%, and 18%, respectively, compared to 36%,\n44%, and 15%, respectively, for the same period in 2022.\nPremiums Ceded\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, ceded premiums were $42.8 million, or 6.7% of gross premiums written,\ncompared to $33.4 million, or 5.9% of gross premiums written, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly\ndue to purchasing an aviation quota share retrocession coverage, as well as an additional $10.0 million excess of loss coverage\nto manage our exposure to marine and energy.\nNet Premiums Written\nDetails of net premiums written are provided in the following table:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022\nProperty $ 94,651 15.9 % $ 67,680 12.8 %\nCasualty 337,111 56.7 315,935 59.6\nOther 162,286 27.3 146,127 27.6\nTotal $ 594,048 100.0 % $ 529,742 100.0 %\nOur net premiums written increased by $64.3 million, or 12.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The\nmovement in net premiums written resulted from the changes in gross premiums written and ceded during the periods.\n57\nLink to Table of Contents\nNet Premiums Earned\nDetails of net premiums earned are provided in the following table:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022\nProperty $ 86,539 14.8 % $ 52,397 11.2 %\nCasualty 331,196 56.8 289,820 61.7\nOther 165,412 28.4 127,260 27.1\nTotal $ 583,147 100.0 % $ 469,477 100.0 %\nNet premiums earned increased by $113.7 million or 24.2%, compared to the prior year. The change in net premiums\nearned is primarily a function of the amount and timing of net premiums written during the current and prior periods, coupled\nwith the mix of business written in the form of excess of loss versus proportional contracts.\nLoss and LAE Incurred, Net\nThe components of the loss ratio were as follows:\nYear ended December 31\nIncrease /\n(decrease) in\nloss ratio\n2023 2022 points\nCurrent accident year loss ratio 59.8 % 67.4 % (7.6)\nPrior year reserve development ratio 1.9 % — % 1.9\nLoss ratio 61.7 % 67.4 % (5.7)\nCurrent accident year loss ratio improved by 7.6 points for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same\nperiod in 2022 primarily due to 3.6 points in lower CAT losses, coupled with favorable pricing and change in business mix in\n2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, prior year adverse loss development was 1.9%, compared to a negligible\namount in 2022. Refer to Note 7 Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves to the consolidated financial statements for\nfurther details on prior year loss developments.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of net losses incurred by lines of business:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022\nProperty $ 62,266 17.3 % $ 40,885 12.9 %\nCasualty 225,314 62.6 205,641 65.0\nOther 72,424 20.1 69,959 22.1\nTotal $ 360,004 100.0 % $ 316,485 100.0 %\n58\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe loss ratios by lines of business were as follows:\nYear ended December 31\nIncrease /\n(decrease) in\nloss ratio\n2023 2022 points\nProperty 72.0 % 78.0 % (6.0) %\nCasualty 68.0 71.0 (3.0)\nOther 43.8 55.0 (11.2)\nTotal 61.7 % 67.4 % (5.7) %\nThe following provides further details on the change in 2023 vs. 2022:\nIncrease Increase /\n(decrease) (decrease)\nExplanation\n($ in in loss ratio\nmillions) points\nProperty $21.4 (6.0)% The increase in losses incurred is primarily due to 65.2% increase in net premiums\nearned, and to a lesser degree due to a higher dollar amount of current year CAT\nlosses.\nHowever, our loss ratio improved mainly due to a decrease of 4.7 loss ratio points\nfrom current CAT losses, in part due to higher premiums earned. In 2023, the U.S.\nsevere storms losses and other CAT events contributed 19.3 loss ratio points to the\nProperty loss ratio. During the comparable period in 2022, CAT losses from\nHurricane Ian, Typhoons Nanmadol and Hinnamnor, and Tennessee wildfires\ncontributed 24.0 percentage points to the Property loss ratio.\nAdditionally, the Property loss ratio benefited by 2.1 percentage points due to an\nincrease in favorable prior year CAT loss development for various underwriting\nyears (2017 to 2022).\nCasualty $19.7 (3.0)% The increase in losses incurred was primarily driven by the 14.3% increase in net\npremiums earned, coupled with an increase of $19.7 million or 5.5 loss ratio points\nin prior year loss development predominantly driven by attritional losses relating to\nmotor, general liability, multiline, workers’ compensation and professional liability\nprograms.\nHowever, our Casualty business benefited by 5.1 loss ratio points from lower\ncurrent year CAT losses, compared to 2022 when the Multi-line class was\nadversely impacted by Hurricane Ian. Further, the overall decrease in loss ratio was\nalso driven by the change in business mix. We significantly grew General Liability\nand Multi-line classes at much lower loss ratios than the Workers’ Compensation\nclass.\nOther $2.5 (11.2)% Despite the 30.0% increase in net premiums earned, driven from growth in our\nMarine and Other Specialty classes, we had only a marginal increase in losses\nincurred for Other, primarily due to 8.2 loss ratio point improvement from prior\nyear favorable loss development, and to a lesser extent, from lower CAT losses.\nThe prior year favorable loss development was predominantly from the following\nclasses of business: Mortgage, Transactional Liability, and Whole Account Marine\nand Energy.\nSee “Critical Accounting Estimates, Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves” in this MD&A and “Note 7. Loss and\nLoss Adjustment Expense Reserves ” to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our reserving\ntechniques and prior year development of net claims and claim expenses.\n59\nLink to Table of Contents\nAcquisition Costs, Net\nOur total acquisition costs increased by 18.0% to $168.9 million, compared to 2022, mainly due to growth in net\npremiums earned, offset partially by lower broker commissions from excess of loss contracts compared to proportional treaties.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net profit commission expense of $14.8 million, (2022: $16.0 million) was included in\nour total acquisition costs.\nThe acquisition cost ratios by line of business were as follows:\nIncrease /\n2023 2022 (decrease)\nProperty 18.7 % 22.2 % (3.5) %\nCasualty 30.5 29.0 1.5\nOther 31.3 37.4 (6.1)\nTotal 29.0 % 30.5 % (1.5) %\nThe following provides further details on the change in 2023 vs. 2022:\nIncrease / (decrease)\nin acquisition cost Explanation\nratio points\nProperty (3.5)% The decrease was due primarily to the higher proportion of excess of loss contracts that\nhave a lower ceding commission rate than proportional treaties. Based on net premiums\nearned for Property, excess of loss contracts accounted for 10% compared to 6% in 2022.\nCasualty 1.5% The marginal increase was due primarily to changes in our business mix, particularly with\nan increase in net premiums earned from General Liability, Professional Liability and\nMulti-line (including FAL) classes, which have higher ceding commission rates than the\nWorkers’ Compensation business.\nOther (6.1)% The decrease was driven primarily by change in business mix, coupled with a higher\nproportion of excess of loss contracts than proportional treaties.

The increase was driven by:\n• Underwriting expenses: Increased by $5.8 million, or 41.8%, mainly due to scaling up as we added to our\ntalent pool, which contributed to the growth in gross premiums written in 2023. Increase in allowance for credit losses\nrelating to certain reinsurance balances receivable and loss recoverable also accounted for the increase in underwriting\nexpenses. The increase was partially offset by lower legal and other professional fees. See above “Ratio Analysis” for\na discussion on our underwriting expense ratio.\n• Corporate expenses: Increased by $5.9 million or 32.9%, driven mainly by $6.4 million of severance related\ncosts compared to $1.1 million in the prior year. The 2023 severance costs included a $1.5 million non-cash charge\nrelating to the accelerated vesting of the former CEO’s restricted shares as well as the modified grant relating to his\nunvested performance-based restricted shares. The remaining increase was mainly due to an increase in personnel\ncosts, including an increase in accrued incentive compensation costs in light of the Company’s performance in 2023.\nThe incentive compensation cost for 2022 was nil due to the net underwriting loss. This increase in corporate expenses\nwas partially offset by lower D&O insurance expense.\nTotal Investment Income\nTotal investment income incorporates (i) changes in the net asset value of our investment in SILP, (ii) interest income\nearned on cash and cash equivalents, including the restricted funds pledged as collateral to our clients, and (iii) gains (or losses)\nand interest on our portfolio of Innovations investments. We expect our total investment income, including any change in the\nnet asset value of our investment in SILP, to fluctuate from period to period.\nA summary of our total investment income is as follows:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022\nInterest and dividend income, net of withholding taxes and other expenses $ 35,629 $ 4,466\nNet realized and unrealized gains on other investments (see Note 4) 1,738 9,673\nNet investment-related income $ 37,367 $ 14,139\nShare of SILP's net income (see Note 3) 28,696 54,844\nTotal investment income $ 66,063 $ 68,983\n61\nLink to Table of Contents\nNet investment-related income\nOur net investment-related income increased by $23.2 million or 164.3% compared to 2022 mainly due to rising U.S.\ninterest rates, which resulted in an increase in interest income from our cash and cash equivalent (including restricted cash),\npartially offset by lower average outstanding balance in 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark rate 11 times for\na total of 5.25 percentage points since March 2022. Our Innovations-related investments had less gains in 2023 in part due to\nless favorable pricing conditions from completed financing rounds by some of our Innovation investees compared to 2022.\nShare of SILP’s Net Income\nOur share of SILP’s net income decreased by $26.1 million in 2023 compared to 2022. For the year ended December\n31, 2023, SILP reported a net investment return of 9.4%, compared to 25.3% for 2022. The following table provides a\nbreakdown of the gross and net investment returns:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022\nLong portfolio gains (losses) 32.1 % — %\nShort portfolio gains (losses) (22.1) 26.1\nMacro gains (losses) 3.7 3.8\nOther income and expenses 1 (3.2) (1.8)\nGross investment return 10.5 % 28.1 %\nNet investment return 1 9.4 % 25.3 %\n1 “Other income and expenses” excludes performance compensation but includes management fees. “Net investment return” incorporates both of these\namounts. For further information about management fees and performance compensation, refer to Note 15 “Related Party Transactions” of the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nThe most significant contributors to SILP’s net investment return for the year ended December 31, 2023 were long\npositions in Green Brick Partners Inc., CONSOL Energy Inc., and a S&P 500 / U.S. interest rate derivative position. For the\nsame period, the most significant detractors were three single-name short positions.\nEach month, we post on our website (www.greenlightre.com) the returns from our investment in SILP.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $1.1 million to $5.3 million compared to\n2022. The increase was driven primarily by the increase in borrowing cost for new Term Loans, which were partially used to\nrepay the outstanding Convertible Notes (see Note 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities” to the consolidated financial statements). The\ninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 included $0.6 million of unrealized loss on the interest rate swaps used\nto partially hedge the Term Loans.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred net income tax expense of $0.1 million, net of a $2.3 million\nreversal of deferred tax asset provision based on management’s conclusion that it was more likely than not that the Company\nwill fully realize the deferred tax asset. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a net income tax recovery of $0.8\nmillion primarily due to a tax refund relating to Verdant.

The increase was primarily driven from net additional contributions into SILP, coupled with the net investment return in\n2023.\nInvestments in SILP\nDME Advisors reports the composition of SILP’s portfolio on a delta-adjusted basis, which it believes is the appropriate\nmanner to assess the exposure and profile of investments and reflects how it manages the portfolio. An option’s delta is the\noption price’s sensitivity to the underlying stock (or commodity) price. The delta-adjusted basis is the number of shares or\ncontracts underlying the option multiplied by the delta and the underlying stock (or commodity) price.\nThe following table represents the composition of SILP’s investments:\nDecember 31\n2023 2022\nLong % Short % Long % Short %\nEquities and related derivatives 90.2 53.8 84.4 49.7\nPrivate and unlisted equity securities 2.0 — 3.2 —\nDebt instruments 0.3 — 0.6 —\nTotal 92.5 % 53.8 % 88.2 % 49.7 %\nThe above exposure analysis does not include cash (U.S. dollar and foreign currencies), gold and other\ncommodities, credit default swaps, sovereign debt, foreign currency derivatives, interest rate derivatives, inflation swaps and\nother macro positions. Under this methodology, a total return swap’s exposure is reported at its full notional amount and\noptions are reported at their delta-adjusted basis. At December 31, 2023, SILP’s exposure to gold on a delta-adjusted basis was\n11.2% (2022: 15.2%).\n63\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe following table represents the composition of SILP by industry sector at December 31, 2023:\nSector Long % Short % Net %\nCommunication Services — % (3.7) % (3.7) %\nConsumer Discretionary 38.7 (11.9) 26.8\nConsumer Staples — (1.0) (1.0)\nEnergy 14.2 — 14.2\nFinancial 15.5 (11.7) 3.8\nHealthcare 7.2 (1.8) 5.4\nIndustrials 3.7 (7.6) (3.9)\nMaterials 6.6 (0.6) 6.0\nReal Estate — (4.0) (4.0)\nTechnology 4.5 (8.2) (3.7)\nUtilities 1.3 (3.3) (2.0)\nOther 0.8 — 0.8\nTotal 92.5 % (53.8) % 38.7 %\nThe following table represents the composition of SILP, by the market capitalization of the underlying issuer, at\nDecember 31, 2023:\nCapitalization Long % Short % Net %\nMega Cap Equity (≥$25 billion) 0.6 % (16.4) % (15.8) %\nLarge Cap Equity (≥$10 billion and <$25 billion) 5.7 (6.3) (0.6)\nMid Cap Equity (≥$2 billion and <$10 billion) 80.5 (25.3) 55.2\nSmall Cap Equity (<$2 billion) 3.4 (5.8) (2.4)\nDebt Instruments 0.3 — 0.3\nOther 2.0 — 2.0\nTotal 92.5 % (53.8) % 38.7 %\nAt December 31, 2023, 95.0% of SILP’s portfolio was valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets (Level\n1), 3.6% was composed of instruments valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2), and a nominal\namount was composed of instruments valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). At December 31, 2023, 1.4% of SILP’s\nportfolio consisted of private equity funds valued using the funds’ net asset values as a practical expedient.\nOther Investments\nThe other investment holdings relate to private investments made by Innovations. During 2023, we made $7.1 million of\nnew private investments compared to $13.2 million in the prior year. While we manage a diversified Innovations-related\ninvestment portfolio with approximately 40 holdings, our top five holdings accounted for 67% of the total carrying value as a\nresult of favorable fair value remeasurement since our initial investments, net of impairment charges. For further information,\nsee Note 4 “Other Investments” of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe certificate of deposit was redeemed in 2023 to provide cash collateral for the new Loan Facility (see “Debt” below).\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\nWe use our restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily for funding trusts and letters of credit issued to our ceding\ninsurers. Our restricted cash decreased by $63.7 million, or 9.5%, from $668.3 million at December 31, 2022, to $604.6 million\nat December 31, 2023, primarily due to release of collateral from our ceding insurers relating to legacy contracts in run-off.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we also pledged $10.0 million collateral as security for the new Loan Facility (see\n“Debt” below).\n64\nLink to Table of Contents\nReinsurance balances receivable\nOur reinsurance balances receivable increased by $113.8 million, or 22.5%, to $619.4 million from $505.6 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. This increase was driven primarily by premiums held by Lloyd’s syndicates through GCM. See\n“Concentration of Credit Risk - Reinsurance Balances Receivable, net” in Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nLoss and LAE Reserves; Loss and LAE Recoverable\nOur reserves for loss and LAE by lines of business were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCase Case\nReserves IBNR Total Reserves IBNR Total\nProperty $ 24,181 $ 41,056 $ 65,237 $ 20,354 $ 41,361 $ 61,715\nCasualty 136,713 299,933 436,646 146,702 227,979 374,681\nOther 28,156 131,515 159,671 17,700 101,372 119,072\nTotal $ 189,050 $ 472,504 $ 661,554 $ 184,756 $ 370,712 $ 555,468\nOur total gross loss and LAE reserves increased by $106.1 million, or 19.1%, to $661.6 million from $555.5 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. See Note 7 “Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves” of the consolidated financial statements for a\nsummary of changes in outstanding loss and LAE reserves and a description of prior period loss developments.\nOur total loss and LAE recoverable increased by $12.4 million, or 94.0%, to $25.7 million from $13.2 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. See Note 8 “Retrocession” of the consolidated financial statements for a description of the credit risk\nassociated with our retrocessionaires.\nPML\nFor most of the contracts we write, defined limits of liability limit our risk exposure. Once each contract’s limit of\nliability has been reached, we have no further exposure to additional losses from that contract. However, certain contracts,\nparticularly quota share contracts covering first-dollar exposure, do not contain aggregate limits.\nOur property and Lloyd’s business, and to a lesser extent our casualty and other business, incorporate contracts that\ncontain natural peril loss exposure. We currently monitor our catastrophe loss exposure in terms of our PML (net of\nretrocession and reinstatement premiums). We anticipate that our PMLs will vary from period to period depending upon the\nmodeled simulated losses and the composition of our in-force book of business.\nWe monitor our natural peril PMLs on a worldwide basis, with a particular focus on our peak peril regions. When\nthese perils consist of a large geographic area, we split them into sub-regions, where the underlying geographic components can\nalso be considered individual peril zones.\nFor our natural catastrophe PMLs, we utilize the output of catastrophe models at the 1-in-250-year return period. The\n1-in-250-year return period PML means that we believe there is a 0.4% probability that, in any given year, an occurrence of a\nnatural catastrophe will lead to losses exceeding the stated estimate.\nIt is important to note that PMLs are best estimates based on the modeled data available for each underlying risk. As a\nresult, we cannot provide assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events\nsimilar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML.\nOur PML estimates incorporate all significant exposure from our reinsurance operations, including coverage for\nproperty, marine and energy, motor, and catastrophe workers’ compensation exposures.\nAt January 1, 2024, our estimated largest PML at a 1-in-250-year return period for a single event and in aggregate was\n$89.7 million and $97.0 million, respectively, both relating to the peril of North Atlantic Hurricane, compared to $77.5 million\nand $83.5 million, respectively, at January 1, 2023. We have increased our PMLs in response to favorable market conditions\nand attractive opportunities, coupled with increased surplus.\n65\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe below table contains the expected modeled loss for each of our peak peril regions and sub-regions for both a\nsingle event loss and aggregate loss measures at the 1-in-250-year return period.\nJanuary 1, 2024\nNet 1-in-250 Year Return Period\nPeril Single Event Loss Aggregate Loss\n($ in thousands)\nNorth Atlantic Hurricane $ 89,651 $ 97,041\nSoutheast Hurricane 83,339 85,296\nGulf of Mexico Hurricane 66,557 68,830\nNortheast Hurricane 51,028 51,028\nNorth America Earthquake 87,227 90,414\nCalifornia Earthquake 74,105 77,981\nOther N.A.

During\n2023, we repurchased $17.5 million of Convertible Notes for a marginal realized gain. Further, we repaid the remaining\n$63.4 million of Convertible Notes, including accrued interest, which matured on August 1, 2023. To repay this debt, we\nentered into a $75.0 million Loan Facility with a group of banks. In connection with this Loan Facility, we contractually agreed\nto hedge 50% of the floating rate Term Loans for the duration of the Loan Facility. Refer to Note 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities”\nof the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nTotal shareholders’ equity\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased by $93.0 million to $596.1 million, compared to $503.1 million at December 31,\n2022. The increase was primarily due to the net income of $86.8 million reported for the year. For details of other movements\nin shareholders’ equity, see the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is a measure of a company’s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short-term and long-term\ncash requirements of its business operations. We manage liquidity at the holding company and operating subsidiary level.\nHolding Company\nGreenlight Capital Re is a holding company with no operations of its own and its assets consist primarily of\ninvestments in its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Greenlight Capital Re’s future cash flows depend on the availability of dividends\nor other statutorily permissible distributions, such as returns of capital, from its subsidiaries. The ability to pay dividends and/\nor distributions is limited by:\n• the applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which Greenlight Capital Re’s subsidiaries operate (see\nNote 18 “Statutory Requirements” to the consolidated financial statements);\n• the need to maintain adequate capital levels to support our reinsurance operations; and\n• the need to preserve our current “A- (Excellent)” rating with a stable outlook by A.M. Best.\nAs a holding company, Greenlight Capital Re has minimal continuing cash needs, most of which are related to the\npayment of corporate and general administrative expenses and interest expenses. Our current policy is to retain earnings to\nsupport the growth of our business. We currently do not expect to pay dividends on our ordinary shares.\n66\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe anticipate positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) to be sufficient to\ncover cash outflows under most loss scenarios in the near term. Based on expected cash flows from operations, financing\narrangements and redemptions from related party investment fund as needed (subject to three day’s notice to the general\npartner), we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover our working capital requirements and other contractual obligations and\ncommitments through the foreseeable future.\nOperating Subsidiaries\nOur sources of funds from operating subsidiaries consist primarily of premium receipts (net of brokerage and ceding\ncommissions), investment income, and other income. We use cash from our operations to pay losses and loss adjustment\nexpenses, profit commissions, interest, and G&A expenses. Our reinsurance business inherently provides liquidity as premiums\nare received well in advance of the time claims are paid. However, the amount of cash required to fund loss payments can\nfluctuate significantly from period to period due to the low frequency / high severity nature of certain types of business we\nwrite.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of funds:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 7,507 $ (31,799)\nInvesting activities (53,133) 47,015\nFinancing activities (5,292) (19,828)\nEffect of currency exchange on cash(1) 100 59\nNet cash inflows (outflows) (50,818) (4,553)\nCash, beginning of period 706,548 711,101\nCash, end of period $ 655,730 $ 706,548\n(1)\nCash includes unrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents - see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.\nCash provided by operating activities\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven mainly by $42.7 million improved underwriting income,\ncoupled with the ebb and flow from our underwriting activities, which may vary significantly from period to period depending\non the mix of business, the nature of underwriting opportunities available and volume of claims submitted to us by our cedents.\nCash used in investing activities\nThe increase in cash used for investing activities was driven mainly by the net change in our investment in SILP where\nwe made a net contribution of $52.0 million during 2023 compared to a net redemption of $60.2 million during 2022. During\n2023, we deployed $6.1 million less on Innovations-related investments compared to 2022, and collected $6.0 million of\nproceeds from a matured term deposit.\nCash used in financing activities\nThe decrease in cash used in our financing activities was due to drawing $74.1 million from the new Loan Facility, offset\nby the repayment of the remaining Convertible Notes on August 1, 2023, in addition to the partial repurchase of these\nConvertible Notes at a discount in 2023. In 2022, we had repurchased $19.8 million of our Convertible Notes.\nCapital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our capital structure:\n67\nLink to Table of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nDebt $ 74,062 $ 80,534\nShareholders’ equity 596,095 503,120\nRatio of debt to shareholders’ equity 12 % 16 %\nThe debt to shareholders’ equity provides an indication of our leverage and capital structure, along with some insights\ninto our financial strength. In addition to the above capital, we also have LOC facilities to support our reinsurance business\noperations where we are not licensed or admitted as a reinsurer.\nThe following is a summary of the changes in our capital:\nDebt\nAt December 31, 2023, our debt consisted of the new $75.0 million Loan Facility used principally to repay the\nConvertible Notes that were outstanding at December 31, 2022, net of repurchases during 2023. We also made the initial loan\ninstallment repayment on the Loan Facility. The facility will mature on August 1, 2026.\nOrdinary Shares\nAt December 31, 2023, there were 35,336,732 outstanding ordinary shares, an increase of 512,671 since December 31,\n2022, due to restricted shares granted to our employees and non-executive directors.\nWhile our Board of Directors renewed the $25.0 million share repurchase plan in 2023, we did not repurchase any\nordinary shares for year ended December 31, 2023 (see “Item 5 - Market for Registrants’s Common Equity, Related\nStockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities”).\nWe expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business\nstrategy for the foreseeable future. However, to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we\nrequire additional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, we have\nfiled a Form S-3 registration statement, which expires in July 2024.\nSecured LOC Facilities\nAt December 31, 2023, our total LOC capacity was $489.0 million, compared to $289.0 million at December 31, 2022.\nThe increase was due to a new LOC credit facility established to accommodate future growth and to diversify the concentration\nrisk of having a single facility. At December 31, 2023, we had $290.7 million LOCs outstanding compared to $203.9 million at\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase is driven by, among other factors, the amount of unearned premiums, development of loss\nreserves, the expansion of our business and loss experience of that business.\nThe amount drawn from the LOC facilities are secured by cash collateral, reported as restricted cash and cash\nequivalents in the consolidated balance sheets.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAt December 31, 2023, our contractual obligations and commitments by period due were as follows:\nLess than More than\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total\nOperating activities\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves (1) $ 314,238 $ 209,713 $ 78,063 $ 59,540 $ 661,554\nOperating lease obligations (2) 637 1,005 — — 1,642\nFinancing activities\nDebt (3) 3,703 70,359 — — 74,062\nTotal $ 318,578 $ 281,077 $ 78,063 $ 59,540 $ 737,258\n68\nLink to Table of Contents\n(1) Due to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance contractual\nliabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain.\n(2) See Note 16 “Commitments and Contingencies” of the consolidated financial statements.\n(3) See Note 9 “Debt and Credit Facilities” of the consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and have required\nmanagement to make assumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including those described\nin “Part I, Item IA. — Risk Factors,” cause actual events or results to differ materially from our underlying assumptions or\nestimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. We believe the\nfollowing accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We\nhave summarized the descriptions below for clarity. We have included a more detailed description of our significant accounting\npolicies and recently issued accounting standards in Note 2 “Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nPremium Revenues\nGross Premiums Written\nWe record our property and casualty reinsurance premiums as premiums written based on our best estimate of the\nultimate premiums for the contract period. Our estimates are based on actuarial pricing models and information received from\nceding companies. Further, we record reinsurance premiums so long as they meet the risk transfer criteria under U.S. GAAP\n(see “Deposit Contracts” below).\nExcess of loss reinsurance contracts typically state premiums as a percentage of the subject premiums written by the\nclient, subject to a minimum and deposit premium. The minimum and deposit premium is generally based on an estimate of\nsubject premiums expected to be written by the client during the contract term. The minimum and deposit premium is reported\ninitially as premiums written and adjusted, if necessary, in subsequent periods once the actual subject premium is known.\nFor quota share (also known as proportional) contracts, we record premiums in the same periods in which the underlying\ninsurance contracts are written, based on cession statements from cedents. We typically receive these statements monthly or\nquarterly, depending on the terms specified in each contract. For any reporting lag, we estimate premiums written based\non the portion of the estimated ultimate premiums relating to the risks bound during the lag period.\nFor multi-year contracts, reinsurance premiums are recorded at the inception of the contract based on our best estimate of\ntotal premiums to be received. Premiums are recognized on an annual basis for multi-year contracts where the cedants have the\nability to unilaterally commute or cancel coverage within the term of the contract.\nWe regularly review premium estimates. Such review includes our experience with the ceding companies, managing\ngeneral underwriters, familiarity with each market, the timing of the reported information, a comparison of reported premiums\nto expected ultimate premiums, along with a review of the aging and collection of premiums. We evaluate the appropriateness\nof the premium estimates on the basis of these reviews and record any adjustments to these estimates in the period in which\nthey are determined. Changes in premium estimates, including premium receivable on both excess of loss and quota share\ncontracts, are not unusual and may result in significant adjustments in any period. A portion of amounts included in\n“Reinsurance balances receivable” in the consolidated balance sheets represent estimated premiums written, net of\ncommissions and brokerage, that are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Additional premiums due\non a contract with no remaining coverage period are earned in full when written.\nCertain contracts provide for reinstatement premiums in the event of a loss. Reinstatement premiums are written and\nearned when a triggering loss event occurs.\nNet Premiums Earned\nWe earn premiums over the risk coverage period. Unearned premiums represent the unexpired portion of reinsurance\nprovided. Changes in circumstances subsequent to the inception of contracts can impact the earnings period. For instance,\nwhen exposure limits for a reinsurance contract are reached, any associated unearned premiums are fully earned.\n69\nLink to Table of Contents\nExcess of loss reinsurance contracts are generally written on a “losses occurring” or “claims made” basis over the term of\nthe policy. Accordingly, premiums are earned evenly over the contract term, which is generally 12 months.\nLine slip or proportional insurance/reinsurance contracts are generally written on a “risks attaching” basis, covering\nclaims that relate to the underlying policies written during the terms of these contracts. As the underlying business incepts\nthroughout the contract term, which is generally one year, and the underlying business generally has a one year coverage\nperiod, these premiums are generally earned evenly over a 24-month period from inception.\nDeposit Contracts\nIf we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk to merit reinsurance accounting treatment, we\nreport the premium we receive as a deposit liability. Similarly, we report the premium we pay as a deposit asset for ceded\ncontracts that do not transfer sufficient risk to merit reinsurance accounting. Any income and expense on deposit-accounted\ncontracts is calculated using the interest method and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations under “Other income\n(expense)” and “Deposit interest expense,” respectively.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nEstimating our loss and LAE reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment, and our estimates as of any given date\nare inherently uncertain. Estimating loss and LAE reserves requires us to make assumptions regarding reporting and\ndevelopment patterns, frequency and severity trends, claims settlement practices, potential changes in legal environments,\ninflation, loss amplification, foreign exchange movements, and other factors. These estimates and judgments are based on\nnumerous considerations and are often revised as (i) we receive changes in loss amounts reported by ceding companies and\nbrokers; (ii) we obtain additional information, experience, or other data; (iii) we develop new or improved methodologies; or\n(iv) we observe changes in the legal environment.\nOur loss and LAE reserves relating to short-tail property risks are typically reported to us and settled more promptly than\nthose relating to long-tail risks. However, the timeliness of loss reporting can be affected by such factors as the nature of the\nevent causing the loss, the location of the loss, whether the loss is from policies in force with primary insurers or with\nreinsurers, and where our exposure falls within the cedent’s overall reinsurance program.\nOur loss and LAE reserves are composed of case reserves (based on claims reported to us) and IBNR reserves, including\nthe associated claims handling costs.\nWe determine case reserve estimates based on loss reports received. We determine our IBNR reserve estimates using\nstandard actuarial methods and a combination of our own historical and current loss experience, insurance industry loss\nexperience, assessments of pricing adequacy trends, and our professional judgment. In estimating our IBNR reserve, we\nestimate the total ultimate loss and LAE we expect to incur and subtract paid claims and case reserves.\nThe nature and extent of our judgment in the reserving process depend in part upon the type of business. Some of our\nproperty treaty reinsurance contracts represent business with a low frequency of claims occurrence and a high potential loss\nseverity, such as claims arising from natural catastrophes. Given the nature of these events, traditional actuarial reserving\nmethods may not be reliable indicators of the final outcome. As such, for contracts or losses of this type, we estimate the\nultimate cost associated with a single loss event rather than perform analysis on the historical development patterns of past\nevents to estimate the ultimate losses for an entire accident year. We estimate our reserves for these large events on a by-\ncontract basis by reviewing policies with known or potential exposure to a particular loss event.\nFor non-catastrophe losses, we apply standard actuarial methodologies in setting reserves, including paid and incurred\nloss development, Bornheutter-Ferguson, burning cost, and frequency and severity techniques. We supplement our analysis\nwith industry loss ratio and development pattern information in conjunction with our own experience. The weight given to a\nparticular method will depend on many factors, including the homogeneity within the class of business, the volume of losses,\nthe maturity of the accident year, and the length of the expected development tail. For example, the expected loss ratio method\nassumes that the ratio of premiums and losses remains constant. In contrast, development methods rely on observable patterns\nwithin reported losses, both historical and newly reported, to establish a view of the ultimate loss incurred. Therefore, as an\naccident year matures, we may migrate from an expected loss ratio method to an incurred development method.\nAs a predominantly broker-market reinsurer for both excess-of-loss and proportional contracts, we rely on loss\ninformation reported to brokers by primary insurers who, in turn, must estimate their losses at the policy level, often based on\nincomplete and changing information. The information we receive varies by cedent and may include paid losses, estimated case\nreserves, and an estimated provision for IBNR reserves. Reserving practices and data-reporting quality differ among ceding\n70\nLink to Table of Contents\ncompanies, which adds further uncertainty to our estimation of ultimate losses. The nature and extent of information received\nfrom ceding companies and brokers also vary widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which\nare affected by market conditions and practices), and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of the terms and\nconditions of reinsurance contracts, the differences in coverage provided to individual clients, and the tendency of those\ncoverages to change rapidly in response to market conditions, we cannot always reliably measure the ongoing economic impact\nof such uncertainties and inconsistencies.\nTime lags are inherent in loss reporting, especially in the case of excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts. The time lags,\ncoupled with the combined characteristics of low claim frequency and high claim severity on such contracts, make the available\ndata less useful for predicting ultimate losses.\nIn the case of proportional contracts, we rely on an analysis of a cedent’s historical experience, industry information, and\nthe underwriters’ professional judgment in estimating reserves. We also utilize ultimate loss ratio forecasts when reported by\ncedents and brokers, which are ordinarily subject to three to six-month lags for proportional business. Due to our reliance on\nceding companies for claims reporting, our reserve estimates are highly dependent on ceding companies’ judgment.\nFurthermore, during the loss settlement period, which may last several years, additional facts regarding individual claims and\ntrends will often become known, and case law may change, affecting ultimate expected losses.\nSince we rely on ceding company data in establishing our loss and LAE reserves, we maintain procedures designed to\nmitigate the risk that such information is incomplete or inaccurate. These procedures include: (i) comparisons of expected\npremiums to reported premiums, which helps us to identify delinquent client periodic reports; (ii) ceding company audits to\nidentify inaccurate or incomplete reporting of claims and ensure that claims are actively and appropriately managed in line with\nagreed protocols and settlement authority limits; and (iii) underwriting reviews to ascertain that the losses ceded are covered as\nprovided under the contract terms. These procedures are incorporated in our internal controls and are regularly evaluated and\namended as market conditions, risk factors, and unanticipated areas of exposure develop.\nWe engage an independent third-party actuarial firm to perform a quarterly reserve review and annually opine on the\nreasonableness and adequacy of the aggregate loss reserves. We provide the third-party actuarial firm with our pricing models,\nreserving analysis, and other data. The actuarial firm may also inquire about the various assumptions and estimates used in the\nreserving analysis. The actuarial firm independently creates its own reserving models based on industry loss information,\naugmented by client-specific loss information and independent assumptions and estimates. Based on various reserving\nmethodologies that the actuarial firm considers appropriate, it creates a loss reserve estimate for each segment in the portfolio. It\nrecommends an aggregate loss reserve, including IBNR. In the event of material differences between our aggregated booked\nreserves and the actuarial firm's recommended reserves, the reserving committee would be notified, with the reserves adjusted\nas deemed appropriate. To date, there have been no material differences resulting from the external actuary’s reviews requiring\nadjustments to our booked reserves.\nWe monitor the development of our prior-year losses during subsequent calendar years by comparing the actual reported\nlosses against previous estimates and current expectations. The analysis of this loss development is important to the ongoing\nrefinement of our reserving assumptions. Each additional year of loss experience with a given cedent provides additional insight\ninto the accuracy and timeliness of previously reported information.\nEstimating loss reserves for our book of longer-tail casualty reinsurance business, which we write on both a proportional\nand non-proportional basis, involves further uncertainties. In addition to the uncertainties described above, casualty business is\ngenerally subject to longer reporting lags than property business, and claims often take several years to settle. During this\nperiod, additional factors and trends will be revealed, and we may adjust our reserves accordingly. Therefore, any factors that\nextend the time until our cedents settle claims add uncertainty to the reserving process.\nThe uncertainties inherent in the reserving process and the potential for unforeseen developments, including changes in\nlaws and the prevailing interpretation of policy terms, may result in our loss and LAE reserves being materially greater or less\nthan the loss and LAE reserves we initially established. We reflect adjustments to our loss and LAE reserves in our financial\nresults during the period they are determined. Changes to our prior year loss reserves will impact our current underwriting\nresults by improving our results if the prior year reserves prove redundant or impairing our results if the prior year reserves\nprove insufficient.\nWe believe that our reserves for loss and LAE are sufficient to cover losses that fall within the terms of our policies and\nagreements with our insured and reinsured customers based on the methodologies used to estimate those reserves. However, we\ncan provide no assurance that actual losses will not (i) be less than or (ii) exceed our total established reserves.\n71\nLink to Table of Contents\nPlease refer to Notes 2 “Significant Accounting Policies - Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves and Recoverable”\nand 7 “Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves” of our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed explanation of\nour loss reserving methodology and the loss development tables by accident year, respectively, as required under U.S. GAAP.\nInvestments\nWe carry our investment in SILP at fair value, based on the most recent net asset value obtained from SILP’s third-party\nadministrator. Further, SILP’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were subject to an\nindependent audit in which SILP’s external auditors issued an unqualified opinion for these years (see “Report of Independent\nRegistered Public Accounting Firm” in the Exhibits).\nOther investments in our consolidated balance sheets includes private and unlisted equity securities that do not have\nreadily determinable fair values. We determine these private equity securities’ carrying value based on the original cost, less\nimpairment, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same\nissuer. At each reporting date, we qualitatively consider whether the investment is impaired on the basis of certain impairment\nindicators. If we determine that the equity security is impaired on the basis of the qualitative assessment and the estimated fair\nvalue is less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss in “Net investment income (loss)” in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. We determine realized gains and losses from other investments based on the specific identification\nmethod (by reference to cost or amortized cost, as appropriate). These gains and losses are included in “Net investment income\n(loss)” in the consolidated statements of operations.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur financial instruments are subject to a variety of market risks. The term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising\nfrom adverse changes from:\n•\nequity price;\n•\ncommodity price;\n•\nforeign currency; and\n•\ninterest rate (including credit spreads).\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis below to estimate the effects that market risk exposure could have on the future\nearnings, fair values or cash flows of our financial instruments. These represent forward-looking statements of market risk\nassuming certain adverse market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected\nresults due to actual developments in the global financial markets.\nEquity Price Risk\nAt December 31, 2023, our investments consisted primarily of an investment in SILP. Among SILP’s holdings are equity\nsecurities, the carrying values of which are based primarily on quoted market prices. Generally, market prices of common\nequity securities are subject to fluctuation, which could cause the amount to be realized upon closing a position to differ\nsignificantly from its current reported value. This risk is partly mitigated by the presence of both long and short equity\nsecurities as part of our investment strategy. At December 31, 2023, a 10% decline in the price of each of the underlying listed\nequity securities and equity-based derivative instruments would result in a $12.3 million (2022: $8.1 million) unrealized loss in\nour investment in SILP.\nCommodity Price Risk\nGenerally, market prices of commodities are subject to fluctuation. SILP’s investments periodically include long or short\ninvestments in commodities or derivatives directly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of commodities. At December 31,\n2023, SILP’s investments incorporate unhedged exposure to changes in gold, uranium, and crude oil prices.\n72\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the net impact that a 10% movement in commodity prices would have on the fair value\nof SILP’s investment portfolio. The below table excludes the indirect effect that changes in commodity prices might have on\nequity securities in the SILP’s investment portfolio.\n10% increase in commodity 10% decrease in commodity\nprices prices\nAt December 31, 2023 ($ in millions)\nGold $ 3.8 $ (3.8)\nUranium 0.8 (0.8)\nCrude oil 1.6 (1.5)\nTotal $ 6.2 $ (6.1)\n10% increase in commodity 10% decrease in commodity\nprices prices\nAt December 31, 2022 ($ in millions)\nGold $ 3.6 $ (3.6)\nSilver 0.3 (0.3)\nUranium 0.3 (0.3)\nCrude oil 0.2 (0.2)\nTotal $ 4.4 $ (4.4)\nForeign Currency Risk\nUnderwriting Related\nCertain of our reinsurance contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, whereby premiums are receivable and losses\nare payable in foreign currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that our foreign currency reinsurance\nbalances are more than (or less than) the corresponding foreign currency cash balances, and there is an increase (or decrease) in\nthe exchange rate of that foreign currency.\nWhile we do not seek to precisely match our liabilities under reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies\nwith investments denominated in such currencies, we continually monitor our exposure to potential foreign currency losses and\nmay use foreign currency cash and cash equivalents or forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate against adverse\nforeign currency movements.\nCertain cedents, particularly the Lloyd’s syndicates, report to us in foreign currencies even though some or all of the\nunderlying exposure is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our consolidated statements of operations may report a foreign exchange\ngain or loss associated with this exposure when reported by the cedents. Additionally, we may report foreign exchange gains or\nlosses due to the mismatch between the currency exchange rates applied to foreign-denominated (i) monetary balances and (ii)\nnon-monetary balances under U.S. GAAP. See Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further\ninformation regarding our accounting treatment of foreign currency transactions.\nWe monitor our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities on an “underlying exposure” basis without\ndistinguishing between monetary and non-monetary balances.\nThe following table summarizes the net impact of a hypothetical 10% currency rate movement relating to our primary\nforeign denominated reinsurance net assets or liabilities (including balances held at Lloyd's):\nNet Asset\n(Liability) 10% increase in 10% decrease in\nAt December 31, 2023 Exposure currency rate currency rate\nGBP £ 25,337 $ (3,228) $ 3,228\nEuro € (13,975) 1,543 (1,543)\nTotal foreign exchange gain (loss) $ (1,685) $ 1,685\n73\nLink to Table of Contents\nNet Asset\n(Liability) 10% increase in 10% decrease in\nAt December 31, 2022 Exposure currency rate currency rate\nGBP £ 5,235 $ (633) $ 633\nEuro € (10,526) 1,126 (1,126)\nTotal foreign exchange gain (loss) $ 493 $ (493)\nInvestment in SILP\nWe may also be exposed to foreign currency risk through SILP’s underlying cash, forwards, options, and investments in\nsecurities denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2023, most of SILP’s currency exposures resulting from foreign-\ndenominated securities (longs and shorts) were reduced by offsetting cash balances denominated in the corresponding foreign\ncurrencies.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies\nwould have no meaningful impact on our investment in SILP.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe primary market risk exposure for any debt instrument is interest rate risk, including credit spreads. Most of our\ninterest rate risk relates to interest rate derivatives held in SILP, and their value may fluctuate with changes in interest rates.\nAt December 31, 2023, our investment in SILP includes interest-rate sensitive securities, such as corporate and sovereign\ndebt instruments and interest rate derivatives. A 100 basis points (increase or decrease) in interest rates would result in a $1.6\nmillion gain (2022: $4.4 million) or a $3.5 million (2022: $4.9 million) loss, respectively, to our investment in SILP.\nWe, along with DME Advisors, monitor the net exposure to interest rate risk and generally do not expect changes in\ninterest rates to have a materially adverse impact on our operations.\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nInformation with respect to this Item is set forth under Part IV Item 15.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE\nNot applicable.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), has\nevaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)\nand 15(d)-15 of the Exchange Act at December 31, 2023. Based on upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023,\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our\ninternal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and\nprocedures that:\n74\nLink to Table of Contents\n● pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the Company;\n● provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only\nin accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n● provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition\nof the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable\nassurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to\ncorrect deficiencies as they are identified.\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework in the Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (the 2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our system of\ninternal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nDeloitte Ltd., an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited the financial statements included in\nthis Annual Report on 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 31, 2023, as required under this Item 9A, which is included herein.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. and subsidiaries (the “Company”)\nas of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, of the Company and our\nreport dated March 5, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s\nAnnual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\nthat a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\n75\nLink to Table of Contents\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte Ltd.\n________________________\nHamilton, Bermuda\nMarch 5, 2024\nITEM 9B.

(the \"Company\") as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each\nof the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 18\n(collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission and our report dated March 5, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nWe did not audit the financial statements of Solasglas Investments, LP, an equity method investment of the Company, as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and for each of the two years in period ended December 31, 2023. The Company’s investment in\nSolasglas Investments, LP as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $258.9 million and $178.2 million, respectively, and its\nequity in net income of Solasglas Investments, LP was $28.7 million and $54.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023\nand 2022. The financial statements of Solasglas Investments, LP were audited by other auditors whose report has been\nfurnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Solasglas Investments, LP, is based solely on\nthe report of the other auditors.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and\nwe are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is derived using expected trends in claim severity and\nfrequency and other factors that may vary significantly as claims are settled. The estimate is sensitive to significant\nassumptions, including the initial expected loss ratio and loss development factors. The estimate is also sensitive to the selection\nof actuarial methods and weighting of these methods applied to project the ultimate losses, the estimation of ultimate reserves\nassociated with catastrophic events, and other factors. Further, not all catastrophic events can be modeled using traditional\nactuarial methodologies, which increases the degree of judgment needed in estimating loss reserves for such events.\nF-1\nLink to Table of Contents\nAuditing the Company’s methods, assumptions and best estimate of the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of\nclaims represented by the incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") claims included in recorded Loss and loss adjustment expense\nreserves involved especially subjective auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our\nactuarial specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to loss and loss adjustment expense reserves included the following, among others\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of the recorded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves,\nincluding the review and approval process that management has in place for significant actuarial methods and\nassumptions used and the approval of management’s best estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.\n• We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company’s actuarial\nanalysis, including historical claims data, to test the reasonableness of key inputs to the actuarial estimate.\n• With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:\n– We independently developed an estimate of the reserves for selected contracts, compared our estimates to\nthose booked by the Company, and evaluated the differences.\n– We evaluated the Company’s methodologies against recognized actuarial practices for the remaining\ncontracts. We also evaluated the assumptions used by the Company using our industry knowledge and\nexperience and other analytical procedures.\n– We compared the results of the quarterly reserve studies prepared by independent external actuaries to\nmanagement’s best estimate and evaluated the differences.\n/s/ Deloitte Ltd.\n_____________________________\nHamilton, Bermuda\nMarch 5, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2022.\nF-2\nLink to Table of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd.\nGrand Cayman, Cayman Islands\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows of\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due\nto error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nOrganization\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE” and, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company”) was\nincorporated as an exempted company under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands on July 13, 2004. At December 31,\n2023, the Company has the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:\n• Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Greenlight Re”), domiciled in the Cayman Islands, is a Class D insurer license\nissued in accordance with the terms of The Insurance Act, 2010 (as amended) and underlying regulations thereto (the\n“Act”) and is subject to regulation by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (“CIMA”). Greenlight Re commenced\nunderwriting in April 2006.\n• Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company (“GRIL”), domiciled in Ireland since 2010, is\nauthorized as a non-life reinsurance undertaking in accordance with the provisions of the European Union (Insurance\nand Reinsurance) Regulations 2015. GRIL provides multi-line property and casualty reinsurance capacity to the\nEuropean broker market and provides GLRE with an additional platform to serve clients located in Europe and North\nAmerica.\n• Greenlight Re Marketing (UK) Limited, domiciled in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) since 2020, is a U.K.\ncompany formed to expand GLRE’s presence in the Lloyd’s of London market (“Lloyd’s”).\n• Greenlight Re Corporate Member Ltd. (“GCM”), domiciled in the U.K., is a corporate member that became a\nwholly-owned subsidiary of GLRE in 2023 and provides underwriting capacity for various Lloyd’s syndicates,\nincluding Greenlight Innovation Syndicate 3456 (“Syndicate 3456”).\n• Verdant Holding Company, Ltd., domiciled in the United States since 2008, is an investment holding\ncompany.\n• Viridis Re SPC, Ltd., domiciled in the Cayman Islands, is an exempted segregated portfolio company which\nwas incorporated in the Cayman Islands in 2023 and is currently in the process of applying to CIMA for a Class B(iii)\ngeneral insurer license.\nAdditionally, through Syndicate 3456, Greenlight Re provides a (re)insurance platform to its growing portfolio of\ninsurtech partnerships. Domiciled in the U.K. since 2022, Syndicate 3456 is authorized to underwrite under the Lloyd’s\nsyndicate-in-a-box model.\nThe ordinary shares of GLRE are listed on Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE.”\nBasis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of GLRE and the\nconsolidated financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany transactions and balances\nhave been eliminated on consolidation.\nCertain amounts in the prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the\npresentation of the current consolidated financial statements. The Company has reported separately the foreign exchange gains\n(losses) from “Other income” in the consolidated statements of operations. This resulted in no change to the previously reported\ntotal revenues or net income. The Company has also included the foreign exchange gains (losses) as part of the net change in\nworking capital in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Further, the Company combined “Other assets, excluding\ndepreciation” and “Other liabilities” and presented the sum as “Other items, net” in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nF-9\nLink to Table of Contents\nThese changes in presentation in the consolidated statements of cash flows have resulted in no change to the previously\nreported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\nTabular dollar are in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts or otherwise noted. All amounts are reported in\nU.S. dollars.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are as follows:\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nperiod. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company’s principal estimates include:\n• loss and loss adjustment expense reserves;\n• premiums written and earned and related premium receivable, net of expected credit losses;\n• reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including expected credit losses; and\n• valuation of investments, including impairments.\nInvestments\nInvestment in related party investment fund\nThe Company records its investment in the related party investment fund based on fair value using the net asset value\npractical expedient, with the Company’s share of the fund’s net income (loss) reported as “Income (loss) from investment in\nrelated party investment fund” in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOther investments\nThe Company’s other investments include short-term investments and private investments and unlisted equity securities\nwithout readily determinable fair values.\nShort-term investments are measured at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. These include certificate of\ndeposit and other financial instruments with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year.\nThe Company measures its private investments and unlisted equity securities without readily determinable fair values at\ncost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from identical or similar investments of the same issuers\n(the “measurement alternative”), with such changes recognized in “Net investment income (loss)” in the consolidated statements\nof operations. The Company considers the need for impairment on a by-investment basis based on certain indicators. Under the\nmeasurement alternative, the Company makes two types of valuation adjustments:\n• When the Company observes an orderly transaction of an investee’s identical or similar equity securities, the\nCompany adjusts the carrying value based on the observable price as of the transaction date. Once the Company\nrecords such an adjustment, the investment is considered an “asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis.”\n• If the Company determines that the investment is impaired and the fair value is less than its carrying value, it\nwrites down the investment to its fair value. Once the Company records such an adjustment, the investment is\nconsidered an “asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.”\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments and certificates of deposit with\noriginal maturity dates of three months or less. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are presented separately in the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nF-10\nLink to Table of Contents\nPremium Revenue Recognition\nThe Company writes excess of loss contracts and quota share contracts and estimates the ultimate premiums for the\ncontract period. The Company bases these estimates on actuarial pricing models and information received from ceding\ncompanies. For excess of loss contracts, the Company writes the total ultimate estimated premiums at the contract’s inception.\nFor quota share contracts, the Company writes premiums in the same periods in which the underlying insurance contracts are\nwritten, based on cession statements from cedents. The Company typically receives these statements monthly or quarterly,\ndepending on the terms specified in each contract. For any reporting lag, the Company estimates premiums written based\non the portion of the estimated ultimate premiums relating to the risks bound during the lag period.\nFor multi-year contracts, reinsurance premiums are recorded at the inception of the contract based on management’s best\nestimate of total premiums to be received. Premiums are recognized on an annual basis for multi-year contracts where the\ncedants have the ability to unilaterally commute or cancel coverage within the term of the contract.\nManagement regularly reviews premium estimates. Such review includes the Company’s experience with the ceding\ncompanies, managing general underwriters, familiarity with each market, the timing of the reported information, a comparison\nof reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums, along with a review of the aging and collection of premiums.\nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of the premium estimates on the basis of these reviews and records any adjustments\nto these estimates in the period in which they are determined. Changes in premium estimates, including premium receivable on\nboth excess of loss and quota share contracts, are not unusual and may result in significant adjustments in any period. A portion\nof amounts included in “Reinsurance balances receivable” in the consolidated balance sheets represent estimated premiums\nwritten, net of commissions and brokerage, that are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Additional\npremiums due on a contract with no remaining coverage period are earned in full when written.\nCertain contracts allow for reinstatement premiums in the event of a loss. Reinstatement premiums are written and\nearned when a triggering loss event occurs.\nPremiums written are generally recognized as earned over the contract period in proportion to the risk covered. Unearned\npremiums represent the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided.\nReinsurance Premiums Ceded\nThe Company reduces the risk of future losses on business assumed by reinsuring certain risks and exposures with other\nreinsurers (referred to as “retrocessionaires”). The Company remains liable to the extent that any retrocessionaire fails to meet\nits obligations and to the extent the Company does not hold sufficient security for its unpaid obligations.\nCeded premiums are written during the period in which the risks incept and the associated expense is recognized over the\ncontract period in proportion to the protection provided. Unearned premiums ceded represent the unexpired portion of\nreinsurance obtained.\nAcquisition Costs\nPolicy acquisition costs vary with, and are directly related to, the successful production of new and renewal business and\nconsist principally of commissions, taxes, and brokerage expenses. The Company presents acquisition costs incurred on\nreinsurance assumed net of commissions earned on reinsurance ceded. However, if the sum of a contract’s expected losses and\nloss expenses and deferred acquisition costs exceeds associated unearned premiums and expected investment income, a\npremium deficiency is determined to exist. In this event, the Company writes off deferred acquisition costs to the extent\nnecessary to eliminate the premium deficiency. If the premium deficiency exceeds deferred acquisition costs, the Company\naccrues a liability for the deficiency. The Company did not recognize any premium deficiency adjustments during the periods\npresented.\nPolicy acquisition costs also include profit commissions, which the Company recognized on a basis consistent with its\nestimate of losses and loss expenses.\nF-11\nLink to Table of Contents\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves and Recoverable\nThe Company’s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves (“LAE”) are composed of:\n● case reserves for loss and LAE resulting from claims notified to the Company by its clients; and\n● reserves for estimated loss and LAE incurred by insureds and reinsureds but not yet reported to the insurer or\nreinsurer (“IBNR”), including unknown future developments on loss and LAE that are known to the insurer or\nreinsurer.\nThe Company estimates these reserves based on reports from ceding companies, industry data, and historical experience\nanalyzed using standard actuarial and statistical techniques.\nThe analysis includes assessing currently available data, predictions of future developments, estimates of future trends,\nand other factors. These estimates are reviewed by the Company’s reserving committee at least quarterly and adjusted as\nnecessary.\nThe final settlement of losses may vary, perhaps materially, from the reserves recorded. The Company recognizes\nall adjustments to the estimates in the period they are determined. U.S. GAAP does not permit establishing loss reserves, which\ninclude case reserves and IBNR loss reserves, until the occurrence of an event that may give rise to a claim. As a result, only\nloss reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date are established. There is no allowance for the establishment\nof loss reserves to account for expected future loss events.\nThe “Loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable” in the consolidated balance sheets represents the amounts due\nfrom retrocessionaires for unpaid loss and LAE on retrocession agreements. Ceded IBNR recoverable amounts are estimated\nbased on the Company’s actuarial estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted when deemed necessary.\nThe Company may be unable to recover the loss and LAE recoverable amounts due as a result of the retrocessionaires’ inability\nto pay. The Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of its retrocessionaires and calculates an allowance for\nexpected credit losses (see “Reinsurance Assets” below).\nFor losses stemming from exposure to natural perils, loss reserves are generally established based on loss payments and\ncase reserves reported by clients when, and if, received. Estimates for IBNR losses are added to the case reserves as the\nCompany deems appropriate. To establish catastrophe IBNR loss estimates, the Company uses estimates communicated by\nceding companies, industry data and information, knowledge of the business written, and management’s judgment.\nFor contracts without significant exposure to natural perils, initial reserves for each contract are determined based on a\ncombination of (i) the pricing analysis performed prior to binding the contract; (ii) the underwriter’s detailed knowledge of the\ncedent, its operations and future business plans; and (iii) the professional judgment and recommendation of the Chief Actuary.\nIn the pricing analysis, the Company utilizes information from the client and industry data. This information typically includes,\nbut is not limited to, data related to premiums, losses, exposure, business mix, industry performance, and associated trends\ncovering as much history as deemed appropriate. The level of detail within the data obtained varies greatly depending on the\nunderlying contract, line of business, client, and coverage provided. In all cases, the Company requests each client to provide\ndata for each reporting period, which, depending on the contract, could be on a monthly or quarterly basis. The terms and\nconditions of each contract specify the data reporting requirements.\nGenerally, the Company obtains regular updates of premium and loss-related information for the current and historical\nperiods and utilizes them to update the initially expected loss ratio. There may be a lag between (i) claims being reported by the\nunderlying insured to the Company’s cedent and (ii) claims being reported by the Company’s cedent to the Company. This lag\nmay impact the Company’s loss reserve estimates. Client reports have pre-determined due dates (for example, fifteen days after\neach month-end). The timing of the reporting requirements is designed so that the Company receives premium and loss\ninformation as soon as practicable once the client has closed its books. Accordingly, there should be a short lag in such\nreporting. Additionally, most contracts that have the potential for large single-event losses have provisions that such loss\nnotifications are provided to the Company immediately upon the occurrence of an event.\nOnce the updated information is received, the Company uses various standard actuarial methods for its quarterly\nanalysis. Such methods typically include the following:\nF-12\nLink to Table of Contents\n● Paid loss development method: Ultimate losses are estimated by calculating past paid loss development factors and\napplying them to exposure periods with further expected paid loss development. This method assumes that losses are\npaid in a consistent pattern. It provides an objective test of reported loss projections because paid losses contain no\nreserve estimates.\n● Reported loss development method: Ultimate losses are estimated by calculating past reported loss development\nfactors and applying them to exposure periods with further expected reported loss development. This method\nincorporates changes in payments and case reserves.\n● Expected loss ratio method: Ultimate losses are estimated by multiplying earned premiums by an expected loss ratio.\nThe expected loss ratio is often determined using industry data, historical company data, past pricing or reserving\nanalysis performed, and actuarial judgment. This method is typically used for lines of business and contracts where\nthere are no (or insignificant) historical losses or where past loss experience is not considered applicable to the current\nperiod.\n● Bornhuetter-Ferguson paid loss method: Ultimate losses are estimated by modifying expected loss ratios to the\nextent losses paid to date differ from what would have been expected based upon the selected paid loss development\npattern. This method avoids some distortions that could result from a large development factor being applied to a\nsmall base of paid losses to calculate ultimate losses.\n● Bornhuetter-Ferguson reported loss method: Ultimate losses are estimated by modifying expected loss ratios to the\nextent losses reported to date differ from what would have been expected based upon the selected reported loss\ndevelopment pattern. This method avoids some distortions that could result from a large development factor being\napplied to a small base of reported losses to calculate ultimate losses.\n● Frequency / Severity method: Ultimate losses are estimated by multiplying the ultimate number of claims (i.e., the\nfrequency multiplied by the exposure base) by the estimated average cost per claim (i.e., the severity). This approach\nenables trends and patterns in the rates of claims emergence (i.e., reporting) and settlement (i.e., closure) and the\naverage cost of claims to be analyzed separately.\nIn addition, the Company may supplement its analysis with other reserving methodologies that it deems relevant to\nspecific contracts.\nFor each contract, the Company utilizes reserving methodologies it considers appropriate to calculate a best estimate of\nreserves. Whether the Company uses a single methodology or a combination depends upon the portfolio segment being\nanalyzed and the actuary’s judgment. The Company’s reserving methodology does not require a fixed weighting of the various\nmethods used. Certain methods are considered more appropriate than others depending on the type, structure, age, maturity, and\nduration of the expected losses on the contract. For example, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson reported loss method might be more\nappropriate than a paid loss development method for relatively new contracts that have experienced little paid loss\ndevelopment.\nThe Company’s gross aggregate reserves are the sum of the best estimate reserves of all portfolio exposures. Generally,\nIBNR loss reserves are calculated by estimating the ultimate incurred losses and subtracting cumulative paid claims and case\nreserves. Each quarter, the Company’s Reserving Committee, led by the Chief Actuary, meets to assess the adequacy of our\nloss reserves based on the reserve analysis and recommendations prepared by the Company’s reserving department.\nThe Company does not typically experience material claims processing backlogs, although such backlogs may occur\nfollowing a major catastrophic event. At December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company did not have a material backlog in its\nclaims processing.\nThe Company did not make any significant changes to the actuarial methodology or assumptions relating to its loss and\nloss adjustment expense reserves for the years presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nReinsurance Assets\nThe Company calculates an allowance for expected credit losses for its reinsurance balances receivable and loss and\nLAE recoverable by applying a Probability of Default (“PD”) / Loss Given Default (“LGD”) model. The PD / LGD approach\nconsiders the Company’s collectibility history on its reinsurance assets and representative external loss history. In calculating\nthe probability of default, the Company also considers the estimated duration of its reinsurance assets.\nThe Company evaluates each counterparty’s creditworthiness based on credit ratings that independent agencies assign to\nthe counterparty. The Company manages its credit risk in its reinsurance assets by transacting only with insurers and reinsurers\nthat it considers financially sound. Credit ratings of the counterparties are forward-looking and consider various economic\nscenarios. The Company's evaluation of the required allowance for reinsurance balances receivable and loss and LAE\nrecoverable considers the current economic environment as well as potential macroeconomic developments.\nF-13\nLink to Table of Contents\nFor its retrocessional counterparties that are unrated, the Company may hold collateral in the form of funds withheld,\ntrust accounts, or irrevocable letters of credit. In evaluating credit risk associated with reinsurance balances receivable, the\nCompany considers its right to offset loss obligations against premiums receivable. The Company regularly evaluates its net\ncredit exposure to assess the ability of cedents and retrocessionaires to honor their respective obligations.\nDeposit Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company applies deposit accounting to reinsurance contracts that do not transfer sufficient insurance risk to merit\nreinsurance accounting. Under deposit accounting, the Company recognizes an asset or liability based on its paid or received\nconsideration. The deposit asset or liability balance is subsequently adjusted using the interest method with the corresponding\nincome and expense recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations under “Other income (expense)” and\n“Deposit interest expense,” respectively. The Company records deposit assets and liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets in\n“Reinsurance balances receivable” and “Reinsurance balances payable,” respectively. At December 31, 2023, deposit assets\nand liabilities were $0.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively (December 31, 2022: $3.1 million and $10.7 million,\nrespectively).\nNet investment income (loss)\nThe Company records interest income and interest expense on an accrual basis.\nAny realized and unrealized gains or losses from other investments are determined on the basis of the specific\nidentification method (by reference to cost or amortized cost, as appropriate). Additionally, net investment income (loss)\nincludes realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nIn connection with the Company’s participation interest in Lloyd’s syndicates, the Lloyd’s syndicates invest a portion of\nthe premiums withheld in investment funds and fixed-maturity securities. The Company records its share of income (or\nexpense) from these assets as other income (expense) as reported by the syndicates on a quarterly lag basis due to the timing of\nthe availability of these quarterly financial reports.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation costs based on the fair value at the award’s grant date. The\nCompany measures compensation for restricted shares and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) based on the price of the Company’s\ncommon shares at the grant date. For restricted shares and RSUs with service and performance vesting conditions, the expense\nis recognized based on management’s estimate of the probability of the performance conditions being achieved based on\nhistorical results and expectations of future results. If the Company expects to meet the performance conditions, it attributes the\nexpense to the period the requisite service is rendered. For restricted shares and RSUs with only service vesting conditions, the\nCompany recognizes the associated expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, net of any estimated or expected\nforfeitures.\nThe forfeiture rate is estimated based on the Company’s historical actual forfeitures relating to restricted shares and\nRSUs granted to employees. The forfeiture rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary. The Company applies no\nforfeiture rate to restricted shares granted to directors, which vest over a maximum twelve-month period.\nDetermining the fair value of share purchase options at the grant date requires significant estimation and judgment. The\nCompany uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to assist in the calculation of fair value for share purchase options. The\nmodel requires estimating various inputs such as the term, forfeiture and dividend rates, and expected volatility. In determining\nthe grant date fair value, the Company uses the entire ten-year life of the options as the estimated term and assumes no\nforfeitures and no dividends paid during the life of the options. The Company bases its estimate of expected volatility on the\ndaily historical trading data of the Company’s ordinary shares from the date they commenced trading (May 24, 2007) to the\ngrant date.\nFor share purchase options issued under the employee stock incentive plan, the compensation cost is calculated and\nrecognized over the vesting periods on a graded vesting basis.\nF-14\nLink to Table of Contents\nConvertible Notes\nPrior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06 in January 2022, “Debt - Debt with Conversion\nand Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”),” the Company determined\nthat the senior convertible notes’ cash conversion option represented an embedded derivative and bifurcated it from the\nunderlying contract for financial reporting purposes. For the debt component, the Company recorded a liability equivalent to the\npresent value of comparable debt without the conversion features at the time of issuance. The remainder of the proceeds, which\nrepresented the embedded derivative, was included in “Additional paid-in capital” in the consolidated balance sheets.\nUpon adoption of ASU 2020-06, U.S. GAAP no longer permits entities to bifurcate embedded conversion features from\nthe underlying contract. Therefore, effective January 1, 2022, the Company no longer presents the embedded conversion\nfeatures separately in equity; instead, the Company’s senior convertible debt is presented as a single liability in the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheet. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 resulted in a decrease in the Company’s opening shareholders’\nequity of $2.5 million, with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the senior convertible notes.\nCosts incurred in issuing the convertible notes consisted primarily of underwriting, legal, accounting, and printing fees.\nThese costs are amortized over the term of the debt and are included in “Interest expense” in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nForeign Exchange\nThe reporting and functional currency of the Company and all its significant subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The\nCompany records foreign currency transactions at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary assets and\nliabilities in foreign currencies are converted at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are carried at their historical exchange rates.\nDerivative instruments\nThe Company recognizes derivative financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair values.\nThe Company’s derivatives do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes. The Company records the\nassociated assets and liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. The Company does not offset these balances\nagainst collateral pledged or received.\nOther Assets\nThe Company’s other assets consist primarily of prepaid expenses, right-of-use lease assets, derivative assets, taxes\nrecoverable, and deferred tax assets.\nOther Liabilities\nThe Company’s other liabilities consist primarily of accruals for legal and other professional fees, employee bonuses and\nseverances, taxes payable, derivative liabilities, and lease liabilities.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe Company has no comprehensive income or loss other than the net income or loss disclosed in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe Company has issued unvested restricted stock awards, some of which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or\ndividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid. These awards are considered “participating securities” for the purposes of\ncalculating earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of\nordinary shares and participating securities outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (or loss) per share includes the\ndilutive effect, if any, of the following:\n• Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) issued that convert to ordinary shares upon vesting;\n• Unvested restricted share awards which are not considered “participating securities”;\nF-15\nLink to Table of Contents\n• Additional potential ordinary shares issuable when in-the-money stock options are exercised, determined using\nthe treasury stock method;\n• For periods prior to January 1, 2022, those ordinary shares with the potential to be issued in connection with\nconvertible notes and other such convertible instruments, determined using the treasury stock method; and\n• Effective January 1, 2022, the dilutive effect of the convertible notes calculated using the if-converted method.\nUnder the if-converted method, the convertible notes are assumed to be converted at the beginning of the\nperiod. The resulting common shares are included in the denominator of the diluted net income per common\nshare calculation. Interest expense related to the convertible notes incurred in the period is added back to the\nnumerator for purposes of the if-converted calculation.\nDiluted earnings (or loss) per share contemplates a conversion to ordinary shares of all convertible instruments only if\nthey are dilutive. In the event of a net loss, all RSUs, stock options, shares potentially issuable in connection with convertible\nnotes, and participating securities are excluded from the calculation of both basic and diluted loss per share as their inclusion\nwould be anti-dilutive.\nTaxation\nThe Company records current and deferred income taxes based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable in the relevant\njurisdiction in the period in which the tax becomes accruable or realizable. Deferred income taxes are provided for all\ntemporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheets and those reported\nin the various jurisdictional tax returns.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance to the extent that the Company considers it more likely than not that all or a\nportion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future. Other than this valuation allowance, the Company has not\ntaken any income tax positions subject to significant uncertainty that is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the\nCompany.\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are based on the internal information that the Chief Operating Decision Maker uses for allocating the\nCompany’s resources and assessing its performance. The Company has one operating segment, Property and Casualty\nReinsurance.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nOn November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new ASU requires\nincremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment, the\nmethod for determining segments, or the criteria for aggregating operating segments into reportable segments. This new\nguidance is effective for the Company’s 2024 year-end financial statements, and should be adopted retrospectively unless\nimpracticable. Early adoption is permitted.\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic (740) - Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures. The amendments in this Update provide more transparency about income tax information through improvements\nto income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. Early adoption is\npermitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective application is permitted. This\nASU is effective for the Company’s 2024 year-end financial statements.\nAs the above ASUs relate solely to financial statement disclosures, the adoption of these ASUs will not impact the\nCompany’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Adopted\nThere are none that would be relevant and material to the Company.\nF-16\nLink to Table of Contents\n3. INVESTMENT IN RELATED PARTY INVESTMENT FUND\nThe Company has entered into the Second Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement (the “SILP\nLPA”) of Solasglas Investments, LP (“SILP”), with DME Advisors II, LLC (“DME II”), as General Partner, Greenlight Re, and\nGRIL, (together, the “GLRE Limited Partners”). SILP has entered into a SILP investment advisory agreement (“IAA”) with\nDME Advisors. LP (“DME Advisors”), pursuant to which DME Advisors is the investment manager for SILP. DME II and\nDME Advisors are related to the Company, and each is an affiliate of David Einhorn, Chairman of the Company’s Board of\nDirectors (the “Chairman”).\nAt December 31, 2023, the SILP LPA included the following proviso: “The Investment Portfolio of each Partner will not\nexceed the product of (a) such Partner’s surplus (Greenlight Re Surplus or GRIL Surplus, as the case may be) multiplied by (b)\nthe Investment Cap (60%), and the General Partner will designate any portion of a Partner’s Investment Portfolio as Designated\nSecurities to effectuate such limit.”\nThe Company has concluded that SILP qualifies as a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under U.S. GAAP. In assessing its\ninterest in SILP, the Company noted the following:\n• DME II serves as SILP’s general partner and has the power to appoint the investment manager. The Company does not\nhave the power to appoint, change or replace the investment manager or the general partner except “for cause.” Neither\nof the GLRE Limited Partners can participate in the investment decisions of SILP as long as SILP adheres to the\ninvestment guidelines provided within the SILP LPA. For these reasons, the GLRE Limited Partners are not\nconsidered to have substantive participating rights or kick-out rights.\n• DME II holds an interest in excess of 10% of SILP’s net assets, which the Company considers to represent an\nobligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits of SILP that are significant to SILP.\nConsequently, the Company has concluded that DME II’s interests, not the Company’s, meet both the “power” and\n“benefits” criteria associated with VIE accounting guidance. Therefore DME II is SILP’s primary beneficiary. The Company\npresents its investment in SILP in its consolidated balance sheets in the caption “Investment in related party investment fund.”\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss relating to SILP is limited to the net asset value of the GLRE Limited\nPartners’ investment in SILP. At December 31, 2023, the net asset value of the GLRE Limited Partners’ investment in SILP\nwas $258.9 million (December 31, 2022: $178.2 million), representing 72.7% (December 31, 2022: 69.3%) of SILP’s total net\nassets. DME II held the remaining 27.3% (December 31, 2022: 30.7%) of SILP’s total net assets. The investment in SILP is\nrecorded at the GLRE Limited Partners’ share of the net asset value of SILP as reported by SILP’s third-party administrator.\nThe GLRE Limited Partners can redeem their assets from SILP for operational purposes by providing 3 business days’ notice to\nDME II. At December 31, 2023, the majority of SILP’s long investments were composed of cash and publicly-traded equity\nsecurities, which could be readily liquidated to meet the GLRE Limited Partners’ redemption requests.\nThe Company’s share of the change in the net asset value of SILP for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and\n2021, was $28.7 million, $54.8 million, and $18.1 million, respectively, and shown in the caption “Income from investment in\nrelated party investment fund” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s investment in SILP exceeded 10% of the Company’s total shareholders’ equity,\nwith a fair value of $258.9 million (December 31, 2022: $178.2 million), representing 43.4% (December 31, 2022: 35.4%), of\ntotal shareholders’ equity.\nThe Company has determined that for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s investment in SILP met\nat least one of the conditions of a significant subsidiary under SEC’s Regulation S-X, Rule 3-09. Accordingly, the audited\nfinancial statements for SILP have been attached as an exhibit (Exhibit 99.1) to this Form 10-K.\nThe summarized financial statements of SILP are presented below.\nF-17\nLink to Table of Contents\nSummarized Statements of Financial Condition of Solasglas Investments, LP\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAssets\nInvestments, at fair value $ 453,358 $ 304,806\nDerivative contracts, at fair value 11,167 17,547\nDue from brokers 121,754 109,169\nInterest and dividends receivable 1,143 527\nTotal assets 587,422 432,049\nLiabilities and partners’ capital\nLiabilities\nInvestments sold short, at fair value (197,571) (159,382)\nDerivative contracts, at fair value (12,917) (12,443)\nDue to brokers (17,398) (2,050)\nCapital withdrawals payable (1,000) (75)\nInterest and dividends payable (2,315) (760)\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities (247) (159)\nTotal liabilities (231,448) (174,869)\nPartners' capital $ 355,974 $ 257,180\nGLRE’s share of Partners' capital $ 258,890 $ 178,197\nF-18\nLink to Table of Contents\nSummarized Statements of Operations of Solasglas Investments, LP\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022 2021\nInvestment income\nDividend income (net of withholding taxes) $ 1,869 $ 1,586 $ 641\nInterest income 9,211 2,390 228\nTotal Investment income 11,080 3,976 869\nExpenses\nManagement fee (4,766) (3,580) (3,492)\nInterest (6,969) (1,950) (1,055)\nDividends (2,802) (1,374) (1,147)\nProfessional fees and other (1,750) (988) (1,221)\nTotal expenses (16,287) (7,892) (6,915)\nNet investment income (loss) (5,207) (3,916) (6,046)\nRealized and change in unrealized gains (losses)\nNet realized gain (loss) (1,394) 75,172 (3,420)\nNet change in unrealized appreciation 55,279 11,886 35,482\nNet gain (loss) on investment transactions 53,885 87,058 32,062\nNet increase in Partners' capital $ 48,678 $ 83,142 $ 26,016\nGLRE’s share of the increase in Partners' capital(1) $ 28,696 $ 54,844 $ 18,087\n1 The net increase in Partners’ capital is net of management fees and performance allocation presented below:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022 2021\nManagement fees $ 4,766 $ 3,580 $ 3,492\nPerformance allocation 3,188 6,094 2,010\nTotal $ 7,954 $ 9,674 $ 5,502\nSee Note 15 for further details on management fees and performance allocation.\n4.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received in an asset sale or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between unaffiliated market participants. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized\nbased on the extent to which the inputs are observable in the market. The categorization of financial instruments within the\nvaluation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is\nprioritized into three levels (with Level 3 being the lowest) defined as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value of the assets\nand liabilities. The term “unobservable inputs” includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, and similar techniques.\nThere have been no material change in the Company’s valuation techniques, nor have there been any transfers between\nLevel 1 and Level 2, or Level 2 and Level 3 for the years presented in these consolidated financial statements.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company held $61.3 million (2022: $53.6 million) of private investments and unlisted\nequities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. At December 31, 2023, the Company held $9.9 million (2022:\n$8.9 million) of private investments and unlisted equities measured at cost. The Company classifies these investments as Level\n3 within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table summarizes the periods between the most recent fair value measurement dates and December 31,\n2023, for the private and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:\nLess than 6\nmonths 6 to 12 months Over 1 year Total\nFair values measured on a nonrecurring basis $ 26,438 $ 1,361 $ 33,490 $ 61,289\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps in connection with its risk management activities to hedge 50% of the interest rate\nrisk relating to the outstanding Term Loans (see Note 9). The interest rate swaps are carried at fair value and are determined\nusing a market approach valuation technique based on significant observable market inputs from third-party pricing vendors.\nF-21\nLink to Table of Contents\nAccordingly, the interest rates swaps are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. These derivative instruments are\nnot designated as accounting hedges under U.S. GAAP.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized unrealized loss for the above derivatives of $0.6\nmillion (2022: $nil), which is included in “Other liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets, in “Interest expense” in the\nconsolidated statements of operations, and in “Net realized and unrealized losses on derivatives” in the consolidated statements\nof cash flows.\nFinancial Instruments Disclosed, But Not Carried, at Fair Value\nThe carrying value of debt and convertible debt securities within “Other Investments” (see “Private investments and\nunlisted equity securities without readily determinable fair values” above) and certificates of deposit with original maturities of\none year or less approximates their fair values. The Company classifies these assets as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nAt December 31, 2023, the carrying values of the Term Loans approximate their fair values.\n7.

The magnitude and volume of losses arising from these events is\ninherently uncertain and, consequently, actual losses for these events may ultimately differ, potentially materially, from current\nestimates.\nF-22\nLink to Table of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized CAT loss, net of reinsurance, of $28.8 million for\ncurrent year CAT loss events, driven mainly by the U.S. severe storms and the Mexican state-owned oil platform fire loss. This\nwas partially offset by $10.7 million of net favorable prior year CAT development. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the\nCompany recognized current year CAT loss of $39.7 million driven primarily by $13.6 million from the Russian-Ukrainian\nconflict and $19.5 million from hurricane Ian. This was partially offset by $5.0 million net favorable prior year CAT\ndevelopment.\nPrior Year Reserve Development\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company experienced $11.2 million in net adverse development on prior\nyear loss and LAE reserves. This was comprised of $39.8 million of reserve strengthening on casualty, workers’ compensation\nand auto classes of business due to current economic and social inflation trends (various underwriting years); homeowners\nbusiness primary due to the deterioration in the CAT loss estimate relating to Winter Storm Elliott (2022 underwriting year),\ncoupled with a final claim settlement on a professional liability contract (2008 underwriting year). This was partially offset by\n$28.6 million favorable loss development from property catastrophe events and better than expected loss emergence for\nmortgage, marine and energy, and specialty contracts from underwriting years 2020-2022.\nSee the loss development tables by lines of business below under “Disclosure about Short-Duration Contracts” for more\ninformation on prior year loss reserve development.\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company experienced $0.1 million in net adverse development on prior\nyear loss and LAE reserves. This was comprised of $21.9 million of reserve strengthening on motor, health, casualty,\nprofessional liability, and workers’ compensation contracts from underwriting years 2014-2021, coupled with higher claim\nsettlements on certain general liability contracts for 2015-2016 underwriting years. This was partially offset by $21.8 million\nfavorable loss development from various pre-2021 years’ property catastrophe events, including COVID-19, and better than\nexpected loss emergence for mortgage business (from 2017-2020 underwriting years), a multi-line combined workers’\ncompensation and commercial packages contract across multiple underwriting years, coupled with favorable development on a\nwhole account contract (2020 underwriting year).\nYear ended December 31, 2021\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company experienced $14.1 million in net favorable development on\nprior year loss and LAE reserves. This was comprised of $37.4 million favorable loss development from better-than-expected\nloss emergence for motor, mortgage, and various specialty contracts (including crop, space, and marine and energy) from\nunderwriting years 2015-2018, coupled with a multi-line contract that incepted in 2019. This was partially offset by\n$23.3 million adverse loss development primarily due to reserve strengthening on multi-line casualty, general liability and\nworkers’ compensation contracts from underwriting years 2014-2019.\nDisclosures about Short-Duration Contracts\nThe Company has one operating segment, Property & Casualty Reinsurance, and categorizes its business as Property,\nCasualty, and Other. The Company’s loss development tables presented below have been disaggregated by lines of business for\nthe years ended from December 31, 2014, through 2023.\nFor purposes of the loss development tables, the property business has been further disaggregated into \"Property\" and\n\"Motor - Physical Damage.\" The casualty category has been disaggregated into \"General Liability,\" \"Motor Liability,\"\n\"Professional Liability,\" and \"Workers' Compensation.\" Contracts that cover more than one line of business, including Lloyd’s\nbusiness, are grouped as \"Multi-line.\" Other specialty business, including aviation, crop, cyber, and energy, which are\nindividually insignificant to the Company’s overall business, have been grouped as \"Other.\" As the Company’s accident and\nhealth business has become immaterial in recent years, the Company has grouped accident and health business with “Other”\nduring 2023. Additionally, the Company has elected to present the loss development table for “Marine” separately from\n“Other” due to its growth in 2023. As a result, the historical incurred and paid claims development presented in the tables below\ndiffer from those disclosed in previously issued financial statements. Conforming changes were also made to the table above\npresenting the changes in the outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for health claims as part of the\n“Consolidated” table for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. The amounts shown in “Net loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses incurred” in the consolidated statements of operations and the allocation between “Current year” and “Prior years” are\nunaffected by these revisions.\nF-23\nLink to Table of Contents\nFor each category, the following tables present the incurred and paid claims development at December 31, 2023, net of\nretrocession, and the total of incurred but not reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims included within\nthe net incurred claims amount.\nThe tables below present incurred and paid claims development for the years ended December 31, 2014 to 2022.

As a result, all prior year information has been restated to reflect\nDecember 31, 2023, foreign exchange rates. This treatment prevents changes in foreign currency exchange rates from distorting\nthe claims development between the years presented.\nFor assumed contracts, the Company does not generally receive claims information by accident year from the ceding\ninsurers but instead receives claims information by the treaty year of the contract. Claims reported by the ceding insurer to the\nF-33\nLink to Table of Contents\nCompany may have the covered losses occurring in an accident year other than the treaty year. Some incurred and paid claims\nhave been allocated to the accident years for the loss development tables based on the proportion of premiums earned for each\ncontract during such accident year.\nFor example, a one-year quota-share reinsurance treaty incepting on October 1, 2020 (with underlying policies each\nhaving a one-year duration) would have a 24-month period over which the premiums would be earned. Therefore, claims would\nbe allocated to accident years 2020, 2021 and 2022 based on the proportion of the premiums earned during each accident year.\nFor illustration of this contract, any claims reported during 2020 would be allocated to the 2020 accident year. For losses\nreported during 2021, the claims would be allocated between 2020 and 2021 based on the percentage of premiums earned\nduring 2020 and 2021. Similarly, for losses reported during 2022 and thereafter, the losses would be allocated to the 2020, 2021\nand 2022 accident years based on the proportion of premiums earned during each of those years. However, natural catastrophes\nand certain other large losses are addressed separately and are assigned to the accident year in which they occurred.\nThe reconciliation of the net incurred and paid claims development tables to the liability for claims and claim\nadjustment expenses in the consolidated balance sheet is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023\nNet outstanding liabilities\nMultiline $ 247,929\nGeneral Liability 74,853\nMotor Casualty 22,622\nMotor Property 2,972\nProperty 48,914\nProfessional Liability 15,767\nWorkers' Compensation 55,792\nFinancial Lines 56,202\nMarine 27,150\nOther 77,092\nLiabilities for claims and claims adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance 629,293\nAdd: Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid claims 25,687\nAdd: Unallocated claims adjustment expenses 6,087\nAdd: Allowance for credit losses 487\nTotal gross liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense $ 661,554\nThe average historical annual percentage payout of net incurred claims (excluding health) at December 31, 2023, is as\nfollows:\nYears 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n(Unaudited - Supplementary Information)\nMultiline 11.2 % 17.3 % 16.0 % 11.6 % 9.8 % 9.9 % 9.2 % 8.1 % 4.7 % 2.2 %\nGeneral Liability 4.7 % 13.6 % 13.1 % 12.5 % 18.2 % 27.5 % 6.9 % 3.0 % 0.4 % 0.1 %\nMotor Casualty 49.5 % 35.8 % 7.7 % 3.6 % 1.5 % 0.9 % 0.8 % 0.2 % — % — %\nMotor Property 53.3 % 40.8 % 4.9 % 1.0 % — % — % — % — % — % — %\nProperty 49.0 % 34.4 % 8.2 % 3.2 % 2.7 % 0.9 % 1.0 % 0.5 % 0.1 % — %\nProfessional Liability 2.7 % 9.8 % 14.3 % 12.7 % 8.7 % 7.3 % 5.6 % 2.3 % 2.6 % 34.0 %\nWorkers' Compensation 30.9 % 35.2 % 20.4 % 9.2 % 3.0 % 0.9 % 0.2 % 0.2 % — % — %\nFinancial Lines 18.5 % 33.8 % 23.6 % 12.0 % 4.1 % 3.7 % 1.7 % 1.5 % 1.1 % — %\nMarine 4.3 % 25.2 % 40.0 % 2.3 % 11.3 % 1.7 % 15.2 % — % — % — %\nOther 19.7 % 27.2 % 7.7 % 9.3 % 7.7 % 7.1 % 7.1 % 6.9 % 7.3 % — %\nF-34\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe historical annual percentage payout pattern for health claims is excluded from the table above because health\nclaims have short settlement periods, and including it would skew the results presented.\nAs a reinsurance entity, the Company generally does not receive detailed claims frequency information or claims\ncounts from ceding insurers and third-party claim handlers. Due to the nature of the reinsurance contracts, the underlying\ninsured reports claims to the insurer who cedes losses to the Company. The Company is contractually obligated to reimburse\nthe ceding insurer for its share of the losses. While the Company has the right to conduct audits of the ceding insurer’s claims\nfiles, the insurer is generally not obligated to provide a detailed listing of claims counts or other claims frequency information.\nTherefore it is impracticable for the Company to present the cumulative number of reported claims by accident year.\n8. RETROCESSION\nFrom time to time, the Company purchases retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to manage\nits overall exposure, reduce its net liability on individual risks, obtain additional underwriting capacity, and balance its\nunderwriting portfolio. The Company records loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable from retrocessionaires as assets.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of ceded reinsurance:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022 2021\nGross ceded premiums $ 42,762 $ 33,429 $ 41\nEarned ceded premiums $ 43,653 $ 15,318 $ —\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses ceded $ 25,554 $ 6,615 $ (12)\nRetrocession contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to its cedents. Failure of retrocessionaires to\nhonor their obligations could result in losses to the Company.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\na) Concentration of Credit Risk\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company monitors its concentration of credit risk with financial institutions and limits acceptable counterparties\nbased on current rating, outlook and other relevant factors.\nInvestments\nThe Company’s credit risk exposure to private debt and convertible debt securities within its “Other investments” are\nimmaterial (see Note 4).\nReinsurance balances receivable, net\nThe following table shows the breakdown of reinsurance balances receivable:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAmount % Amount %\nPremiums receivable $ 186,940 30.2 % $ 160,559 31.8 %\nFunds withheld:\nFunds held by cedants 50,075 8.1 % 45,351 9.0 %\nPremiums held by Lloyds' syndicates 264,278 42.7 % 188,056 37.2 %\nFunds at Lloyd’s 115,772 18.6 % 103,947 20.5 %\nProfit commission receivable 2,302 0.4 % 4,888 1.0 %\nDeposit assets 888 0.1 % 3,110 0.6 %\nTotal before provision 620,255 100.1 % 505,911 100.1 %\nProvision for expected credit losses (854) (0.1) % (356) (0.1) %\nReinsurance balances receivable, net $ 619,401 100.0 % $ 505,555 100.0 %\nThe Company has posted deposits at Loyd’s to support underwriting capacity for certain syndicates, including\nSyndicate 3456 (see Note 18). Lloyd’s has a credit rating of “A” (Excellent) from A.M. Best.\nF-44\nLink to Table of Contents\nPremiums receivable includes a significant portion of estimated premiums not yet due. Brokers and other\nintermediaries are responsible for collecting premiums from customer on the Company’s behalf. The Company monitors its\nconcentration of credit risks from brokers (see Note 17). The diversity in the Company’s client base limits credit risk\nassociated with premiums receivable and funds (premiums) held by cedents. Further, under the reinsurance contracts the\nCompany has contractual rights to offset premium balances receivable and funds held by cedants against corresponding\npayments for losses and loss expenses.\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable, net\nThe Company regularly evaluates its net credit exposure to the retrocessionaires and their abilities to honor their\nrespective obligations. See Note 8 for analysis of concentration of credit risk relating to retrocessionaires.\nb) Lease Obligations\nThe Company operates in the Cayman Islands, United Kingdom, and Ireland under various non-cancelable operating\nlease agreements. The Company’s weighted-average remaining operating lease term is approximately 2.5 years at\nDecember 31, 2023.\nAs the lease contracts generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, the Company used the weighted-average\ndiscount rate of 6.0% to determine the present value of lease payments. This discount rate represents the Company’s\nincremental borrowing rate for a term similar to that of the associated lease based on information available at the\ncommencement date. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to include renewal, termination, or purchase\noptions that are not reasonably certain of exercise when determining the borrowing term.\nAt December 31, 2023, the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities relating to the operating leases were $1.4 million and\n$1.5 million, respectively (2022: $1.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively). For the year ended December 31, 2023, the\nCompany recognized operating lease expense $0.6 million (2022: $0.6 million, 2021: $0.4 million).\nAt December 31, 2023, the commitment for operating lease liabilities for future annual periods was as follows:\nYear ending December 31,\n2024 $ 637\n2025 653\n2026 352\nTotal lease payments 1,642\nLess Imputed Interest (142)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 1,500\nc) Litigation\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may be involved in formal and informal dispute\nresolution procedures, which may include arbitration or litigation. The outcomes of these procedures determine the rights and\nobligations under the Company’s reinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, the Company may\nseek to enforce its rights under an agreement or collect funds owed. In other matters, the Company may resist attempts by\nothers to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of legal disputes with certainty,\nthe Company does not believe that any existing dispute, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, or operating results.\nF-45\nLink to Table of Contents\n17.

STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS\nThe Company’s reinsurance operations are subject to insurance laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they\noperate, principally in the Cayman Islands and in Ireland. Additionally, the Company’s Syndicate 3456 is regulated by Lloyd’s.\nThese regulations include certain restrictions on the amount of dividends or other distribution, such as loans or cash advances,\navailable to shareholders without prior approval of the respective regulatory authorities.\nThe statutory capital and surplus and required minimum statutory capital and surplus of the Company’s most significant\nregulated reinsurance operations are detailed below:\nCayman Islands Ireland\nAt December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022\nStatutory capital and surplus 569,044 $ 474,985 58,721 68,881\nRequired statutory capital surplus 256,586 226,507 39,367 41,859\nExcess statutory capital 312,458 $ 248,478 19,354 $ 27,022\nThe statutory net income for the Company’s most significant regulated reinsurance operations were as follows:\nGreenlight Re GRIL\nYear ended December 31, 2023 $ 85,464 $ 11,479\nYear ended December 31, 2022 $ 32,290 $ 4,612\nYear ended December 31, 2021 $ 15,912 $ 3,800\nCayman Islands\nGreenlight Re is subject to the Cayman Islands’ Insurance (Capital and Solvency) (Classes B, C, and D Insurers)\nRegulations, (2018 Revision) (the “Insurance Regulations”). Under this Insurance Regulations, Greenlight Re is required to\nmaintain minimum statutory capital and surplus equal to the greater of: a) the Minimum Capital Requirement of $50.0 million\nand b) the Prescribed Capital Requirement (“PCR”) as defined in the Insurance Regulations.\nGreenlight Re is not required to prepare statutory financial statements for filing with CIMA. There were no material\ndifferences between Greenlight Re’s GAAP capital, surplus, and net income and its statutory capital, surplus, and net income at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and for the years then ended.\nAny dividends declared and paid from Greenlight Re to the Company requires CIMA’s approval. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, $8.3 million of dividends (2022: $60.1 million, 2021: $4.0 million) were declared or paid by Greenlight Re\nto the Company. The dividends were approved by CIMA and resulted in the return of additional share capital to the Company.\nThe dividends were used primarily to repurchase and repay the Company’s Convertible Notes (see Note 9). At December 31,\n2023, $312.5 million (2022: $248.5 million) of Greenlight Re’s capital and surplus was available for distribution as dividends.\nF-47\nLink to Table of Contents\nIreland\nEffective January 1, 2016, the Company’s Irish subsidiary (GRIL) is obligated to maintain at all times the Minimum\nCapital Requirement (“Irish MCR”) and the Solvency Capital Requirement (“SCR”) as calculated by reference to Solvency II\ndefinition.\nThere were no material differences between the statutory financial statements and statements prepared in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP for GRIL at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and for the years then ended.\nThe amount of dividends that GRIL is permitted to distribute is limited to its retained earnings. The Central Bank of\nIreland has powers to intervene if a dividend payment were to breach regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2023\nand 2022, none of GRIL’s capital and surplus was available for distribution as dividends.\nLloyd’s of London\nThe Company operates in the Lloyd’s market through its corporate member, GCM, which provides 100% of Syndicate\n3456’s capital support. Syndicate 3456 is managed by a third party managing agency. GCM and Syndicate 3456 are bound by\nthe rules of Lloyd’s, which are prescribed by Bye-laws and Requirements made by the Council of Lloyd’s under powers\nconferred by the Lloyd’s Act 1982. These rules prescribe members’ membership subscription, the level of their contributions to\nthe Lloyd’s Central Fund and the assets they must deposit with Lloyd’s in support of their underwriting. Further, the Council of\nLloyd’s has broad powers to sanctions breaches of its rules, including the power to restrict or prohibit a member’s participation\non Lloyd’s syndicates.\nThe underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd’s must be supported by providing a deposit, known as “Funds at\nLloyds” or “FAL”, in the form of cash, certain investment securities, or letters of credit. The FAL is not available for\ndistributions for the payment of dividends or for working capital requirements. Further, corporate members may also be\nrequired to maintain funds under the control of Lloyd’s in excess of their capital requirements and such funds also may not be\navailable for distribution for the payment of dividends. The amount of FAL for Syndicate 3456 is determined by Lloyd’s and is\nbased on Syndicate 3456’s solvency and capital requirement based on an internal capital model. See Note 16 for total FAL for\nSyndicate 3456 and other syndicates in which the Company has a participation interest.\nF-48\nLink to Table of Contents\nSCHEDULE I\nGREENLIGHT CAPITAL RE, LTD.\nSUMMARY OF INVESTMENTS — OTHER THAN INVESTMENTS IN RELATED PARTIES\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nBalance\nType of Investment Cost Fair Value Sheet Value\nOther investments:\nPrivate investments and unlisted equities $ 28,470 $ 71,157 $ 71,157\nDebt and convertible debt securities 2,499 2,136 2,136\nTotal other investments 30,969 73,293 73,293\nTotal investments -

(“Greenlight Capital Re,” “Company,” “us,” “we,”\nor “our”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ,\nand Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements, other than\nstatements of historical facts included in this report, including statements regarding estimates, projections, statements relating to\nour business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are\n“forward-looking statements”. We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for\nforward-looking statements in the United States (“U.S.”) federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements generally\nare identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “predict,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,”\n“should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements\nare not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections, and various assumptions, many of\nwhich, are inherently uncertain and beyond management’s control. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the\nforward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially\nfrom those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n● Our results of operations fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\n● The impact of general economic, capital and credit market conditions, including banking sector instability, financial\nmarket illiquidity and fluctuations in interest rates, equity securities’ prices and/or foreign currency exchange rates.\n● A downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement\nour business strategy.\n● Any suspension or revocation of any of our licenses would materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n● Our investment performance depends in part on the performance of Solasglas Investments, LP (“SILP”) and may\nsuffer as a result of adverse financial market developments or other factors that impact SILP’s liquidity, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our investment results, financial condition and results of operations.\n● The carry values of our investments made under our Greenlight Re Innovations pillar, which focuses on developing a\nrange of risk products via strategic partnerships and other methods to access fee income, a stream of underwriting\nbusiness, and investment upside potential (“Innovations”), may differ significantly from those that would be used if\nwe carried these investments at fair value.\n● Our level of debt may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, restrict our current and future operations, particularly\nour ability to respond to business opportunities, and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry\nconditions.\n● Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd. (“Greenlight Re”), and/or Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland,\nDesignated Activity Company (“GRIL”) may be subject to United States federal income taxation.\n● The other matters set forth in the section entitled “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2023 (“2022 Form 10-\nK”).\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new\ninformation, future events, or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements,\nwhich speak only to the dates they were made.\nWe intend to communicate certain events that we believe may have a material adverse impact on our operations or\nfinancial position, including property and casualty catastrophic events and material losses in our investment portfolio, in a\ntimely manner through a public announcement. Other than as required by the Exchange Act, we do not intend to make public\nannouncements regarding reinsurance or investment events that we do not believe, based on management’s estimates and\ncurrent information, will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.\n3\nReturn to table of contents\nItem 1.

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE” and, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company”) was\nincorporated as an exempted company under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands on July 13, 2004. The Company’s\nwholly-owned subsidiaries are described below:\n• Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Greenlight Re”), domiciled in the Cayman Islands, is a Class D insurer license\nissued in accordance with the terms of The Insurance Act, 2010 (as amended) and underlying regulations thereto (the\n“Act”) and is subject to regulation by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. Greenlight Re commenced\nunderwriting in April 2006.\n• Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company (“GRIL”), domiciled in Ireland since 2010, is\nauthorized as a non-life reinsurance undertaking in accordance with the provisions of the European Union (Insurance\nand Reinsurance) Regulations 2015. GRIL provides multi-line property and casualty reinsurance capacity to the\nEuropean broker market and provides GLRE with an additional platform to serve clients located in Europe and North\nAmerica.\n• Greenlight Re Marketing (UK) Limited, domiciled in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) since 2020, is a U.K.\ncompany formed to expand GLRE’s presence in the Lloyd’s of London market (“Lloyd’s”).\n• Greenlight Re Corporate Member Ltd., domiciled in the U.K. since 2014, is a corporate member that became\na wholly-owned subsidiary of GLRE in 2023 and provides underwriting capacity for various Lloyd’s syndicates,\nincluding Syndicate 3456.\n• Verdant Holding Company, Ltd., domiciled in the United States since 2008, is an investment holding\ncompany.\nAdditionally, through Greenlight Innovation Syndicate 3456 (“Syndicate 3456”), Greenlight Re provides a (re)insurance\nplatform to its growing portfolio of insurtech partnerships. Domiciled in the U.K. since 2022, Syndicate 3456 is authorized to\nunderwrite under the Lloyd’s syndicate-in-a-box model.\nThe ordinary shares of GLRE are listed on Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE.”\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information, and with the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) instructions to Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of\nRegulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete\nfinancial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the\nCompany’s audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s 2022 Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on\nMarch 8, 2023. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include GLRE and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\nand all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.\nIn the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments\n(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and\nresults of operations as at the end of and for the periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results for a full year.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in its 2022 Form 10-\nK.\n8\nReturn to table of contents\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The significant estimates reflected in the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves,\npremiums written, earned, and receivable, variability underlying risk transfer assessments, allowances for credit losses, share-\nbased compensation, valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets and investment impairments.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Restricted Cash Equivalents\nThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances to collateralize regulatory trusts and letters of credit issued to\ncedents (see Note 11). The following table reconciles the cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the\nunaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets to the total presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of\ncash flows:\nSeptember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\n($ in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 41,302 $ 38,238\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents 622,624 668,310\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of unaudited cash flows $ 663,926 $ 706,548\nFunds Held by Cedents\nThe caption “Reinsurance balances receivable” in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets\nincludes financial assets held by cedents. At September 30, 2023, funds held by cedents were $422.4 million (December 31,\n2022: $337.4 million). Such amounts include premiums withheld by Lloyd’s syndicates and funds contributed by the Company\nto Lloyd's as security for members’ underwriting activities. The Lloyd’s syndicates invest a portion of the premiums withheld in\ninvestment funds and fixed-maturity securities. The Company records its share of income (or expense) from these assets, in its\nunaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption “Other income (expense)” as reported by the\nsyndicates on a quarterly lag basis due to the timing of the availability of these quarterly financial reports.\nDeposit Assets and Liabilities\nAt September 30, 2023, deposit assets and liabilities were $3.0 million and $5.2 million, respectively (December 31,\n2022: $3.1 million and $10.7 million, respectively). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the\ninterest income (expense) on deposit-accounted contracts were as follows:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n($ in thousands) ($ in thousands)\nDeposit interest income $ — $ — $ — $ —\nDeposit interest expense $ (278) $ (6,148) $ (645) $ (6,373)\nDeposit interest income (expense), net $ (278) $ (6,148) $ (645) $ (6,373)\nForeign Exchange\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, $(2.0) million and $7.6 million (three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022: $(5.0) million and $(10.4) million), respectively, of foreign exchange gains (losses) were included in the\nCompany’s net income in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption of “Other income\n(expense), net”.\n9\nReturn to table of contents\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) and weighted average shares used in computing basic and diluted net\nincome (loss) per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 (expressed in thousands of U.S.\ndollars, except per share and share amounts):\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nNumerator for earnings per share\nNet income (loss) - basic $ 13,477 $ (18,469) $ 69,224 $ (9,408)\nNet income (loss) - diluted $ 13,477 $ (18,469) $ 69,224 $ (9,408)\nDenominator for earnings per share\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 34,070,818 33,127,384 34,067,012 33,119,814\nEffect of dilutive employee and director share-based awards 731,046 — 636,961 —\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 34,801,864 33,127,384 34,703,973 33,119,814\nAnti-dilutive stock options outstanding 652,140 690,337 652,140 690,337\nParticipating securities excluded from calculation of loss per\nshare — 848,841 — 848,841\nShares potentially issuable in connection with convertible notes\nexcluded from calculation of diluted loss per share — 5,686,747 — 5,773,889\nEarnings (loss) per share:\nBasic $ 0.40 $ (0.56) $ 2.03 $ (0.28)\nDiluted $ 0.39 $ (0.56) $ 1.99 $ (0.28)\n3. INVESTMENT IN RELATED PARTY INVESTMENT FUND\nThe Company has entered into the Second Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement (the “SILP\nLPA”) of Solasglas Investments, LP (“SILP”), with DME Advisors II, LLC (“DME II”), as General Partner, Greenlight Re, and\nGRIL, (together, the “GLRE Limited Partners”). SILP has entered into a SILP investment advisory agreement (“IAA”) with\nDME Advisors. LP (“DME Advisors”), pursuant to which DME Advisors is the investment manager for SILP. DME II and\nDME Advisors are related to the Company, and each is an affiliate of David Einhorn, Chairman of the Company’s Board of\nDirectors (the “Chairman”).\nAt September 30, 2023, the SILP LPA included the following proviso: “The Investment Portfolio of each Partner will\nnot exceed the product of (a) such Partner’s surplus (Greenlight Re Surplus or GRIL Surplus, as the case may be) multiplied by\n(b) the Investment Cap (60%), and the General Partner will designate any portion of a Partner’s Investment Portfolio as\nDesignated Securities to effectuate such limit.”\nThe Company has concluded that SILP qualifies as a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under U.S. GAAP. In assessing its\ninterest in SILP, the Company noted the following:\n• DME II serves as SILP’s general partner and has the power to appoint the investment manager. The Company does not\nhave the power to appoint, change or replace the investment manager or the general partner except “for cause.” Neither\nof the GLRE Limited Partners can participate in the investment decisions of SILP as long as SILP adheres to the\ninvestment guidelines provided within the SILP LPA. For these reasons, the GLRE Limited Partners are not\nconsidered to have substantive participating rights or kick-out rights.\n• DME II holds an interest in excess of 10% of SILP’s net assets, which the Company considers to represent an\nobligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits of SILP that are significant to SILP.\n10\nReturn to table of contents\nConsequently, the Company has concluded that DME II’s interests, not the Company’s, meet both the “power” and\n“benefits” criteria associated with VIE accounting guidance. Therefore DME II is SILP’s primary beneficiary. The Company\npresents its investment in SILP in its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets in the caption “Investment in related\nparty investment fund.”\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss relating to SILP is limited to the net asset value of the GLRE Limited\nPartners’ investment in SILP. At September 30, 2023, the net asset value of the GLRE Limited Partners’ investment in SILP\nwas $229.0 million (December 31, 2022: $178.2 million), representing 70.3% (December 31, 2022: 69.3%) of SILP’s total net\nassets. DME II held the remaining 29.7% (December 31, 2022: 30.7%) of SILP’s total net assets.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized\nbased on the extent to which the inputs are observable in the market. The categorization of financial instruments within the\nvaluation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is\nprioritized into three levels (with Level 3 being the lowest) defined as follows:\n13\nReturn to table of contents\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value of the assets\nand liabilities. The term “unobservable inputs” includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, and similar techniques.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nAt September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company held $53.7 million and $53.6 million, respectively, of\nprivate investments and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The Company classifies these assets as\nLevel 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The following table summarizes the periods between the most recent fair value\nmeasurement dates and September 30, 2023, for the private and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:\nLess than 6\nmonths 6 to 12 months Over 1 year Total\n($ in thousands)\nFair values measured on a nonrecurring basis $ 18,552 $ 602 $ 34,567 $ 53,721\nAt September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company held $11.1 million and $8.9 million, respectively, of\nprivate investments and unlisted equities measured at cost.\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps in connection with its risk management activities to hedge 50% of the interest\nrate risk relating to the outstanding Term Loans (see Note 7). The interest rate swaps are carried at fair value and are determined\nusing a market approach valuation technique based on significant observable market inputs from third-party pricing vendors.\nAccordingly, the interest rates swaps are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. These derivative instruments are\nnot designated as accounting hedges under U.S. GAAP.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized unrealized gain for the above\nderivatives of $0.1 million, which are included in other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, in interest\nexpense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and in net change in unrealized gains and losses on\ninvestments and derivatives in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nInvestment in Related Party Investment Fund\nThe Company’s investment in the related party investment fund is measured at fair value using the net asset value\npractical expedient.Therefore, this investment is not classified within the fair value hierarchy. (See Note 3 for further details on\nthe related party investment fund.)\nFinancial Instruments Disclosed, But Not Carried, at Fair Value\nThe carrying value of debt and convertible debt securities within “Other Investments” (see “Private investments and\nunlisted equity securities without readily determinable fair values” above) and certificates of deposit with original maturities of\none year or less approximates their fair values. The Company classifies these assets as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Term Loans (see Note 7) represent financial instruments that the Company carries at amortized cost. At\nSeptember 30, 2023, the carrying values of the Term Loans approximate their fair values.\n14\nReturn to table of contents\n5. LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES\nAt September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were composed of the\nfollowing:\nSeptember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\n($ in thousands)\nCase reserves $ 190,121 $ 184,756\nIBNR 468,113 370,712\nTotal $ 658,234 $ 555,468\nA summary of changes in outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for all lines of business consolidated for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nConsolidated 2023 2022\n($ in thousands)\nGross balance at January 1 $ 555,468 $ 524,010\nLess: Losses recoverable (13,239) (11,100)\nNet balance at January 1 542,229 512,910\nIncurred losses related to:\nCurrent year 273,570 251,231\nPrior years 10,502 1,558\nTotal incurred 284,072 252,789\nPaid losses related to:\nCurrent year (41,026) (54,866)\nPrior years (154,374) (160,094)\nTotal paid (195,400) (214,960)\nForeign currency revaluation (858) (20,516)\nNet balance at September 30 630,043 530,223\nAdd: Losses recoverable 28,191 10,604\nGross balance at September 30 $ 658,234 $ 540,827\nEstimates for Significant Catastrophe Events\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses include estimated amounts for several\ncatastrophe and weather-related events (“CAT loss”). The magnitude and volume of losses arising from these events is\ninherently uncertain and, consequently, actual losses for these events may ultimately differ, potentially materially, from current\nestimates.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized CAT loss, net of reinsurance, of $29.5\nmillion for current year CAT loss events, driven by the Turkey earthquake, Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand, the U.S. severe\nstorms, Mexican state-owned oil platform fire, and satellite losses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the\nCompany recognized CAT loss of $39.1 million driven by $13.6 million from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and $19.5 million\nfrom hurricane Ian.\nPrior Year Reserve Development\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the estimate of net losses incurred relating to prior accident years\nincreased by $10.5 million, primarily due to the following:\n• $31.3 million adverse loss development primarily due to reserve strengthening on legacy motor (predominantly 2021\nunderwriting year), homeowners (primarily deterioration relating to Winter Storm Elliott in December 2022), and\nworkers’ compensation (2021 and prior underwriting years) contracts, coupled with a final claim settlement on a\nprofessional liability contract (2008 underwriting year).\n15\nReturn to table of contents\n• The adverse loss development was partially offset by $20.8 million favorable loss development from various prior\nyears’ property catastrophe events and better than expected loss emergence for marine and energy (predominantly\n2020 and 2022 underwriting years), group medical (2022 and prior underwriting years) and cyber contracts\n(predominantly 2021 underwriting year).\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the estimate of net losses incurred relating to prior accident years\nincreased by $1.6 million, primarily due to the following:\n• $16.3 million reserve strengthening on motor and health business (2021-2021 underwriting years); a multi-line quota\nshare program (2015, 2016-2019 underwriting years); marine and energy contracts (2020 underwriting year); and a\ncyber contract (2020 underwriting year).\n• Offsetting the above adverse loss development, the Company had favorable loss experience driven mostly by mortgage\nbusiness (2018 underwriting year), excess of loss workers’ compensation contract (2020 underwriting year) as well as\nfavorable CAT loss development relating to small catastrophe events (mainly 2020 and 2021 underwriting years) and\nCOVID-19 (2020 underwriting year) based on updated claims reporting received from cedents.\n6. RETROCESSION\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company’s earned ceded premiums were $15.3 million\nand $35.2 million, respectively (three and nine months ended September 30, 2022: $4.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively).\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, loss and loss adjustment expenses recovered and changes in losses\nrecoverable were $9.1 million and $24.8 million, respectively (three and nine months ended September 30, 2022: $2.5 million\nand $2.5 million, respectively).\nRetrocession contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to its cedents. Failure of retrocessionaires to\nhonor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. At September 30, 2023, the Company’s loss reserves recoverable\nconsisted of (i) $20.2 million (December 31, 2022: $9.5 million) recoverable from unrated retrocessionaires, of which $14.7\nmillion (December 31, 2022: $9.2 million) were secured by cash, letters of credit and collateral held in trust accounts for the\nbenefit of the Company and (ii) $8.1 million (December 31, 2022: $3.8 million) recoverable from retrocessionaires rated A- or\nabove by A.M. Best.\nThe Company regularly evaluates its net credit exposure to assess the ability of the retrocessionaires to honor their\nrespective obligations. At September 30, 2023, the Company’s allowance for expected credit losses was $0.1 million\n(December 31, 2022: $0.1 million).\n7.

Outstanding loans (“Term Loans”) under the Facility will (i) amortize in equal quarterly installments in an\naggregate annual amount equal to 5.0% of the outstanding loans and (ii) accrue interest at a rate equal to an adjusted Term\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 3.5% per annum. The Company posted $10.0 million of collateral as security\nfor the Facility. The Facility matures on August 1, 2026.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company borrowed $75.0 million from the Facility, of\nwhich $63.4 million was used to repay all of the outstanding Convertible Senior Notes (see below), with the remaining\nproceeds for general corporate purposes. On August 31, 2023, the Company hedged 50% of the floating interest rate on the\nTerm Loans (see Note 4). The interest rate on the outstanding Terms Loans was 8.9% at September 30, 2023.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants relating to the Facility at September 30, 2023.\nSenior Convertible Notes\nOn August 7, 2018, the Company issued $100.0 million of senior unsecured convertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”),\nwith a maturity date of August 1, 2023.

The conversion price was $17.19 per ordinary share of the Company.\nAs noted above, the Company fully repaid the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes on August 1, 2023, from the\nproceeds of the new Term Loans.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 the Company repurchased and canceled $nil and $17.2\nmillion of the Convertible Notes, respectively, resulting in realized gains of $nil and $0.3 million, respectively, which is\nincluded in “Other income (expense), net”, in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. As noted above,\nthe Company fully repaid the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes on August 1, 2023, from the proceeds of the new Term\nLoans.\nFinancing Costs\nThe Company incurred $0.9 million of issuance costs relating to the Credit Agreement, which are deferred and amortized\nthrough the maturity of the Facility. The remaining unamortized deferred finance costs are reported separately in the above\ntable.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized interest expense of $1.6 million and\n$3.1 million, respectively (three and nine months ended September 30, 2022: $1.1 million and $3.4 million, respectively) for\nthe above total debt, which included the interest coupon, the amortization of issuance costs and the change in fair value of the\ninterest rate swap (see Note 4).\n8.

DME II receives a performance allocation equal to (with capitalized terms having the meaning provided under the\nSILP LPA) (a) 10% of the portion of the Positive Performance Change for each limited partner’s capital account that is less\nthan or equal to the positive balance in such limited partner’s Carryforward Account, plus (b) 20% of the portion of the Positive\nPerformance Change for each limited partner’s capital account that exceeds the positive balance in such limited partner’s\nCarryforward Account. The Carryforward Account for Greenlight Re and GRIL includes the amount of investment losses to be\nrecouped, including any loss generated on the assets invested in SILP, subject to adjustments for redemptions. The loss carry-\nforward provision in the SILP LPA allows DME II to earn a reduced performance allocation of 10% of profits in years\nsubsequent to any year in which SILP has incurred a loss until all losses are recouped, and an additional amount equal to 150%\nof the loss is earned.\nIn accordance with the SILP LPA, DME Advisors constructs a levered investment portfolio as agreed by the Company\n(the “Investment Portfolio”, as defined in the SILP LPA). On September 1, 2018, SILP entered into the IAA with DME\nAdvisors, which entitles DME Advisors to a monthly management fee equal to 0.125% (1.5% on an annual basis) of each\nlimited partner’s Investment Portfolio. The IAA has an initial term ending on August 31, 2023, subject to an automatic\nextension for successive three-year terms.\nFor a detailed breakdown of management fees and performance compensation for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022 (see Note 3).\nPursuant to the SILP LPA and the IAA, the Company has agreed to indemnify DME, DME II, and DME Advisors for\nany expense, loss, liability, or damage arising out of any claim asserted or threatened in connection with DME Advisors serving\nas the Company’s or SILP’s investment advisor. The Company will reimburse DME, DME II, and DME Advisors for\nreasonable costs and expenses of investigating and defending such claims, provided such claims were not caused due to gross\nnegligence, breach of contract, or misrepresentation by DME, DME II, or DME Advisors. The Company incurred no\nindemnification amounts during the periods presented.\nGreen Brick Partners, Inc.\nDavid Einhorn also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Green Brick Partners, Inc. (“GRBK”), a\npublicly-traded company. At September 30, 2023, SILP, along with certain affiliates of DME Advisors, collectively owned\n29.1% of the issued and outstanding common shares of GRBK. Under applicable securities laws, DME Advisors may\nsometimes be limited in its ability to trade GRBK shares held in SILP. At September 30, 2023, SILP held 2.7 million shares of\nGRBK.\nService Agreement\nThe Company has entered into a service agreement with DME Advisors, pursuant to which DME Advisors provides\ncertain investor relations services to the Company for compensation of five thousand dollars per month (plus expenses). The\nagreement automatically renews annually until terminated by either the Company or DME Advisors for any reason with 30\ndays prior written notice to the other party.\nCollateral Assets Investment Management Agreement\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company (and its subsidiaries) entered into a collateral assets investment management\nagreement (the “CMA”) with DME Advisors, pursuant to which DME Advisors manages certain assets of the Company that are\nnot subject to the SILP LPA and are held by the Company to provide collateral required by the cedents in the form of trust\naccounts and letters of credit. In accordance with the CMA, DME Advisors receives no fees and is required to comply with the\ncollateral investment guidelines. The CMA can be terminated by any of the parties upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the\nother parties.\n20\nReturn to table of contents\n11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLetters of Credit and Trusts\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company had the following committed letter of credit facility:\nMaximum Termination Notice period required for\nFacility Limit Date termination\n($ in thousands)\nCitibank Europe plc $ 275,000 August 20, 2024 120 days before the termination date\nIn addition, the Company has a $14.0 million uncommitted letter of credit facility with Citibank Europe plc.\nAt September 30, 2023, an aggregate amount of $268.2 million (December 31, 2022: $203.9 million) in letters of credit\nwas issued under both the committed and uncommitted credit facilities. At September 30, 2023, the Company had pledged total\ncash and cash equivalents with a fair value in the aggregate of $269.0 million (December 31, 2022: $204.7 million) as collateral\nagainst the letters of credit issued and included in the caption “Restricted cash and cash equivalents” in the Company’s\nunaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company was in compliance with all the covenants of these facilities at\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nThe Company has also established regulatory trust arrangements for certain cedents. At September 30, 2023, collateral of\n$342.0 million (December 31, 2022: $463.7 million) was provided to cedents in the form of regulatory trust accounts and\nincluded in the caption “Restricted cash and cash equivalents” in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance\nsheets.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may be involved in formal and informal dispute\nresolution procedures, which may include arbitration or litigation. The outcomes of these procedures determine the rights and\nobligations under the Company’s reinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, the Company may\nseek to enforce its rights under an agreement or collect funds owed. In other matters, the Company may resist attempts by\nothers to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of legal disputes with certainty,\nthe Company does not believe that any existing dispute, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, or operating results.\n21\nReturn to table of contents\n12.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nReferences to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company,” or “the Company” refer to Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE”)\nand its wholly-owned subsidiaries unless the context dictates otherwise. See Item 1, Note 1 of the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for list of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. References to our “ordinary shares” refer\ncollectively to our Ordinary, Class A Ordinary, and Class B Ordinary shares.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes, which appear in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2023 and 2022 and financial condition at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nOVERVIEW\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a global specialty property and casualty (re)insurer headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with an underwriting\nand investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. Our goal is to build long-term\nshareholder value by providing risk management solutions to the insurance, reinsurance, and other risk marketplaces. We focus\non delivering risk solutions to clients and brokers who value our expertise, analytics, and customer service offerings.\nWe aim to complement our underwriting activities with a non-traditional investment approach designed to achieve\nhigher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that exclusively employ more traditional investment\nstrategies. Our investment portfolio is managed according to a value-oriented philosophy, in which our investment advisor takes\nlong positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities.\nThrough Greenlight Re Innovations (“Innovations”), we support technology innovators in the (re)insurance market by\nproviding investment capital, risk capacity, and access to a broad insurance network.\nBecause we seek to capitalize on favorable market conditions and opportunities, period-to-period comparisons of our\nunderwriting results may not be meaningful. Also, our historical investment results are not necessarily indicative of future\nperformance. Due to the nature of our reinsurance and investment strategies, our operating results will likely fluctuate from\nperiod to period.\nThe Company’s reinsurance subsidiaries hold an A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) with a stable\noutlook, which was re-affirmed by A.M. Best on September 29, 2023.\nOutlook and Trends\nWe operate in a business where we expect volatility in our underwriting result. In 2023, we have witnessed one of the\ncostliest on record for U.S. severe storms, which contributed to our CAT losses during the first half of the year. In the third\nquarter we incurred additional CAT losses from a Mexican state-owned oil platform fire and two satellite loss events.\nAccordingly, our CAT incurred losses were $13.1 million and $29.5 million, net of reinsurance, for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nWhile the global inflationary pressures have abated from their recent highs, we believe inflation continues to be a\nsignificant concern within the (re)insurance industry, as it can add uncertainty to the cost of claims, particularly for classes of\nbusiness with long payout tails. As a result, it creates pricing challenges for new business and valuation challenges in claims\nreserves. We continue to manage these concerns and risks in multiple ways:\n• Our underwriting strategy focuses on relatively short-tailed business, which is inherently less exposed to inflation than\nlong-tailed lines. We estimate the payout duration of our existing reserves at less than three years.\n• We incorporate inflation assumptions in all our pricing and reassess these assumptions frequently.\n• We are minimizing our exposure to classes that are experiencing severe supply-chain-driven inflation.\n23\nReturn to table of contents\nThe rising interest rate environment has had a mixed impact on our financial results. Our term loan is partially\nexposed to fluctuations in the SOFR interest rate. While in 2022 we experienced losses driven by fixed-income securities held\nby the Lloyd’s syndicates in which we participate, we have seen a reversal of this in 2023 as maturing fixed-income securities\nare reinvested at higher yields. In addition, the higher interest rates have improved the yield on our restricted cash and cash\nequivalents. To the extent interest rates continue to increase, we expect to see these trends continue. The SILP portfolio is\npositioned to also benefit from an inflationary environment.\nThe combination of the recent significant loss events, continued social inflation, and rising interest rates led to a\nsignificant reduction in the amount of reinsurance capital available for deployment, which in turn led to attractive market\nconditions for 2023. We expect these conditions to continue into the 2024 January renewals. We are also encouraged by the\ngrowth of our innovations portfolio and continue to find innovative ways to foster our insurtech partnerships as part of our long\nterm strategy.\nKey Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement uses certain key financial measures, some of which are not prescribed under U.S. GAAP rules and\nstandards (“non-GAAP financial measures”), to evaluate our financial performance, financial position, and the change in\nshareholder value. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in SEC Regulation G, is a numerical measure of a\ncompany’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts\nthat are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented under U.S. GAAP.\nWe believe that these measures, which may be calculated or defined differently by other companies, provide consistent and\ncomparable metrics of our business performance to help shareholders understand performance trends and facilitate a more\nthorough understanding of the Company’s business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for\nthose determined under U.S. GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this report are:\n• Basic book value per share and fully diluted book value per share; and\n• Net underwriting income (loss)\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are described below.\nBasic Book Value Per Share and Fully Diluted Book Value Per Share\nWe believe that long-term growth in fully diluted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial\nperformance because it provides management and investors a yardstick to monitor the shareholder value generated. Fully\ndiluted book value per share may also help our investors, shareholders, and other interested parties form a basis of comparison\nwith other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry. Basic book value per share and fully diluted book\nvalue per share should not be viewed as substitutes for the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nWe calculate basic book value per share as (a) ending shareholders' equity, divided by (b) aggregate of ordinary shares\nissued and outstanding, including all unvested service-based restricted shares, and the earned portion of performance-based\nrestricted shares granted after December 31, 2021. We exclude shares potentially issuable in connection with convertible notes\nif the conversion price exceeds the share price. We repaid all outstanding convertible notes on August 1, 2023 without issuing\nany shares.\nFully diluted book value per share represents basic book value per share combined with any dilutive impact of in-the-\nmoney stock options, unvested service-based RSUs, and the earned portion of unvested performance-based RSUs granted. Fully\ndiluted book value per share also includes the dilutive effect, if any, of ordinary shares expected to be issued upon settlement of\nthe convertible notes.\nOur primary financial goal is to increase fully diluted book value per share over the long term. We use fully diluted\nbook value per share as a financial measure in our annual incentive compensation.\n24\nReturn to table of contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures basic and fully diluted book value\nper share to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure:\nSeptember June 30, March 31, December September\n30, 2023 2023 2023 31, 2022 30, 2022\n($ in thousands, except per share and share amounts)\nNumerator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share:\nTotal equity (U.S. GAAP) (numerator for\nbasic and fully diluted book value per share) $ 575,865 $ 561,121 $ 510,041 $ 503,120 $ 466,952\nDenominator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share: (1)\nOrdinary shares issued and outstanding as\npresented in the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheets 35,337,407 35,272,013 35,262,678 34,824,061 34,824,061\nLess: Unearned performance-based\nrestricted shares granted after December 31,\n2021 (785,003) (820,156) (851,828) (516,489) (539,161)\nDenominator for basic book value per share 34,552,404 34,451,857 34,410,850 34,307,572 34,284,900\nAdd: In-the-money stock options, service-\nbased RSUs granted, and earned\nperformance-based RSUs granted 171,150 164,116 157,431 187,750 183,790\nDenominator for fully diluted book value\nper share 34,723,554 34,615,973 34,568,281 34,495,322 34,468,690\nBasic book value per share $ 16.67 $ 16.29 $ 14.82 $ 14.66 $ 13.62\nIncrease (decrease) in basic book value per\nshare ($) $ 0.38 $ 1.47 $ 0.16 $ 1.04 $ (0.56)\nIncrease (decrease) in basic book value per\nshare (%) 2.3 % 9.9 % 1.1 % 7.6 % (3.9) %\nFully diluted book value per share $ 16.58 $ 16.21 $ 14.75 $ 14.59 $ 13.55\nIncrease (decrease) in fully diluted book\nvalue per share ($) $ 0.37 $ 1.46 $ 0.16 $ 1.04 $ (0.55)\nIncrease (decrease) in fully diluted book\nvalue per share (%) 2.3 % 9.9 % 1.1 % 7.7 % (3.9) %\n(1) For periods prior to January 1, 2022, all unvested restricted shares are included in the “basic” and “fully diluted”\ndenominators. Restricted shares with performance-based vesting conditions granted after December 31, 2021, are included in\nthe “basic” and “fully diluted” denominators to the extent that the Company has recognized the corresponding share-based\ncompensation expense. At September 30, 2023, the aggregate number of unearned restricted shares with performance\nconditions not included in the “basic” and “fully diluted” denominators was 947,492 (June 30, 2023: 982,645, March 31, 2023:\n1,014,317, December 31, 2022: 709,638, September 30, 2022: 732,310).\nNet Underwriting Income (Loss)\nOne way that we evaluate the Company’s underwriting performance is by measuring net underwriting income (loss). We\ndo not use premiums written as a measure of performance. Net underwriting income (loss) is a performance measure used by\nmanagement to evaluate the fundamentals underlying the Company’s underwriting operations. We believe that the use of net\nunderwriting income (loss) enables investors and other users of the Company’s financial information to analyze our\nperformance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. Management also believes this measure follows\nindustry practice and allows the users of financial information to compare the Company’s performance with that of our industry\npeer group.\nNet underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used to calculate\nnet income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. We calculate net underwriting income (loss) as net premiums earned less net loss\nand loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs, underwriting expenses, and deposit interest expense. The measure excludes, on\na recurring basis: (1) investment income (loss); (2) other income (expense) not related to underwriting, including foreign\n25\nReturn to table of contents\nexchange gains or losses, and Lloyd’s interest income and expense; (3) corporate general and administrative expenses; and (4)\ninterest expense. We exclude total investment income or loss, foreign exchange gains or losses, and Lloyd’s interest income or\nexpense as we believe these items are influenced by market conditions and other factors unrelated to underwriting decisions.\nAdditionally, we exclude corporate and interest expenses because these costs are generally fixed and not incremental to or\ndirectly related to our underwriting operations. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our underwriting\nprocess, and including them could hinder the analysis of trends in our underwriting operations.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, basic book\nvalue per share increased by $0.38 per share, or 2.3%, to $16.67 per share from $16.29 per share at June 30, 2023.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, our net income was $13.5 million, compared to net loss of $18.5\nmillion reported for the equivalent 2022 period.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during the three months ended September\n30, 2023, compared to the equivalent 2022 period, are summarized below:\n• Underwriting: Our underwriting income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $14.4 million,\nwhich included CAT losses of $13.1 million during the third quarter of 2023, driven by the Mexican state-owned\noil platform fire and two satellite loss events. We reported favorable loss development of $3.3 million driven\nprimarily by property, marine and energy business, partially offset by adverse development relating to motor,\nworkers’ compensation, and professional liability business. By comparison, the equivalent period in 2022 reported\nan underwriting loss of $18.9 million, which included $25.9 million of CAT losses, primarily related to $19.5\nmillion from Hurricane Ian and $3.2 million from Typhoons Nanmadol and Hinnamnor. Additionally, the\nunderwriting loss in the comparable period in 2022 included $6.1 million of interest expense relating to deposit-\naccounted contracts that did not meet the risk transfer condition for reinsurance accounting under U.S. GAAP.\nOur combined ratio was 91.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 115.4% during the\nequivalent 2022 period. The significant improvement in our combined ratio was driven mainly by 18.1 points\nimprovement in loss ratio mainly due to lower CAT events, coupled with 4.7 points decrease in underwriting\nexpense ratio driven by lower interest expense relating to deposit-accounted contracts.\n• Investments: Our total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was $5.1 million,\ncompared to total investment income of $11.6 million reported for the same period in 2022. Our investment in\nSILP reported a loss of $1.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a gain of\n$8.5 million during the equivalent period in 2022. Other investment income from our Innovation investments and\ninterest earned from our restricted cash and cash equivalents and Funds at Lloyd’s (“FAL”) cash positions totaled\n$7.0 million and $3.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nincrease in other investment income was driven primarily by increase in short-term yields as a result of the U.S.\ncentral bank hiking its benchmark borrowing rate from 5.00% to 5.25% during the quarter.\n• Other (income) expense: For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred other expense of $1.3\nmillion, compared to $6.8 million for the same quarter in 2022. The favorable change was driven primarily by:\n◦ $3.0 million of lower foreign exchange losses, due mainly to a lesser weakening of the U.S. dollar\nagainst the pound sterling; and\n◦ our share of Lloyd’s syndicates’ investment income on FAL business, which is generally conducted on a\nfunds withheld basis. The Lloyd’s syndicates invest a portion of these funds in fixed-maturity securities\nand investment funds. We record our share of the investment income and mark-to-market adjustments of\nthese fixed maturity securities when the syndicates report them to us, generally one quarter in arrears.\n28\nReturn to table of contents\nNine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, fully diluted book value per share increased by $1.99, or 13.6%, to\n$16.58 per share from $14.59 per share at December 31, 2022. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, basic book\nvalue per share increased by $2.01, or 13.7%, to $16.67 per share from $14.66 per share at December 31, 2022.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net income was $69.2 million, compared to net loss of $9.4\nmillion reported for the equivalent 2022 period.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during the nine months ended September\n30, 2023, compared to the equivalent 2022 period, are summarized below:\n• Underwriting: Our underwriting income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was $20.2 million,\nwhich was negatively impacted by $29.5 million of total CAT losses in 2023 including the Turkey earthquake,\nCyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand, the U.S. severe storms, the Mexican state-owned oil platform fire, and the two\nsatellite losses. Additionally, we incurred $10.5 million of adverse loss development on prior years’ contracts. By\ncomparison, our underwriting loss for the equivalent period in 2022 was $17.2 million, which was negatively\nimpacted by $42.3 million of CAT losses including $13.6 million related to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and\n$25.4 million related to Hurricane Ian, Typhoon Nanmadol and Hinnamnor, and Tennessee wildfires.\nAdditionally, we incurred $1.6 million of adverse loss development on prior year’s contracts during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022.\nOur combined ratio was 95.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 104.8% for the same\nperiod in 2022. This favorable change was primarily due to our loss ratio improving by 6.8 points due to lower\nCAT losses, net of 2.0 points increase from prior year adverse loss development compared to 2022. Additionally,\nour underwriting expense ratio improved by 1.3 points for the same reason noted above for the quarter.\n• Investments: Our total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was $52.5 million,\ncompared to $36.5 million earned during the equivalent 2022 period. For the nine months ended September 30,\n2023, our investment in SILP reported a gain of $27.8 million, compared to a gain of $24.5 million during the\nequivalent period in 2022. Other investment income totaled $24.7 million and $12.0 million during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The increase in other investment income was driven\nprimarily by increase in short-term yields as previously noted.\n• Other income (expense): For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, other income was $13.4 million\ncompared to other expense of $13.4 million. The favorable change was driven primarily by the same reasons\nexplained above for the quarter, including $18.0 million favorable foreign exchange movement.\nUnderwriting Results by Segment\nThere was no change to our operating segment since December 31, 2022.\nThe following provides a further discussion of our underwriting results for our Property & Casualty (Re)insurance\noperating segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\n29\nReturn to table of contents\nGross Premiums Written\nDetails of gross premiums written are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n($ in thousands) ($ in thousands)\nProperty $ 32,940 18.0 % $ 20,021 12.9 % $ 94,660 18.0 % $ 58,841 13.5 %\nCasualty 108,964 59.5 91,240 58.8 284,560 54.3 248,231 57.0\nOther 41,170 22.5 43,885 28.3 145,252 27.7 128,740 29.5\nTotal $ 183,074 100.0 % $ 155,146 100.0 % $ 524,472 100.0 % $ 435,812 100.0 %\nAs a result of our underwriting philosophy, the total premiums we write and the mix of premiums between property,\ncasualty, and other business, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the market opportunities we identify.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, our gross premiums written increased by $27.9 million, or 18.0%,\ncompared to the equivalent 2022 period. The following table provides a further analysis of this overall increase:\nGross Premiums Written\nThree months ended September 30, 2023\nIncrease\n(decrease) % change Explanation\n($ in millions)\nProperty $12.9 64.5% The increase was driven from growth in our Commercial class, mainly due to\nnew quota share treaties bound in mid-2022 and new insurance contracts via\nSyndicate 3456 in 2023. This resulted in a change in business mix for Property,\nwith Commercial and Personal accounting for 49% and 51%, respectively, of\ntotal Property compared to 11% and 88%, respectively, for the same quarter in\n2022.\nCasualty $17.7 19.4% The increase was driven mainly from growth in General Liability from new\ncontracts and premiums written from quota share treaties bound in 2022. This\ngrowth was partially offset by a reduction in the Workers’ Compensation class,\nwhere we have significantly reduced appetite for quota share treaties beginning\nin 2022, coupled with a marginal premium decrease in the Multi-line class.\nAs a result, the business mix within our Casualty line of business has changed\nsignificantly with General Liability and Multi-line classes accounting for 29%\nand 62% of total Casualty, respectively, compared to 15% and 76% in same\nperiod in 2022.\nOther $(2.7) (6.2)% The decrease was driven mainly by our decision to non-renew certain Accident\n& Health programs, coupled with lower premium written for our Financial\nclass. The reduction in Financial premium was predominantly due to lower\nmerger and acquisition activity in 2023 impacting premium from transactional\nliability programs and lower mortgage origination volumes in 2023 due to\nsurging mortgage rates. This was partially offset by premium growth in the\nOther Specialty class, driven by favorable pricing and new contracts.\n30\nReturn to table of contents\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our gross premiums written increased by $88.7 million, or 20.3%,\ncompared to the equivalent 2022 period.

This was partially\noffset by a reduction in Accident & Health and Financial classes for the same\nreasons as noted above. The decrease was also due partially to $4.4 million\npremium estimate reduction recorded earlier in 2023 relating to a transactional\nliability program bound in 2022 within our Financial class.\nAs a result, the change in business mix was follows: Other Specialty, Financial,\nand Marine represented 46%, 33%, and 17%, respectively, compared to 34%,\n44%, and 14%, respectively, for the same period in 2022.\nPremiums Ceded\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, premiums ceded were $14.8 million, or 8.1% of gross premiums\nwritten, compared to $8.8 million, or 5.7% of gross premiums written, for the same quarter in 2022. The increase was primarily\ndue to an increase in quota share retrocessions for Property and Casualty, driven by growth from inward premiums.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, premiums ceded were $35.7 million, or 6.8% of gross premiums\nwritten, compared to $22.0 million, or 5.0% of gross premiums written for the period in 2022. The increase was driven mostly\nfor the same reason noted above, in addition to an aviation quota share retrocession coverage purchased during the second\nquarter of 2023 as well as an additional $10.0 million excess of loss coverage purchased during the first quarter of 2023 to\nmanage our exposure to marine and energy.\nNet Premiums Written\nDetails of net premiums written are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n($ in thousands) ($ in thousands)\nProperty $ 24,771 14.7 % $ 15,486 10.6 % $ 77,397 15.8 % $ 48,517 11.7 %\nCasualty 103,542 61.5 88,002 60.1 275,578 56.4 242,369 58.6\nOther 39,972 23.8 42,857 29.3 135,757 27.8 122,953 29.7\nTotal $ 168,285 100.0 % $ 146,345 100.0 % $ 488,732 100.0 % $ 413,839 100.0 %\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 net premiums written increased by $21.9 million, or 15.0%,\nand by $74.9 million or 18.1%, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.

The\nacquisition cost ratios by line of business were as follows:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\nIncrease / Increase /\n(decrease) in (decrease) in\nacquisition cost acquisition cost\n2023 2022 ratio points 2023 2022 ratio points\nProperty 17.7 % 19.0 % (1.3) % 18.5 % 22.6 % (4.1) %\nCasualty 31.9 31.6 0.3 31.0 28.6 2.4\nOther 28.2 30.6 (2.4) 28.2 34.8 (6.6)\nTotal 28.8 % 30.2 % (1.4) % 28.4 % 29.6 % (1.2) %\nThe changes in the acquisition cost ratios for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to the equivalent\nperiod in 2022, were attributable to the following:\nChange in Acquisition Cost Ratios\nThree months ended September 30, 2023\nIncrease / (decrease)\nin acquisition cost Explanation\nratio points\nProperty (1.3)% The decrease was due primarily to the higher proportion of excess of loss contracts which\nhave a lower ceding commission rate than proportional treaties. Based on net premiums\nearned for Property, excess of loss contracts accounted for 14% compared to 12% for the\nsame quarter in 2022.\nCasualty 0.3 The marginal increase was due mainly to changes in our business mix, particularly with an\nincrease in earned premiums from General Liability and Multi-Line (including FAL)\nclasses, which both have a higher ceding commission than the Workers’ Compensation\nbusiness.\nOther (2.4) The decrease was driven primarily by change in business mix, coupled with a higher\nproportion of excess of loss contracts than proportional treaties.

G&A expenses included $1.3 million and $1.2 million, of costs related to share-based compensation granted to\nemployees and directors for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The reversal of share-based\ncompensation relating to forfeited stock awards was insignificant for both periods.\n36\nReturn to table of contents\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, G&A expenses increased by $5.1 million, or 22.6%, compared to the\nequivalent 2022 period, predominantly due to the 40.0% increase in underwriting expenses as previously noted. Corporate\nexpenses increased by 8.9% driven mainly by the increase in personnel costs, including severance costs for our former CFO\nand an increase in accrued incentive compensation costs in light of the Company’s performance in 2023. The incentive\ncompensation cost for the comparative period in 2022 was nil due to the losses suffered in the period. The increase in corporate\nexpenses was partially offset by lower D&O insurance and legal fees. G&A expenses included $3.5 million (net of $0.3 million\nforfeiture credit) and $3.3 million (net of insignificant forfeiture credit), for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, of costs related to share-based compensation granted to employees and directors.\nTotal Investment Income (Loss)\nTotal investment income (loss) incorporates (i) changes in the net asset value of our investment in SILP managed by\nDME Advisors, (ii) interest income earned on the restricted cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral to our clients, and\n(iii) gains (or losses) and interest on our portfolio of strategic and Innovations investments. We expect our total investment\nincome, including any change in the net asset value of our investment in SILP, to fluctuate from period to period.\nA summary of our total investment income (loss) is as follows for the respective periods::\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n($ in thousands)\nInterest and dividend income, net of withholding\ntaxes and other expenses 9,513 2,741 27,004 2,908\nChange in unrealized gains and losses relating to\nInnovations-related investees (2,530) 54 (1,474) 9,237\nInvestment-related foreign exchange gains (losses) (25) 243 (25) (167)\nRealized gains (losses) relating to Innovations-\nrelated investees — — (800) —\nNet investment-related income (loss) $ 6,958 $ 3,038 $ 24,705 $ 11,978\nIncome (loss) from investments in related party\ninvestment fund (1,853) 8,521 27,791 24,474\nTotal investment income (loss) $ 5,105 $ 11,559 $ 52,496 $ 36,452\nNet investment-related income (loss)\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, our net investment-related income increased by $3.9 million or\n129.0% compared to same period in 2022 mainly due to the increase in interest income, primarily from our restricted cash and\ncash equivalents which benefited from rising U.S. interest rates. The U.S. central bank hiked its benchmark borrowing rate 11\ntimes for a total of 5.25 percentage points since March 2022. Partially offsetting this increase, we recognized $2.5 million\nunrealized losses on our Innovations-related investment as a result of recently completed financing rounds by some of our\nInnovations investees compared to a small unrealized gain in the same period in 2022.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our net investment-related income increased by $12.7 million or\n106.3% compared to the same period in 2023 for the same explanation as noted above. In 2022, our Innovations-related\ninvestment benefited from significant unrealized gains driven by favorable pricing conditions from completed financing rounds\nby some of our Innovations investees.\nIncome from investment in SILP\nThe caption “Income (loss) from investments in related party investment fund” in the above table is net of\nmanagement fees paid by SILP to DME Advisors and performance compensation, if any, allocated from the Company’s\ninvestment in SILP to DME II. No performance compensation is allocated in periods of loss reported by SILP. For further\ninformation about management fees and performance compensation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023\nand 2022, refer to Note 3 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Investment Portfolio managed by DME Advisors reported a loss\nof 0.6%, compared to a gain of 3.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. SILP’s long portfolio lost 4.1%, the short\n37\nReturn to table of contents\nportfolio gained 1.7%, and macro positions gained 2.8%, during the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, the significant contributors to SILP’s investment return were long positions in CONSOL\nEnergy Inc. (CEIX), Capri Holdings as well as from a S&P 500 U.S. interest rate derivative position. The largest detractors\nwere long positions in Green Brick Partners (GRBK) and Tenet Healthcare Corp. as well as one single-name short position.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Investment Portfolio managed by DME Advisors reported a gain\nof 9.1%, compared to a gain of 10.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The long portfolio and macro positions\ngained 22.8% and 2.6%, respectively, while the short portfolio lost 12.8% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe most significant contributors to SILP’s investment return for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were long\npositions in GRBK, CEIX, and U.S. interest rate derivative positions. For the same period, the most significant detractors were\nthe hedge position for our GRBK exposure and two single-name short positions.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the gross investment return (loss) on our\ninvestments managed by DME Advisors (excluding the investment advisor performance allocation) was composed of the\nfollowing:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nLong portfolio gains (losses) (4.1) % 6.0 % 22.8 % (10.5) %\nShort portfolio gains (losses) 1.7 (0.1) (12.8) 21.1\nMacro gains (losses) 2.8 (1.4) 2.6 2.6\nOther income and expenses 1 (1.0) (0.5) (2.5) (1.5)\nGross investment return (0.6) % 4.0 % 10.1 % 11.7 %\nNet investment return 1 (0.6) % 3.6 % 9.1 % 10.5 %\n1 “Other income and expenses” excludes performance compensation but includes management fees. “Net investment return”\nincorporates both of these amounts.\nThe investment performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 reflects the Investment Portfolio\ncalculated based on 50% of GLRE Surplus, or the Company's shareholders' equity, as reported in the Company’s then most\nrecent quarterly U.S. GAAP financial statements adjusted monthly for our share of the net profits and net losses reported by\nSILP during any intervening period (the “adjusted GLRE Surplus”). Effective January 1, 2023, the Investment Portfolio is\ncalculated based on 60% of adjusted GLRE Surplus.\nEach month, we post on our website (www.greenlightre.com) the returns from our investment in SILP.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nTotal investments\nThe total investments at September 30, 2023 was $296.6 million, compared to $248.5 million at December 31, 2022, an\nincrease of $48.2 million, or 19.4%. The increase was primarily driven by strong performance from our SILP portfolio, coupled\nwith net contributions in SILP and new Innovation investments. This was partially offset by the redemption of a matured term\ndeposit.\nAt September 30, 2023, 93.3% of SILP’s portfolio was valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets (Level\n1), 5.0% was composed of instruments valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2), and a nominal\namount was composed of instruments valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). At September 30, 2023, 1.7% of SILP’s\nportfolio consisted of private equity funds valued using the funds’ net asset values as a practical expedient.\nAt September 30, 2023, 82.8% of our Innovations-related portfolio was carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,\nmeasured as of the investees’ most recently completed financing round, and 17.2% was carried at the original cost.\nOther than our investment in SILP (see Note 3 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements), we have not participated in transactions that created relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial\npartnerships, including VIEs, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements.\n38\nReturn to table of contents\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\nWe use our restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily for funding trusts and letters of credit issued to our ceding\ninsurers. Our restricted cash decreased by $45.7 million, or 6.8%, from $668.3 million at December 31, 2022, to $622.6 million\nat September 30, 2023, primarily due to release of collateral from our ceding insurers relating to legacy contracts in run-off.\nThis was partially offset by the $10.0 million collateral pledged as security for the new Facility (see “Debt” below).\nReinsurance balances receivable\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, reinsurance balances receivable increased by $134.8 million, or\n26.7%, to $640.4 million from $505.6 million at December 31, 2022. This increase was related partially to funds withheld by\ncedents. At September 30, 2023, funds held by cedents were $422.4 million, compared to $337.4 million at December 31, 2022.\nFunds withheld predominantly relate to premiums withheld by Lloyd’s syndicates and funds contributed by the Company to\nLloyd's as security for members’ underwriting activities. The remaining increase related to premiums receivable on new\ncontracts bound, net of collections, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves; Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Recoverable\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses were composed of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCase Case\nReserves IBNR Total Reserves IBNR Total\n($ in thousands)\nProperty $ 25,528 $ 50,866 $ 76,394 $ 20,354 $ 41,361 $ 61,715\nCasualty 141,446 281,814 423,260 146,702 227,979 374,681\nOther 23,147 135,433 158,580 17,700 101,372 119,072\nTotal $ 190,121 $ 468,113 $ 658,234 $ 184,756 $ 370,712 $ 555,468\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the total gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves increased\nby $102.8 million, or 18.5%, to $658.2 million from $555.5 million at December 31, 2022. See Note 5 of the accompanying\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a summary of changes in outstanding loss and loss adjustment\nexpense reserves and a description of prior period loss developments.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the total loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable increased\nby $15.0 million, or 112.9%, to $28.2 million from $13.2 million at December 31, 2022. See Note 6 of the accompanying\nunaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of the credit risk associated with our retrocessionaires.\nAt October 1, 2023, our estimated largest probable maximum loss (net of retrocession and reinstatement premiums) at\na 1-in-250 year return period for a single event and in aggregate was $80.3 million and $87.7 million, respectively, both relating\nto the peril of North Atlantic Hurricane, compared to $77.5 million and $83.5 million, respectively, at January 1, 2023.\n39\nReturn to table of contents\nThe below table contains the expected modeled loss for each of our peak peril regions and sub-regions, for both a\nsingle event loss and aggregate loss measures at the 1-in-250 year return period.\nOctober 1, 2023\nNet 1-in-250 Year Return Period\nPeril Single Event Loss Aggregate Loss\n($ in thousands)\nNorth Atlantic Hurricane $ 80,342 $ 87,719\nSoutheast Hurricane 66,060 67,584\nGulf of Mexico Hurricane 52,287 57,682\nNortheast Hurricane 52,968 52,968\nNorth America Earthquake 69,819 74,519\nCalifornia Earthquake 63,401 67,233\nOther N.A.

During 2023, we repurchased $17.2 million of Convertible Notes for a marginal\nrealized gain. Further, we repaid the remaining $63.4 million Convertible Notes, including accrued interest, which matured on\nAugust 1, 2023. To repay this debt, we entered into a $75.0 million Facility with a group of banks, for which CIBC Bank USA\nis acting as administrative agent. In connection with this Facility, we contractually agreed to hedge 50% of the floating rate\nTerms Loans for the duration of the Facility. Refer to Notes 4 and 7 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements for further information on the interest rate swaps used for hedging purposes and the material terms and\nconditions of the Facility, respectively.\nTotal shareholders’ equity\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased by $72.7 million to $575.9 million at September 30, 2023, compared to $503.1\nmillion at December 31, 2022. The increase in shareholders’ equity during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was\nprimarily due to the net income of $69.2 million reported for the period. For details of other movements in shareholders’ equity,\nsee the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity.\n40\nReturn to table of contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe anticipate positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) to be sufficient to\ncover cash outflows under most loss scenarios in the near term. Based on expected cash flows from operations, financing\narrangements and redemptions from related party investment fund as needed, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover\nour working capital requirements and other contractual obligations and commitments through the foreseeable future. Refer to\nthe “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section included in Item 7 of our 2022 Form 10-K for a general discussion of liquidity\nand capital resources. The following provides an update on material changes to our liquidity and capital resources during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of funds for the respective periods:\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30\n2023 2022 Change\n($ in thousands)\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (14,630) $ (27,424) $ 12,794\nInvesting activities (22,548) 4,239 (26,787)\nFinancing activities (5,292) (6,419) 1,127\nEffect of currency exchange on cash(1) (152) (322) 170\nNet cash inflows (outflows) (42,622) (29,926) (12,696)\nCash, beginning of period 706,548 711,101 (4,553)\nCash, end of period $ 663,926 $ 681,175 $ (17,249)\n(1) Cash includes unrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents - see Note 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nCash used in operating activities\nThe lower use of cash in our operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 over the same period\nin 2022 was driven mainly by stronger operating performance, coupled with the ebb and flow from our underwriting activities,\nwhich may vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of business, the nature of underwriting opportunities\navailable and volume of claims submitted to us by our cedents.\nCash used by investing activities\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we made net contributions of $23.0 million into SILP compared to\nnet redemptions from SILP of $12.9 million during the same period in 2022, which contributed mostly to the $26.8 million\nincrease in cash used by investing activities. Partially offsetting this increase, we invested $3.1 million less in Innovations\ninvestments for the same period in 2022, coupled with $6.0 million proceeds from a matured term deposit.\nCash used in financing activities\nThe decrease in cash used in our financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 over the same\nperiod in 2022 was due to drawing fully on the new $75.0 million Facility, offset by the repayment of the remaining\nConvertible Notes on August 1, 2023, in addition to the partial repurchase of these Convertible Notes at a discount earlier in\n2023.\nCash at September 30, 2023\nAs a result of the above activities, coupled with the foreign exchange rate adjustment on foreign cash, our consolidated\ncash position declined to $663.9 million at September 30, 2023, from $706.5 million at December 31, 2022.\n41\nReturn to table of contents\nLetters of Credit and Trust Arrangements\nSee Note 11 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for details on the committed\nand uncommitted letter of credit facilities. We provide collateral to cedents in the form of letters of credit and trust\narrangements. At September 30, 2023, the aggregate amount of collateral provided to cedents under such arrangements was\n$610.2 million (December 31, 2022: $667.6 million). At September 30, 2023, the letters of credit and trust accounts were\nsecured by restricted cash and cash equivalents with a total fair value of $610.9 million (December 31, 2022: $668.3 million).\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nSince December 31, 2022, the material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments at September 30, 2023\nwere as follows:\nLess than More than\nPayment due: 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total\n($ in thousands)\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves (1) $ 326,484 $ 195,495 $ 74,380 $ 61,874 $ 658,234\n(1) Due to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance contractual\nliabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain.\nAdditionally, we have related party commitments as disclosed in Note 11 of the unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements. At September 30, 2023, we estimate the reduced performance allocation of 10% to continue to be applied\nuntil SILP achieves additional investment returns of 117%, at which point the performance allocation will revert to 20%. For\ndetailed breakdowns of management fees and performance compensation for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023 and 2022, refer to Note 3 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nCapital\nOur capital structure currently consists of debt and equity issued in Ordinary shares - see Financial Condition for\nfurther details.\nOn July 25, 2023, at the Company’s Annual General Meeting, the shareholders approved the re-designation of Class B\nOrdinary shares as Class A Ordinary shares, and the reclassification of Class A Ordinary shares as “Ordinary shares,” resulting\nin the elimination of the dual-class share structure. At September 30, 2023, there were 35,337,407 outstanding Ordinary shares.\nWe expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business\nstrategy for the foreseeable future. However, to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we\nrequire additional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, we have\nfiled a Form S-3 registration statement, which expires in July 2024.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and\nhave required management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including\nthose described in “Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our 2022 Form 10-K, cause actual events or results to differ\nmaterially from our underlying assumptions or estimates. In that case, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of\noperations, financial condition, or liquidity. The most significant estimates relate to: premium revenues and risk transfer, loss\nand loss adjustment expense reserves, investment impairments, allowances for credit losses, and share-based compensation.\nWe believe that the critical accounting estimates discussion in “Part II. Item 7. — Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results on Operations” of our 2022 Form 10-K continues to describe the significant\nestimates and judgments included in the preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\n42\nReturn to table of contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAt September 30, 2023, there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that\nwe expect could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION\nThere is no material change to our prior disclosure provided in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe believe we are principally exposed to the following types of market risk:\n•\nequity price risk;\n•\ncommodity price risk;\n•\nforeign currency risk;\n•\ninterest rate risk;\n•\ncredit risk; and\n•\npolitical risk.\nSee “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in our 2022 Form 10-K, for a\ndiscussion of our exposure to these risks. The following is an update of the material changes in our exposure to market risk at\nSeptember 30, 2023 since December 31, 2022:\nEquity Price Risk\nAt September 30, 2023, a 10% decline in the price of each of the underlying listed equity securities and equity-based\nderivative instruments would result in a $10.5 million loss to our Investment Portfolio and $3.5 million loss to our proportionate\nshare of the equity exposure held by the Lloyd’s syndicates.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe following table summarizes the net impact that a 10% increase and decrease in commodity prices would have on\nthe value of our Investment Portfolio at September 30, 2023. The below table excludes the indirect effect that changes in\ncommodity prices might have on equity securities in our Investment Portfolio.\n10% increase in 10% decrease in\ncommodity prices commodity prices\nChange in Change in\nCommodity fair value fair value\n($ in millions)\nGold $ 3.3 $ (3.3)\nSilver 0.3 (0.3)\nUranium 0.6 (0.6)\nCrude oil 0.3 (0.3)\nTotal $ 4.5 $ (4.5)\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe following table summarizes the net impact of a hypothetical 10% currency rate movement relating to our main\nforeign denominated reinsurance net liabilities (including balances held at Lloyd's) at September 30, 2023:\n43\nReturn to table of contents\n10% increase in 10% decrease in\nCurrency Net Exposure currency rate currency rate\n($ in thousands)\nGBP £ 10,263 $ 1,252 $ (1,252)\nEuro € (12,547) (1,326) 1,326\nTotal foreign exchange loss (gain) $ (74) $ 74\nAdditionally, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would have no\nmeaningful impact on the value of our Investment Portfolio at September 30, 2023.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThere was no material change in our exposure to interest rate risk at September 30, 2023 since December 31, 2022,\nexcept for:\n• Our Term Loans are subject to interest rate variability based on SOFR plus 3.5% per annum, of which 50% is hedged\nby interest rate swaps. At September 30, 2023, a 100 basis points change (increase or decrease) in interest rates would\nresult in a $0.4 million change to our interest expense for the unhedged portion of the Term Loans.\n• Our investment in SILP includes interest-rate sensitive securities, such as corporate and sovereign debt instruments\nand interest rate derivatives. At September 30, 2023, a 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would\nresult in a $12.0 million gain or a $11.9 million loss, respectively, to our Investment Portfolio.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in such rules) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports prepared in accordance with the rules and\nregulations of the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules\nand forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These\ninherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur\nbecause of simple error or mistake.\nAdditionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,\nor by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its\nstated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,\nor the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-\neffective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n44\nReturn to table of contents\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal controls\nover financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the\nCompany’s systems evolve with its business.\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, we may be involved in formal and informal dispute resolution\nprocedures, which may include arbitration or litigation, the outcomes of which determine our rights and obligations under our\nreinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, we may seek to enforce our rights under an\nagreement or to collect funds owing to us. In other matters, we may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged\nrights. While the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of our existing\ncontractual disputes, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFactors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report are any of the risks described in\n“Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our 2022 Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2023. Any of these factors\ncould result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors\nnot presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2023, there have been no other material changes to the risk factors disclosed in “Part I. Item 1A.\nRisk Factors” included in our 2022 Form 10-K. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from\ntime to time in our future filings with the SEC.\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a share repurchase plan authorizing the Company to repurchase ordinary shares.\nFrom time to time, the repurchase plan has been re-approved or modified at the election of our Board of Directors. On May 2,\n2023, the Board of Directors re-approved the share repurchase plan effective from July 1, 2023, until June 30, 2024, authorizing\nthe Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million of ordinary shares or securities convertible into ordinary shares in the open\nmarket, through privately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans (as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-\nK).\nThe Company is not required to repurchase any ordinary shares and the repurchase plan may be modified, suspended or\nterminated at any time without prior notice. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, there was no repurchase of ordinary\nshares.\nItem 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nItem 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. OTHER INFORMATION\n(c) Insider Trading Arrangements and Related Disclosures\n45\nReturn to table of contents\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, we did not have any “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements” or any “non-\nRule 10b5-1 arrangements” (in each case, as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K) in place for our directors and officers.\nItem 6.

(“Greenlight Capital Re,” “Company,” “us,” “we,”\nor “our”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ,\nand Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements, other than\nstatements of historical facts included in this report, including statements regarding estimates, projections, statements relating to\nour business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are\n“forward-looking statements”. We intend these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for\nforward-looking statements in the United States (“U.S.”) federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements generally\nare identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “predict,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,”\n“should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements\nare not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections, and various assumptions, many of\nwhich, are inherently uncertain and beyond management’s control. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from the\nforward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially\nfrom those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n● Our results of operations fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\n● The impact of general economic, capital and credit market conditions, including banking sector instability, financial\nmarket illiquidity and fluctuations in interest rates, equity securities’ prices and/or foreign currency exchange rates.\n● A downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement\nour business strategy.\n● Any suspension or revocation of any of our licenses would materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n● Our investment performance depends in part on the performance of Solasglas Investments, LP (“SILP”) and may\nsuffer as a result of adverse financial market developments or other factors that impact SILP’s liquidity, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our investment results, financial condition and results of operations.\n● The carry values of our investments made under our Greenlight Re Innovations pillar, which focuses on developing a\nrange of risk products via strategic partnerships and other methods to access fee income, a stream of underwriting\nbusiness, and investment upside potential (“Innovations”), may differ significantly from those that would be used if\nwe carried these investments at fair value.\n● Our level of debt may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, restrict our current and future operations, particularly\nour ability to respond to business opportunities, and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry\nconditions.\n● Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd. (“Greenlight Re”), and/or Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland,\nDesignated Activity Company (“GRIL”) may be subject to United States federal income taxation.\n● The other matters set forth in the section entitled “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2023.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new\ninformation, future events, or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements,\nwhich speak only to the dates they were made.\nWe intend to communicate certain events that we believe may have a material adverse impact on our operations or\nfinancial position, including property and casualty catastrophic events and material losses in our investment portfolio, in a\ntimely manner through a public announcement. Other than as required by the Exchange Act, we do not intend to make public\nannouncements regarding reinsurance or investment events that we do not believe, based on management’s estimates and\ncurrent information, will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.\n3\nReturn to table of contents\nItem 1.

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE” and, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company”) was\nincorporated as an exempted company under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands on July 13, 2004. The Company’s\nwholly-owned subsidiaries are described below:\n• Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Greenlight Re”), domiciled in the Cayman Islands, is a Class D insurer license\nissued in accordance with the terms of The Insurance Act, 2010 (as amended) and underlying regulations thereto (the\n“Act”) and is subject to regulation by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. Greenlight Re commenced\nunderwriting in April 2006.\n• Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company (“GRIL”), domiciled in Ireland since 2010, is\nauthorized as a non-life reinsurance undertaking in accordance with the provisions of the European Union (Insurance\nand Reinsurance) Regulations 2015. GRIL provides multi-line property and casualty reinsurance capacity to the\nEuropean broker market and provides GLRE with an additional platform to serve clients located in Europe and North\nAmerica.\n• Greenlight Re Marketing (UK) Limited, domiciled in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) since 2020, is a U.K.\ncompany formed to expand GLRE’s presence in the Lloyd’s of London market (“Lloyd’s”).\n• Greenlight Re Corporate Member Ltd., domiciled in the U.K. since 2014, is a corporate member that became\na wholly-owned subsidiary of GLRE in 2023 and provides underwriting capacity for various Lloyd’s syndicates,\nincluding Syndicate 3456.\n• Verdant Holding Company, Ltd., domiciled in the United States since 2008, is an investment holding\ncompany.\nAdditionally, through Greenlight Innovation Syndicate 3456 (“Syndicate 3456”), Greenlight Re provides a (re)insurance\nplatform to its growing portfolio of insurtech partnerships. Domiciled in the U.K. since 2022, Syndicate 3456 is authorized to\nunderwrite under the Lloyd’s syndicate-in-a-box model.\nThe Class A ordinary shares of GLRE are listed on Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE.”\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information, and with the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.\nAccordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2022, as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2023. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include GLRE and\nits wholly-owned subsidiaries and all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on\nconsolidation.\nIn the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments\n(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and\nresults of operations as at the end of and for the periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results for a full year.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in its Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n8\nReturn to table of contents\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The significant estimates reflected in the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves,\npremiums written, earned, and receivable, variability underlying risk transfer assessments, allowances for credit losses, share-\nbased compensation, valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets and investment impairments.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Restricted Cash Equivalents\nThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances to collateralize regulatory trusts and letters of credit issued to\ncedents (see Note 11). The following table reconciles the cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the\nunaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets to the total presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of\ncash flows:\nJune 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\n($ in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 55,597 $ 38,238\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents 627,734 668,310\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of unaudited cash flows $ 683,331 $ 706,548\nFunds Held by Cedents\nThe caption “Reinsurance balances receivable” in the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets\nincludes financial assets held by cedents. At June 30, 2023, funds held by cedents were $404.9 million (December 31, 2022:\n$337.4 million). Such amounts include premiums withheld by Lloyd’s syndicates and funds contributed by the Company to\nLloyd's as security for members’ underwriting activities. The Lloyd’s syndicates invest a portion of the premiums withheld in\ninvestment funds and fixed-maturity securities. The Company records its share of income (or expense) from these assets, in its\nunaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption “Other income (expense)” as reported by the\nsyndicates on a quarterly lag basis due to the timing of the availability of these quarterly financial reports.\nDeposit Assets and Liabilities\nAt June 30, 2023, deposit assets and liabilities were $3.0 million and $6.9 million, respectively (December 31, 2022:\n$3.1 million and $10.7 million, respectively). For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the interest income\n(expense) on deposit-accounted contracts were as follows:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n($ in thousands) ($ in thousands)\nDeposit interest income $ — $ — $ — $ —\nDeposit interest expense $ (235) $ (191) $ (367) $ (225)\nDeposit interest income (expense), net $ (235) $ (191) $ (367) $ (225)\nForeign Exchange\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, $4.7 million and $9.7 million (three and six months ended June 30,\n2022: $(4.3) million and $(5.4) million), respectively, of foreign exchange gains (losses) were included in the Company’s net\nincome in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption of “Other income (expense), net”.\n9\nReturn to table of contents\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) and weighted average shares used in computing basic and diluted net\nincome (loss) per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 (expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars,\nexcept per share and share amounts):\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nNumerator for earnings per share\nNet income (loss) - basic $ 49,860 $ 14,788 $ 55,747 $ 9,061\nAdd: interest on convertible notes 744 — 1,520 —\nLess: gain on debt repurchases $ — $ — (265) —\nNet income (loss) - diluted $ 50,604 $ 14,788 $ 57,002 $ 9,061\nDenominator for earnings per share\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 34,070,818 33,871,359 34,065,066 33,861,151\nEffect of dilutive employee and director share-based awards 580,494 421,611 534,958 313,733\nShares potentially issuable in connection with convertible notes 3,615,825 5,818,182 3,722,897 5,818,182\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 38,267,137 40,111,152 38,322,921 39,993,066\nAnti-dilutive stock options outstanding 690,337 735,627 690,337 735,627\nEarnings (loss) per Class A and Class B ordinary share:\nBasic $ 1.46 $ 0.44 $ 1.64 $ 0.27\nDiluted $ 1.32 $ 0.37 $ 1.49 $ 0.23\n3. INVESTMENT IN RELATED PARTY INVESTMENT FUND\nThe Company has entered into the Second Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement (the “SILP\nLPA”) of Solasglas Investments, LP (“SILP”), with DME Advisors II, LLC (“DME II”), as General Partner, Greenlight Re, and\nGRIL, (together, the “GLRE Limited Partners”). SILP has entered into a SILP investment advisory agreement (“IAA”) with\nDME Advisors. LP (“DME Advisors”), pursuant to which DME Advisors is the investment manager for SILP. DME II and\nDME Advisors are related to the Company, and each is an affiliate of David Einhorn, Chairman of the Company’s Board of\nDirectors (the “Chairman”).\nAt June 30, 2023, the SILP LPA included the following proviso: “The Investment Portfolio of each Partner will not\nexceed the product of (a) such Partner’s surplus (Greenlight Re Surplus or GRIL Surplus, as the case may be) multiplied by (b)\nthe Investment Cap (60%), and the General Partner will designate any portion of a Partner’s Investment Portfolio as Designated\nSecurities to effectuate such limit.”\nThe Company has concluded that SILP qualifies as a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under U.S. GAAP. In assessing its\ninterest in SILP, the Company noted the following:\n• DME II serves as SILP’s general partner and has the power to appoint the investment manager. The Company does not\nhave the power to appoint, change or replace the investment manager or the general partner except “for cause.” Neither\nof the GLRE Limited Partners can participate in the investment decisions of SILP as long as SILP adheres to the\ninvestment guidelines provided within the SILP LPA. For these reasons, the GLRE Limited Partners are not\nconsidered to have substantive participating rights or kick-out rights.\n• DME II holds an interest in excess of 10% of SILP’s net assets, which the Company considers to represent an\nobligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits of SILP that are significant to SILP.\nConsequently, the Company has concluded that DME II’s interests, not the Company’s, meet both the “power” and\n“benefits” criteria associated with VIE accounting guidance. Therefore DME II is SILP’s primary beneficiary. The Company\n10\nReturn to table of contents\npresents its investment in SILP in its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets in the caption “Investment in related\nparty investment fund.”\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss relating to SILP is limited to the net asset value of the GLRE Limited\nPartners’ investment in SILP. At June 30, 2023, the net asset value of the GLRE Limited Partners’ investment in SILP was\n$216.8 million (December 31, 2022: $178.2 million), representing 68.9% (December 31, 2022: 69.3%) of SILP’s total net\nassets. DME II held the remaining 31.1% (December 31, 2022: 30.7%) of SILP’s total net assets. The investment in SILP is\nrecorded at the GLRE Limited Partners’ share of the net asset value of SILP as reported by SILP’s third-party administrator.\nThe GLRE Limited Partners can redeem their assets from SILP for operational purposes by providing 3 business days’ notice to\nDME II. At June 30, 2023, the majority of SILP’s long investments were composed of cash and publicly traded equity\nsecurities, which could be readily liquidated to meet the GLRE Limited Partners’ redemption requests.\nThe Company’s share of the change in the net asset value of SILP for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was\n$32.8 million and $29.6 million, respectively (three and six months ended June 30, 2022: $11.9 million and $16.0 million,\nrespectively), and shown in the caption “Income (loss) from investment in related party investment fund” in the Company’s\nunaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe summarized financial statements of SILP are presented below.\nSummarized Statement of Assets and Liabilities of Solasglas Investments, LP\nJune 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\n($ in thousands)\nAssets\nInvestments, at fair value $ 413,335 $ 304,806\nDerivative contracts, at fair value 20,450 17,547\nDue from brokers 104,842 109,169\nInterest and dividends receivable 39 527\nTotal assets 538,666 432,049\nLiabilities and partners’ capital\nLiabilities\nInvestments sold short, at fair value (197,148) (159,382)\nDerivative contracts, at fair value (15,291) (12,443)\nCapital withdrawals payable (40) (75)\nDue to brokers (10,439) (2,050)\nInterest and dividends payable (991) (760)\nOther liabilities (194) (159)\nTotal liabilities (224,103) (174,869)\nNet Assets $ 314,563 $ 257,180\nGLRE Limited Partners’ share of Net Assets $ 216,845 $ 178,197\n11\nReturn to table of contents\nSummarized Statement of Operations of Solasglas Investments, LP\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n($ in thousands)\nInvestment income\nDividend income (net of withholding taxes) $ 724 $ 303 $ 1,351 $ 623\nInterest income 2,076 286 3,892 335\nTotal Investment income 2,800 589 5,243 958\nExpenses\nManagement fee (1,163) (894) (2,231) (1,785)\nInterest (1,579) (479) (3,007) (735)\nDividends (793) (200) (1,212) (582)\nProfessional fees and other (607) (230) (889) (494)\nTotal expenses (4,142) (1,803) (7,339) (3,596)\nNet investment income (loss) (1,342) (1,214) (2,096) (2,638)\nRealized and change in unrealized gains (losses)\nNet realized gain (loss) (845) 26,827 (2,605) 50,975\nNet change in unrealized appreciation\n(depreciation) 54,825 (6,699) 53,792 (23,491)\nNet gain (loss) on investment transactions 53,980 20,128 51,187 27,484\nNet income (loss) $ 52,638 $ 18,914 $ 49,091 $ 24,846\nGLRE Limited Partners’ share of net income\n(loss) (1) $ 32,782 $ 11,876 $ 29,644 $ 15,953\n(1) Net income (loss) is net of management fees and performance allocation presented below:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n($ in thousands)\nManagement fees $ 1,163 $ 894 $ 2,231 $ 1,785\nPerformance allocation 3,294 $ 1,319 3,294 1,772\nTotal $ 4,457 $ 2,213 $ 5,525 $ 3,557\nSee Note 10 for further details on related party management fees and performance allocation.\n12\nReturn to table of contents\n4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nPrivate investments and unlisted equity securities without readily determinable fair values\nAt June 30, 2023, the Company included the following private investments and unlisted securities without readily\ndeterminable fair values in the caption “Other investments”:\nFair value /\nUnrealized Unrealized Accrued carrying\nCost gains losses interest value\n($ in thousands)\nPrivate investments and unlisted equities $ 25,202 $ 42,967 $ (2,265) $ — $ 65,904\nDebt and convertible debt securities 2,676 — — 90 2,766\nTotal other investments $ 27,878 $ 42,967 $ (2,265) $ 90 $ 68,670\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company included the following private investments and unlisted securities without readily\ndeterminable fair values in the caption “Other investments”:\nUnrealized Unrealized Fair value /\nCost gains losses carrying value\n($ in thousands)\nPrivate investments and unlisted equities $ 22,787 $ 42,461 $ (2,815) $ 62,433\nDebt and convertible debt securities 1,846 — — 1,846\nCertificates of deposit 6,000 — — 6,000\nTotal other investments $ 30,633 $ 42,461 $ (2,815) $ 70,279\nThe following table presents the carrying values of the private investments and unlisted equity securities carried under\nthe measurement alternative at June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related adjustments recorded during the periods then ended.\nSix months ended June 30\n2023 2022\n($ in thousands)\nCarrying value (1) $ 65,904 $ 59,809\nUpward carrying value changes (2) $ 506 $ 11,184\nDownward carrying value changes and impairment (3) $ (250) $ (1,698)\n(1) The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes.\n(2) The cumulative upward carrying value changes from inception to June 30, 2023, totaled $43.4 million.\n(3) The cumulative downward carrying value changes and impairments from inception to June 30, 2023, totaled $3.3 million.\nDuring three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company realized a loss of $nil and $0.8 million, respectively,\n(three and six months ended June 30, 2022: $nil), and a corresponding reversal of unrealized loss relating to an investment\nwhich was previously fully impaired at December 31, 2022, resulting in no impact to the Company’s net income (loss).\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received in an asset sale or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between unaffiliated market participants. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized\nbased on the extent to which the inputs are observable in the market. The categorization of financial instruments within the\nvaluation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is\nprioritized into three levels (with Level 3 being the lowest) defined as follows:\n13\nReturn to table of contents\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value of the assets\nand liabilities. The term “unobservable inputs” includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, and similar techniques.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nAt June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company held $54.1 million and $53.6 million, respectively, of private\ninvestments and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The Company classifies these assets as Level 3\nwithin the fair value hierarchy. The following table summarizes the periods between the most recent fair value measurement\ndates and June 30, 2023, for the private and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:\nLess than 6\nmonths 6 to 12 months Over 1 year Total\n($ in thousands)\nFair values measured on a nonrecurring basis $ 10,315 $ 25,053 $ 18,694 $ 54,062\nAt June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company held $11.8 million and $8.9 million, respectively, of private\ninvestments and unlisted equities measured at cost.\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nAt June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company did not carry any other investments at fair value with an\nassigned Level within the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s investment in the related party investment fund is measured at\nfair value using the net asset value practical expedient.Therefore, this investment is not classified within the fair value\nhierarchy. (See Note 3 for further details on the related party investment fund.)\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nFinancial Instruments Disclosed, But Not Carried, at Fair Value\nThe caption “Convertible senior notes payable” represents financial instruments that the Company carries at amortized\ncost. The fair value of the convertible senior notes payable is estimated based on the bid price observed in an inactive market\nfor the identical instrument (Level 2 input) (see Note 7).\nThe carrying value of debt and convertible debt securities (see “Private investments and unlisted equity securities\nwithout readily determinable fair values” above) and certificates of deposit with original maturities of one year or less\napproximates their fair values. The Company classifies these assets as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\n5.

The magnitude and volume of losses arising from these events is\ninherently uncertain and, consequently, actual losses for these events may ultimately differ, potentially materially, from current\nestimates.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized CAT loss, net of reinsurance, of $19.6 million\nrelated mostly to $16.4 million for current year CAT loss events (the Turkey earthquake, Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand,\nand the U.S. severe storms), coupled with prior year net adverse loss development principally from Winter Storm Elliott in\n2022. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized CAT loss of $13.6 million related to the Russian-\nUkrainian conflict and $2.8 million of losses related to Tennessee wildfires.\nPrior Year Reserve Development\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, the estimate of net losses incurred relating to prior accident years increased by\n$13.8 million, primarily due to the following:\n• $4.1 million relating to Winter Storm Elliott; offset partially by $0.9 million net favorable loss development on CAT\nloss events from 2018-2022 underwriting years; and\n• $10.6 million of additional attritional losses, driven mainly by $7.1 million on casualty contracts (mostly 2018, 2019\nand 2021 underwriting years) and $4.3 million on property contracts (mostly 2020 and 2021 underwriting years).\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2022, the estimate of net losses incurred relating to prior accident years decreased by\n$0.6 million, primarily due to favorable development on mortgage contracts. This favorable development was partially offset\nby adverse development on motor and health business driven by the inflationary increase in claim costs and additional losses\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic.\n6. RETROCESSION\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company’s earned ceded premiums were $11.3 million and $19.9\nmillion, respectively (three and six months ended June 30, 2022: $2.7 million and $3.9 million, respectively). For the three and\n15\nReturn to table of contents\nsix months ended June 30, 2023, loss and loss adjustment expenses recovered and changes in losses recoverable were $9.5\nmillion and $15.7 million, respectively (three and six months ended June 30, 2022: $0.7 million and $nil, respectively).\nRetrocession contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to its cedents. Failure of retrocessionaires to\nhonor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. At June 30, 2023, the Company’s loss reserves recoverable\nconsisted of (i) $15.7 million (December 31, 2022: $9.5 million) recoverable from unrated retrocessionaires, of which $15.5\nmillion (December 31, 2022: $9.2 million) were secured by cash, letters of credit and collateral held in trust accounts for the\nbenefit of the Company and (ii) $5.9 million (December 31, 2022: $3.8 million) recoverable from retrocessionaires rated A- or\nabove by A.M. Best.\nThe Company regularly evaluates its net credit exposure to assess the ability of the retrocessionaires to honor their\nrespective obligations. At June 30, 2023, the Company’s allowance for expected credit losses was $0.1 million (December 31,\n2022: $0.1 million).\n7. SENIOR CONVERTIBLE NOTES\nOn August 7, 2018, the Company issued $100.0 million of senior unsecured convertible notes (the “Notes”), which\nmature on August 1, 2023. The Notes bear interest at 4.0%, payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year\nbeginning February 1, 2019.\nNoteholders have the option, under certain conditions, to redeem the Notes prior to maturity. At June 30, 2023, the\nCompany’s share price was lower than the conversion price of $17.19 per share. If a holder redeems the Notes, the Company\nshall have the option to settle the conversion obligation in cash, ordinary shares of the Company, or a combination thereof\npursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Notes.\nThe Company’s effective borrowing rate for non-convertible debt at the time of issuance of the Notes was estimated to\nbe 6.0%. The Company incurred issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the Notes. At June 30, 2023, the unamortized\nportion of these costs was $0.04 million (December 31, 2022: $0.4 million), which the Company expects to amortize through\nthe maturity date.\nDuring the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 the Company repurchased and canceled $nil and $17.5 million of\nthe Notes, respectively, resulting in realized gains of $nil and $0.3 million, respectively, which is included in “Other income\n(expense), net”, in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The carrying value of the Notes outstanding\nat June 30, 2023, including accrued interest of $1.0 million, was $63.1 million (December 31, 2022: $80.5 million). At June 30,\n2023, the Company estimated the fair value of the Notes (excluding accrued interest) to be $61.5 million (December 31, 2022:\n$77.1 million) (see Note 4 Financial Instruments).\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized interest expense of $0.7 million and $1.5\nmillion, respectively (three and six months ended June 30, 2022: $1.2 million and $2.3 million, respectively), which included\nthe interest coupon and the amortization of issuance costs.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants relating to the Notes at June 30, 2023.\nSee Notes 13 (b), Subsequent Events - New Term Loan Facility.\n16\nReturn to table of contents\n8.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nReferences to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company,” or “the Company” refer to Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE”)\nand its wholly-owned subsidiaries unless the context dictates otherwise. See Item 1, Note 1 of the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for list of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. References to our “ordinary shares” refer\ncollectively to our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes, which appear in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2023 and 2022 and financial condition at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nOVERVIEW\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a global specialty property and casualty (re)insurer headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with an underwriting\nand investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. Our goal is to build long-term\nshareholder value by providing risk management solutions to the insurance, reinsurance, and other risk marketplaces. We focus\non delivering risk solutions to clients and brokers who value our expertise, analytics, and customer service offerings.\nWe aim to complement our underwriting activities with a non-traditional investment approach designed to achieve\nhigher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that exclusively employ more traditional investment\nstrategies. Our investment portfolio is managed according to a value-oriented philosophy, in which our investment advisor takes\nlong positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities.\nThrough Greenlight Re Innovations (“Innovations”), we support technology innovators in the (re)insurance market by\nproviding investment capital, risk capacity, and access to a broad insurance network.\nBecause we seek to capitalize on favorable market conditions and opportunities, period-to-period comparisons of our\nunderwriting results may not be meaningful. Also, our historical investment results are not necessarily indicative of future\nperformance. Due to the nature of our reinsurance and investment strategies, our operating results will likely fluctuate from\nperiod to period.\nThe Company’s reinsurance subsidiaries hold an A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) with a stable\noutlook.\nOutlook and Trends\nWe operate in a business where we expect volatility in our underwriting results.\nWe have witnessed one of the costliest first half of the year on record for U.S. severe storms with insured loss of at\nleast $29 billion, according to Gallagher Re’s Natural Catastrophe Report Q1 2023. These severe storms contributed to our\nCAT losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. These losses relate to a single homeowners program, with the\nmajority of premiums written in 2022 (from our Innovation platform). We reduced our participation level for the 2023 program\nrenewal in light of the higher than anticipated volatility from these storms. Our total CAT incurred losses were $10.2 million\nand $16.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively.\nWhile there are signs that global inflationary pressures may be abating, this continues to be a significant concern to the\n(re)insurance industry, as it can add uncertainty to the cost of claims, particularly for classes of business with long payout tails.\nAs a result, it creates pricing challenges for new business and valuation challenges in claims reserves. We continue to manage\nthese concerns and risks in multiple ways:\n• Our underwriting strategy focuses on relatively short-tailed business, which is inherently less exposed to inflation than\nlong-tailed lines. We estimate the payout duration of our existing reserves at less than three years.\n• We incorporate inflation assumptions in all our pricing and reassess these assumptions frequently.\n• We are minimizing our exposure to classes that are experiencing severe supply-chain-driven inflation.\n24\nReturn to table of contents\nThe rising interest rate environment has had a mixed impact on our financial results. While in 2022 we experienced\nlosses driven by fixed-income securities held by the Lloyd’s syndicates in which we participate, we have seen a reversal of this\nin 2023 as maturing fixed-income securities are reinvested at higher yields. In addition, the higher interest rates have improved\nthe yield on our restricted cash and cash equivalents. To the extent interest rates continue to increase, we expect to see these\ntrends continue. The SILP portfolio is positioned to also benefit from an inflationary environment.\nThe combination of the recent loss events, continued inflation, and rising interest rates led to a significant reduction in\nthe amount of reinsurance capital available for deployment, which in turn has led to attractive market conditions that we\nconsider more favorable than any we have experienced in more than a decade. We have seen widespread pricing improvements\nin the aviation, war and terror, and marine classes and even higher increases in property catastrophe rates. These improvements\ncontinued into the July 1 renewal seasons. These short-tailed specialty and property catastrophe classes represent a significant\nportion of our 2023 business plan. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we grew our property line by 48.1% over the same\nperiod in 2022 to $61.7 million (representing 18.1% of total gross premiums written). Elsewhere in our portfolio, almost all our\nactive lines of business showed rate improvements albeit at a more modest rate.\nKey Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement uses certain key financial measures, some of which are not prescribed under U.S. GAAP rules and\nstandards (“non-GAAP financial measures”), to evaluate our financial performance, financial position, and the change in\nshareholder value. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in SEC Regulation G, is a numerical measure of a\ncompany’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts\nthat are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented under U.S. GAAP.\nWe believe that these measures, which may be calculated or defined differently by other companies, provide consistent and\ncomparable metrics of our business performance to help shareholders understand performance trends and facilitate a more\nthorough understanding of the Company’s business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for\nthose determined under U.S. GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this report are:\n• Basic book value per share and fully diluted book value per share; and\n• Net underwriting income (loss)\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are described below.\nBasic Book Value Per Share and Fully Diluted Book Value Per Share\nWe believe that long-term growth in fully diluted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial\nperformance because it provides management and investors a yardstick to monitor the shareholder value generated. Fully\ndiluted book value per share may also help our investors, shareholders, and other interested parties form a basis of comparison\nwith other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry. Basic book value per share and fully diluted book\nvalue per share should not be viewed as substitutes for the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nWe calculate basic book value per share as (a) ending shareholders' equity, divided by (b) aggregate of Class A and\nClass B ordinary shares issued and outstanding, including all unvested service-based restricted shares, and the earned portion of\nperformance-based restricted shares granted after December 31, 2021. We exclude shares potentially issuable in connection\nwith convertible notes if the conversion price exceeds the share price. We repaid all outstanding convertible notes on August 1,\n2023 without issuing any shares.\nFully diluted book value per share represents basic book value per share combined with any dilutive impact of in-the-\nmoney stock options, unvested service-based RSUs, and the earned portion of unvested performance-based RSUs granted. Fully\ndiluted book value per share also includes the dilutive effect, if any, of ordinary shares expected to be issued upon settlement of\nthe convertible notes.\nOur primary financial goal is to increase fully diluted book value per share over the long term. We use fully diluted\nbook value per share as a financial measure in our annual incentive compensation.\n25\nReturn to table of contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures basic and fully diluted book value\nper share to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure:\nJune 30, March 31, December September June 30,\n2023 2023 31, 2022 30, 2022 2022\n($ in thousands, except per share and share amounts)\nNumerator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share:\nTotal equity (U.S. GAAP) (numerator for\nbasic and fully diluted book value per share) $ 561,121 $ 510,041 $ 503,120 $ 466,952 $ 484,293\nDenominator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share: (1)\nOrdinary shares issued and outstanding as\npresented in the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheets 35,272,013 35,262,678 34,824,061 34,824,061 34,721,231\nLess: Unearned performance-based\nrestricted shares granted after December 31,\n2021 (820,156) (851,828) (516,489) (539,161) (560,927)\nDenominator for basic book value per share 34,451,857 34,410,850 34,307,572 34,284,900 34,160,304\nAdd: In-the-money stock options, service-\nbased RSUs granted, and earned\nperformance-based RSUs granted 164,116 157,431 187,750 183,790 179,988\nDenominator for fully diluted book value\nper share 34,615,973 34,568,281 34,495,322 34,468,690 34,340,292\nBasic book value per share $ 16.29 $ 14.82 $ 14.66 $ 13.62 $ 14.18\nIncrease (decrease) in basic book value per\nshare ($) $ 1.47 $ 0.16 $ 1.04 $ (0.56) $ 0.46\nIncrease (decrease) in basic book value per\nshare (%) 9.9 % 1.1 % 7.6 % (3.9) % 3.4 %\nFully diluted book value per share $ 16.21 $ 14.75 $ 14.59 $ 13.55 $ 14.10\nIncrease (decrease) in fully diluted book\nvalue per share ($) $ 1.46 $ 0.16 $ 1.04 $ (0.55) $ 0.45\nIncrease (decrease) in fully diluted book\nvalue per share (%) 9.9 % 1.1 % 7.7 % (3.9) % 3.3 %\n(1) For periods prior to January 1, 2022, all unvested restricted shares are included in the “basic” and “fully diluted”\ndenominators.

We\ndo not use premiums written as a measure of performance. Net underwriting income (loss) is a performance measure used by\nmanagement to evaluate the fundamentals underlying the Company’s underwriting operations. We believe that the use of net\nunderwriting income (loss) enables investors and other users of the Company’s financial information to analyze our\nperformance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. Management also believes this measure follows\nindustry practice and allows the users of financial information to compare the Company’s performance with that of our industry\npeer group.\nNet underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used to calculate\nnet income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. We calculate net underwriting income (loss) as net premiums earned less net loss\nand loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs, underwriting expenses, and deposit interest expense. The measure excludes, on\na recurring basis: (1) investment income (loss); (2) other income (expense) not related to underwriting, including foreign\n26\nReturn to table of contents\nexchange gains or losses, and Lloyd’s interest income and expense; (3) corporate general and administrative expenses; and (4)\ninterest expense. We exclude total investment income or loss, foreign exchange gains or losses, and Lloyd’s interest income or\nexpense as we believe these items are influenced by market conditions and other factors unrelated to underwriting decisions.\nAdditionally, we exclude corporate and interest expenses because these costs are generally fixed and not incremental to or\ndirectly related to our underwriting operations. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our underwriting\nprocess, and including them could hinder the analysis of trends in our underwriting operations. Net underwriting income (loss)\nshould not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income before income taxes.\nThe reconciliations of net underwriting income (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes (the most directly comparable\nU.S. GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis are shown below:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n($ in thousands)\nIncome (loss) before income tax $ 49,888 $ 14,797 $ 55,829 $ 9,054\nAdd (subtract):\nTotal investment (income) loss (42,151) (17,156) (47,391) (24,893)\nOther non-underwriting (income) expense (7,595) 5,957 (14,692) 6,590\nCorporate expenses 4,557 4,578 10,554 8,589\nInterest expense 744 1,166 1,520 2,320\nNet underwriting income (loss) $ 5,443 $ 9,342 $ 5,820 $ 1,660\n27\nReturn to table of contents\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe table below summarizes our operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nUnderwriting revenue\nGross premiums written $ 154,943 $ 134,780 $ 341,398 $ 280,666\nGross premiums ceded (9,739) (7,163) (20,951) (13,172)\nNet premiums written 145,204 127,617 320,447 267,494\nChange in net unearned premium reserves (5,261) (17,398) (37,855) (31,350)\nNet premiums earned $ 139,943 $ 110,219 $ 282,592 $ 236,144\nUnderwriting related expenses\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred\nCurrent year $ 88,740 $ 63,706 $ 173,428 $ 158,788\nPrior year * 1,764 (2,883) 13,801 (558)\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 90,504 60,823 187,229 158,230\nAcquisition costs 38,293 36,335 79,769 69,280\nUnderwriting expenses 5,468 3,528 9,407 6,749\nDeposit interest expense 235 191 367 225\nNet underwriting income (loss) 1 $ 5,443 $ 9,342 $ 5,820 $ 1,660\nIncome (loss) from investment in related party\ninvestment fund $ 32,782 $ 11,876 $ 29,644 $ 15,953\nNet investment income (loss) 9,369 5,280 17,747 8,940\nTotal investment income (loss) $ 42,151 $ 17,156 $ 47,391 $ 24,893\nNet underwriting and investment income (loss) $ 47,594 $ 26,498 $ 53,211 $ 26,553\nCorporate expenses $ 4,557 $ 4,578 $ 10,554 $ 8,589\nOther (income) expense, net (7,595) 5,957 (14,692) 6,590\nInterest expense 744 1,166 1,520 2,320\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 28 9 82 (7)\nNet income (loss) $ 49,860 $ 14,788 $ 55,747 $ 9,061\nEarnings (loss) per share (Class A and Class B)\nBasic $ 1.46 $ 0.44 $ 1.64 $ 0.27\nDiluted $ 1.32 $ 0.37 $ 1.49 $ 0.23\nUnderwriting ratios\nLoss ratio - current year 63.4 % 57.8 % 61.4 % 67.2 %\nLoss ratio - prior year 1.3 % (2.6) % 4.9 % (0.2) %\nLoss ratio 64.7 % 55.2 % 66.3 % 67.0 %\nAcquisition cost ratio 27.4 % 33.0 % 28.2 % 29.3 %\nComposite ratio 92.1 % 88.2 % 94.5 % 96.3 %\nUnderwriting expense ratio 4.1 % 3.4 % 3.5 % 3.0 %\nCombined ratio 96.2 % 91.6 % 98.0 % 99.3 %\n28\nReturn to table of contents\n* The net financial impacts associated with changes in the estimate of losses incurred in prior years, which incorporate earned\nreinstatement premiums assumed and ceded, and adjustments to assumed and ceded acquisition costs, were a loss of $1.9 million\nand a loss of $3.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a loss of $13.9 million and $6.1\nmillion for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n1 Net underwriting income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “ Key Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures”\nabove for discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nOverview\nThree months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, the fully diluted book value per share increased by $1.46 per share, or\n9.9%, to $16.21 per share from $14.75 per share at March 31, 2023. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, basic book\nvalue per share increased by $1.47 per share, or 9.9%, to $16.29 per share from $14.82 per share at March 31, 2023.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, our net income was $49.9 million, compared to net income of $14.8 million\nreported for the equivalent 2022 period.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during the three months ended June 30,\n2023, compared to the equivalent 2022 period, are summarized below:\n• Underwriting: Our underwriting income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was $5.4 million. This\nunderwriting income included $10.2 million of total CAT losses primarily driven by the severe storms in the U.S.\nthat occurred during the current quarter. By comparison, the equivalent period in 2022 reported an underwriting\nincome of $9.3 million, which included $2.9 million of net prior year favorable loss development and no CAT\nlosses.\nOur combined ratio was 96.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to 91.6% during the\nequivalent 2022 period. The increase was driven mainly by the 9.5 points increase in loss ratio mainly from the\nabove noted CAT losses, partially offset by lower acquisition cost ratio driven primarily by an increase in writing\nexcess of loss contracts vs. quota share reinsurance treaties.\n• Investments: Our total investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2023 was $42.2 million, compared\nto total investment income of $17.2 million reported for the same period in 2022. Our investment in SILP reported\na gain of $32.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared to a gain of $11.9 million during\nthe equivalent period in 2022. Other investment income from our Innovation investments and interest earned from\nour restricted cash and cash equivalents and Funds at Lloyd’s (“FAL”) cash positions totaled $9.4 million and\n$5.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in other\ninvestment income was driven primarily by increase in short-term yields in the last twelve months.\n• Other (income) expense: For the three months ended June 30, 2023, we earned other income of $7.6 million,\ncompared to incurring other expense of $6.0 million for the same quarter in 2022. The favorable change was\ndriven primarily by:\n◦ $4.7 million of foreign exchange gains during the current quarter, compared to $4.3 million of foreign\nexchange loss in the same quarter in 2022, due mainly to the strengthening of the pound sterling against\nthe U.S. dollar; and\n◦ our share of Lloyd’s syndicates’ investment income on FAL business, which is generally conducted on a\nfunds withheld basis. The Lloyd’s syndicates invest a portion of these funds in fixed-maturity securities\nand investment funds. We record our share of the investment income and mark-to-market adjustments of\nthese fixed maturity securities when the syndicates report them to us, generally one quarter in arrears.\n29\nReturn to table of contents\nSix months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, fully diluted book value per share increased by $1.62, or 11.0%, to $16.21 per\nshare from $14.59 per share at December 31, 2022. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, basic book value per share\nincreased by $1.63, or 11.0%, to $16.29 per share from $14.66 per share at December 31, 2022.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, our net income was $55.7 million, compared to net income of $9.1 million\nreported for the equivalent 2022 period.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during the six months ended June 30,\n2023, compared to the equivalent 2022 period, are summarized below:\n• Underwriting: Our underwriting income for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was $5.8 million, which was\nnegatively impacted by (a) $16.4 million of CAT losses during 2023 (the Turkey earthquake, Cyclone Gabrielle in\nNew Zealand, and the U.S. severe storms) and (b) $3.2 million of adverse loss development principally from\nWinter Storm Elliott in 2022. Additionally, we incurred $10.6 million of net prior year adverse attritional losses.\nBy comparison, our underwriting income for the equivalent period in 2022 was $1.7 million, which was\nnegatively impacted by $13.6 million of CAT losses related to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and $2.8 million of\nlosses related to Tennessee wildfires.\nOur combined ratio was 98.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to 99.3% for the same period in\n2022. While CAT losses and prior year adverse loss development were higher in 2023 compared to 2022, this\nwas partially offset by the favorable pricing in 2023 coupled with a change in business mix.\n• Investments: Our total investment income for the six months ended June 30, 2023, was $47.4 million, compared\nto $24.9 million earned during the equivalent 2022 period. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, our\ninvestment in SILP reported a gain of $29.6 million, compared to a gain of $16.0 million during the equivalent\nperiod in 2022. Other investment income totaled $17.7 million and $8.9 million during the six months ended June\n30, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The increase in other investment income was driven primarily by increase in\nshort-term yields in the last twelve months.\n• Other income (expense): For the six months ended June 30, 2023, other income was $14.7 million compared to\nother expense of $6.6 million. The favorable change was driven primarily for the same reasons explained above\nfor the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nUnderwriting Results by Segment\nThere was no change to our operating segment since December 31, 2022.\nThe following provides a further discussion of our underwriting results for our Property & Casualty (Re)insurance\noperating segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nGross Premiums Written\nDetails of gross premiums written are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2023 2022 2023 (1) 2022\n($ in thousands) ($ in thousands)\nProperty $ 31,160 20.1 % $ 23,129 17.2 % $ 61,720 18.1 % $ 41,664 14.8 %\nCasualty 88,472 57.1 75,804 56.2 175,596 51.4 154,073 54.9\nOther 35,311 22.8 35,847 26.6 104,082 30.5 84,929 30.3\nTotal $ 154,943 100.0 % $ 134,780 100.0 % $ 341,398 100.0 % $ 280,666 100.0 %\n30\nReturn to table of contents\n(1) During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we reclassified certain reinsurance contracts within the above three lines of business\nresulting in a presentation change to the previously reported gross premiums written for the three months ended March 31, 2023, to conform\nwith the current quarter’s presentation. This resulted in reclassifying $8.1 million from Casualty (mostly multi-line class) to $7.9 million\nOther (mostly marine and other specialty classes) and $0.2 million Property for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Accordingly, the\ngross premiums written for the six months ended June 30, 2023 reflects this presentation change.\nAs a result of our underwriting philosophy, the total premiums we write and the mix of premiums between property,\ncasualty, and other business, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the market opportunities we identify.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, our gross premiums written increased by $20.2 million, or 15.0%,\ncompared to the equivalent 2022 period. The following table provides a further analysis of this overall increase:\nGross Premiums Written\nThree months ended June 30, 2023\nIncrease\n(decrease) % change Explanation\n($ in millions)\nProperty $8.0 34.7% The increase was driven mainly from growth in our Commercial class, mainly\ndue to new quota share treaties bound in mid 2022 and new contracts in 2023.\nThis resulted in a change in business mix for Property, with Commercial and\nPersonal accounting for 46% and 53%, respectively, of total Property compared\nto 23% and 81%, respectively, for the same quarter in 2022.\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2022, there was a reversal of Motor premiums\ndue to premium adjustments which accounted for (4)% of total Property.\nCasualty $12.7 16.7% The increase was driven mainly from our General Liability class primarily due\nto new contracts in 2023 and from quota share treaties bound in 2022. As a\nresult of this growth, General Liability accounted for 31% of total Casualty\ncompared to 22% in same period in 2022.\nAlso contributing to the favorable variance was the Motor (personal liability)\nclass in part due to negative premium adjustments in 2022 as well as from\ngrowth in our Professional class. This growth was partially offset by our\ndecision to exit the Workers’ Compensation class, particularly quota share\ntreaties, which began in 2022.\nOther $(0.5) (1.5)% While there was little change for Other line of business, we experienced a\nchange in business mix mainly due to a $6.1 million reduction in our Financial\nclass driven by premium estimate adjustments on prior years’ treaties. As a\nresult, Financial class accounted for 25% of total Other compared to 43% in the\nsame quarter in 2022. This decline was offset partially by growth in our Marine\nand Other Specialty classes, driven by favorable pricing and new contracts.\n31\nReturn to table of contents\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, our gross premiums written increased by $60.7 million, or 21.6%, compared\nto the equivalent 2022 period. The changes in gross premiums written for the six months ended June 30, 2023, were attributable\nto the following:\nGross Premiums Written\nSix months ended June 30, 2023\nIncrease\n(decrease) % change Explanation\n($ in millions)\nProperty $20.1 48.1% Same explanation as for the three months ended June 30, 2023. As a percentage\nof total Property gross premiums written, the change in business mix is virtually\nthe same as noted above.\nCasualty $21.5 14.0% Same explanation as for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\nGeneral Liability and Multi-Line classes represented 27% and 60%,\nrespectively, of total Casualty gross premiums written compared to 17% and\n68%, respectively for the same period in 2022.\nOther $19.2 22.6% The increase was driven mainly by new contracts within our Marine class and\n“Other Specialty” class, primarily in aviation and cyber risk. This was partially\noffset by a reduction in Financial class for the same reason as noted above.\nAs a result, the change in business mix was follows: Other Specialty, Financial,\nand Marine represented 46%, 30%, and 19%, respectively, compared to 36%,\n43%, and 16%, respectively, for the same period in 2022.\nPremiums Ceded\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2023, premiums ceded were $9.7 million, or 6.3% of gross premiums written,\ncompared to $7.2 million, or 5.3% of gross premiums written, for the same quarter in 2022. The increase was primarily due to\na 50% quota share on certain aviation programs to reduce our exposure.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, premiums ceded were $21.0 million, or 6.1% of gross premiums written,\ncompared to $13.2 million, or 4.7% of gross premiums written for the period in 2022. The increase was driven by the new\naviation retrocession, rate increase, an increase in quota share retrocessions for property lines due to growth from inward\npremiums and the purchase of an additional $10.0 million excess of loss coverage during the first quarter of 2023 to reduce our\nexposure to marine and energy.\nNet Premiums Written\nDetails of net premiums written are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n($ in thousands) ($ in thousands)\nProperty $ 26,433 18.2 % $ 16,891 13.2 % $ 52,626 16.4 % $ 33,326 12.5 %\nCasualty 84,840 58.4 75,803 59.4 172,036 53.7 154,072 57.6\nOther 33,931 23.4 34,923 27.4 95,785 29.9 80,096 29.9\nTotal $ 145,204 100.0 % $ 127,617 100.0 % $ 320,447 100.0 % $ 267,494 100.0 %\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 net premiums written increased by $17.6 million, or 13.8%, and by\n$53.0 million or 19.8%, respectively, compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2022.

These 2022 losses were\npartially offset by favorable loss development in our mortgage business within our\nFinancial class.\nWe incurred $1.4 million adverse loss development relating to the Russian-\nUkrainian conflict for the six months ended June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2023,\nwe have not recorded any reinsurance recoveries, as the estimated losses had not\nimpacted the excess layers. However, we may generate recoveries under the\nretroceded contracts if we recognize significant further losses from the Russian-\nUkrainian conflict.\n35\nReturn to table of contents\nAcquisition Costs, Net\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, our total acquisition cost increased by 5.4% to $38.3 million, and by\n15.1% to $79.8 million, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022, mainly due to growth in net premiums earned\noffset partially by lower commissions from excess of loss contracts compared to quota share reinsurance treaties.

The increase in shareholders’ equity during the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2023, was primarily due to the net income of $55.7 million reported for the period. For details of other\nmovements in shareholders’ equity, see the accompanying unaudited “Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’\nEquity.”\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe anticipate positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) to be sufficient to\ncover cash outflows under most loss scenarios in the near term. Based on expected cash flows from operations, financing\narrangements and redemptions from related party investment fund as needed, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover\nour working capital requirements and other contractual obligations and commitments through the foreseeable future. Refer to\nthe “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 for a general discussion of liquidity and capital resources. The following provides an update on material\nchanges to our liquidity and capital resources during the six months ended June 30, 2023.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of funds for the respective periods:\n41\nReturn to table of contents\nSix months ended June 30\n2023 2022 Change\n($ in thousands)\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 566 $ (14,014) $ 14,580\nInvesting activities (7,049) 636 (7,685)\nFinancing activities (17,085) — (17,085)\nEffect of currency exchange on cash(1) 351 (120) 471\nNet cash inflows (outflows) (23,217) (13,498) (9,719)\nCash, beginning of period 706,548 711,101 (4,553)\nCash, end of period $ 683,331 $ 697,603 $ (14,272)\n(1) Cash includes unrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents - see Note 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements.\nCash used in operating activities\nThe increase in cash used in our operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 over the same period in\n2022 was driven mainly by the ebb and flow from our underwriting activities, which may vary significantly from period to\nperiod depending on the mix of business, the nature of underwriting opportunities available and volume of claims submitted to\nus by our cedents.\nCash provided by investing activities\nThe decrease in cash used for our investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 over the same period in\n2022 was mainly due to net contributions of $9.0 million into SILP, compared to net redemptions from SILP of $10.3 million\nduring the same period in 2022. Additionally, we invested $4.0 million in Innovations investments, compared to $9.7 million\nfor the same period in 2022. The cash outflows during the six months ended June 30, 2023 were partially offset by $6.0 million\nproceeds from a matured term deposit.\nCash used in financing activities\nThe cash used in our financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was due to the partial repurchase of\nour outstanding convertible senior notes at a discount.\nCash at June 30, 2023\nAs a result of the above activities, coupled with the foreign exchange rate adjustment on foreign cash, our consolidated\ncash position declined to $683.3 million at June 30, 2023, from $706.5 million at December 31, 2022.\nLetters of Credit and Trust Arrangements\nSee Note 11 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for details on the committed\nand uncommitted letter of credit facilities. We provide collateral to cedents in the form of letters of credit and trust\narrangements. At June 30, 2023, the aggregate amount of collateral provided to cedents under such arrangements was $626.9\nmillion (December 31, 2022: $667.6 million). At June 30, 2023, the letters of credit and trust accounts were secured by\nrestricted cash and cash equivalents with a total fair value of $627.7 million (December 31, 2022: $668.3 million).\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nSince December 31, 2022, the material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments at June 30, 2023 were\nas follows:\n42\nReturn to table of contents\nLess than More than\nPayment due: 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total\n($ in thousands)\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves (1) $ 308,066 $ 184,467 $ 70,184 $ 58,383 $ 621,101\n(1) Due to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance contractual\nliabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain.\nAdditionally, we have related party commitments as disclosed in Note 11 of the unaudited condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements. At June 30, 2023, we estimate the reduced performance allocation of 10% to continue to be applied until\nSILP achieves additional investment returns of 117%, at which point the performance allocation will revert to 20%. For detailed\nbreakdowns of management fees and performance compensation for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,\nrefer to Note 3 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.\nCapital\nOn July 25, 2023, at the Company’s Annual General Meeting, the shareholders approved the re-designation of Class B\nordinary shares as Class A ordinary shares, and the reclassification of Class A ordinary shares as “ordinary shares,” resulting in\nthe elimination of the dual-class share structure. Accordingly, there were 35,272,013 outstanding ordinary shares at the market\nclose on July 28, 2023.\nAs disclosed in Note 13(b) of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1, we entered into a\n$75 million credit facility with CIBC on June 16, 2023, which we drew down in July 2023 with $63.4 million of the proceeds\nused to repay the outstanding Notes plus accrued interest on August 1, 2023. The remaining proceeds will be used for general\ncorporate purposes.\nAccordingly, our capital structure currently consists of debt and equity issued in ordinary shares. We expect that the\nexisting capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business strategy for the foreseeable\nfuture. However, to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we require additional capital\nfor working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, we have filed a Form S-3\nregistration statement, which expires in July 2024.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and\nhave required management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including\nthose described in “Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2023, cause actual events or results to differ materially from our\nunderlying assumptions or estimates. In that case, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial\ncondition, or liquidity. The most significant estimates relate to: premium revenues and risk transfer, loss and loss adjustment\nexpense reserves, investment impairments, allowances for credit losses, and share-based compensation.\nWe believe that the critical accounting estimates discussion in “Part II. Item 7. — Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results on Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 continues to describe the significant estimates and judgments included in the preparation of these unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAt June 30, 2023, there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we\nexpect could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION\nThere is no material change to our prior disclosure provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2022.\n43\nReturn to table of contents\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe believe we are principally exposed to the following types of market risk:\n•\nequity price risk;\n•\ncommodity price risk;\n•\nforeign currency risk;\n•\ninterest rate risk;\n•\ncredit risk; and\n•\npolitical risk.\nSee “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022, for a discussion of our exposure to these risks. The following is an update of the\nmaterial changes in our exposure to market risk at June 30, 2023 since December 31, 2022:\nEquity Price Risk\nAt June 30, 2023, a 10% decline in the price of each of the underlying listed equity securities and equity-based\nderivative instruments would result in a $11.4 million loss to our Investment Portfolio and $3.2 million loss to our proportionate\nshare of the equity exposure held by the Lloyd’s syndicates.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe following table summarizes the net impact that a 10% increase and decrease in commodity prices would have on\nthe value of our Investment Portfolio at June 30, 2023. The below table excludes the indirect effect that changes in commodity\nprices might have on equity securities in our Investment Portfolio.\n10% increase in 10% decrease in\ncommodity prices commodity prices\nChange in Change in\nCommodity fair value fair value\n($ in millions)\nGold $ 5.5 $ (5.5)\nSilver 0.5 (0.5)\nUranium 0.4 (0.4)\nCrude oil 0.3 (0.3)\nTotal $ 6.7 $ (6.7)\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe following table summarizes the net impact of a hypothetical 10% currency rate movement relating to our main\nforeign denominated reinsurance net liabilities (including balances held at Lloyd's) at June 30, 2023:\n10% increase in 10% decrease in\nCurrency Net Exposure currency rate currency rate\n($ in thousands)\nGBP £ 8,028 $ 1,020 $ (1,020)\nEuro € (13,643) (1,489) 1,489\nTotal foreign exchange loss (gain) $ (469) $ 469\nAdditionally, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would have no\nmeaningful impact on the value of our Investment Portfolio at June 30, 2023.\n44\nReturn to table of contents\nInterest Rate Risk\nThere was no material change in our exposure to interest rate risk at June 30, 2023 since December 31, 2022, except\nfor our investment in SILP, which includes interest-rate sensitive securities, such as corporate and sovereign debt instruments\nand interest rate derivatives. At June 30, 2023, a 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a $7.4\nmillion gain or a $3.9 million loss, respectively, to our Investment Portfolio.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in such rules) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports prepared in accordance with the rules and\nregulations of the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules\nand forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These\ninherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur\nbecause of simple error or mistake.\nAdditionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,\nor by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its\nstated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,\nor the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-\neffective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended\nJune 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal controls over\nfinancial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the\nCompany’s systems evolve with its business.\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, we may be involved in formal and informal dispute resolution\nprocedures, which may include arbitration or litigation, the outcomes of which determine our rights and obligations under our\nreinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, we may seek to enforce our rights under an\nagreement or to collect funds owing to us. In other matters, we may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged\nrights. While the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of our existing\ncontractual disputes, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults.\n45\nReturn to table of contents\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFactors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report are any of the risks described in\n“Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as\nfiled with the SEC on March 8, 2023. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results\nof operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may\nalso impair our business or results of operations.\nAs of June 30, 2023, there have been no other material changes to the risk factors disclosed in “Part I. Item 1A. Risk\nFactors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. We may disclose changes\nto such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a share repurchase plan authorizing the Company to repurchase Class A ordinary\nshares. From time to time, the repurchase plan has been re-approved or modified at the election of our Board of Directors. On\nMay 2, 2023, the Board of Directors re-approved the share repurchase plan effective from July 1, 2023, until June 30, 2024,\nauthorizing the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million of Class A ordinary shares or securities convertible into Class A\nordinary shares in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans.\nThe Company is not required to repurchase any Class A ordinary shares and the repurchase plan may be modified,\nsuspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, there was no repurchase of\nClass A ordinary shares.\nItem 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nItem 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nItem 5. OTHER INFORMATION\n(c) Insider Trading Arrangements and Related Disclosures\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2023, we did not have any “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements” or any “non-Rule\n10b5-1 arrangements” (in each case, as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K) in place for our directors and officers.\n46\nReturn to table of contents\nItem 6.

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE” and, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the “Company”) was\nincorporated as an exempted company under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands on July 13, 2004. The Company’s\nwholly-owned subsidiaries are described below:\n• Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Greenlight Re”), domiciled in the Cayman Islands, is a Class D insurer license\nissued in accordance with the terms of The Insurance Act, 2010 (as amended) and underlying regulations thereto (the\n“Act”) and is subject to regulation by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. Greenlight Re commenced\nunderwriting in April 2006.\n• Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company (“GRIL”), domiciled in Ireland since 2010, is\nauthorized as a non-life reinsurance undertaking in accordance with the provisions of the European Union (Insurance\nand Reinsurance) Regulations 2015. GRIL provides multi-line property and casualty reinsurance capacity to the\nEuropean broker market and provides GLRE with an additional platform to serve clients located in Europe and North\nAmerica.\n• Greenlight Re Marketing (UK) Limited, domiciled in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) since 2020, is a U.K.\ncompany formed to expand GLRE’s presence in the Lloyd’s of London market (“Lloyd’s”).\n• Greenlight Re Corporate Member Ltd., domiciled in the U.K. since 2014, is a corporate member that became\na wholly-owned subsidiary of GLRE in 2023 and provides underwriting capacity for various Lloyd’s syndicates,\nincluding Syndicate 3456.\n• Verdant Holding Company, Ltd., domiciled in the United States since 2008, is an investment holding\ncompany.\nAdditionally, through Greenlight Innovation Syndicate 3456 (“Syndicate 3456”), Greenlight Re provides a (re)insurance\nplatform to its growing portfolio of insurtech partnerships. Domiciled in the U.K. since 2022, Syndicate 3456 is authorized to\nunderwrite under the Lloyd’s syndicate-in-a-box model.\nThe Class A ordinary shares of GLRE are listed on Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE.”\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information, and with the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.\nAccordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2022, as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2023. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include GLRE and\nits wholly-owned subsidiaries and all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on\nconsolidation.\nIn the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments\n(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and\nresults of operations as at the end of and for the periods presented. The results of operations for any interim period are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results for a full year.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in its Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n7\nReturn to table of contents\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The significant estimates reflected in the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves,\npremiums written, earned, and receivable, variability underlying risk transfer assessments, allowances for credit losses, share-\nbased compensation, valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets and investment impairments.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Restricted Cash Equivalents\nThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances to collateralize regulatory trusts and letters of credit issued to\ncedents (see Note 11). The following table reconciles the cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets to the total presented in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:\nMarch 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n($ in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 40,024 $ 38,238\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents 626,236 668,310\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of cash flows $ 666,260 $ 706,548\nFunds Held by Cedents\nThe caption “Reinsurance balances receivable” in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets includes\nfinancial assets held by cedents. At March 31, 2023, funds held by cedents were $367.8 million (December 31, 2022: $337.4\nmillion). Such amounts include premiums withheld by Lloyd’s syndicates and funds contributed by the Company to Lloyd's as\nsecurity for members’ underwriting activities. The Lloyd’s syndicates invest a portion of the premiums withheld in investment\nfunds and fixed-maturity securities. The Company records its share of income (or expense) from these assets, in its condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations under the caption “Other income (expense)” as reported by the syndicates on a quarterly\nlag basis due to the timing of the availability of these quarterly financial reports.\nDeposit Assets and Liabilities\nAt March 31, 2023, deposit assets and liabilities were $3.1 million and $8.8 million, respectively (December 31, 2022:\n$3.1 million and $10.7 million, respectively). For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the interest income\n(expense) on deposit-accounted contracts were as follows:\nThree months ended March 31\n2023 2022\n($ in thousands)\nDeposit interest income $ — $ —\nDeposit interest expense $ (132) $ (34)\nDeposit interest income (expense), net $ (132) $ (34)\nForeign Exchange\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, $4.9 million (three months ended March 31, 2022: $(1.1) million), of\nforeign exchange gains (losses) were included in the Company’s net income in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations.\n8\nReturn to table of contents\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) and weighted average shares used in computing basic and diluted net\nincome (loss) per share for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 (expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except\nper share and share amounts):\nThree months ended\nMarch 31\n2023 2022\nNumerator for earnings per share\nNet income (loss) - basic $ 5,887 $ (5,727)\nAdd: interest on convertible notes 776 —\nLess: gain on debt repurchases (265) —\nNet income (loss) - diluted $ 6,398 $ (5,727)\nDenominator for earnings per share\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 34,059,185 32,926,227\nEffect of dilutive employee and director share-based awards 341,263 —\nShares potentially issuable in connection with convertible notes 3,831,159 —\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 38,231,607 32,926,227\nAnti-dilutive stock options outstanding 690,337 735,627\nParticipating securities excluded from calculation of loss per share — 815,847\nShares potentially issuable in connection with convertible notes excluded from\ncalculation of diluted loss per share — 5,818,182\nEarnings (loss) per Class A and Class B ordinary share:\nBasic $ 0.17 $ (0.17)\nDiluted $ 0.17 $ (0.17)\nDue to the net loss attributable to common shareholders recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2022, the\nshare-based awards and convertible notes were anti-dilutive.\n3. INVESTMENT IN RELATED PARTY INVESTMENT FUND\nThe Company has entered into the Second Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement (the “SILP\nLPA”) of Solasglas Investments, LP (“SILP”), with DME Advisors II, LLC (“DME II”), as General Partner, Greenlight Re, and\nGRIL, (together, the “GLRE Limited Partners”). SILP has entered into a SILP investment advisory agreement (“IAA”) with\nDME Advisors. LP (“DME Advisors”), pursuant to which DME Advisors is the investment manager for SILP. DME II and\nDME Advisors are related to the Company, and each is an affiliate of David Einhorn, Chairman of the Company’s Board of\nDirectors (the “Chairman”).\nAt March 31, 2023, the SILP LPA included the following proviso: “The Investment Portfolio of each Partner will not\nexceed the product of (a) such Partner’s surplus (Greenlight Re Surplus or GRIL Surplus, as the case may be) multiplied by (b)\nthe Investment Cap (60%), and the General Partner will designate any portion of a Partner’s Investment Portfolio as Designated\nSecurities to effectuate such limit.”\nThe Company has concluded that SILP qualifies as a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under U.S. GAAP. In assessing its\ninterest in SILP, the Company noted the following:\n• DME II serves as SILP’s general partner and has the power to appoint the investment manager. The Company does not\nhave the power to appoint, change or replace the investment manager or the general partner except “for cause.” Neither\nof the GLRE Limited Partners can participate in the investment decisions of SILP as long as SILP adheres to the\ninvestment guidelines provided within the SILP LPA. For these reasons, the GLRE Limited Partners are not\nconsidered to have substantive participating rights or kick-out rights.\n9\nReturn to table of contents\n• DME II holds an interest in excess of 10% of SILP’s net assets, which the Company considers to represent an\nobligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits of SILP that are significant to SILP.\nConsequently, the Company has concluded that DME II’s interests, not the Company’s, meet both the “power” and\n“benefits” criteria associated with VIE accounting guidance. Therefore DME II is SILP’s primary beneficiary. The Company\npresents its investment in SILP in its condensed consolidated balance sheets in the caption “Investment in related party\ninvestment fund.”\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss relating to SILP is limited to the net asset value of the GLRE Limited\nPartners’ investment in SILP. At March 31, 2023, the net asset value of the GLRE Limited Partners’ investment in SILP was\n$196.1 million (December 31, 2022: $178.2 million), representing 71.6% (December 31, 2022: 69.3%) of SILP’s total net\nassets. DME II held the remaining 28.4% (December 31, 2022: 30.7%) of SILP’s total net assets.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized\nbased on the extent to which the inputs are observable in the market. The categorization of financial instruments within the\nvaluation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is\nprioritized into three levels (with Level 3 being the lowest) defined as follows:\n12\nReturn to table of contents\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value of the assets\nand liabilities. The term “unobservable inputs” includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, and similar techniques.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nAt March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company held $53.6 million and $53.6 million, respectively, of private\ninvestments and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The Company classifies these assets as Level 3\nwithin the fair value hierarchy. The following table summarizes the periods between the most recent fair value measurement\ndates and March 31, 2023, for the private and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:\nLess than 6\nmonths 6 to 12 months Over 1 year Total\n($ in thousands)\nFair values measured on a nonrecurring basis $ 599 $ 24,451 $ 28,503 $ 53,553\nAt March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company held $9.1 million and $8.9 million, respectively, of private\ninvestments and unlisted equities measured at cost.\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nAt March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company did not carry any other investments at fair value with an\nassigned Level within the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s investment in the related party investment fund is measured at\nfair value using the net asset value practical expedient.Therefore, this investment is not classified within the fair value\nhierarchy. (See Note 3 for further details on the related party investment fund.)\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nFinancial Instruments Disclosed, But Not Carried, at Fair Value\nThe caption “Convertible senior notes payable” represents financial instruments that the Company carries at amortized\ncost. The fair value of the convertible senior notes payable is estimated based on the bid price observed in an inactive market\nfor the identical instrument (Level 2 input) (see Note 7).\nThe carrying value of debt and convertible debt securities (see “Private investments and unlisted equity securities\nwithout readily determinable fair values” above) and certificates of deposit with original maturities of one year or less\napproximates their fair values. The Company classifies these assets as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\n5. LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES\nAt March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were composed of the following:\nMarch 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n($ in thousands)\nCase reserves $ 195,957 $ 184,756\nIBNR 399,842 370,712\nTotal $ 595,799 $ 555,468\n13\nReturn to table of contents\nA summary of changes in outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for all lines of business consolidated for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nConsolidated 2023 2022\n($ in thousands)\nGross balance at January 1 $ 555,468 $ 524,010\nLess: Losses recoverable (13,239) (11,100)\nNet balance at January 1 542,229 512,910\nIncurred losses related to:\nCurrent year 84,687 95,082\nPrior years 12,038 2,325\nTotal incurred 96,725 97,407\nPaid losses related to:\nCurrent year (5,546) (9,903)\nPrior years (57,158) (59,901)\nTotal paid (62,704) (69,804)\nForeign currency revaluation 2,622 (2,741)\nNet balance at March 31 578,872 537,772\nAdd: Losses recoverable 16,927 11,369\nGross balance at March 31 $ 595,799 $ 549,141\nEstimates for Significant Catastrophe Events\nAt March 31, 2023, the Company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses included estimated amounts for several\ncatastrophe and weather-related events. The magnitude and complexity of losses arising from certain of these events inherently\nincrease the level of uncertainty and, accordingly, the level of management judgement involved in arriving at estimated net\nreserves for losses and loss expenses. Consequently, actual losses for these events may ultimately differ materially from current\nmanagement estimates.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized catastrophe and weather-related losses, net of\nreinsurance, of $6.2 million related to the Turkey earthquake, the New Zealand Cyclone Gabrielle and the U.S. convective\nstorms that occurred during the current quarter, coupled with $4.1 million of CAT losses relating to the 2022 Winter Storm\nElliott for total CAT losses of $10.3 million (three months ended March 31, 2022: $17.9 million).\nPrior Year Reserve Development\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, the estimate of net losses incurred relating to prior accident years increased\nby $12.0 million, primarily due to the following:\n• $4.1 million relating to the 2022 Winter Storm Elliott as noted above; and\n• $9.8 million of additional attritional losses driven mainly by $7.8 million on casualty contracts (mostly 2019 and 2021\nunderwriting years) and $1.9 million on property contracts (mostly 2020 and 2021 underwriting years).\nThese increases were partially offset by $1.9 million of loss reserve reduction on other lines of business (mostly 2021\nand 2022 underwriting years).\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022, the estimate of net losses incurred relating to prior accident years increased\nby $2.3 million, primarily due to adverse development on a health contract and additional losses from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n6. RETROCESSION\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company’s earned ceded premiums were $8.6 million, (three months\nended March 31, 2022: $1.2 million). For the three months ended March 31, 2023, loss and loss adjustment expenses recovered\nand changes in losses recoverable were $6.2 million (three months ended March 31, 2022: $0.7 million).\n14\nReturn to table of contents\nRetrocession contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to its cedents. Failure of retrocessionaires to\nhonor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. At March 31, 2023, the Company’s loss reserves recoverable\nconsisted of (i) $12.5 million (December 31, 2022: $9.5 million) recoverable from unrated retrocessionaires, of which $12.2\nmillion (December 31, 2022: $9.2 million) were secured by cash, letters of credit and collateral held in trust accounts for the\nbenefit of the Company and (ii) $4.5 million (December 31, 2022: $3.8 million) recoverable from retrocessionaires rated A- or\nabove by A.M. Best.\nThe Company regularly evaluates its net credit exposure to assess the ability of the retrocessionaires to honor their\nrespective obligations. At March 31, 2023, the Company had recorded an allowance for expected credit losses of $62 thousand\n(December 31, 2022: $62 thousand).\n7. SENIOR CONVERTIBLE NOTES\nOn August 7, 2018, the Company issued $100.0 million of senior unsecured convertible notes (the “Notes”), which\nmature on August 1, 2023. The Notes bear interest at 4.0%, payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year\nbeginning February 1, 2019.\nNoteholders have the option, under certain conditions, to redeem the Notes prior to maturity. At March 31, 2023, the\nCompany’s share price was lower than the conversion price of $17.19 per share. If a holder redeems the Notes, the Company\nshall have the option to settle the conversion obligation in cash, ordinary shares of the Company, or a combination thereof\npursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Notes.\nThe Company’s effective borrowing rate for non-convertible debt at the time of issuance of the Notes was estimated to\nbe 6.0%. The Company incurred issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the Notes. At March 31, 2023, the\nunamortized portion of these costs was $0.2 million (December 31, 2022: $0.4 million), which the Company expects to\namortize through the maturity date.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023 the Company repurchased and canceled $17.5 million of the Notes,\nresulting in realized gains of $0.3 million, which is included in Other income (expense), net, in the condensed consolidated\nstatements of operations. The carrying value of the Notes outstanding at March 31, 2023, including accrued interest of $0.4\nmillion, was $62.4 million (December 31, 2022: $80.5 million). At March 31, 2023, the Company estimated the fair value of\nthe Notes (excluding accrued interest) to be $60.3 million (December 31, 2022: $77.1 million) (see Note 4 Financial\nInstruments).\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized interest expense of $0.8 million (three months\nended March 31, 2022: $1.2 million), which included the interest coupon and the amortization of issuance costs.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants relating to the Notes at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. At\nMarch 31, 2023, the Company had a remaining obligation for interest and principal payments of $63.4 million.\n8.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nEach of DME, DME II, and DME Advisors is an affiliate of the Chairman and, therefore, is a related party to the\nCompany.\nThe Company has entered into the SILP LPA (as described in Note 3 of the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements). DME II receives a performance allocation equal to (with capitalized terms having the meaning provided under the\nSILP LPA) (a) 10% of the portion of the Positive Performance Change for each limited partner’s capital account that is less\nthan or equal to the positive balance in such limited partner’s Carryforward Account, plus (b) 20% of the portion of the Positive\nPerformance Change for each limited partner’s capital account that exceeds the positive balance in such limited partner’s\nCarryforward Account. The Carryforward Account for Greenlight Re and GRIL includes the amount of investment losses to be\nrecouped, including any loss generated on the assets invested in SILP, subject to adjustments for redemptions. The loss carry-\nforward provision in the SILP LPA allows DME II to earn a reduced performance allocation of 10% of profits in years\nsubsequent to any year in which SILP has incurred a loss until all losses are recouped, and an additional amount equal to 150%\nof the loss is earned.\nIn accordance with the SILP LPA, DME Advisors constructs a levered investment portfolio as agreed by the Company\n(the “Investment Portfolio”, as defined in the SILP LPA). On September 1, 2018, SILP entered into the IAA with DME\nAdvisors, which entitles DME Advisors to a monthly management fee equal to 0.125% (1.5% on an annual basis) of each\nlimited partner’s Investment Portfolio. The IAA has an initial term ending on August 31, 2023, subject to an automatic\nextension for successive three-year terms.\nFor a detailed breakdown of management fees and performance compensation for the three months ended March 31,\n2023 and 2022, refer to Note 3 of the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n17\nReturn to table of contents\nPursuant to the SILP LPA and the IAA, the Company has agreed to indemnify DME, DME II, and DME Advisors for\nany expense, loss, liability, or damage arising out of any claim asserted or threatened in connection with DME Advisors serving\nas the Company’s or SILP’s investment advisor. The Company will reimburse DME, DME II, and DME Advisors for\nreasonable costs and expenses of investigating and defending such claims, provided such claims were not caused due to gross\nnegligence, breach of contract, or misrepresentation by DME, DME II, or DME Advisors. The Company incurred no\nindemnification amounts during the periods presented.\nGreen Brick Partners, Inc.\nDavid Einhorn also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Green Brick Partners, Inc. (“GRBK”), a\npublicly-traded company. At March 31, 2023, SILP, along with certain affiliates of DME Advisors, collectively owned 37.9%\nof the issued and outstanding common shares of GRBK. Under applicable securities laws, DME Advisors may sometimes be\nlimited in its ability to trade GRBK shares held in SILP. At March 31, 2023, SILP held 2.7 million shares of GRBK.\nService Agreement\nThe Company has entered into a service agreement with DME Advisors, pursuant to which DME Advisors provides\ncertain investor relations services to the Company for compensation of five thousand dollars per month (plus expenses). The\nagreement automatically renews annually until terminated by either the Company or DME Advisors for any reason with 30\ndays prior written notice to the other party.\nCollateral Assets Investment Management Agreement\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company (and its subsidiaries) entered into a collateral assets investment management\nagreement (the “CMA”) with DME Advisors, pursuant to which DME Advisors manages certain assets of the Company that are\nnot subject to the SILP LPA and are held by the Company to provide collateral required by the cedents in the form of trust\naccounts and letters of credit. In accordance with the CMA, DME Advisors receives no fees and is required to comply with the\ncollateral investment guidelines. The CMA can be terminated by any of the parties upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the\nother parties.\n11.

The outcomes of these procedures determine the rights and\nobligations under the Company’s reinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, the Company may\nseek to enforce its rights under an agreement or collect funds owed. In other matters, the Company may resist attempts by\nothers to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of legal disputes with certainty,\nthe Company does not believe that any existing dispute, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, or operating results.\n12.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nReferences to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company,” or “the Company” refer to Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE”)\nand its wholly-owned subsidiaries unless the context dictates otherwise. See Item 1, Note 1 of the unaudited condensed\nconsolidated financial statements for list of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. References to our “ordinary shares” refer\ncollectively to our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes, which appear in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and\n2022 and financial condition at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nSpecial Note About Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis, other than purely historical information, including\nestimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions\nupon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended , and Section 21E of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the\nwords “believe,” “project,” “predict,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,”\n“will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current\nexpectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from\nthe forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially\nfrom those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n20\nReturn to table of contents\n● Our results of operations fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\n● The impact of general economic, capital and credit market conditions, including banking sector instability, financial\nmarket illiquidity and fluctuations in interest rates, equity securities’ prices and/or foreign currency exchange rates.\n● A downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement\nour business strategy.\n● Any suspension or revocation of any of our licenses would materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n● Our investment performance depends in part on the performance of SILP and may suffer as a result of adverse\nfinancial market developments or other factors that impact SILP’s liquidity, which could materially and adversely\naffect our investment results, financial condition and results of operations.\n● The carry values of our Innovations investments may differ significantly from those that would be used if we carried\nthese investments at fair value.\n● Our level of debt may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, restrict our current and future operations, particularly\nour ability to respond to business opportunities, and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry\nconditions.\n● Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re and/or GRIL may be subject to United States federal income taxation.\n● The other matters set forth in the section entitled “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2023.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new\ninformation, future events, or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements,\nwhich speak only to the dates they were made.\nWe intend to communicate certain events that we believe may have a material adverse impact on our operations or\nfinancial position, including property and casualty catastrophic events and material losses in our investment portfolio, in a\ntimely manner through a public announcement. Other than as required by the Exchange Act, we do not intend to make public\nannouncements regarding reinsurance or investment events that we do not believe, based on management’s estimates and\ncurrent information, will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.\nGeneral\nWe are a global specialty property and casualty (re)insurer headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with an underwriting\nand investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. Our goal is to build long-term\nshareholder value by providing risk management solutions to the insurance, reinsurance, and other risk marketplaces. We focus\non delivering risk solutions to clients and brokers who value our expertise, analytics, and customer service offerings.\nWe aim to complement our underwriting activities with a non-traditional investment approach designed to achieve\nhigher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that exclusively employ more traditional investment\nstrategies. Our investment portfolio is managed according to a value-oriented philosophy, in which our investment advisor takes\nlong positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities.\nThrough Greenlight Re Innovations (“Innovations”), we support technology innovators in the (re)insurance market by\nproviding investment capital, risk capacity, and access to a broad insurance network.\nBecause we seek to capitalize on favorable market conditions and opportunities, period-to-period comparisons of our\nunderwriting results may not be meaningful. Also, our historical investment results are not necessarily indicative of future\nperformance. Due to the nature of our reinsurance and investment strategies, our operating results will likely fluctuate from\nperiod to period.\nThe Company’s reinsurance subsidiaries hold an A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) with a stable\noutlook.\n21\nReturn to table of contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and\nhave required management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including\nthose described in “Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2023, cause actual events or results to differ materially from our\nunderlying assumptions or estimates. In that case, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial\ncondition, or liquidity. The most significant estimates relate to: premium revenues and risk transfer, loss and loss adjustment\nexpense reserves, investment impairments, allowances for credit losses, and share-based compensation.\nWe believe that the critical accounting estimates discussion in “Part II. Item 7. — Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results on Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 continues to describe the significant estimates and judgments included in the preparation of these unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAt March 31, 2023, there were no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we\nexpect could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nSegments\nWe have one operating segment, Property & Casualty (Re)insurance, and we analyze our business based on the\nfollowing categories:\n● Property\n● Casualty\n● Other\nProperty business covers personal lines, commercial lines exposures and automobile physical damage. Property\nbusiness includes both catastrophe and non-catastrophe coverage.\nCasualty business covers general liability, motor liability, professional liability, and workers’ compensation exposures.\nThe Company’s multi-line business includes the Funds at Lloyd’s business. As our Lloyd’s syndicate contracts incorporate\nproperty (including incidental catastrophe), casualty, and other exposures, we categorize them as multi-line (and therefore\ncasualty) business. However, these contracts are composed of primarily short-tailed risks.\nOther business covers accident and health, financial (including transactional liability, mortgage insurance, surety, and\ntrade credit), marine, energy, as well as other specialty business such as aviation, crop, cyber, political, and terrorism exposures.\nOutlook and Trends\nWe operate in a business where we expect volatility in our underwriting results. During the three months ended March\n31, 2023, we incurred losses from catastrophe and weather-related events (herein referred as “CAT” losses) of $10.3 million\nfrom Cyclone Gabrielle, the Turkey earthquake, the U.S. convective storms in 2023, and Winter Storm Elliott in December\n2022. As noted below, these loss trends have led to improved pricing at the January 1st and April 1st renewal seasons.\nThe ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict has resulted in continued financial and economic sanctions imposed by the\nU.S., United Kingdom, European Union, and other countries, which have caused significant disruption in the global economy\nand have increased economic and geopolitical uncertainty. If this conflict is prolonged, we and other reinsurers may incur\nadditional losses in future periods.\nWhile there are signs that global inflationary pressures may be abating, this continues to be a significant concern to the\n(re)insurance industry, as it can add uncertainty to the cost of claims, particularly for classes of business with long payout tails.\nAs a result, it creates pricing challenges for new business and valuation challenges in claims reserves. We continue to manage\nthese concerns and risks in multiple ways:\n• Our underwriting strategy focuses on relatively short-tailed business, which is inherently less exposed to inflation than\nlong-tailed lines. We estimate the payout duration of our existing reserves at less than three years.\n22\nReturn to table of contents\n• We incorporate inflation assumptions in all our pricing and reassess these assumptions frequently.\n• We are minimizing our exposure to classes that are experiencing severe supply-chain-driven inflation.\nThe rising interest rate environment has had a mixed impact on our financial results. While in 2022 we experienced\nlosses driven by fixed-income securities held by the Lloyd’s syndicates in which we participate, the higher interest rates have\nimproved the yield on our restricted cash and cash equivalents. To the extent interest rates continue to increase, we expect to see\nthese trends continue. The SILP portfolio is positioned to also benefit from rising interest rates and an inflationary environment.\nThe combination of the recent loss events, continued inflation, and rising interest rates led to a significant reduction in\nthe amount of reinsurance capital available for deployment, which in turn has led to market conditions that we consider more\nfavorable than any we have experienced in more than a decade. The January 1 renewal season saw widespread pricing\nimprovements in the aviation, war and terror, and marine classes and even higher increases in property catastrophe rates. These\nshort-tailed specialty and property catastrophe classes represent a significant portion of our 2023 business plan. For the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023, we grew our property line by 63.9% over the same quarter in 2022 to $30.4 million\n(representing 16.3% of total gross premiums written). Elsewhere in our portfolio, average percentage rate improvements were\nin the single digits.\nAdditionally, we continue to be encouraged by our Innovations unit, whose central objective is to enhance our\nunderwriting return and risk profile by establishing a range of strategic partnerships. Our Innovations-related premiums,\nincluding premiums written by Syndicate 3456, grew by 57.2% for three months ended March 31, 2023 over the same quarter\nin 2022, and accounted for approximately 14.9% of our net premiums written for the three months ended March 31, 2023. We\nsee the potential for continued growth from Innovations-derived underwriting opportunities in 2023.\nKey Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement uses certain key financial measures, some of which are not prescribed under U.S. GAAP rules and\nstandards (“non-GAAP financial measures”), to evaluate our financial performance, financial position, and the change in\nshareholder value. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in SEC Regulation G, is a numerical measure of a\ncompany’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts\nthat are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented under U.S. GAAP.\nWe believe that these measures, which may be calculated or defined differently by other companies, provide consistent and\ncomparable metrics of our business performance to help shareholders understand performance trends and facilitate a more\nthorough understanding of the Company’s business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for\nthose determined under U.S. GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this report are:\n• Basic book value per share and fully diluted book value per share; and\n• Net underwriting income (loss)\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are described below.\nBasic Book Value Per Share and Fully Diluted Book Value Per Share\nWe believe that long-term growth in fully diluted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial\nperformance because it provides management and investors a yardstick to monitor the shareholder value generated. Fully\ndiluted book value per share may also help our investors, shareholders, and other interested parties form a basis of comparison\nwith other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry. Basic book value per share and fully diluted book\nvalue per share should not be viewed as substitutes for the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nWe calculate basic book value per share as (a) ending shareholders' equity, divided by (b) aggregate of Class A and\nClass B ordinary shares issued and outstanding, including all unvested service-based restricted shares, and the earned portion of\nperformance-based restricted shares granted after December 31, 2021. We exclude shares potentially issuable in connection\nwith convertible notes if the conversion price exceeds the share price.\nFully diluted book value per share represents basic book value per share combined with any dilutive impact of in-the-\nmoney stock options, unvested service-based RSUs, and the earned portion of unvested performance-based RSUs granted. Fully\ndiluted book value per share also includes the dilutive effect, if any, of ordinary shares expected to be issued upon settlement of\nthe convertible notes.\n23\nReturn to table of contents\nOur primary financial goal is to increase fully diluted book value per share over the long term. We use fully diluted\nbook value per share as a financial measure in our annual incentive compensation.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures basic and fully diluted book value\nper share to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure:\nMarch 31, December September June 30, March 31,\n2023 31, 2022 30, 2022 2022 2022\n($ in thousands, except per share and share amounts)\nNumerator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share:\nTotal equity (U.S. GAAP) (numerator for\nbasic and fully diluted book value per share) $ 510,041 $ 503,120 $ 466,952 $ 484,293 $ 468,407\nDenominator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share: (1)\nOrdinary shares issued and outstanding as\npresented in the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheets 35,262,678 34,824,061 34,824,061 34,721,231 34,721,231\nLess: Unearned performance-based\nrestricted shares granted after December 31,\n2021 (851,828) (516,489) (539,161) (560,927) (581,593)\nDenominator for basic book value per share 34,410,850 34,307,572 34,284,900 34,160,304 34,139,638\nAdd: In-the-money stock options, service-\nbased RSUs granted, and earned\nperformance-based RSUs granted 157,431 187,750 183,790 179,988 176,379\nDenominator for fully diluted book value\nper share 34,568,281 34,495,322 34,468,690 34,340,292 34,316,017\nBasic book value per share $ 14.82 $ 14.66 $ 13.62 $ 14.18 $ 13.72\nIncrease (decrease) in basic book value per\nshare ($) $ 0.16 $ 1.04 $ (0.56) $ 0.46 $ (0.33)\nIncrease (decrease) in basic book value per\nshare (%) 1.1 % 7.6 % (3.9) % 3.4 % (2.3) %\nFully diluted book value per share $ 14.75 $ 14.59 $ 13.55 $ 14.10 $ 13.65\nIncrease (decrease) in fully diluted book\nvalue per share ($) $ 0.16 $ 1.04 $ (0.55) $ 0.45 $ (0.34)\nIncrease (decrease) in fully diluted book\nvalue per share (%) 1.1 % 7.7 % (3.9) % 3.3 % (2.4) %\n(1) For periods prior to January 1, 2022, all unvested restricted shares are included in the “basic” and “fully diluted”\ndenominators. Restricted shares with performance-based vesting conditions granted after December 31, 2021, are included in\nthe “basic” and “fully diluted” denominators to the extent that the Company has recognized the corresponding share-based\ncompensation expense. At March 31, 2023, the aggregate number of unearned restricted shares with performance conditions not\nincluded in the “basic” and “fully diluted” denominators was 1,014,317 (December 31, 2022: 709,638, September 30, 2022:\n732,310, June 30, 2022: 754,076, March 31, 2022: 774,742).\nNet Underwriting Income (Loss)\nOne way that we evaluate the Company’s underwriting performance is by measuring net underwriting income (loss). We\ndo not use premiums written as a measure of performance. Net underwriting income (loss) is a performance measure used by\nmanagement to evaluate the fundamentals underlying the Company’s underwriting operations. We believe that the use of net\nunderwriting income (loss) enables investors and other users of the Company’s financial information to analyze our\nperformance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. Management also believes this measure follows\nindustry practice and allows the users of financial information to compare the Company’s performance with that of our industry\npeer group.\n24\nReturn to table of contents\nNet underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used to calculate\nnet income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. We calculate net underwriting income (loss) as net premiums earned, plus other\nincome relating to reinsurance and deposit-accounted contracts, less deposit interest expense, less net loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses, acquisition costs, and underwriting expenses. The measure excludes, on a recurring basis: (1) investment income\n(loss); (2) other income (expense) not related to underwriting, including foreign exchange gains or losses, Lloyd’s interest\nincome and expense, and adjustments to the allowance for expected credit losses; (3) corporate general and administrative\nexpenses; and (4) interest expense. We exclude total investment income or loss, foreign exchange gains or losses, Lloyd’s\ninterest income or expense and expected credit losses as we believe these items are influenced by market conditions and other\nfactors unrelated to underwriting decisions. Additionally, we exclude corporate and interest expenses because these costs are\ngenerally fixed and not incremental to or directly related to our underwriting operations. We believe all of these amounts are\nlargely independent of our underwriting process, and including them could hinder the analysis of trends in our underwriting\noperations. Net underwriting income (loss) should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income before income\ntaxes.\nThe reconciliations of net underwriting income (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes (the most directly comparable\nU.S. GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis are shown below:\nThree months ended March 31\n2023 2022\n($ in thousands)\nIncome (loss) before income tax $ 5,941 $ (5,743)\nAdd (subtract):\nTotal investment (income) loss (5,240) (7,737)\nOther non-underwriting (income) expense (7,097) 633\nCorporate expenses 5,997 4,011\nInterest expense 776 1,154\nNet underwriting income (loss) $ 377 $ (7,682)\n25\nReturn to table of contents\nResults of Operations\nThe table below summarizes our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022:\nThree months ended March 31\n2023 2022\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nUnderwriting revenue\nGross premiums written $ 186,455 $ 145,886\nGross premiums ceded (11,212) (6,009)\nNet premiums written 175,243 139,877\nChange in net unearned premium reserves (32,594) (13,952)\nNet premiums earned $ 142,649 $ 125,925\nUnderwriting related expenses\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred\nCurrent year $ 84,687 $ 95,082\nPrior year * 12,038 2,325\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 96,725 97,407\nAcquisition costs 41,476 32,945\nUnderwriting expenses 3,939 3,221\nDeposit accounting and other reinsurance expense (income) 132 34\nNet underwriting income (loss) 1 $ 377 $ (7,682)\nIncome (loss) from investment in related party investment fund $ (3,138) $ 4,077\nNet investment income (loss) 8,378 3,660\nTotal investment income (loss) $ 5,240 $ 7,737\nNet underwriting and investment income (loss) $ 5,617 $ 55\nCorporate expenses $ 5,997 $ 4,011\nOther (income) expense, net (7,097) 633\nInterest expense 776 1,154\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 54 (16)\nNet income (loss) $ 5,887 $ (5,727)\nEarnings (loss) per share (Class A and Class B) (Note 2)\nBasic $ 0.17 $ (0.17)\nDiluted $ 0.17 $ (0.17)\nUnderwriting ratios\nLoss ratio - current year 59.4 % 75.6 %\nLoss ratio - prior year 8.4 % 1.8 %\nLoss ratio 67.8 % 77.4 %\nAcquisition cost ratio 29.1 % 26.2 %\nComposite ratio 96.9 % 103.6 %\nUnderwriting expense ratio 2.9 % 2.6 %\nCombined ratio 99.8 % 106.2 %\n* The net financial impacts associated with changes in the estimate of losses incurred in prior years, which incorporate earned\nreinstatement premiums assumed and ceded, and adjustments to assumed and ceded acquisition costs, were a loss of\n$12.0 million and a loss of $2.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n1 Net underwriting income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “ Key Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures”\nabove for discussion and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\n26\nReturn to table of contents\nThree months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, the fully diluted book value per share increased by $0.16 per share, or\n1.1%, to $14.75 per share from $14.59 per share at December 31, 2022. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, basic book\nvalue per share increased by $0.16 per share, or 1.1%, to $14.82 per share from $14.66 per share at December 31, 2022.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, our net income was $5.9 million, compared to a net loss of $5.7 million\nreported for the equivalent 2022 period.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during the three months ended March 31,\n2023, compared to the equivalent 2022 period, are summarized below:\n• Underwriting: The underwriting income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $0.4 million. This\nunderwriting income included $7.9 million of net prior year attritional loss development, coupled with $10.3\nmillion of total catastrophe losses from the Turkey earthquake, New Zealand Cyclone Gabrielle, and the U.S.\nconvective storms that occurred during the current quarter, as well as $4.1 million of losses resulting from Winter\nStorm Elliott that occurred in late December 2022. By comparison, the equivalent period in 2022 reported an\nunderwriting loss of $7.7 million, which included $1.5 million of net prior year attritional loss development,\ncoupled with CAT losses of $13.6 million from the Russian-Ukrainian war and $2.8 million from Tennessee\nwildfires.\nOur combined ratio was 99.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to 106.2% during the\nequivalent 2022 period. The lower CAT losses quarter over quarter contributed favorably to the combined ratio\nfor the three months ended March 31, 2023. The improved underwriting performance was partially offset by\nhigher adverse attritional loss development from prior years, which added 5.6 percentage points to our combined\nratio for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to 0.6 percentage points for same period in 2022.\n• Investments: Our total investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $5.2 million,\ncompared to total investment income of $7.7 million reported for the same period in 2022. Our investment in SILP\nreported a loss of $3.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to a gain of $4.1 million\nduring the equivalent period in 2022. Other investment income from our Innovations investments and restricted\ncash and cash equivalents totaled $8.4 million and $3.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively. The increase in other investment income was driven primarily by increase in short-term\nyields in the last twelve months.\n• Other (income) expense: For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we earned other income of $7.1 million,\ncompared to incurring other expense of $0.6 million for the same quarter in 2022. The favorable change was\ndriven primarily by:\n◦ $4.9 million of foreign exchange gains during the current quarter, compared to $1.1 million of foreign\nexchange loss in the same quarter in 2022, due mainly to the strengthening of the pound sterling against\nthe U.S. dollar; and\n◦ our share of Lloyd’s syndicates’ investment income on Funds at Lloyd’s business, which is generally\nconducted on a funds withheld basis. The Lloyd’s syndicates invest a portion of these funds in fixed-\nmaturity securities and investment funds. We record our share of the investment income and mark-to-\nmarket adjustments of these fixed maturity securities when the syndicates report them to us, generally\none quarter in arrears.\n27\nReturn to table of contents\nUnderwriting results\nWe analyze our business based on three categories: “property,” “casualty,” and “other.”\nGross Premiums Written\nDetails of gross premiums written are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended March 31\n2023 2022\n($ in thousands)\nProperty $ 30,372 16.3 % $ 18,535 12.7 %\nCasualty 95,204 51.1 78,269 53.7\nOther 60,879 32.7 49,082 33.6\nTotal $ 186,455 100.0 % $ 145,886 100.0 %\nAs a result of our underwriting philosophy, the total premiums we write and the mix of premiums between property,\ncasualty, and other business, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the market opportunities we identify.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, our gross premiums written increased by $40.6 million, or 27.8%,\ncompared to the equivalent 2022 period. The following table provides a further analysis of this overall increase:\nGross Premiums Written\nThree months ended March 31, 2023\nIncrease\n(decrease) % change Explanation\n($ in millions)\nProperty $11.8 63.9% The increase was driven mainly from growth in our commercial lines and to a\nlesser extent personal lines of business, mainly due to favorable pricing and new\ncontracts. This was partially offset by our continued exit strategy from motor\nbusiness with only a negligible amount written during the current quarter.\nCasualty $16.9 21.6% The increase was due primarily to favorable pricing and new contracts bound\nduring 2023 relating to general liability and multi-line business. This was\npartially offset by our continued tactical strategy to lower our exposure to\nworkers’ compensation business.\nOther $11.8 24.0% The increase was driven mainly by new contracts within our “other specialty”\nlines of business, primarily in aviation and cyber risk lines.\nOur Innovations-related contracts contributed $9.5 million to the overall net increase in gross premiums written for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023.\nPremiums Ceded\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, premiums ceded were $11.2 million, or 6.0% of gross premiums written,\ncompared to $6.0 million, or 4.1% of gross premiums written for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase was\ndriven mainly by rate increase and purchase of an additional $10.0 million excess of loss coverage to reduce our exposure to\nmarine and energy, coupled with an increase in quota share retrocessions for property lines due to growth from inward\npremiums.\n28\nReturn to table of contents\nNet Premiums Written\nDetails of net premiums written are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended March 31\n2023 2022\n($ in thousands)\nProperty $ 26,005 14.8 % $ 16,435 11.7 %\nCasualty 95,276 54.4 78,269 56.0\nOther 53,962 30.8 45,173 32.3\nTotal $ 175,243 100.0 % $ 139,877 100.0 %\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 net premiums written increased by $35.4 million, or 25.3%, compared to\nthe three months ended March 31, 2022. The movement in net premiums written resulted from the changes in gross premiums\nwritten and ceded during the periods.\nNet Premiums Earned\nDetails of net premiums earned are provided in the following table:\nThree months ended March 31\n2023 2022\n($ in thousands)\nProperty $ 18,743 13.1 % $ 14,490 11.5 %\nCasualty 84,115 59.0 81,228 64.5\nOther 39,791 27.9 30,207 24.0\nTotal $ 142,649 100.0 % $ 125,925 100.0 %\nNet premiums earned for the three months ended March 31, 2023, increased by $16.7 million or 13.3%, compared to\nthe three months ended March 31, 2022. The change in net premiums earned is primarily a function of the amount and timing\nof net premiums written during the current and prior periods, coupled by the mix of business written in the form of excess of\nloss versus quota share reinsurance contracts.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Incurred, Net\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the components of the loss ratio were as follows:\nThree months ended March 31\nIncrease /\n(decrease) in loss\n2023 2022 ratio points\nCurrent accident year loss ratio 59.4 % 75.5 % (16.1)\nPrior year reserve development ratio 8.4 % 1.8 % 6.6\nLoss ratio 67.8 % 77.4 % (9.5)\nCurrent accident year loss ratio decreased to 59.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from 75.5% for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2022. Adjusting for the impact of CAT losses (including Ukrainian-Russian conflict), the\ncurrent accident year loss ratio decreased to 55.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from 62.5% for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2022. This positive change was principally due to the impact of favorable pricing over loss trends in\nour lines of business.\nPrior year reserve development ratio deteriorated by 6.6 points in the current quarter compared to the first quarter in\n2022.

For the same quarter in\n2022, we incurred $2.8 million of CAT losses related to the Tennessee\nwildfires.\nCasualty $5.7 4.4 The increase in losses incurred and loss ratio points was primarily due to\nadverse loss development on our professional liability, motor and workers’\ncompensation exposures.\nOther $(14.2) (61.4) Despite the 31.7% increase in net premiums earned from other specialty\nlines of business, the decrease in incurred losses and loss ratio points was\nmainly driven by favorable pricing and lower CAT events, coupled by\nhigher volume of adverse attritional loss development in the comparative\nperiod.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, we incurred $1.4 million\nof adverse loss development mainly relating to the Ukraine-Russia conflict.\nDuring the same quarter in 2022, we incurred $9.5 million losses related to\nthe Ukraine-Russia conflict.\n30\nReturn to table of contents\nRussian-Ukrainian Conflict\nOur loss and loss adjustment expenses from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict relate primarily to marine, energy, political\nviolence, and terrorism (“MEPVT”) policies and whole account contracts, which are included mostly in the “Other” line of\nbusiness. As of March 31, 2023, we had recorded $14.3 million incurred losses related to this CAT event (December 31, 2022:\n$13.6 million). We purchased excess of loss reinsurance to reduce our net exposure relating to MEPVT exposures. As of\nMarch 31, 2023, we have not recorded any reinsurance recoveries, as the estimated losses had not impacted the excess layers.\nHowever, we may generate recoveries under the retroceded contracts if we recognize significant further MEPVT losses from\nthe Russian-Ukrainian conflict.\nAcquisition Costs, Net\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, our total acquisition cost increased by 25.9% to $41.5 million, compared\nto the same quarter in 2022, mainly due to growth in net premiums earned.

In addition to the increase in underwriting expenses as previously noted above, our\ncorporate expenses increased mainly due to severance relating to the former CFO and higher legal professional fees as a result\nof outsourced legal services while we sought a replacement General Counsel.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, general and administrative expenses included $1.0 million (net\nof $0.3 million forfeiture credit) and $1.0 million (net of insignificant forfeiture credit), respectively, of costs related to share-\nbased compensation granted to employees and directors.\n32\nReturn to table of contents\nTotal Investment Income (Loss)\nTotal investment income (loss) incorporates (i) changes in the net asset value of our investment in SILP managed by\nDME Advisors, (ii) interest income earned on the restricted cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral to our clients, and\n(iii) gains (or losses) and interest on our portfolio of strategic and Innovations investments.

SILP’s long portfolio gained 8.9%, the short\nportfolio lost 9.0%, and macro positions lost 0.3%, during the three months ended March 31, 2023. For the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2023, the significant contributors to SILP’s investment return were long positions in Green Brick Partners (GRBK),\nKyndryl Holdings Inc., and gold. The largest detractors were Brighthouse Financial, one short position, and a hedge position for\nGRBK.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, we had an unrealized loss of $0.3 million in our Innovations-related\ninvestments, compared to $3.9 million net unrealized gains recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\nThe increase in interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily related to our restricted cash\nand cash equivalents, which benefited from rising U.S. interest rates.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the gross investment return (loss) on our investments managed\nby DME Advisors (excluding the investment advisor performance allocation) was composed of the following:\nThree months ended March 31\n2023 2022\nLong portfolio gains (losses) 8.9 % (6.0) %\nShort portfolio gains (losses) (9.0) 4.9\nMacro gains (losses) (0.3) 3.5\nOther income and expenses 1 (0.7) (0.5)\nGross investment return (1.1) % 1.9 %\nNet investment return 1 (1.1) % 1.7 %\n1 “Other income and expenses” excludes performance compensation but includes management fees. “Net investment return”\nincorporates both of these amounts.\n33\nReturn to table of contents\nThe investment performance for the three months ended March 31, 2022 reflects the Investment Portfolio calculated\nbased on 50% of GLRE Surplus, or the Company's shareholders' equity, as reported in the Company’s then most recent\nquarterly U.S. GAAP financial statements adjusted monthly for our share of the net profits and net losses reported by SILP\nduring any intervening period (the “adjusted GLRE Surplus”). Effective January 1, 2023, the Investment Portfolio is calculated\nbased on 60% of adjusted GLRE Surplus.\nEach month, we post on our website (www.greenlightre.com) the returns from our investment in SILP.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal investments\nThe total investments reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets at March 31, 2023 was $267.2\nmillion, compared to $248.5 million at December 31, 2022, an increase of $18.7 million, or 7.5%. The increase was primarily\nrelated to net contribution into SILP resulting from release of restricted cash. The increase was partially offset by an investment\nloss reported by SILP.\nAt March 31, 2023, 91.8% of SILP’s portfolio was valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets (Level\n1), 6.1% was composed of instruments valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2), and 0.0% was\ncomposed of instruments valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). At March 31, 2023, 2.1% of SILP’s portfolio\nconsisted of private equity funds valued using the funds’ net asset values as a practical expedient.\nAt March 31, 2023, 85.4% of our Innovations-related portfolio was carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,\nmeasured as of the investees’ most recently completed financing round, and 14.6% was carried at the original cost.\nOther than our investment in SILP (see Note 3 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements), we have not participated in transactions that created relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial\npartnerships, including VIEs, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\nWe use our restricted cash and cash equivalents for funding trusts and letters of credit issued to our ceding insurers. Our\nrestricted cash decreased by $42.1 million, or 6.3%, from $668.3 million at December 31, 2022, to $626.2 million at March 31,\n2023, primarily due to release of collateral from our ceding insurers relating to legacy contracts in run-off.\nReinsurance balances receivable\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, reinsurance balances receivable increased by $76.1 million, or 15.0%,\nto $581.6 million from $505.6 million at December 31, 2022. This increase was related partially to funds withheld by cedents.\nAt March 31, 2023, funds held by cedents were $367.8 million, compared to $337.4 million at December 31, 2022. Funds\nwithheld predominantly relate to premiums withheld by Lloyd’s syndicates and funds contributed by the Company to Lloyd's as\nsecurity for members’ underwriting activities.

The increase in shareholders’ equity during the\nthree months ended March 31, 2023, was primarily due to the net income of $5.9 million reported for the period. For details of\nother movements in shareholders’ equity, please see the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nShareholders’ Equity.”\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe anticipate positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) to be sufficient to\ncover cash outflows under most loss scenarios in the near term. Based on expected cash flows from operations, financing\narrangements and redemptions from related party investment fund as needed, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to cover\nour working capital requirements and other contractual obligations and commitments through the foreseeable future. Refer to\nthe “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 for a general discussion of liquidity and capital resources. The following provides an update on material\nchanges to our liquidity and capital resources during the three months ended March 31, 2023.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of funds for the respective periods:\n35\nReturn to table of contents\nThree months ended March 31\n2023 2022 Change\n($ in thousands)\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (1,259) $ (11,618) $ 10,359\nInvesting activities (22,076) 33,256 (55,332)\nFinancing activities (17,085) — (17,085)\nEffect of currency exchange on cash(1) 132 — 132\nNet cash inflows (outflows) (40,288) 21,638 (61,926)\nCash, beginning of period 706,548 711,101 (4,553)\nCash, end of period $ 666,260 $ 732,739 $ (66,479)\n(1) Cash includes unrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents - see Note 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements.\nCash used in operating activities\nThe decrease in cash used in our operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 over the same quarter\nin 2022 was driven mainly by the ebb and flow from our underwriting activities, which may vary significantly from period to\nperiod depending on the mix of business, the nature of underwriting opportunities available and volume of claims submitted to\nus by our cedents.\nCash provided by investing activities\nThe increase in cash used for our investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 over the same quarter\nin 2022 was mainly due to contributions (net of redemptions) of $21.0 million into SILP, compared to net redemptions from\nSILP of $36.7 million during the same period in 2022.\nCash used in financing activities\nThe increase in cash used in our financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 over the same quarter\nin 2022 was due to the partial repurchase of our outstanding convertible senior notes at a discount.\nCash at March 31, 2023\nAs a result of the above activities, coupled with the foreign exchange rate adjustment on foreign cash, our consolidated\ncash position declined to $666.3 million at March 31, 2023, from $706.5 million at December 31, 2022.\nLetters of Credit and Trust Arrangements\nSee Note 11 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for details on the committed and\nuncommitted letter of credit facilities. We provide collateral to cedents in the form of letters of credit and trust arrangements. At\nMarch 31, 2023, the aggregate amount of collateral provided to cedents under such arrangements was $625.5 million\n(December 31, 2022: $667.6 million). At March 31, 2023, the letters of credit and trust accounts were secured by restricted cash\nand cash equivalents with a total fair value of $626.2 million (December 31, 2022: $668.3 million).\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nSince December 31, 2022, the material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments at March 31, 2023\nwere as follows:\nLess than More than\nPayment due: 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total\n($ in thousands)\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves (1) $ 295,516 $ 176,952 $ 67,325 $ 56,005 $ 595,799\n36\nReturn to table of contents\n(1) Due to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance contractual\nliabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain.\nAdditionally, we have related party commitments as disclosed in Note 11 of the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements. At March 31, 2023, we estimate the reduced performance allocation of 10% to continue to be applied until SILP\nachieves additional investment returns of 150%, at which point the performance allocation will revert to 20%. For detailed\nbreakdowns of management fees and performance compensation for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, refer to\nNote 3 of the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nCapital\nOur capital structure currently consists of senior convertible notes and equity issued in two classes of ordinary shares.\nWe expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business strategy for\nthe foreseeable future. However, to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we require\nadditional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, we have filed a\nForm S-3 registration statement, which expires in July 2024. We are in the process of arranging refinancing for the outstanding\nconvertible senior notes that mature in August 2023. If we are unable to refinance the convertible senior notes, we may find\nalternative financing arrangements, or fund the settlement at maturity using cash on hand, or withdrawals from SILP.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation generally affects the cost of claims and claim expenses. Long-tailed lines of business generally have greater\nexposure to inflation than short-tailed lines, with this differential becoming more pronounced as the severity of inflation\nincreases. Our underwriting portfolio is predominantly short-tailed, and we actively manage our exposures to lines that\nexperience significant inflation. Our pricing and reserving models incorporate the anticipated effects of inflation on our claim\ncosts, and we regularly review and update our assumptions. However, we cannot predict or estimate the onset, duration, and\nseverity of an inflationary period with precision. The actual effect of inflation may differ significantly from our assumptions.\nInflation can also affect the asset values in SILP’s investment portfolio. DME Advisors regularly monitors and re-\npositions SILP’s investment portfolio to deal with the impact of inflation on its underlying investments, and holds macro\npositions to benefit from a rising inflationary environment.\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe believe we are principally exposed to the following types of market risk:\n•\nequity price risk;\n•\ncommodity price risk;\n•\nforeign currency risk;\n•\ninterest rate risk;\n•\ncredit risk; and\n•\npolitical risk.\nSee “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022, for a discussion of our exposure to these risks. The following is an update of the\nmaterial changes in our exposure to market risk at March 31, 2023 since December 31, 2022:\nEquity Price Risk\nAt March 31, 2023, a 10% decline in the price of each of the underlying listed equity securities and equity-based\nderivative instruments would result in a $12.0 million loss to our Investment Portfolio and $2.1 million loss to our proportionate\nshare of the equity exposure held by the Lloyd’s syndicates.\n37\nReturn to table of contents\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe following table summarizes the net impact that a 10% increase and decrease in commodity prices would have on\nthe value of our Investment Portfolio at March 31, 2023. The below table excludes the indirect effect that changes in\ncommodity prices might have on equity securities in our Investment Portfolio.\n10% increase in 10% decrease in\ncommodity prices commodity prices\nChange in Change in\nCommodity fair value fair value\n($ in millions)\nGold $ 4.1 $ (4.1)\nSilver 0.3 (0.3)\nUranium 0.3 (0.3)\nCrude oil 0.2 (0.2)\nTotal $ 4.9 $ (4.9)\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe following table summarizes the net impact of a hypothetical 10% currency rate movement relating to our GBP and\nEuro denominated reinsurance net liabilities (including balances held at Lloyd's) at March 31, 2023:\n10% increase in 10% decrease in\nCurrency Net Exposure currency rate currency rate\n($ in thousands)\nGBP £ 6,589 $ 812 $ (812)\nEuro € (10,477) (1,136) 1,136\nTotal foreign exchange loss (gain) $ (324) $ 324\nAdditionally, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would have no\nmeaningful impact on the value of our Investment Portfolio at March 31, 2023.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThere was no material change in our exposure to interest rate risk at March 31, 2023 since December 31, 2022, except\nfor our investment in SILP, which includes interest-rate sensitive securities, such as corporate and sovereign debt instruments\nand interest rate options. At March 31, 2023, a 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a $7.5\nmillion gain or a $5.8 million loss, respectively, to our Investment Portfolio.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in such rules) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports prepared in accordance with the rules and\nregulations of the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules\nand forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n38\nReturn to table of contents\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These\ninherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur\nbecause of simple error or mistake.\nAdditionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,\nor by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its\nstated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,\nor the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-\neffective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended\nMarch 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal controls over\nfinancial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the\nCompany’s systems evolve with its business.\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, we may be involved in formal and informal dispute resolution\nprocedures, which may include arbitration or litigation, the outcomes of which determine our rights and obligations under our\nreinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, we may seek to enforce our rights under an\nagreement or to collect funds owing to us. In other matters, we may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged\nrights. While the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of our existing\ncontractual disputes, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFactors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report are any of the risks described in\n“Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as\nfiled with the SEC on March 8, 2023. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results\nof operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may\nalso impair our business or results of operations.\nAs of March 31, 2023, there have been no other material changes to the risk factors disclosed in “Part I. Item 1A. Risk\nFactors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. We may disclose changes\nto such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a share repurchase plan authorizing the Company to repurchase Class A ordinary\nshares. From time to time, the repurchase plan has been re-approved or modified at the election of our Board of Directors. The\ncurrent plan expires on June 30, 2023. On May 2, 2023, the Board of Directors re-approved the share repurchase plan effective\nfrom July 1, 2023, until June 30, 2024, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million of Class A ordinary shares\nor securities convertible into Class A ordinary shares in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or Rule\n10b5-1 stock trading plans.\n39\nReturn to table of contents\nThe Company is not required to repurchase any Class A ordinary shares and the repurchase plan may be modified,\nsuspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, there was no\nrepurchase of Class A ordinary shares.\nItem 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nItem 4.

These forward-looking statements generally are\nidentified by the words “believe,” “project,” “predict,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “should,”\n“will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based\non current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from the forward-looking statements. We have included a detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could\ncause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements in the section entitled “Risk\nFactors” (refer to Part I, Item 1A). Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n● Our results of operations fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\n● A downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement\nour business strategy.\n● Any suspension or revocation of any of our licenses would materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n● Our investment performance depends in part on the performance of SILP and may suffer as a result of adverse\nfinancial market developments or other factors that impact SILP’s liquidity, which could materially and adversely\naffect our investment results, financial condition and results of operations.\n● The carry values of our Innovations investments may differ significantly from those that would be used if we carried\nthese investments at fair value.\n● Our level of debt may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, restrict our current and future operations, particularly\nour ability to respond to business opportunities, and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry\nconditions.\n● Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re and/or GRIL may be subject to United States federal income taxation.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new\ninformation, future events, or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements,\nwhich speak only to the dates they were made.\nWe intend to communicate certain events that we believe may have a material adverse impact on our operations or\nfinancial position, including property and casualty catastrophic events and material losses in our investment portfolio, in a\ntimely manner through a public announcement. Other than as required by the Exchange Act, we do not intend to make public\nannouncements regarding reinsurance or investment events that we do not believe, based on management’s estimates and\ncurrent information, will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.\n3\nLink to Table of Contents\nItem 1. BUSINESS\nUnless otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this annual report on Form 10-K to\n“the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar expressions are references to Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this annual report to entity\nnames are as set forth in the following table:\nReference Entity’s legal name\nGreenlight Capital Re Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd.\nGreenlight Re Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd.\nGRIL Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nVerdant Verdant Holding Company, Ltd.\nGreenlight Re UK Greenlight Re Marketing (UK) Limited\nSyndicate 3456 Greenlight Innovation Syndicate 3456\nGCM Greenlight Re Corporate Member Ltd.\nWe have included a Glossary of Selected Reinsurance Terms at the end of “Part 1, Item 1. Business” of this Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nGreenlight Capital Re is a holding company incorporated in July 2004 under the laws of the Cayman Islands. In August\n2004, we raised gross proceeds of $212.2 million from private placements of Greenlight Capital Re’s Class A ordinary shares\nand Class B ordinary shares, or, collectively, the ordinary shares. On May 24, 2007, Greenlight Capital Re raised proceeds of\n$208.3 million, net of underwriting fees, in an initial public offering of Class A ordinary shares, and an additional $50.0 million\nfrom a private placement of Class B ordinary shares.\nWe are a global specialty property and casualty reinsurer headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with a reinsurance and\ninvestment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. We conduct our operations through two\nlicensed and regulated entities: Greenlight Re, based in the Cayman Islands, and GRIL, based in Dublin, Ireland. Greenlight Re\nprovides multi-line property and casualty reinsurance globally, while GRIL focuses mainly on the European market. In 2022,\nGreenlight Innovation Syndicate 3456 (“Syndicate 3456”) commenced insurance operations under the Lloyd’s syndicate-in-a-\nbox model, with Greenlight Re as the sole capital provider.\nThe London market specialty business is central to our underwriting portfolio. In 2020, we established a UK marketing\nCompany, Greenlight Re UK, which has increased our London market presence and we expect it to facilitate continued growth\nin this market.\nOn January 1, 2023, we acquired a Lloyd’s corporate member, GCM, that provides underwriting capacity for various\nsyndicates (including Syndicate 3456) that underwrite general insurance and reinsurance business at Lloyd’s. Prior to acquiring\nGCM, we sourced our Funds at Lloyd’s (“FAL”) business through the same corporate member. The ownership of GCM\ncomplements our Syndicate 3456 and provides us more control over the FAL business.\nOur goal is to build long-term shareholder value by providing risk management products and services to the insurance,\nreinsurance, and other risk marketplaces. We focus on delivering risk solutions to clients and brokers who value our expertise,\nanalytics, and customer service offerings.\nWe aim to complement our underwriting activities with a non-traditional investment approach designed to achieve higher\nrates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that exclusively employ more traditional investment strategies.\nOur investment portfolio is managed by a value-oriented investment advisor that analyzes companies’ available financial data,\nbusiness strategies, and prospects to identify undervalued and overvalued securities.\nFrom time to time, we make long-term strategic investments in insurance companies and general agents to complement\nour strategy and strengthen our client relationships. In 2018, we launched our Greenlight Re Innovations unit, which supports\ntechnology innovators in the (re)insurance market by providing investment, risk capacity, and access to a broad insurance\nnetwork. In certain instances, we utilize Verdant to facilitate strategic investments in property and casualty insurers, general\nagents, and other entities domiciled in the United States.\n4\nLink to Table of Contents\nDescription of Business\nGreenlight Re is licensed and regulated by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (“CIMA”) to write property and\ncasualty reinsurance business as well as long-term business (e.g., life insurance, long-term disability, long-term care, etc.) To\ndate, we have not written any long-term business. GRIL is licensed and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (“CBI”) to\nwrite property and casualty reinsurance business. Currently, we have one operating segment: property and casualty reinsurance.\nWithin that segment, we employ a two-pillar strategy:\n1. Traditional property and casualty reinsurance\nWe offer excess of loss and quota share products across a range of classes in the property and casualty market. Our\nunderwriting approach varies by class and type of opportunity:\n● Where our expertise is sufficient to evaluate the risk thoroughly, we will generally seek to participate in syndicated\nplacements negotiated and priced by another party that we judge to have market-leading expertise in the class or as\na quota share retrocessionaire of a market-leading reinsurer;\n● Where we have domain-specific expertise and a high level of market access, we may seek to act as the lead\nunderwriter to achieve greater influence in negotiating pricing, terms, and conditions.\n2. Risk innovation and strategic partnerships\nWe seek to develop a range of risk products via strategic partnerships and other methods to access fee income, a\nstream of underwriting business, and investment upside potential. We refer to this pillar as Greenlight Re Innovations\n(“Innovations”).\nIn evaluating Innovations opportunities, we generally ensure that each investment meets at least one of the following\ncriteria:\n● The value we add to a partnership is derived primarily from the application of our risk expertise, not solely capital\nor reinsurance support;\n● The partnership adds expertise to our company in specific risk areas, technology, product innovation, or other\nareas;\n● The partnership approach provides access to a pool of capital, products, or distribution;\n● Overall, the partnership approach creates a combined effort that generates a durable strategic or competitive\nposition in one or more markets and increases our opportunities to achieve revenue growth and margin expansion.\nOur investment strategy, like our reinsurance strategy, is designed to maximize returns over the long term while\nminimizing the risk of capital loss. Unlike the investment strategies of many of our competitors, which invest primarily in\nfixed-income securities either directly or through fixed-fee arrangements with one or more investment managers, our\ninvestment strategy is focused mainly on long and short positions, primarily in publicly-traded equity and corporate debt\ninstruments.\nWe measure our success by long-term growth in book value per share, which we believe is the most comprehensive\ngauge of our performance. Accordingly, we have incorporated a metric based on growth in book value per share in our\nincentive compensation plan to align employee and shareholder interests.\nThe size and diversification of our underwriting portfolio will vary based on our perception of the opportunities available\nin each line of business at each point in time. As our focus on certain lines fluctuates based on market conditions, we may only\noffer or underwrite a limited number of lines in any given period. We seek to:\n● target markets and lines of business where we believe an appropriate risk/reward profile exists;\n● attract and retain clients with expertise in their respective lines of business;\n● employ strict underwriting discipline; and\n● select reinsurance opportunities with anticipated favorable returns on capital.\n5\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe following table sets forth our gross premiums written by line of business, further broken down by class of business:\nYear ended December 31\n2022 2021 2020\n($ in thousands)\nProperty\nCommercial $ 14,750 2.6 % $ 10,853 1.9 % $ 11,190 2.3 %\nMotor 2,346 0.4 29,953 5.3 33,054 6.9\nPersonal 68,227 12.2 12,141 2.1 14,219 3.0\nTotal Property 85,323 15.2 52,947 9.4 58,463 12.2\nCasualty\nGeneral Liability 60,276 10.7 18,037 3.2 4,228 0.9\nMotor Liability 8,601 1.6 118,251 20.9 127,379 26.5\nProfessional Liability 1,921 0.3 316 0.1 204 —\nWorkers' Compensation 28,381 5.0 62,188 11.0 82,189 17.1\nMulti-line 225,924 40.1 180,321 31.9 88,237 18.4\nTotal Casualty 325,103 57.7 379,113 67.1 302,237 63.0\nOther\nAccident & Health 8,947 1.6 31,612 5.6 56,284 11.7\nFinancial 66,528 11.8 66,612 11.8 23,231 4.8\nMarine 22,700 4.0 10,652 1.9 770 0.2\nOther Specialty 54,570 9.7 24,457 4.3 38,806 8.1\nTotal Other 152,745 27.1 133,333 23.6 119,091 24.8\n$ 563,171 100.0 % $ 565,393 100.0 % $ 479,791 100.0 %\nThe following table sets forth our gross premiums written by the geographic area of the risk insured:\nYear ended December 31\n2022 2021 2020\n($ in thousands)\nU.S. and Caribbean $ 295,428 52.4 % $ 316,015 55.9 % $ 390,000 81.3 %\nWorldwide (1) 242,561 43.1 240,285 42.5 84,204 17.5\nAsia 20,334 3.6 4,609 0.8 5,587 1.2\nEurope 4,848 0.9 4,484 0.8 — —\n$ 563,171 100.0 % $ 565,393 100.0 % $ 479,791 100.0 %\n(1) “Worldwide” comprises contracts that reinsure risks in more than one geographic area and may include risks in the U.S.\nAdditional information about our business is set forth in “Part II, Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations”.\nMarketing and Distribution\nBusiness transacted using intermediaries\nWe source a majority of our business through reinsurance brokers. Brokerage distribution channels provide us with\naccess to an efficient, variable cost and global distribution system. In some cases, intermediaries also provide other services,\nincluding risk analytics, processing, and clearing.\nWe aim to build and strengthen long-term relationships with global reinsurance brokers. Our management team has\nrelationships with most primary and specialty broker intermediaries in the reinsurance marketplace. By maintaining close\n6\nLink to Table of Contents\nrelationships with brokers, we believe that we will continue to obtain access to a broad range of reinsurance clients and\nopportunities.\nWe seek to strengthen our broker relationships and become the preferred choice of brokers and clients by providing,\nwhere applicable:\n● demonstrated expertise in the underlying reinsured exposures and the operation of the contracts;\n● rapid responses to risk submissions;\n● timely claims payments;\n● customized solutions that address the specific business needs of our clients;\n● financial security; and\n● a clear indication of risks we will and will not underwrite.\nWe focus on the quality and financial strength of any brokerage firm we conduct business with. Brokers do not have the\nauthority to bind us to any reinsurance contract. Their commissions are generally determined based on a percentage of gross\npremiums written.\nWe rely on a small number of broker relationships, which has continued to decrease in recent years as a result of\nconsolidation in the broker sector. In 2022, five brokerage firms accounted for 69.4% of our gross premiums written. The\nfollowing table sets forth the premiums generated through our largest brokers and their subsidiaries and affiliates:\nYear ended December 31\n2022\n($ in thousands)\nAon Benfield $ 159,421 28.3 %\nGallagher Re 91,239 16.2\nBMS Group 51,435 9.1\nGuy Carpenter (Marsh) 50,626 9.0\nHowden 38,376 6.8\nTotal of largest brokers 391,097 69.4\nAll other brokers and direct placements 172,074 30.6\nTotal $ 563,171 100.0 %\nWe frequently meet in the Cayman Islands, Ireland, U.K. and elsewhere with brokers and senior representatives of\nclients and prospective clients. We review and (when we deem appropriate) approve all contract submissions in the Cayman\nIslands or Ireland. Due to our dependence on brokers, the inability to obtain business from them could adversely affect our\nbusiness strategy. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — The inability to obtain business provided\nfrom brokers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.” We may\nassume a degree of the credit risk of our reinsurance brokers. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business —\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our brokers, cedents, agents and other counterparties.”\nWhile most of our business is sourced through reinsurance brokers, we also write some insurance and reinsurance\nbusiness on a direct basis. Our Innovations partnerships are a growing source of directly placed business.\nOur FAL business, which represented approximately one third of our gross written premiums in the 2022 fiscal year, was\ngenerated through a Lloyd’s corporate member, which we subsequently acquired effective January 1, 2023.\nWe may also selectively delegate underwriting authority to managing general agents to transact business within the\nconstraints of prescribed underwriting guidelines. We expect to delegate underwriting authority primarily relating to Syndicate\n3456, and sporadically through carefully selected managing agents.\n7\nLink to Table of Contents\nUnderwriting and Risk Management\nWe have established an underwriting platform composed of experienced underwriters and actuaries. We have\nunderwriting operations in three locations: the Cayman Islands, Dublin, Ireland, and London, U.K. These platforms provide\naccess to key markets in the U.S. and Europe. Our experienced team allows us to deploy our capital in various lines of business\nand capitalize on opportunities that we believe offer favorable returns on equity over the long term. Our underwriters and\nactuaries have expertise in multiple lines of business. We generally apply the following underwriting and risk management\nprinciples:\nEconomics of Results\nOur primary underwriting goal is to build a (re)insurance portfolio that maximizes profitability, subject to risk and\nvolatility constraints.\nUnderwriting Analysis\nOur approach to underwriting analysis begins at the class-of-business level. This analysis includes identifying and\nassessing the structural drivers of risk and emerging loss trends and understanding the market participants and results, capacity\nconditions for supply and demand, and other factors. Our underwriting professionals specialize in business lines, and our\nquantitative professionals assist in evaluating all risks we underwrite. Combined with cross-line management, we believe this\napproach enables us to build and deploy expertise and insight into the business line’s risk dynamics and external factors that\nwill affect each transaction.\nWe assign a deal team composed of underwriting and quantitative professionals to evaluate each potential transaction’s\npricing and structure. Before committing capital to any transaction, the deal team and the regional Chief Underwriting Officer\nmust obtain approval from the Chief Executive Officer. In seeking this approval, the deal team presents the key components of\nthe proposed transaction, including assumptions and threats, market and individual deal risk factors, market capacity dynamics,\ntransaction structure and pricing, maximum downside, and other factors.\nWe collaborate with our current and prospective clients and brokers to understand the risks associated with each potential\ntransaction. For most of our business, we follow terms set by recognized market leads. We consider the remainder of our\nunderwriting portfolio, including contracts linked to our Innovations partners or in areas where we have significant market\nexpertise, to be “lead business.” When underwriting lead business, we generally structure the reinsurance agreements to ensure\nthat our cedents’ interests and ours are aligned. Where appropriate, we conduct or contract for on-site audits or reviews of the\nclients’ underwriting files, systems, and operations. We usually obtain substantial data from our clients to conduct a thorough\nactuarial modeling analysis. As part of our pricing and underwriting process, we assess, among other factors:\n● the client’s and industry’s historical loss data;\n● the expected duration for claims to fully develop;\n● the client’s pricing and underwriting strategies;\n● the geographic areas in which the client is doing business and its market share;\n● the reputation and financial strength of the client and its management and underwriting teams;\n● the reputation and expertise of the broker; and\n● reports provided by independent industry specialists.\nWe develop proprietary quantitative models and use several commercially available tools to price our business. Our\nmodels consider conventional underwriting and risk metrics and incorporate various class-specific and market-specific aspects\nfrom our line-of-business analyses. We use models to evaluate the quantitative work’s quality and predictive power and\nundertake a detailed assessment of the data quality.\n8\nLink to Table of Contents\nUnderwriting Authorities\nThe Underwriting Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Underwriting Committee”) sets parameters for aggregate\nproperty catastrophic caps and limits for maximum loss potential under any individual contract. The Underwriting Committee\nmust approve any exceptions to the established limits. The Underwriting Committee may amend the maximum underwriting\nauthorities periodically to align with our capital base. The Underwriting Committee designs our underwriting authorities to\nensure the underwriting portfolio is appropriate on a risk-adjusted basis.\nRetrocessional Coverage\nWe opportunistically purchase retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to manage our overall\ncatastrophe events or aggregate exposure, reduce our net liability on individual risks, obtain additional underwriting capacity,\nand balance our underwriting portfolio.\nThe retrocessional coverage we purchase varies based on numerous factors, including the inherent volatility and risk\naccumulation of our underwriting portfolio and capital base. Our portfolio, and by extension our gross risk position, will change\nin size from year to year depending on market opportunities, so it is difficult to predict the level of retrocessional coverage that\nwe will purchase in any future year.\nWe generally purchase uncollateralized retrocessional coverage from reinsurers with a minimum financial strength rating\nof “A- (Excellent)” from A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) or an equivalent rating from a recognized rating service. For\nlower-rated or non-rated reinsurers, we endeavor to obtain and monitor collateral in the form of cash, funds withheld, letters of\ncredit, regulatory trusts, or other collateral in the form of guarantees. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount due from\nreinsurers from retrocessional coverages represented 2.4% (2021: 2.1%) of our gross loss reserves. For further details, please\nsee Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers to assess\ntheir ability to honor their obligations. At December 31, 2022, the Company had recorded an allowance for expected credit\nlosses from retrocessionaires of $0.4 million (2021: $0.1 million).\nClaims Management\nOur claims management process begins upon receiving claims notifications from our clients or third-party\nadministrators. We review reserving and settlement authority under the individual contract requirements and, as necessary,\ndiscuss with the contract’s underwriter. Our in-house claims officer oversees claims reviews and approves complex or large\nclaim settlements. Claims above the claims officer’s authority are referred to the General Counsel or Chief Financial Officer,\ntogether with the claims officer’s recommendations, for secondary approval. Our Chief Executive Officer must approve claim\npayments above a certain threshold. We believe that this process ensures that we pay claims in accordance with each contract's\nterms and conditions.\nWhere appropriate, we conduct or contract for on-site claims audits at cedents and third-party administrators, particularly\nfor large accounts, Innovations partners, and those whose performance differs from our expectations. Through these audits, we\nevaluate and monitor the third-party administrators’ and the ceding companies’ organization and claims-handling practices.\nThese practices include:\n• fact-finding and investigation techniques;\n• loss notifications;\n• reserving;\n• claims negotiation and settlement;\n• adherence to claims-handling guidelines.\nWe recognize that the fair interpretation of our reinsurance agreements and timely payment of covered claims are\nessential components of the service we provide to our clients.\n9\nLink to Table of Contents\nReserves\nOur reserving philosophy is to set reserves at the level representing our best estimate of the amount we will ultimately be\nrequired to pay in connection with risks we have underwritten. Our actuarial staff performs quarterly reviews of our portfolio\nand provides reserving estimates according to our stated reserving philosophy. In doing so, our actuarial staff groups our\nportfolio into reserving analysis segments based primarily on homogeneity considerations. Currently, this process involves\nanalysis at the individual client or transaction level.\nWe engage independent external actuaries who review and provide opinions on these reserve estimates at least once a\nyear. Due to the use of different assumptions and loss experience, the amount we establish as reserves with respect to individual\nrisks, clients, transactions, or business lines may be greater or less than those set by our clients or ceding companies. Reserves\ninclude claims reported but not yet paid, claims incurred but not reported, and claims in the process of settlement. Additional\nunderwriting liabilities include unearned premiums, premium deposits, and profit commissions earned but not yet paid.\nReserves represent an estimate rather than an exact quantification. Although the methods for establishing reserves are\nwell established, many assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. We base\nour estimates on our assessment of facts and circumstances, future trends in claim severity and frequency, judicial theories of\nliability, and other factors, including inflation, interest rate changes, political risks and the actions of third parties, which are\nbeyond our control. See Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of claims reserves,\nloss development tables by accident year, and explanations of significant prior period loss development movements. See “Item\n1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — If our losses and loss adjustment expenses greatly exceed our loss\nreserves, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.”\nCollateral Arrangements and Letter of Credit Facilities\nWe are licensed and admitted as a reinsurer only in the Cayman Islands and the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).\nMany jurisdictions, including the United States, do not permit clients to take credit for reinsurance on their statutory financial\nstatements if they obtain such reinsurance from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers without appropriate collateral. As a result,\nour U.S. clients and some non-U.S. clients require us to provide collateral for the contracts we bind with them. We provide\ncollateral as funds withheld, trust arrangements, or letters of credit. At December 31, 2022, we had one letter of credit facility\nwith a limit of $275.0 million (2021: $275.0 million). At December 31, 2022, we had issued letters of credit totaling $203.9\nmillion (2021: $136.8 million) to clients. Additionally, at December 31, 2022, we had pledged $463.7 million (2021: $497.1\nmillion) as collateral through trust arrangements.\nCompetition\nThe reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete with major reinsurers, most of which are well-established\nand have significant operating histories, strong financial strength ratings, and long-standing client relationships.\nOur competitors vary according to the individual market and situation. Generally, they include Arch Capital, Axis,\nEverest Re, Hamilton Re, Hannover Re, RenaissanceRe, SiriusPoint, and smaller companies, other niche reinsurers, and\nLloyd’s syndicates and their related entities. Although we seek to provide coverage where capacity and alternatives are limited,\nwe directly compete with these and other larger companies due to the breadth of their coverage across the property and casualty\nmarket in substantially all lines of business. See “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business – Competitors\nwith greater resources may make it difficult for us to effectively market our products or offer our products at a profit.”\nRatings\nOur current “A- (Excellent)” rating with a stable outlook from A.M. Best is the fourth highest of 13 ratings. We believe a\nstrong rating is important in marketing reinsurance products to clients and brokers. These ratings reflect the rating agency’s\nopinion of our reinsurance subsidiaries’ financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet obligations. It is not an\nevaluation directed toward the investors’ protection or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our Class A ordinary shares.\nThe failure to maintain a strong rating may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business\nstrategy. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business — A downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best\nratings would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy.”\n10\nLink to Table of Contents\nRegulations\nCayman Islands Insurance Regulation\nThe legislative framework for conducting insurance and reinsurance business in and from within the Cayman Islands is\ncomposed of The Insurance Act, 2010 (as amended) and underlying regulations thereto (the “Act”), which became effective in\nthe Cayman Islands on November 1, 2012.\nGreenlight Re holds a Class D insurer license issued in accordance with the terms of the Act and is subject to regulation\nand supervision by CIMA.\nAs the holder of a Class D insurer license, Greenlight Re is permitted to carry on reinsurance business from the Cayman\nIslands but, except with the prior written approval of CIMA, may not carry on any insurance or reinsurance business where the\nunderlying risk originates and resides in the Cayman Islands.\nGreenlight Re is required to comply with the following principal requirements under the Act:\n● to maintain capital and a margin of solvency in accordance with the capital and solvency requirements\nprescribed by the Act;\n● to carry on its business in accordance with its business plan and the laws of the Cayman Islands, including the\nregulatory laws, regulations, rules, and statements of guidance, where applicable;\n● to maintain adequate arrangements, including internal controls, for the management of risks and a system of\ngovernance as approved by CIMA;\n● to maintain a minimum of at least two directors and to seek the prior approval of CIMA in respect of the\nappointment of directors and officers and to provide CIMA with information in connection therewith and\nnotification of any changes thereto;\n● to have a place of business in the Cayman Islands and to maintain such resources, including staff and facilities,\nbooks and records as CIMA considers appropriate, having regard for the nature and scale of the business of\nGreenlight Re;\n● to submit to CIMA an annual return in the prescribed form together with:\n- financial statements prepared in accordance with internationally recognized accounting standards, audited by\nan independent auditor approved by CIMA;\n- an actuarial valuation of Greenlight Re’s assets and liabilities, certified by an actuary approved by CIMA;\n- certification of solvency prepared by a person approved by CIMA in accordance with the prescribed\nrequirements;\n- confirmation that the information contained in Greenlight Re’s license application, as modified by any\nsubsequent changes, remains correct and up to date;\n- such other information as may be prescribed by CIMA; and\n● to pay an annual license fee.\nIt is the duty of CIMA:\n● to maintain a general review of insurance practices in the Cayman Islands;\n● to examine the affairs or business of any licensee or other person carrying on, or who has carried on, insurance\nbusiness to ensure that the Act has been complied with and that the licensee is in a sound financial position and\nis carrying on its business in a fit and proper manner;\n● to examine and report on the annual returns delivered to CIMA in terms of the Act; and\n● to examine and make recommendations with respect to, among other things, proposals for the revocation of\nlicenses and cases of suspected insolvency of licensed entities.\nGreenlight Re is also required to comply with, amongst other standards, the Rule on Corporate Governance for Insurers,\nthe Rule on Risk Management for Insurers, and the Rule on Investment Activities for Insurers and the associated Statement of\nGuidance. Respectively, these rules require regulated insurers to establish and maintain (a) a corporate governance framework\nthat provides for the sound and prudent management and oversight of the insurer's business, including outsourcing and internal\ncontrols, and which adequately recognizes and protects the interests of its policyholders, and (b) a risk management framework\nthat is capable of promptly identifying, measuring, assessing, reporting, monitoring and controlling all sources of risks that\ncould have a material impact on its operations, and (c) implement investment activities that consider all of Greenlight Re’s risks\nand solvency requirements.\n11\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe Act provides that where CIMA believes a licensee is committing, or is about to commit or pursue, an act that is an\nunsafe or unsound business practice, CIMA may direct the licensee to cease or refrain from committing the act or pursuing the\noffending course of conduct. Failure to comply with such a CIMA direction may be punishable on summary conviction by a\nfine of up to 100,000 Cayman Islands dollars (approximately US$120,000) or to imprisonment for a term of five years or to\nboth, and on conviction on indictment to a fine of 500,000 Cayman Islands dollars (approximately US$600,000) or to\nimprisonment for a term of ten years or to both and to an additional 10,000 Cayman Islands dollars (approximately US$12,000)\nfor every day after conviction that the breach continues.\nThe Monetary Authority Act (“MAA”) also provides CIMA with the authority to impose administrative fines on\nlicensees. The recent Monetary Authority (Administrative Fines) (Amendment) Regulations, 2020 (the “Amendment\nRegulations”) came into force on 26 June 2020. They extended the scope of the fines CIMA may impose for breaches of a\nrange of regulatory laws, including the Act. Breaches are categorized as minor, serious, or very serious, and, depending on the\ncategory of the breach, fines range from US$6,100 to US$1,220,000 per breach for very serious breaches. Where a breach is\ncommitted by a corporate entity and is shown to have been committed with the consent, connivance, knowledge, or neglect of\nan individual, that individual may also be subject to an administrative fine.\nWhenever CIMA believes that a licensee is or may become unable to meet its obligations as they fall due, is carrying on\nbusiness in a manner likely to be detrimental to the public interest or the interests of its creditors or policyholders, has\ncontravened the terms of the Act or has otherwise behaved in such a manner to cause CIMA to call into question the licensee’s\nfitness, CIMA may take one of several steps. The steps include requiring the licensee to rectify the matter, suspending the\nlicense of the licensee, revoking the license, imposing conditions upon the license and amending or revoking any such\ncondition, requiring the substitution of any director, manager, or officer of the licensee, at the expense of the licensee,\nappointing a person to advise the licensee on the proper conduct of its affairs and to report to CIMA thereon, at the expense of\nthe licensee, appointing a person to assume control of the licensee’s affairs or otherwise requiring such action to be taken by the\nlicensee as CIMA considers necessary. We have not been subject to any such actions from CIMA to date.\nOther Regulations in the Cayman Islands\nAs Cayman Islands exempted companies, Greenlight Capital Re and Greenlight Re may not carry on business or trade\nlocally in the Cayman Islands except in furtherance of their business outside the Cayman Islands and are prohibited from\nsoliciting the public of the Cayman Islands to subscribe for any of their securities or debt. Both these companies are further\nrequired to file a return with the Registrar of Companies in January of each year (“Annual Return”) and to pay an annual\nregistration fee at that time.\nEconomic substance law requiring a “relevant entity” conducting “relevant activity” to file notifications and, unless\nexempt, to report to the Tax Information Authority (“TIA”) and maintain economic substance has been introduced in the\nCayman Islands.\nThe International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Act (2020 Revision) and International Tax Co-operation\n(Economic Substance) Regulations, 2020, were published on January 14, 2020, and August 11, 2020, respectively, and\nsubsequently amended (together, the “ES Act”). The latest version of the Guidance on Economic Substance for Geographically\nMobile Activities (“ES Guidance”) was published in July 2022.\nCommencing January 2020, Greenlight Capital Re and Greenlight Re are required to confirm their economic substance\nclassification and submit this classification to the TIA as a prerequisite to the Annual Return filing.\nThe Cayman Islands has no exchange controls restricting dealings in currencies or securities.\nIreland Insurance Regulations\nOur Irish subsidiary, GRIL, is authorized as a non-life reinsurance undertaking by the CBI in accordance with the\nEuropean Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 (the \"Irish Regulations\"). The Irish Regulations give effect in\nIreland to EU Directive 2009/138/EC (known as \"Solvency II\"), which introduced a new European regulatory regime for\ninsurers and reinsurers with effect from January 1, 2016. Solvency II is supplemented by the European Commission Delegated\nRegulation (EU) 2015/35, other European Commission “delegated acts” and binding technical standards, and guidelines issued\nby the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (“Delegated Acts and Guidelines”). GRIL is required to\ncomply at all times with the Irish Regulations, the Irish Insurance Acts 1909 to 2018, regulations relating to insurance business\nor reinsurance business promulgated under the European Communities Act 1972, the Irish Central Bank Acts 1942 to 2018 as\namended, regulations promulgated thereunder and directions, guidelines and codes of conduct issued by CBI (collectively the\n12\nLink to Table of Contents\n“Irish Insurance Acts and Regulations”). In addition, GRIL is required to comply with the Delegated Acts and Guidelines and\nmust meet risk-based solvency requirements imposed under Solvency II on insurers and reinsurers across all member states,\nincluding Ireland. Solvency II and the Delegated Acts and Guidelines set out classification and eligibility requirements,\nincluding the characteristics that capital, including any capital contribution, must display to qualify as regulatory capital.\nGRIL is also required to comply with the European Union (Insurance Distribution) Regulations 2018 (the \"2018\nRegulations\"), which apply to distributors of insurance and reinsurance products (including insurers and reinsurers). The 2018\nRegulations give effect in Ireland to Directive (EU) 2016/97 (known as the \"IDD\") and strengthen the regulatory regime\napplicable to distribution activities through increased transparency, information, and conduct requirements. On May 25, 2018,\nthe General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") came into force across the EU. The GDPR significantly increases\norganizations’ obligations and responsibilities in collecting, using, storing, and protecting personal data. Organizations in\nbreach of the GDPR may incur sizable financial penalties up to, the higher of €10 million or 4% of annual global turnover.\nUK Regulations\nLloyd’s Oversight\nSyndicate 3456 is subject to oversight by Lloyd’s, substantially effected through the Lloyd’s Council. Our business plan\nfor Syndicate 3456, including maximum underwriting capacity, requires annual approval by Lloyd’s. Lloyd’s may require\nchanges to any business plan presented to it or additional capital to be provided to support the underwriting plan. We have\ndeposited certain assets with Lloyd’s to support GCM’s underwriting business at Lloyd’s.\nBy entering into a membership agreement with Lloyd’s, GCM has undertaken to comply with all Lloyd’s by-laws and\nregulations as well as the provisions of the Lloyd’s Acts and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended by the\nFinancial Services Act 2012. This arrangement subjects us to the following:\n● Capital Requirements. The underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd’s must be supported by providing a\ndeposit, referred to as “Funds at Lloyd’s” or “FAL,” in an amount determined on the basis of such entity’s\nsolvency and capital requirements. The amount of such deposit is calculated for each member through the\ncompletion of an annual capital adequacy exercise. In addition, if the FAL are not sufficient to cover all losses,\nthe Lloyd’s Central Fund provides an additional level of security for policyholders. Dividends from a Lloyd’s\nmanaging agent and a Lloyd’s corporate member can be declared and paid provided the relevant company has\nsufficient profits available for distribution.\n● Ratings. The financial security of the Lloyd’s market as a whole is regularly assessed by three independent\nrating agencies (A.M. Best, S&P and Fitch). Syndicates at Lloyd’s take their financial security rating from the\nrating of the Lloyd’s market. A satisfactory credit rating issued by an accredited rating agency is necessary for\nLloyd’s syndicates to be able to trade in certain classes of business at current levels.\n● Intervention Powers. The Lloyd’s Council has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting at\nLloyd’s, including, the power to withdraw a member’s permission to underwrite business or to underwrite a\nparticular class of business and to change the basis on which syndicate expenses are allocated.\n● Assessments. If Lloyd’s determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it has the power to assess\npremium levies on current Lloyd’s members up to 5% of a member’s underwriting capacity in any one year.\nPRA and FCA Regulation.\nThe Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) regulate all financial\nservices firms in the U.K. including the Lloyd’s market, and Syndicate 3456, and have substantial powers of intervention in\nrelation to regulated firms. Lloyd’s is required to implement certain rules prescribed by the PRA and the FCA. If it appears to\neither the PRA or the FCA that either Lloyd’s is not fulfilling its delegated regulatory responsibilities or that managing agents\nare not complying with the applicable regulatory rules and guidance, the PRA or the FCA may intervene at their discretion.\nLloyd’s is subject to an annual PRA solvency test which measures whether Lloyd’s has sufficient assets in the\naggregate to meet all outstanding liabilities of its members, both current and run-off. If Lloyd’s fails this test, the PRA may\nrequire the entire Lloyd’s market to cease underwriting or individual Lloyd’s members may be required to cease or reduce their\nunderwriting.\n13\nLink to Table of Contents\nOverview of Investments\nOur investment portfolio is managed by DME Advisors, LP (“DME Advisors”), a value-oriented investment advisor that\nanalyzes companies’ available financial data, business strategies, and prospects to identify undervalued and overvalued\nsecurities. DME Advisors is controlled by David Einhorn, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and the President of\nGreenlight Capital, Inc.\nWe have entered into an amended and restated exempted limited partnership agreement (the “SILP LPA”) of Solasglas\nInvestments, LP (“SILP”), with DME Advisors II, LLC (“DME II”), as General Partner, Greenlight Re, GRIL and the initial\nlimited partner (each, a “Partner”). We present our investment in SILP under the caption “Investment in related party\ninvestment fund” in our consolidated balance sheets.\nOn September 1, 2018, SILP entered into an investment advisory agreement (the “IAA”) with DME Advisors, with an\ninitial term ending on August 31, 2023, subject to automatic extensions for successive three-year terms. DME Advisors has the\ncontractual right to manage substantially all of our investable assets and is required to follow our investment guidelines and act\nin a fair and equitable manner in allocating investment opportunities to SILP. However, DME Advisors is not otherwise\nrestricted with respect to the nature or timing of making investments for SILP.\nOn February 26, 2019, effective as of September 1, 2018, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the SILP LPA. The\namendment revised the mechanics for calculating the Carryforward Account and Performance Allocation (as defined in the\nSILP LPA) to consider withdrawals from and subsequent recontributions of capital to SILP. On January 7, 2021, effective as of\nJanuary 1, 2021, we entered into a second amended and restated SILP LPA, which amended (a) the definition of “Additional\nInvestment Ratio” and (b) each of the defined terms “Greenlight Re Surplus” and “GRIL Surplus.” The amendment to the SILP\nLPA also incorporated the requirement that the Investment Portfolio, as defined in the SILP LPA, will not exceed 50% of\nGLRE Surplus. Effective January 1, 2023, we amended the SILP LPA to increase the maximum Investment Portfolio to 60% of\nGLRE Surplus.\nDME Advisors receives a monthly management fee at an annual rate of 1.5% of each limited partner’s Investment\nPortfolio, as provided in the SILP LPA. DME II receives a performance allocation based on the positive performance change of\neach limited partner’s capital account equal to 20% of net profits calculated per annum, subject to a loss carryforward provision.\nThe loss carryforward provision allows DME II to earn a reduced performance allocation of 10% on net profits in any\nyear after the year in which a limited partner’s capital account incurs a loss until the limited partner has recouped all losses and\nhas earned an additional amount equal to 150% of the loss. DME II is not entitled to a performance allocation in a year in which\na capital account incurs a loss.\nDME Advisors is required to follow our investment guidelines and act in a manner that it considers fair and equitable in\nallocating investment opportunities to us and SILP. However, the IAA does not otherwise impose any specific obligations or\nrequirements concerning the allocation of time, effort, or investment opportunities to us and SILP or any restrictions on the\nnature or timing of investments for our or SILP’s account or other accounts that DME Advisors or its affiliates may manage.\nDME Advisors can outsource to sub-advisors without our consent or approval. If DME Advisors and any of its affiliates\nattempt to invest in the same opportunity simultaneously, DME Advisors and its affiliates may allocate the opportunity as they\ndetermine reasonably. Affiliates of DME Advisors presently serve as the general partner or the investment advisor of\nGreenlight Capital, LP, Greenlight Capital Offshore Qualified, Ltd., GCOQ Intermediate, LP, Greenlight Capital Offshore\nPartners, Ltd., Greenlight Capital Investors, LP, Greenlight Capital Offshore Investors, Ltd., GCOI Intermediate, LP,\nGreenlight Capital Offshore Master, Ltd., Greenlight Masters, LP, Greenlight Masters Qualified, LP, Greenlight Masters\nOffshore, Ltd., Greenlight Masters Offshore I, Ltd., Greenlight Masters Offshore Partners and Greenlight Masters Partners\n(collectively, the “Greenlight Funds”).\nWe have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all our current and future subsidiaries to enter into the\nSILP LPA. Under the SILP LPA, we are contractually obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause substantially\nall investable assets of Greenlight Re and GRIL, with limited exceptions, to be contributed to SILP.\nWe have agreed to release DME II and DME Advisors and their affiliates from any liability arising out of the IAA or the\nSILP LPA, subject to certain exceptions. Furthermore, DME II has agreed to indemnify us against any liability incurred in\nconnection with certain actions.\nUnder the SILP LPA, either GLRE Limited Partner may voluntarily withdraw all or part of its capital account for its\noperating needs by giving DME II at least three business days’ notice. Either of the GLRE Limited Partners may withdraw as a\n14\nLink to Table of Contents\npartner and fully withdraw all of its capital account from SILP on three business days’ notice if the limited partner’s board\ndeclares that a cause for withdrawal exists as per the SILP LPA.\nInvestment Strategy\nDME Advisors implements a value-oriented investment strategy by taking long positions in perceived undervalued\nsecurities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities. DME Advisors aims to achieve high absolute returns while\nminimizing the risk of capital loss. DME Advisors attempts to determine the risk/return characteristics of potential investments\nby analyzing factors such as the risk that expected cash flows would not be achieved, the volatility of the cash flows, the\nleverage of the underlying business, and the security’s liquidity, among others.\nOur Board of Directors reviews our investment portfolio activities and oversees our investment guidelines to meet our\ninvestment objectives. We believe our investment approach, while generating returns less predictable than those of traditional\nfixed-income portfolios, complements our reinsurance business and will achieve higher rates of return over the long term than\nreinsurance companies that invest predominantly in fixed-income securities. We have designed our investment guidelines to\nmaintain adequate liquidity to fund our reinsurance operations.\nDME Advisors is contractually obligated to adhere to our investment guidelines and make investment decisions on our\nbehalf. These decisions may include buying publicly listed equity securities and corporate debt, selling securities short, and\ninvesting in private placements, futures, currencies, commodities, credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, sovereign debt,\nderivatives, and other instruments.\nInvestment Guidelines\nThe investment guidelines adopted by the respective Boards of Directors of Greenlight Re and GRIL, which may be\namended, modified, or waived from time to time, take into account restrictions imposed on us by regulators, our liability mix,\nrequirements to maintain an appropriate claims-paying rating by ratings agencies and requirements of lenders.\nAt the date hereof, Greenlight Re’s investment guidelines, which Greenlight Re’s board of directors may amend at any\ntime, are as follows:\n● Composition of Investments: At least 80% of the assets in its Investment Portfolio (as defined in the SILP LPA) will\nbe held in debt or equity securities (including swaps) of publicly-traded companies (or their subsidiaries),\ngovernments of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development high-income countries, cash, cash\nequivalents, and gold. No more than 10% of Greenlight Re Surplus (as defined in the SILP LPA) will be held in\nprivate equity securities.\n● Concentration of Investments: Other than cash, cash equivalents, United States government obligations, and gold, no\nsingle investment in its Investment Portfolio will constitute more than 10% of Greenlight Re Surplus.\n● Liquidity: Assets will be invested in such fashion that Greenlight Re has a reasonable expectation that it can meet any\nof its liabilities as they become due. Greenlight Re will review with the Investment Advisor the liquidity of the\nportfolio on periodic basis.\n● Monitoring: Greenlight Re will require the Investment Advisor to re-evaluate each position in its Investment Portfolio\nand to monitor changes in intrinsic value and trading value and provide monthly reports on its Investment Portfolio to\nGreenlight Re as Greenlight Re may reasonably determine.\n● Leverage: No new investments to increase net long exposure shall be made when Greenlight Re’s pro-rata share of\nAssets (excluding cash equivalents) exceeds its Investment Portfolio. In any event, Greenlight Re’s pro-rata share of\nAssets (excluding cash equivalents) may not exceed 110% of its Investment Portfolio.\n● Currency hedging activities are excluded from leverage calculations. In addition to currency hedging, where the\nInvestment Advisor enters into a secondary investment with the primary purpose of reducing the risk of another\nexisting investment, then the investment advisor may exclude the secondary investment from the calculation of\nleverage provided that the Investment Advisor receives approval from Greenlight Re’s Chief Financial Officer. Such\nauthority is limited such that no more than 10% of gross exposure may be excluded from leverage calculations and\nmay be netted from the primary investment for concentration limits.\n15\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe investment guidelines for GRIL are identical to Greenlight Re’s except for (a) currency hedging guidelines, which\ndo not apply to GRIL, and (b) Concentration of Investments and Credit default swaps, which for GRIL are as follows:\n● Concentration of Investments: Other than cash, cash equivalents, and United States government obligations, (1) no\nsingle investment in its Investment Portfolio will constitute more than 7.5% of GRIL Surplus (as defined in the SILP\nLPA), (2) the ten largest investments shall not constitute greater than 40% of GRIL Surplus, and (3) its Investment\nPortfolio shall at all times be composed of a minimum of 50 debt or equity securities of publicly traded companies\n(or their subsidiaries).\n● Credit default swaps: The sale of credit default swaps is prohibited.\nAt December 31, 2022, taking into account a waiver provided by the Board of Directors of Greenlight Re, relating to\nSILP’s concentration in a single investment, DME Advisors was in compliance with each of Greenlight Re’s and GRIL’s\ninvestment guidelines. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Investment Strategy — SILP may be\nconcentrated in a few large positions, which could result in investment volatility and large losses.”\nInvestment Results\nComposition\nThe following table summarizes the investments as reported in the consolidated financial statements:\nDecember 31\n2022 2021\n($ in thousands)\nInvestment in related party investment fund $ 178,197 71.7 % $ 183,591 79.5 %\nPrivate investments and unlisted equities 62,433 25.1 47,049 20.4\nDerivative financial instruments (not designated as hedging instruments) — — 335 0.1\nDebt and convertible debt securities 1,846 0.8 — —\nCertificates of deposit 6,000 2.4 — —\nTotal investments $ 248,476 100.0 % $ 230,975 100.0 %\nDME Advisors reports the composition of SILP’s portfolio on a delta-adjusted basis, which it believes is the appropriate\nmanner to assess the exposure and profile of investments and reflects how it manages the portfolio. An option’s delta is the\noption price’s sensitivity to the underlying stock (or commodity) price. The delta-adjusted basis is the number of shares or\ncontracts underlying the option multiplied by the delta and the underlying stock (or commodity) price.\nThe following table represents the composition of SILP’s investments at December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nDecember 31\n2022 2021\nLong % Short % Long % Short %\nDebt instruments 0.6 % — % 1.1 % — %\nEquities and related derivatives 84.4 49.7 79.1 45.0\nPrivate and unlisted equity securities 3.2 — 4.0 —\nTotal 88.2 % 49.7 % 84.2 % 45.0 %\nThe above exposure analysis does not include cash (U.S. dollar and foreign currencies), gold and other\ncommodities, credit default swaps, sovereign debt, foreign currency derivatives, interest rate options, and other macro positions.\nUnder this methodology, a total return swap’s exposure is reported at its full notional amount. Options are reported at their\ndelta-adjusted basis. At December 31, 2022, SILP’s exposure to gold on a delta-adjusted basis was 15.2% (2021: 8.1% ).\n16\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe following table represents the composition of SILP by industry sector at December 31, 2022:\nSector Long % Short % Net %\nCommunication Services 0.9 % (3.9) % (3.0) %\nConsumer Discretionary 29.8 (18.5) 11.3\nConsumer Staples 0.8 (0.6) 0.2\nEnergy 13.0 (0.2) 12.8\nFinancial 13.8 (3.4) 10.4\nHealthcare 6.8 (6.6) 0.2\nIndustrials 3.3 (4.2) (0.9)\nMaterials 7.6 — 7.6\nReal Estate 0.3 (2.3) (2.0)\nTechnology 10.3 (9.7) 0.6\nUtilities 0.3 (0.3) —\nOther 1.3 — 1.3\nTotal 88.2 % (49.7) % 38.5 %\nThe following table represents the composition of our investments in SILP, by the market capitalization of the\nunderlying security, at December 31, 2022:\nCapitalization Long % Short % Net %\nMega Cap Equity (≥$25 billion) 12.6 % (14.8) % (2.2) %\nLarge Cap Equity (≥$10 billion and <$25 billion) 5.8 (9.3) (3.5)\nMid Cap Equity (≥$2 billion and <$10 billion) 43.5 (20.0) 23.5\nSmall Cap Equity (<$2 billion) 22.5 (5.6) 16.9\nDebt Instruments 0.6 — 0.6\nOther Investments 3.2 — 3.2\nTotal 88.2 % (49.7) % 38.5 %\nInvestment Returns\nIn accordance with the SILP LPA, DME Advisors constructs a levered investment portfolio as agreed with the Company\n(the “Investment Portfolio” as defined in the SILP LPA). Investment returns, net of all fees and expenses, by quarter for the last\nfive years are as follows: (1)\nQuarter 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018\n1st 1.7 % 1.5 % (8.1) % 6.2 % (11.8) %\n2nd 4.9 (0.9) 0.3 2.7 (3.8)\n3rd 3.6 (2.7) 1.4 1.2 (8.4)\n4th 13.4 9.9 8.4 (1.0) (10.2)\nFull Year 25.3 % 7.5 % 1.4 % 9.3 % (30.3) %\n(1) Investment returns are calculated monthly and compounded to calculate the quarterly and annual returns generated by our\nInvestment Portfolio. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. The monthly investment return is\ncalculated by dividing the investment income/loss (net of fees and expenses) by the Investment Portfolio. Effective January 1,\n2021, the Investment Portfolio is calculated on the basis of 50% of GLRE Surplus, or the shareholders’ equity of Greenlight\nCapital Re, Ltd., as reported in Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd.’s then most recent quarterly financial statements prepared in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). It is adjusted\nmonthly for the Company’s net profits and net losses as reported by SILP during any intervening period. This basis was\nincreased to 60% effective January 1, 2023. Prior to January 1, 2021, the Investment Portfolio was calculated on the basis of\nseveral factors, including the Companies’ shares of SILP’s net asset value, collateral posted by the Companies, and the\nCompanies’ net reserves.\n17\nLink to Table of Contents\nInternal Risk Management\nOur Chief Risk Officer is responsible for constructing and reviewing our internal risk management function. A primary\nobjective of our risk management function is to ensure that our underwriting efforts comply with explicitly stated underwriting\nappetites. We design these appetites to balance our risk position size with our expertise and the available margins while\ncontaining the cost of incorrectly assessing risks and rewards. In doing so, our risk management function designs, implements,\nand oversees a range of operational and underwriting controls to support the organization. We frequently review our investment\nand underwriting portfolios to assess the impact on capital under stressed scenarios. With the assistance of DME Advisors, we\nanalyze our investment assets and liabilities, including the numerous risk components in our portfolio, such as concentration\nand liquidity risks.\nInformation Technology\nWe have most of our information technology infrastructure primarily at an off-site, secure data center hosted by\nMicrosoft. We have increased our use of cloud-based services as the security and reliability have proven cost-effective and\nprovide the high levels of service and redundancy required.\nWe have implemented backup procedures to ensure we save key data daily and that we can restore it promptly as needed.\nWe have a disaster recovery plan for our information technology infrastructure that includes data and system snapshots\nwith restore points. We believe we can access our core systems with minor outages and restore our primary systems within our\nmean time to restore.\nWe protect our information systems with physical, electronic, and software safeguards considered appropriate by our\nmanagement. We employ a specialist vendor to monitor our systems for security events and risks within our network. We\nregularly provide security risk awareness education and training to our staff. Despite these efforts, computer viruses, hackers,\nemployee misuse or misconduct, and other internal or external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches,\ncyber-attacks, or other disruptions. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Operational risks,\nincluding human or systems failures, are inherent in our business.” and “— Technology breaches or failures, including\nthose resulting from a malicious ransomware or cyber-attack on us or our business partners and service providers, could\ndisrupt or otherwise negatively impact our business.”\nHuman Capital\nAt March 3, 2023, we had 48 full-time employees, 31 of whom were based in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, 12 in\nDublin, Ireland, and 5 in London, United Kingdom. We believe that our employee relations are good. None of our employees\nare subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements. We\nalso engage consultants and contract with third parties, as needed, to provide additional resources to support our business\nactivities.\nWe are committed to advancement and innovation through investing in our employees’ professional development. We\nhave implemented an employee training and development policy to encourage our employees to take advantage of training and\ndevelopment opportunities.\nWe have designed our performance-driven compensation policy to attract and retain talent. We use short-term\ncompensation composed of base salary and annual cash bonuses and long-term compensation composed of stock options,\nrestricted share units, and restricted shares, as applicable, to align our employees’ and executive officers’ interests with those of\nour shareholders. In addition, from time to time and under certain circumstances, we award sign-on bonuses, retention bonuses,\nand other bonus opportunities. We also offer welfare benefits and other perquisites, including a defined contribution pension\nplan and medical insurance coverage for our employees. As part of our commitment to supporting our employees, we match\nany contributions made by our employees to charities and not-for-profit organizations.\nWe believe our employees are fairly compensated without regard to gender, race, and ethnicity. We believe in creating\nand maintaining a workplace free from discrimination and harassment. Each of our employees annually acknowledges\ncomplying with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which provides employees with access to an anonymous\nwhistleblower hotline to report any violations. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website.\n18\nLink to Table of Contents\nAdditional Information\nOur website address is www.greenlightre.com, and we make available, free of charge, on or through our website, links to\nour annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and other documents we\nfile with or furnish to the SEC, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to\nthe SEC.

Health insurance provides\ncoverage for medicine, visits to the doctor or emergency room, hospital stays, and\nother medical expenses.\nAcquisition costs Ceding commissions, profit commissions, brokerage fees, premium taxes, and\nother direct expenses relating directly to premium production.\nAcquisition cost ratio The acquisition cost ratio is calculated by dividing net acquisition costs by net\npremiums earned.\nActuary A person professionally trained in the mathematical and technical aspects of\ninsurance and related fields, particularly in calculating premiums, loss reserves,\nand other values.\nBroker An intermediary who negotiates contracts of insurance or reinsurance, receiving a\ncommission for placement and other services rendered, between (1) a policyholder\nand a primary insurer, on behalf of the policyholder, (2) a primary insurer and a\nreinsurer, on behalf of the primary insurer, or (3) a reinsurer and a retrocessionaire,\non behalf of the reinsurer.\nCapacity Capacity is the percentage of surplus that an insurer or reinsurer is willing or able\nto place at risk or the dollar amount of exposure it is willing to assume. Capacity\nmay apply to a single risk, a program, a business line, or an entire book of\nbusiness. Capacity may be constrained by legal restrictions, corporate restrictions,\nor indirect financial restrictions such as capital adequacy requirements.\nCasualty reinsurance Casualty reinsurance is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to\nthird persons (persons other than the policyholder) and the legal liability imposed\non the policyholder resulting therefrom. Casualty reinsurance includes but is not\nlimited to workers’ compensation, automobile liability, and general liability. A\ngreater degree of unpredictability is generally associated with casualty risks known\nas ‘‘long-tail risks,’’ where losses take time to become known, and a claim may be\nseparated from the circumstances that caused it by several years. An example of a\nlong-tail casualty risk includes the use of certain drugs that may cause cancer or\nbirth defects. There tends to be a greater delay in the reporting and settlement of\ncasualty reinsurance claims due to the long-tail nature of the underlying casualty\nrisks and their greater potential for litigation.\nCatastrophe A severe loss, typically involving multiple claimants. Common perils include\nearthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, hailstorms, tornados, derechos, severe winter\nweather, floods, fires, explosions, volcanic eruptions, and other natural or human-\nmade disasters.

The amount of the deposit is related to the member's premium income\nlimit and also the nature of the underwriting account.\nGross premiums written Total premiums for assumed reinsurance during a given period.\nHealth insurance Insurance against loss by illness or bodily injury. Health insurance covers\nmedicine, visits to the doctor or emergency room, hospital stays, and other medical\nexpenses.\nIncurred but not reported (IBNR) Reserves for estimated loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by insureds and\nreinsureds but not yet reported to the insurer or reinsurer, including unknown\nfuture developments on loss and loss adjustment expenses known to the insurer or\nreinsurer.\nLloyd’s Depending on the context, this term may refer to - (a) the society of individual and\ncorporate underwriting members that insure and reinsure risks as members of one\nor more syndicates. Lloyd’s is not an insurance company; (b) the underwriting\nroom in the Lloyd’s Building in which managing agents underwrite insurance and\nreinsurance on behalf of their syndicate members. In this sense, Lloyd’s should be\nunderstood as a marketplace; or (c) the Corporation of Lloyd’s, which regulates\nand provides support services to the Lloyd’s market.\nLoss adjustment expenses (LAE) The expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees, and the portion of\ngeneral expenses allocated to claim settlement costs. Also known as claim\nadjustment expenses.\nLoss ratio The loss ratio is calculated by dividing net loss and loss adjustment expenses\nincurred by net premiums earned.\nLoss reserves and loss adjustment Liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect the estimated cost of\nexpense reserves claims payments and the related expenses that the insurer or reinsurer will\nultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance or reinsurance contracts it has\nwritten. Reserves are established for losses and loss adjustment expenses and\nconsist of reserves established for individual reported claims and incurred but not\nreported losses.\nMulti-line Contracts that cover more than one line of business.\nNet financial impact The net impact of prior period loss development after taking into account net\nlosses and loss expenses incurred, earned reinstatement premiums assumed and\nceded, and adjustments to assumed and ceded acquisition costs and profit\ncommissions.\nNet premiums written An insurer’s gross premiums written, less premiums ceded to reinsurers.\nNon-admitted insurers An insurer not licensed to do business in the jurisdiction in question.

This coverage includes errors and omissions policies,\ndirectors and officers coverage, and specialty coverage like employment practices\nliability insurance.\nProfit commission A commission paid by a reinsurer to a ceding insurer based on a predetermined\npercentage of the profit realized by the reinsurer on the ceded business.\n20\nLink to Table of Contents\nProperty insurance Property insurance covers a business’s building and its contents—money and\nsecurities, records, inventory, furniture, machinery, supplies, and even intangible\nassets such as trademarks—when damage, theft, or loss occurs.\nProperty catastrophe reinsurance Property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are typically ‘‘all risk’’ in nature,\nprotecting against losses from natural and human-made catastrophes. Losses on\nthese contracts typically stem from direct property damage and business\ninterruption.\nProportional reinsurance All forms of reinsurance in which the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the\noriginal premiums and losses of the reinsured. In proportional reinsurance, the\nreinsurer generally pays the client a ceding commission. The ceding commission is\ngenerally based on the client’s cost of acquiring the business being reinsured\n(including commissions, premium taxes, assessments, and miscellaneous\nadministrative expenses) and may include a profit component. Frequently referred\nto as quota-share reinsurance.\nQuota-share reinsurance A form of proportional reinsurance in which the reinsurer assumes an agreed\npercentage of each underlying insurance contract being reinsured.\nReinstatement premium Premium charged for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage to\nits full amount otherwise reduced as a result of a reinsurance loss payment.\nReinsurance An arrangement in which a reinsurer agrees to indemnify an insurance company,\nthe client, against all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the client\nunder one or more policies.

Reinsurance also provides a client with additional\nunderwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and write more\nbusiness than would be possible without a related increase in capital and surplus,\nand facilitates the maintenance of acceptable financial ratios by the client.\nReinsurance does not legally discharge the client from its liability with respect to\nits obligations to the insured.\nReinsurer An insurance company that assumes part of the risk in exchange for part of the\npremium to a primary insurer.\nRetrocession; retrocessional coverage A transaction whereby a reinsurer cedes to another reinsurer, commonly referred to\nas the retrocessionaire, all or part of the reinsurance that the first reinsurer has\nassumed. Retrocessional reinsurance does not legally discharge the ceding\nreinsurer from its liability with respect to its obligations to the reinsured.\nRisk-free rate The interest rate on a riskless or safe asset, usually taken to be a short-term U.S.\ngovernment security.\nRisk transfer The shifting of all or a part of a risk to another party.\nSeverity business Insurance/reinsurance characterized by contracts containing the potential for\nsignificant losses emanating from one event.\nSurety and fidelity insurance Surety and fidelity insurance includes (1) insurance guaranteeing the fidelity of\npersons holding positions of public or private trust; (2) insurance guaranteeing the\nperformance of contracts other than insurance policies and guaranteeing and\nexecuting bonds, undertakings, and contracts of suretyship; and (3) insurance\nindemnifying banks, bankers, brokers, financial or moneyed corporations or\nassociations against loss.\nUnderwriter An insurance or reinsurance company employee who examines, accepts, or rejects\nrisks and classifies risks to charge an appropriate premium for each accepted risk.\nUnderwriting The process of evaluating, defining, and pricing reinsurance risks including, where\nappropriate, the rejection of such risks, and the acceptance of the obligation to pay\nthe reinsured under the terms of the contract.\nUnderwriting expense Underwriting expenses include those expenses directly related to underwriting\nactivities that are not eligible to be capitalized and an allocation of other general\nand administrative expenses.\nUnderwriting expense ratio The underwriting expense ratio includes those expenses directly related to\nunderwriting activities and an allocation of other general and administrative\nexpenses. Therefore, the underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting\nexpenses to net premiums earned. The underwriting expense ratio also incorporates\ninterest income and expenses from deposit-accounted contracts.\n21\nLink to Table of Contents\nWorkers’ compensation insurance Workers’ compensation insurance provides medical, disability, and lost-wage\nbenefits to employees for injuries and illness sustained in the course of their\nemployment.\n22\nLink to Table of Contents\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial\ncondition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business\nor results of operations.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\n• Our results of operations fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\n• A downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement\nour business strategy.\n• If our losses and loss adjustment expenses greatly exceed our loss reserves, our financial condition may be materially\nand adversely affected.\n• Our property and casualty reinsurance operations make us vulnerable to losses from catastrophes and may cause our\nresults of operations to vary significantly from period to period.\n• The inability to obtain business provided from brokers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Insurance and Other Regulations\n• Any suspension or revocation of any of our licenses would materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations\n• Our reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these\nrequirements could subject us to regulatory action.\n• We are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under U.S. federal securities law.\n• A failure by Syndicate 3456 to comply with rules and regulations could materially and adversely interfere with our\nbusiness strategy.\nRisks Relating to Our SILP Investment Strategy\n• Our investment performance depends in part on the performance of SILP and may suffer as a result of adverse\nfinancial market developments or other factors that impact SILP’s liquidity, which could materially and adversely\naffect our investment results, financial condition and results of operations.\n• SILP may be concentrated in a few large positions, which could result in material adverse valuation movements.\n• Under the SILP LPA, we are contractually obligated to invest substantially all our assets in SILP with certain\nexceptions. SILP’s performance depends on the ability of DME Advisors to select and manage appropriate\ninvestments.\nRisks Relating to Our Innovations Strategy\n• The carry values of our Innovations investments may differ significantly from those that would be used if we carried\nthese investments at fair value.\n• Our Innovations investments support our underwriting operations and the failure to identify and consummate\ninvestment opportunities may materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy.\n• Investments in privately held early-stage companies involve significant risks.\n23\nLink to Table of Contents\nRisks Relating to Our Class A Ordinary Shares\n• Our level of debt may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, restrict our current and future operations, particularly\nour ability to respond to business opportunities, and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry\nconditions.\n• We may not be able to repay or refinance our convertible notes, pay interest on the convertible notes, or settle\nconversions of the convertible notes in cash or to repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change, and our\nfuture debt, if any, may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible\nnotes.\n• Provisions of our Articles, the Companies Act of the Cayman Islands (the “Companies Act”) and our corporate\nstructure may each impede a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of our Class A ordinary shares.\nRisks Relating to Taxation\n• Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re and/or GRIL may be subject to United States federal income taxation.\n• United States persons who own Class A ordinary shares may be subject to United States federal income taxation on\nour undistributed earnings and may recognize ordinary income upon disposition of Class A ordinary shares.\n• The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”) may cause us to undertake changes to the manner in which we\nconduct our business and could subject United States persons who own Class A ordinary shares to United States\nincome taxation on our undistributed earnings.\n• The impact of the initiative of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the\nEuropean Union (“EU”) to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in the\nCayman Islands, where we are exempt from income taxes.\nAdditional details relating to the above and other risk factors are described below:\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur results of operations fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\nOur results of operations fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including:\n● our assessment of the quality of available reinsurance and renewal opportunities;\n● loss experience on our reinsurance contracts;\n● reinsurance contract pricing;\n● the volume and mix of reinsurance products we underwrite; and\n● our ability to assess and integrate our risk management strategy.\nIn addition, our SILP investment strategy and Innovations investments are likely to be more volatile than traditional\nfixed-income portfolios composed primarily of investment-grade bonds. See “— Risks Relating to Our SILP Investment\nStrategy” and “— Risks Relating to Our Innovations Investments.” Accordingly, our short-term results of operations may not\nbe indicative of our long-term prospects.\nA downgrade or withdrawal of our A.M. Best ratings would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our\nbusiness strategy.\nIf A.M. Best downgrades or withdraws either of our ratings, we could be severely limited or prevented from writing any\nnew reinsurance contracts, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy.\nAdditionally, if A.M. Best downgrades or withdraws our ratings, we cannot provide assurance that our regulators, the Cayman\nIslands Monetary Authority and the Central Bank of Ireland, would continue to authorize our current business strategy and\ninvestment strategy. See “—Risks Relating to Insurance and Other Regulations – Any suspension or revocation of our\nreinsurance licenses would materially and adversely impact our ability to do business and implement our business strategy.”\n24\nLink to Table of Contents\nGreenlight Re’s A.M. Best rating of “A- (Excellent)” with a stable outlook is the fourth highest of 13 ratings that A.M.\nBest issues. A.M. Best periodically reviews our ratings and may revise one or more of our ratings downward or revoke them at\nits sole discretion based primarily on its analysis of our balance sheet strength, operating performance, and business profile.\nPotential developments that may affect such an analysis include:\n● if A.M. Best alters its capital adequacy assessment methodology in a manner that would adversely affect the rating of\nour reinsurance entities;\n● if A.M. Best alters its approach regarding our SILP investment strategy or our Innovations investments;\n● if our actual losses significantly exceed our loss reserves;\n● if unfavorable financial or market trends impact us;\n● if we change our business practices from our organizational business plan in a manner that no longer supports our\nA.M. Best ratings;\n● if we are unable to retain our senior management and other key personnel or implement succession plans; or\n● if our investments incur significant losses.\nIf A.M. Best downgrades or withdraws either of our ratings, we could be severely limited or prevented from writing new\nor renewal reinsurance contracts, which would materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy. In\naddition, substantially all of our assumed reinsurance contracts contain provisions that permit our clients to cancel the contract\nor require additional collateral in the event of a downgrade in our A.M. Best ratings below specified levels or a reduction of our\ncapital or surplus below specified levels over the course of the agreement.\nWe expect that similar provisions will also be included in future contracts. Whether a client would exercise such\ncancellation rights would likely depend on, among other things, the prevailing market conditions, the degree of unexpired\ncoverage, and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage. We cannot predict how many of our clients\nwould ultimately exercise such rights. The exercise of such rights in the aggregate could significantly affect our financial\ncondition, results of operations, and our underwriting capacity.\nIf our losses and loss adjustment expenses greatly exceed our loss reserves, our financial condition may be materially and\nadversely affected.\nOur results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to accurately assess the potential losses and loss\nadjustment expenses associated with the risks we reinsure. Reserves are liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to\nreflect the estimated cost of claims payments and the related expenses that the insurer or reinsurer will ultimately be required to\npay in respect of insurance or reinsurance contracts it has written. The Company estimates these reserves based upon facts and\ncircumstances then known, estimates of future trends in claim severity, and other variable factors. The inherent uncertainties\nassociated with estimating loss reserves are generally greater for reinsurance companies than for primary insurance companies\ndue primarily to:\n● the lapse of time from the occurrence of an event to the reporting of the claim and the ultimate resolution or\nsettlement of the claim;\n● the settlement delays associated with the reporting delays;\n● the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties;\n● the necessary reliance on clients for information regarding claims; and\n● other macro-economic changes which may impact reserves generally.\nOur reserve estimates may be less reliable than the reserve estimations of a reinsurer with a greater volume of business\nand more established loss history. Actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid may deviate substantially from the estimates\nof our loss reserves contained in our financial statements and could negatively affect our results of operations. If we determine\nour loss reserves to be inadequate, we will increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income and\ncapital in the period in which we identify the deficiency. If our losses and loss adjustment expenses greatly exceed our loss\nreserves, our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. For a summary of the effects of reserve re-\nestimation on prior year reserves and net income, see “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates, Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves”.\nWe may need additional capital in the future in order to operate our business, and such capital may not be available to us or\nmay not be available to us on favorable terms.\n25\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future through public or private equity or debt offerings or otherwise in\norder to:\n● repay our convertible notes;\n● fund liquidity needs or replace lost capital resulting from underwriting or investment losses;\n● meet rating agency capital requirements;\n● satisfy collateral requirements that may be imposed by our clients or by regulators;\n● meet applicable statutory jurisdiction requirements; or\n● respond to competitive pressures.\nAdditional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. Increases in interest rates could result in higher\ninterest expense on our outstanding debt. Further, any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute existing\nownership interest in our company and may cause the market price of our Class A ordinary shares to decline. Additional capital\nraised through the issuance of debt may result in creditors having rights, preferences, and privileges senior or otherwise superior\nto those of our Class A ordinary shares.\nCompetitors with greater resources may make it difficult for us to effectively market our products or offer our products at a\nprofit.\nThe reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete with major reinsurers, many of which have substantially\ngreater financial, marketing, and management resources than we do, including Arch Capital, Axis, Everest Re, Hamilton Re,\nHannover Re, Renaissance Re, and Sirius Point, as well as smaller companies, other niche reinsurers, and Lloyd’s syndicates\nand their related entities. Competition in the types of business that we underwrite is based on many factors, including:\n● the perceived financial strength and general reputation of the reinsurer, including its level of service, trustworthiness,\nbusiness practices, and other subjective matters;\n● ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;\n● relationships with reinsurance brokers;\n● pricing;\n● terms and conditions of products offered;\n● speed of claims payment; and\n● the experience and reputation of the members of our underwriting team in the particular lines of reinsurance we seek\nto underwrite.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the reinsurance market. Our failure to compete\neffectively could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and may increase the\nlikelihood that we will be deemed a passive foreign investment company or an investment company. See “— Risks Relating to\nTaxation — United States persons who own Class A ordinary shares may be subject to United States federal income taxation\non our undistributed earnings and may recognize ordinary income upon disposition of Class A ordinary shares.” and “—Risks\nRelating to Insurance and Other Regulations — We are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under\nU.S. federal securities law.”\nConsolidation in the reinsurance industry could adversely affect us.\nThe reinsurance industry, including our competitors, customers, and insurance and reinsurance brokers, has experienced\nsignificant consolidation over the last several years. Consolidated entities may try to use their enhanced market power to\nnegotiate price reductions for our products and services. If competitive pressures reduce our prices, we would expect to write\nless business. If the insurance industry further consolidates, competition for customers may intensify, and the importance of\nacquiring and servicing each customer may become greater. We could incur greater expenses relating to customer acquisition\nand retention, further reducing our operating margins. In addition, insurance companies that merge may be able to spread their\nrisks across a larger capital base so that they require less reinsurance. The number of companies offering retrocessional\nreinsurance may decline. Reinsurance intermediaries could also consolidate, potentially adversely impacting our ability to\naccess business and distribute our products. We could also experience more robust competition from larger, better-capitalized\ncompetitors. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\n26\nLink to Table of Contents\nInflation may adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nSteps taken by governments throughout the world in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, expansionary monetary\npolicies, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and other factors have led to an inflationary environment. Our\noperations are susceptible to inflation, and underestimating inflation levels could result in underpricing the risks we reinsure.\nAdditionally, our reserving models include assumptions about future payments for the settlement of claims and claims-handling\nexpenses, such as the value of replacing property, associated labor costs for the property business we write, and litigation costs.\nInflation may cause costs to increase above loss reserves established for claims. In that case, we will be required to increase our\nloss reserves with a corresponding reduction in net income in the period the deficiency is identified, which may have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Unanticipated higher inflation could also lead to higher\ninterest rates, potentially negatively impacting the value of any rate-sensitive financial instruments held by SILP and could also\nimpact our Innovations investments. See “—Risks Related to Our SILP Investment Strategy” and “—Risks Related to Our\nInnovations Investments.”\nThe effect of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business is uncertain.\nAs industry practices and social, political, legal, judicial, and regulatory conditions change, unexpected issues related to\nclaims and coverage have emerged and adversely affected our results. Examples of emerging claims and coverage issues\ninclude, but are not limited to:\n● new theories of liability and disputes regarding medical causation with respect to certain diseases;\n● assignment-of-benefits agreements, where rights of insurance claims and benefits of the insurance policy are\ntransferred to third parties, which can result in inflated repair costs and legal expenses to insurers and reinsurers;\n● claims related to political unrest, geopolitical instability, or other politically driven events, such as the military\nconflict between Russia and Ukraine, including loss claims relating to expropriation, forced abandonment, license\ncancellation, trade embargo, contract frustration, non-payment, war on land or political violence (including terrorism,\nrevolution insurrection, and civil unrest);\n● claims related to data security breaches, information system failures, or cyber-attacks; and\n● claims related to business interruption including protocols enlisted by governments in connection with pandemics,\nand ransomware and cyber-attacks.\nAdditionally, various provisions of our contracts, such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum,\nmay be difficult to enforce in the manner we intend due to, among other things, disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal\nforum. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond the period that we intended or by\nincreasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not manifest themselves until many years after\nwe have issued reinsurance contracts that are affected by these changes. As a result, we may not be able to ascertain the full\nextent of our liabilities under our reinsurance contracts for many years following the issuance of our contracts.\nThe property and casualty reinsurance market may be affected by cyclical trends.\nWe write reinsurance in the property and casualty markets, which are subject to pricing cycles. These cycles, as well as\nother factors that influence aggregate supply and demand for property and casualty reinsurance products, are outside our\ncontrol. Primary insurers’ underwriting results, prevailing general economic and market conditions, liability retention decisions\nof companies, and primary insurers and reinsurance premium rates influence the demand for property and casualty reinsurance.\nPrevailing prices and available surplus to support assumed business influence reinsurance supply. Supply may fluctuate in\nresponse to changes in return on capital realized in the reinsurance industry, the frequency and severity of losses, and prevailing\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nAs a result, the reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price\ncompetition due to high levels of available underwriting capacity and periods when shortages of capacity have permitted\nfavorable premium levels and changes in terms and conditions. The supply of available reinsurance capital could increase in\nfuture years, either due to capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or\nreinsurers.\nContinued increases in the supply of reinsurance may have consequences for the reinsurance industry generally and for\nus, including fewer contracts written, lower premium rates, increased expenses for customer acquisition and retention, less\nfavorable policy terms and conditions, and/or lower premium volume. The effects of cyclicality could materially and adversely\naffect our financial condition and results of operations.\n27\nLink to Table of Contents\nOperational risks, including human or systems failures, are inherent in our business.\nOperational risks and losses can result from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions or to\nobtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with regulatory requirements, information technology failures, or\nexternal events.\nWe believe that our modeling, underwriting, information technology, and application systems are critical to our business.\nWe utilize modeling tools to facilitate the pricing, reserving, and risk management of our reinsurance portfolio. These models\nhelp us to control risk accumulation, inform management and other stakeholders of capital requirements and to improve the\nrisk/return profile or minimize the amount of capital required to cover the risks in each reinsurance contract. However, given\nthe inherent uncertainty of modeling techniques and the application of such techniques, these models and databases may not\naccurately address the emergence of a variety of matters that might be deemed to impact certain of our coverages. These models\nhave been developed internally, and in some cases, they make use of third-party software. The construction of these models and\nthe selection of assumptions require significant actuarial judgment. Furthermore, these models typically rely on either cedent or\nindustry data, which may be incomplete or may be subject to errors. Accordingly, these models, and the assumptions and\njudgements made in connection therewith, may understate the exposures we are assuming, and our financial results may be\nmaterially and adversely impacted.\nTechnology breaches or failures, including those resulting from a malicious ransomware or cyber-attack on us or our\nbusiness partners and service providers, could disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nOur information technology and application systems have been an important part of our underwriting process and our\nability to compete successfully. We have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties. We cannot be certain that we\nwill have access to these service providers or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as\nintended. In addition, we cannot be certain that we would be able to replace these systems without slowing our underwriting\nresponse time. Like all companies, we have information technology and application systems that are vulnerable to data\nbreaches, interruptions or failures due to events that may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters,\ntheft, terrorist attacks, malicious ransomware cyber-attacks, computer viruses, hackers and general technology failures.\nA major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could result in\nmanagement distraction, a violation of applicable privacy or other laws, harm our reputation, a loss of customers, or monetary\nfines or penalties or otherwise increased expenses. We believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to\nprevent significant data breaches, interruptions, or failures in, information technology and application systems. However,\ninternal controls provide only a reasonable, not absolute, assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities, and the\nineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe cybersecurity regulatory environment is evolving, and we expect the costs of complying with new or developing\nregulatory requirements to increase. In addition, as our operations expand to other jurisdictions, we will be required to comply\nwith cybersecurity laws in those jurisdictions, which will further increase our cost of compliance.\nEpidemics, pandemics, and other public health threats, including COVID-19, could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, including our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity, in a manner and to a degree that cannot be\npredicted.\nWe continue to monitor the developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken or recommended\nby governments and other authorities to reduce the spread of the virus and to assess its impact on our business and the insurance\nand reinsurance sectors. The future impact of the pandemic on us is uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on\ninflation, global financial markets, and our results of operations, financial position, and/or liquidity. The extent of the impact\nwill depend on future developments, including actions taken to limit the spread of COVID-19 and the uncertain impact of\npotential judicial, legislative, and regulatory actions by local, state, and national governmental and regulatory bodies. Risks\npresented by the ongoing effects of COVID-19 include possible higher loss and loss adjustment expenses, inflation, potential\nimpairment on SILP’s investment strategy or performance, Innovations investments’ performance and heightened cybersecurity\nrisks.\n28\nLink to Table of Contents\nOur property and casualty reinsurance operations make us vulnerable to losses from catastrophes and may cause our results\nof operations to vary significantly from period to period.\nCertain of our reinsurance operations expose us to claims arising out of unpredictable catastrophic events, including\nweather-related and other natural catastrophes and man-made disasters such as acts of war or terrorism. The incidence and\nseverity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. Increases in the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes and the\nlosses that result from them are possible. In particular, climate change, to the extent that it produces extreme changes in\ntemperatures and weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events and wildfires. Changes in weather\npatterns could also affect the frequency and severity of other natural catastrophe events to which we may be exposed. Further,\nsuch catastrophes could impact the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance, which could impact pricing.\nAdditionally, increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property, particularly along coastal regions, could\ncause the cost of such losses to increase.\nCatastrophic losses are a function of the insured exposure in the affected area and the event’s severity. Claims from\ncatastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially\nand adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability to obtain business provided from brokers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our business is placed through brokered transactions, which involve a limited number of\nreinsurance brokers, which has continued to decrease in recent years as a result of consolidation in the broker sector. Our\ntwo largest brokers each accounted for more than 10% of our gross written premiums, and in the aggregate, they accounted for\napproximately 44.5% of our gross premiums written in 2022. Because broker-produced business is concentrated with a small\nnumber of brokers, we are exposed to concentration risk. To lose or fail to expand all or a substantial portion of the business\nprovided through brokers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our clients’ evaluations of the risks associated with their insurance underwriting, which may subject us to\nreinsurance losses.\nIn our proportional reinsurance business, in which we assume an agreed percentage of each underlying insurance\ncontract, we do not expect to separately evaluate each of the original individual risks assumed under these reinsurance\ncontracts. Therefore, we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies. We are\nsubject to the risk that the clients may not have adequately evaluated the insured risks and that the premiums ceded may not\nadequately compensate us for the risks we assume. We also do not separately evaluate each of the individual claims made on\nthe underlying insurance contracts under quota share contracts, rendering us dependent on the claims decisions our clients\nmake.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our brokers, cedents, agents and other counterparties.\nIn accordance with industry practice, we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our policies to reinsurance\nbrokers, and these brokers, in turn, remit these amounts to the ceding companies that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities\nwith us. In some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a payment, we might remain liable to the client for the deficiency,\nnotwithstanding the broker’s obligation to make such payment. Conversely, in certain jurisdictions, when the client pays\npremiums for policies to reinsurance brokers for payment to us, these premiums are considered to have been paid, and the client\nwill no longer be liable to us for these premiums, whether or not we have actually received them. Consequently, we assume a\ndegree of credit risk associated with brokers.\nWe are also exposed to the credit risk of our cedents and agents, who, pursuant to their contracts with us, may be\nrequired to pay us profit commission, additional premiums, reinstatement premiums, and adjustments to ceding commissions\nover a period of time, which in some cases may extend beyond the initial period of risk coverage. Insolvency, liquidity\nproblems, distressed financial condition, or the general effects of an economic recession may increase the risk that our cedents\nor agents may not pay some or all of their obligations to us. To the extent our cedents or agents become unable to pay us, we\nwould be required to recognize a downward adjustment to our reinsurance balances receivable or loss and loss expenses\nrecoverable, as applicable, in our financial statements. While we generally seek to mitigate this risk through, among other\nthings, collateral agreements, funds withheld, corporate guarantees, and the right to offset receivables against any losses\npayable, an increased inability of customers to fulfill their obligations to us could have an adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n29\nLink to Table of Contents\nOur reinsurance balances receivable from brokers and cedents at December 31, 2022 totaled $505.6 million, which\nincluded premiums, ceding commissions receivable, and funds at Lloyd’s, a majority of which are not collateralized. We cannot\nprovide assurance that such receivables will be collected or that valuation allowances or write-downs for uncollectible balances\nwill not be required in future periods.\nWe may be unable to purchase reinsurance for the liabilities we reinsure, and if we successfully purchase such reinsurance,\nwe may be unable to collect, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we seek to purchase reinsurance for certain liabilities we reinsure to mitigate the effect of a potential\nconcentration of losses upon our financial condition. The insolvency or inability or refusal of a retrocessionaire to make\npayments under the terms of its agreement with us could have an adverse effect on us because our obligations to our clients\nwould remain. At certain times, market conditions have limited, and in some cases have prevented, reinsurers from obtaining\nthe types and amounts of retrocessional coverage they consider necessary for their business needs. Accordingly, we may not be\nable to obtain our desired amounts of retrocessional coverage, negotiate terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable, or obtain\nretrocessional coverage from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness. Our inability to establish adequate retrocessional\narrangements or the failure of our retrocessional arrangements to protect us from overly concentrated risk exposure could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with restrictive covenants contained in our current or future credit facilities could trigger prepayment\nobligations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur credit facility requires us and/or certain of our subsidiaries to comply with certain covenants, including restrictions\non our ability to place a lien or charge on pledged assets, issue debt, and in certain circumstances, on the payment of dividends.\nOur failure to comply with these or other covenants could result in an event of default under the credit facility or any credit\nfacility we may enter into in the future, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay the amounts\noutstanding under these facilities prior to maturity. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe materially and adversely affected.\nIf we lose or are unable to retain or implement succession plans for our senior management and other key personnel, our\nability to implement our business strategy could be delayed or hindered, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, to a significant extent, on the efforts of our senior management and other key personnel to\nimplement our business strategy. We believe there are only a limited number of available qualified executives with substantial\nexperience in our industry and we currently do not maintain key life insurance with respect to any of our senior management.\nWe could face challenges and incur expenses in attracting and retaining personnel in the Cayman Islands, U.K., and Ireland.\nAccordingly, the loss of the services of one or more of the members of our senior management or other key personnel, or our\ninability to implement succession plans or hire and retain other key personnel, could prevent us from continuing to implement\nour business strategy and, consequently, materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy could be adversely affected by Cayman Islands employment restrictions.\nUnder Cayman Islands law, persons who are not Caymanian, do not possess Caymanian status, or are not otherwise\nentitled to reside and work in the Cayman Islands pursuant to provisions of the Immigration Act (as amended) of the Cayman\nIslands, which we refer to as the Immigration Act, may not engage in any gainful occupation in the Cayman Islands without an\nappropriate governmental work permit. Such a work permit may be granted or extended on a continuous basis for a maximum\nperiod of nine years (after having been legally and ordinarily resident in the Cayman Islands for a period of eight years a person\nmay apply for permanent residence in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act) upon showing that, after proper\npublic advertisement, no Caymanian or person of Caymanian status, or other person legally and ordinarily resident in the\nCayman Islands who meets the minimum standards for the advertised position is available. The failure of these work permits to\nbe granted or extended could prevent us from continuing to implement our business strategy.\n30\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe may face risks arising from future strategic transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, or joint ventures.\nWe may pursue strategic transactions from time to time, which could involve acquisitions or dispositions of businesses\nor assets. Any strategic transactions could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operation, or financial\ncondition. Sources of risk arising from these types of transactions include financial, accounting, tax, and regulatory challenges;\ndifficulties with integration, business retention, execution of strategy, unforeseen liabilities or market conditions; and other\nmanagerial or operating risks and challenges. Any future transactions could also subject us to risks such as failure to obtain\nappropriate value, post-closing claims being levied against us, and disruption to our other businesses during the negotiation or\nexecution process or thereafter. Accordingly, these risks and difficulties may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits\nfrom such strategic transactions. For example, businesses that we acquire or our strategic alliances or joint ventures may\nunderperform relative to the price paid or resources committed by us; we may not achieve anticipated cost savings; we may\notherwise be adversely affected by transaction-related charges; we may assume unknown or undisclosed business, operational,\ntax, regulatory and other liabilities; fail to accurately assess known contingent liabilities; or assume businesses with internal\ncontrol deficiencies. Risk-mitigating provisions that we put in place in the course of negotiating and executing these\ntransactions, such as due diligence efforts and indemnification provisions, may not be sufficient to fully address these risks and\ncontingencies.\nNon-compliance with laws, regulations, and taxation regarding transactions with international counterparties may adversely\naffect our business.\nAs we provide reinsurance on a worldwide basis, we are subject to an expanding legal, regulatory, and tax environment\nintended to help detect and prevent anti-trust activity, money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing, fraud, tax\navoidance, and other illicit activity. These requirements include, among others, regulations promulgated and administered by\nCIMA, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the\nIran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012, and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. These and other programs\nprohibit or restrict dealings with certain persons, entities, countries, governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals\nand may require detailed reporting to various administrative parties. Non-compliance with any of these regulations could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nCurrency fluctuations could result in exchange rate losses and negatively impact our business.\nOur functional currency is the U.S. dollar. However, we expect to write a portion of our business in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar. We may incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses as we ultimately receive premiums and settle claims in\nforeign currencies. In addition, SILP may invest in securities or cash denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nConsequently, we may experience exchange rate losses to the extent that our foreign currency exposure is not hedged, which\ncould materially and adversely affect our business. If we or SILP hedge our foreign currency exposure through forward foreign\ncurrency exchange contracts or currency swaps, we will be subject to the risk that the hedging counterparties to such\narrangements may fail to perform.\nRisks Relating to Insurance and Other Regulations\nAny suspension or revocation of any of our licenses would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWe are licensed as a reinsurer in the Cayman Islands and the EEA. We are also licensed to write insurance business in\nthe U.K. and the EEA through our Syndicate 3456. The suspension or revocation of any of our licenses to do business in either\nof these jurisdictions for any reason would mean that we would not be able to enter into any new reinsurance contracts in that\njurisdiction until the suspension ended or we became licensed in another jurisdiction. The process of obtaining licenses is time-\nconsuming and costly, and we may not be able to become licensed in another jurisdiction in the event we choose to. Any such\nsuspension or revocation of our license would negatively impact our reputation in the (re)insurance marketplace, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on any potential license application and would materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nCIMA and the CBI may take a number of actions, including suspending or revoking a reinsurance license whenever the\nregulatory body believes that a licensee is or may become unable to meet its financial obligations, is carrying on business in a\nmanner likely to be detrimental to the public interest or the interest of its creditors or policyholders, has contravened the terms\nof the Act, or has otherwise behaved in such a manner so as to cause such regulatory body to call into question the licensee’s\nfitness to conduct regulated activity.\n31\nLink to Table of Contents\nFurther, based on statutes, regulations, and policies in their respective jurisdictions, CIMA and CBI may suspend or\nrevoke our licenses if certain events occur, including without limitation:\n● we cease to carry on reinsurance business;\n● the direction and management of our reinsurance business have not been conducted in accordance with laws and\nregulations;\n● we cease to meet certain capital and surplus requirements;\n● a person holding a position as a director, manager or officer is not deemed to be a fit or proper person to hold the\nrespective position; or\n● we become bankrupt, go into liquidation, or are wound up or otherwise dissolved.\nSimilarly, if either CIMA or the CBI suspended or revoked our licenses, we could lose our exemption under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) (See “— We are subject to the risk of\npossibly becoming an investment company under U.S. federal securities law.”)\nOur reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these\nrequirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nThe Insurance (Capital and Solvency) (Classes B, C, and D Insurers) Regulations (2018 Revision) (the “Capital and\nSolvency Regulations”) impose on Greenlight Re a minimum capital requirement of US$50 million, a prescribed capital\nrequirement of US$226.5 million and a requirement to maintain solvency equal to greater than the total prescribed capital\nrequirement (the “Capital Requirements”). At December 31, 2022, Greenlight Re was in compliance with the Capital\nRequirements.\nGRIL, our Irish subsidiary, is required to comply with risk-based solvency requirements under the European legislation\nknown as “Solvency II,” including calculating and maintaining a minimum capital requirement and solvency capital\nrequirement. At December 31, 2022, GRIL’s minimum capital requirement and solvency capital requirement was\napproximately $10.5 million and $41.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, GRIL was in compliance with the capital\nrequirements required under the Irish Insurance Acts and Regulations.\nAny failure to meet applicable requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements could subject us to further\nexamination or action by regulators, including restrictions on dividend payments, limitations on our writing of additional\nbusiness or engaging in financial or other activities, enhanced supervision, financial or other penalties, or liquidation. Further,\nany changes in existing risk-based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements may require us to increase\nour statutory capital levels, which we might be unable to do.\nWe are a holding company that depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends.\nWe are a holding company and do not have any significant operations or assets other than our ownership of the shares of\nour subsidiaries. Dividends and other permitted distributions from our subsidiaries are our primary source of funds to meet\nongoing cash requirements, including future debt service payments, if any, and other corporate expenses, and to repurchase\nshares or pay dividends to our shareholders if we choose to do so. Some of our subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory\nrestrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends. The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount\nsufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have an adverse effect on our\noperations and our ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends to our shareholders if we choose to do so and/or meet our debt\nservice obligations, if any.\nTo the extent any of our subsidiaries located in jurisdictions other than the Cayman Islands consider declaring dividends,\nsuch subsidiaries are required to comply with restrictions set forth under applicable law and regulations in such other\njurisdictions. These restrictions could adversely impact the Company.\n32\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under U.S. federal securities law.\nIn the United States, the Investment Company Act regulates certain companies that invest in or trade securities. We rely\non an exemption under the Investment Company Act for an entity organized and regulated as a foreign insurance company\nwhich is engaged primarily and predominantly in the reinsurance of risks on insurance agreements. The law in this area is\nsubjective, and there is a lack of guidance as to the meaning of “primarily and predominantly” under the relevant exemption to\nthe Investment Company Act. For example, there is no standard for the amount of premiums that need to be written relative to\nthe level of an entity’s capital in order to qualify for the exemption. If this exemption were deemed inapplicable, we would have\nto register under the Investment Company Act as an investment company. Registered investment companies are subject to\nextensive, restrictive, and potentially adverse regulation relating to, among other things, operating methods, management,\ncapital structure, leverage, dividends, and transactions with affiliates. Registered investment companies are not permitted to\noperate their business in the manner in which we operate our business, nor are registered investment companies permitted to\nhave many of the relationships that we have with our affiliated companies. Accordingly, we likely would not be permitted to be\nlimited partners in SILP unless we obtained board and shareholder approvals under the Investment Company Act. If we did not\ninvest in SILP, we would seek to identify and retain another investment advisor with a value-oriented investment philosophy. If\nwe could not identify or retain such an advisor, we would be required to make substantial modifications to our investment\nstrategy. Any such changes to our investment strategy could materially and adversely impact our investment results, financial\ncondition, and ability to implement our business strategy.\nIf at any time it were established that we had been operating as an investment company in violation of the registration\nrequirements of the Investment Company Act, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could\nbecome subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, or that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third\nparties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period in which it was\nestablished that we were an unregistered investment company.\nTo the extent that the laws and regulations change in the future so that contracts we write are deemed not to be\nreinsurance contracts, we will be at greater risk of not qualifying for the Investment Company Act exception. Additionally, it is\npossible that our classification as an investment company would result in the suspension or revocation of our reinsurance\nlicense.\nInsurance regulations to which we are, or may become, subject, and potential changes thereto, could have a significant and\nnegative effect on our business.\nWe currently are admitted to do reinsurance business in the Cayman Islands and the European Economic Area. We are\nalso licensed to write insurance business in the U.K. and the EEA through our Syndicate 3456. Our operations in these\njurisdictions are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision. The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which\nour subsidiaries are domiciled require that, among other things, these subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of statutory or\nregulatory capital, surplus, and liquidity, meet solvency standards, submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition,\nand restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital. Statutes, regulations, and policies that our subsidiaries are subject\nto may also restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to write insurance and reinsurance policies, make certain investments, and\ndistribute funds.\nMore specifically, with respect to GRIL, Solvency II was introduced with effect from January 1, 2016, and governs the\nprudential regulation of insurers and reinsurers, and requires insurers and reinsurers in Europe to meet risk-based solvency\nrequirements. It also imposes group solvency and governance requirements on groups with insurers and/or reinsurers operating\nin the European Economic Area. A number of European Commission delegated acts and technical standards have been adopted,\nwhich set out more detailed requirements based on the overarching provisions of the Solvency II Directive. However, further\ndelegated acts, technical standards, and guidance are likely to be published on an ongoing basis.\nAlthough we presently are admitted to do business in the Cayman Islands, U.K. and the EEA, we cannot provide\nassurance that insurance regulators in the United States or elsewhere will not review our activities and claim that we are subject\nto such jurisdiction’s licensing requirements. In addition, we are subject to indirect regulatory requirements imposed by\njurisdictions that may limit our ability to provide reinsurance. For example, our ability to write reinsurance may be subject, in\ncertain cases, to arrangements satisfactory to applicable regulatory bodies, and proposed legislation and regulations may have\nthe effect of imposing additional requirements upon, or restricting the market for, non-U.S. reinsurers such as Greenlight Re\nand GRIL, with whom domestic companies may place business. We do not know of any such proposed legislation pending at\nthis time.\nWe may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain desired exemptions from, revised statutes, regulations, and policies\nthat currently, or may in the future, govern the conduct of our business. Failure to comply with, or to obtain desired\n33\nLink to Table of Contents\nauthorizations and/or exemptions under, any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or\nundertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines and\nother sanctions. The MAA includes amendments that provide for a specific administrative fines framework whereby CIMA has\nbeen granted the power to issue monetary penalties of up to 1 million Cayman Dollars for a very serious breach.\nIn addition, governmental authorities worldwide have become increasingly interested in potential risks posed by the\ninsurance industry as a whole, and to the commercial and financial systems in general. While we cannot predict the exact\nnature, timing, or scope of possible governmental initiatives, there may be increased regulatory intervention in our industry in\nthe future. Changes in the laws or regulations to which our subsidiaries are subject or may become subject, or in the\ninterpretations thereof by enforcement or regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere are differences between Cayman Islands corporate law and Delaware corporate law with respect to interested party\ntransactions, which may benefit certain of our shareholders at the expense of other shareholders.\nAs a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect\nto the company and therefore it is considered that they owe the following duties to the company: a duty to act in good faith and\nin what they consider to be in the best interests of the company; a duty not to make a profit out of their position as director\n(unless the company permits them to do so); a duty to exercise their powers for the purposes for which they are conferred; and a\nduty not to put themselves in a position where the interests of the company conflict with their personal interest or their duty to a\nthird party. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. A director will need\nto exhibit in the performance of their duties both the degree of skill that may reasonably be expected from a subjective\nperspective determined by reference to their knowledge and experience and the skill and care objectively to be expected from a\nperson occupying office as a director of the company.\nUnder Cayman Islands corporate law and pursuant to our Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation (the “Articles”), a director may vote on a contract or transaction where the director has an interest as a shareholder,\ndirector, officer, or employee, provided such interest is duly disclosed to the Board. In exercising any such vote, such director's\nduties remain as described above. Pursuant to our Articles none of our contracts will be deemed to be void purely because any\ndirector is an interested party in such transaction and in such circumstances, interested parties will generally not be held liable\nfor monies owed to the Company. Under Delaware law, interested party transactions are voidable.\nA failure by Syndicate 3456 to comply with rules and regulations could materially and adversely interfere with our business\nstrategy.\nSyndicate 3456 is subject to Lloyd’s oversight. The PRA and the FCA regulate all financial services firms in the U.K.,\nincluding Lloyd’s and Syndicate 3456. Both the PRA and the FCA have substantial powers of intervention in relation to\nLloyd’s Syndicates, including the power to remove Lloyd’s authorization to manage such Syndicates. See “— Item 1. Business\n— Regulations — UK Regulations” for further discussion of such regulations.\nFailure to comply with, or any future regulatory changes or rulings to, the regulations of the PRA and/or the FCA could\ninterfere with the business strategy of Syndicate 3456, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our SILP Investment Strategy\nOur investment performance depends in part on the performance of SILP and may suffer as a result of adverse financial\nmarket developments or other factors that impact SILP’s liquidity, which could materially and adversely affect our\ninvestment results, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results depend in part on the performance of SILP. We cannot provide assurance that DME Advisors, on\nbehalf of SILP, will successfully structure investments in relation to our liquidity needs or liabilities. Failure to do so could\nforce us to make redemptions from SILP that cause DME Advisors to liquidate investments at a significant loss or at prices that\nare not optimal, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe risks associated with the value-oriented investment strategy expected to be employed by SILP may be substantially\ngreater than the risks associated with traditional fixed-income investment strategies. In addition, long equity investments may\ngenerate losses if the market declines. Similarly, short equity investments may generate losses in a rising market. The success of\nthe investment strategy may also be affected by general economic conditions. Unexpected market volatility and illiquidity\nassociated with our investment in SILP could materially and adversely affect our investment results, financial condition, or\n34\nLink to Table of Contents\nresults of operations.\nSILP may be concentrated in a few large positions, which could result in material adverse valuation movements.\nOur Board of Directors has adopted our investment guidelines, which provide that SILP may commit up to, but not more\nthan, 10% of Greenlight Re Surplus (as defined in the SILP LPA) and 7.5% of GRIL Surplus (as defined in the SILP LPA) to\nany single investment, unless a waiver has been obtained by the board of directors of Greenlight Re or GRIL, as applicable. At\nDecember 31, 2022, SILP, along with certain affiliates of DME Advisors, collectively owned 37.2% of Green Brick Partners,\nInc., a publicly traded company (NYSE: GRBK), or the “GRBK Shares”. At December 31, 2022, SILP had invested more than\n10% of Greenlight Re Surplus in GRBK. Under applicable securities laws, DME Advisors may be unable to, or limited in its\nability to trade GRBK Shares on behalf of SILP. As of the date of this filing, the board of directors of Greenlight Re had waived\nthe applicable investment guidelines to allow SILP’s investment in the GRBK Shares to exceed the 10% threshold. The board\nof directors of Greenlight Re and GRIL may grant future waivers relating to the GRBK Shares.\nIn addition, GRIL’s investment guidelines require that the ten largest investments shall not constitute more than 40% of\nthe GRIL Surplus, and GRIL’s investment portfolio shall at all times, unless waived by the GRIL board of directors, be\ncomposed of a minimum of 50 debt or equity securities of publicly traded companies. From time to time, SILP may hold a\nsmall number of relatively large security positions in relation to our capital accounts. Since SILP may not be widely diversified\nby security or by industry, it may be subject to more rapid changes in value than would be the case if our investment portfolio\nwere required to maintain a wide diversification among companies, securities industries, and types of securities.\nUnder the SILP LPA, we are contractually obligated to invest substantially all our assets in SILP with certain exceptions.\nSILP’s performance depends on the ability of DME Advisors to select and manage appropriate investments.\nDME Advisors acts as the exclusive investment advisor for SILP. Apart from funds required for collateral purposes,\nfunds allocated to our Innovations investment strategy, risk management, and other operational needs, we are contractually\nobligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause substantially all investable assets of Greenlight Re and GRIL to be\ncontributed to SILP. Additionally, we are restricted from making additional contributions of assets that would cause the capital\naccount balances of Greenlight Re and GRIL to represent more than 90% of the aggregate capital account balances of all of the\npartners of SILP. Although DME Advisors is contractually obligated to follow the investment guidelines of both Greenlight Re\nand GRIL, we cannot provide assurance as to how DME Advisors will allocate our investable assets to different investment\nopportunities. DME Advisors may allocate our capital accounts to long and short equity positions, debt, and derivatives, which\ncould increase the level of risk to which our investment portfolio will be exposed.\nThe performance of the SILP investment portfolio depends to a great extent on the ability of DME Advisors to select and\nmanage appropriate investments for SILP. We cannot assure you that DME Advisors will successfully meet our investment\nobjectives. The diminution or loss of the services of DME Advisors’ principals (or loss or diminution of their market\nreputation) or the failure of DME Advisors to perform adequately could materially and adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. In addition, the loss of DME Advisors’ key personnel, or DME Advisors’ inability to hire\nand retain other key personnel, over which we have no control, could delay or prevent DME Advisors from fulfilling its\nobligations, which could materially and adversely affect SILP’s performance and, correspondingly, our business and financial\nperformance.\nUnder our investment management structure, we have limited control over SILP.\nUnder the SILP LPA, subject to our investment guidelines and certain other conditions, DME II, as the general partner of\nSILP, has complete and exclusive power and responsibility for all investment and investment management decisions to be\nundertaken on behalf of SILP and for managing and administering the affairs of SILP. DME II has the power and authority to\ndo all things that it considers necessary or desirable to carry out its duties thereunder, including the power to delegate its\nauthorities. While SILP is not, and is not expected to be registered as an “investment company” under the Investment Company\nAct or any comparable U.S. regulatory requirements, the general partner, or its designee, may resign or withdraw from SILP\nand may admit new limited partners to SILP without our consent, which may cause SILP to be deemed an “investment\ncompany” under the Investment Company Act.\nThe SILP LPA limits our ability to use another investment manager.\nThe SILP LPA contains exclusivity and limited termination provisions. Accordingly, we are unable to use other\ninvestment managers for so long as Greenlight Re and GRIL are limited partners in SILP. Greenlight Re and GRIL, as limited\npartners of SILP may withdraw upon notice only on the Greenlight Re Relevant Date or the GRIL Relevant Date or “for\ncause” (each as defined in the SILP LPA). Additionally, while GRIL may withdraw as a limited partner in SILP due to\n35\nLink to Table of Contents\nunsatisfactory long-term performance of DME II or DME Advisors, as determined solely by the Board of Directors of GRIL at\nthe end of each fiscal year during the term of the SILP LPA, Greenlight Re may not.\nThe historical performance of DME Advisors and its affiliates should not be considered indicative of the future results of the\nSILP investment portfolio, our future results, or any returns expected on our Class A ordinary shares.\nThe historical returns of SILP and other funds managed by DME Advisors and its affiliates are not directly linked to our\nClass A ordinary shares. Results for the SILP investment portfolio could differ from those of other funds managed by DME\nAdvisors and its affiliates due to restrictions imposed by our investment guidelines and other factors.\nPotential conflicts of interest with DME Advisors and its affiliates may exist that could adversely affect us.\nDME Advisors and its affiliates, in addition to managing SILP, may engage in investment and trading activities for their\nown accounts and/or for the accounts of third parties. None of DME Advisors or its affiliates, including David Einhorn,\nChairman of our Board of Directors and the President of Greenlight Capital, Inc., is obligated to devote any specific amount of\ntime, effort or allocation, or prioritize any investment opportunity, to SILP or to address possible or actual conflicts among the\naccounts they may manage, which may adversely affect SILP’s investment returns, and, correspondingly, our investment\nreturns.\nIn addition, under Cayman Islands laws, Mr. Einhorn is not legally restricted from participating in making decisions with\nrespect to Greenlight Re’s investment guidelines. Accordingly, his involvement as a member of the Boards of Directors of\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd. and Greenlight Re may lead to a conflict of interest.\nDME Advisors and its affiliates may also manage accounts whose advisory fee schedules, investment objectives, and\npolicies differ from those of SILP, which may cause DME Advisors and its affiliates to effect trading in one account that may\nhave an adverse effect on another account, including SILP. We do not have the contractual right to inspect the trading records\nof DME Advisors or its principals.\nCertain investments made by SILP may have limited liquidity and lack valuation data which could create a conflict of\ninterest.\nOur investment guidelines allow SILP to invest in certain securities with limited liquidity or no public market. This lack\nof liquidity may adversely affect the ability of SILP to execute trade orders at desired prices and may impact our ability to\nfulfill our underwriting payment obligations. To the extent that SILP invests in securities or instruments for which market\nquotations are not readily available, the valuation of such securities and instruments for purposes of compensation will be\ndetermined by DME Advisors, whose determination, subject to audit verification, will be conclusive and binding in the absence\nof bad faith or manifest error.\nIn addition, for all securities traded on public exchanges, each exchange typically has the right to suspend or limit trading\nin all securities it lists. Such a suspension could render it impossible to liquidate positions and thereby expose SILP and,\ncorrespondingly us, to losses.\nIf DME Advisor’s risk management methodologies are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.\nDME Advisors and its affiliates continually refine its risk management techniques, strategies, and assessment methods.\nHowever, its risk management techniques and strategies do not fully mitigate the risk exposure of its funds and managed\naccounts, including SILP, in all economic or market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that it might fail to\nidentify or anticipate. Any failures in DME Advisors’ risk management techniques and strategies to accurately quantify risk\nexposure could affect the risk-adjusted returns of SILP. In addition, any risk management failures could cause losses to be\nsignificantly greater than historical measures predict. DME Advisors’ approach to managing those risks could prove\ninsufficient, exposing SILP, and correspondingly our SILP investment portfolio, to material unanticipated or material losses.\nThe compensation arrangements of SILP may create an incentive to effect transactions that are risky or speculative.\nPursuant to the SILP LPA, each of Greenlight Re and GRIL is obligated to pay a performance allocation of 20% to DME\nII at the end of each performance period based on its positive performance change to its capital account, subject to a modified\nloss carry forward provision.\nThe loss carry forward provision contained in the SILP LPA allows DME II to earn a reduced performance allocation of\n10% of profits in any year subsequent to the year in which SILP has incurred a loss until all losses are recouped and an\nadditional amount equal to 150% of the loss is earned.\n36\nLink to Table of Contents\nWhile the performance compensation arrangement contained in the SILP LPA provides that losses will be carried\nforward as an offset against net profits in subsequent periods, DME II and DME Advisors generally will not otherwise be\npenalized for losses or decreases in the value of our portfolio under the SILP LPA. These performance compensation\narrangements may incentivize DME Advisors to engage in transactions that focus on the potential for short-term gains rather\nthan long-term growth or that are particularly risky or speculative.\nDME Advisors’ representatives’ service on boards and committees may place trading restrictions on our investments and\nmay subject us to indemnification liability.\nDME Advisors may, from time to time, place its or its affiliates’ representatives on creditors’ committees and/or boards\nof certain companies in which SILP has invested. While such representation may enable DME Advisors to enhance the sale\nvalue of SILP’s investments, it may also prevent SILP from freely disposing of investments. The IAA provides for the\nindemnification of DME Advisors or any other person designated by DME Advisors for claims arising from such board\nrepresentation.\nThe ability to use “soft dollars” may provide DME Advisors with an incentive to select certain brokers that may take into\naccount benefits to be received by DME Advisors.\nDME Advisors is entitled to use so-called “soft dollars” generated by commissions paid in connection with transactions\nfor SILP to pay for certain of DME Advisors’ operating and overhead costs, including the payment of all or a portion of its\ncosts and expenses of operation. “Soft dollars” are a means of paying brokerage firms for their services through commission\nrevenue rather than through direct payments. DME Advisors only uses soft dollars to pay for expenses that would otherwise be\nborne by SILP and certain other co-managed funds. However, DME Advisors’ right to use soft dollars may give DME Advisors\nan incentive to select brokers or dealers for our transactions or to negotiate commission rates or other execution terms in a\nmanner that takes into account the soft dollar benefits received by DME Advisors rather than giving exclusive consideration to\nthe interests of our investment portfolio and, accordingly, may create a conflict.\nIncreased regulation or scrutiny of alternative investment advisors may affect DME Advisors’ ability to manage SILP or\naffect our business reputation.\nThe regulatory environment for investment managers is evolving, and changes in the regulation of managers may\nadversely affect the ability of DME Advisors to obtain the leverage it might otherwise obtain or to pursue its trading\nstrategies. In addition, the securities and futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin\nrequirements. The SEC, other regulators, and self-regulatory organizations and exchanges are authorized to take extraordinary\nactions in the event of market emergencies. The regulation of derivatives transactions and funds that engage in such transactions\nis an evolving area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. Any future regulatory change could\nhave a significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and SILP are exposed to credit risk from counterparties that may default on their obligations to us.\nWe and SILP are exposed to credit risk from counterparties that may default on their obligations to us or it. The amount\nof the maximum exposure to credit risk is indicated by the carrying value of our and SILP’s financial assets. In addition, SILP\nholds the securities of our investment portfolio with prime brokers and has credit risk from the possibility that one or more of\nthem may default on their obligations to SILP. Other than our investment in derivative contracts and corporate debt, if any, and\nthe fact that our investments are held by prime brokers and custodians on our behalf, we have no other significant\nconcentrations of credit risk in our investment portfolio.\nIssuers or borrowers whose securities or debt SILP holds, customers, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing\nhouses, and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us and/or SILP due to bankruptcy,\ninsolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. Such defaults could have\na significant and negative effect on us and/or SILP and, correspondingly, our investment portfolio and our results of operations,\nfinancial condition, and cash flows.\nSILP effectuates short sales that subject our capital accounts to material and adverse loss potential.\nSILP enters into transactions in which it sells a security it does not own, which we refer to as a short sale, in anticipation\nof a decline in the market value of the security. Short sales subject our capital accounts in SILP to material and adverse loss\npotential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase.\nShort-sale transactions have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, including the imposition of restrictions on\n37\nLink to Table of Contents\nshort selling certain securities and reporting requirements. SILP’s ability to execute a short selling strategy may be materially\nand adversely impacted by new temporary and/or permanent rules, interpretations, prohibitions, and restrictions adopted in\nresponse to these adverse market events. Temporary restrictions and/or prohibitions on short selling activity may be imposed by\nregulatory authorities with little or no advance notice and may impact prior and future trading activities of our investment\nportfolio. Additionally, the SEC, its non-U.S. counterparts, other governmental authorities, and/or self-regulatory organizations\nmay at any time promulgate permanent rules or interpretations consistent with such temporary restrictions or that impose\nadditional or different permanent or temporary limitations or prohibitions.\nFurther, regulatory authorities may, from time to time, impose restrictions that adversely affect SILP’s ability to borrow\ncertain securities in connection with short sale transactions. As a result, SILP may be unable to effectively pursue a short-selling\nstrategy which may adversely affect SILP’s investment returns, and correspondingly, our investment returns.\nSILP may trade on margin and use other forms of financial leverage, which may increase the risk of our investment\nportfolio.\nOur investment guidelines allow SILP to trade on margin and use other forms of financial leverage. SILP relies on prime\nbrokers to extend leverage and such prime brokers may elect not to provide leverage to SILP. Fluctuations in the market value\nof our investment in SILP could have a disproportionately large effect in relation to our capital. Any event which may adversely\naffect the value of positions SILP holds could materially and adversely affect the net asset value of our investment portfolio and\nour results of operations.\nSILP may transact in derivatives trading, which may increase the risks associated with our investment portfolio.\nDerivative instruments, or derivatives, include futures, options, swaps, structured securities, and other instruments and\ncontracts that derive their value from one or more underlying securities, financial benchmarks, currencies, commodities, or\nindices. There are a number of risks associated with derivatives trading. Because many derivatives are leveraged, a relatively\nsmall adverse market movement may result in a substantial loss and may expose us to a loss exceeding the original amount\ninvested. Derivatives may also expose SILP, and correspondingly, our investment portfolio, to liquidity risk as there may not be\na liquid market within which to close or dispose of outstanding derivative contracts. The counterparty risk lies with each party\nwith whom SILP contracts for the purpose of making derivative investments. In the event of the counterparty’s default, SILP\nwill generally only rank as an unsecured creditor and risk the loss of all or a portion of the amounts SILP is contractually\nentitled to receive.\nSILP may invest in securities based outside the United States, which may be riskier than securities of United States issuers.\nUnder our investment guidelines, SILP may invest in securities of issuers organized or based outside the United States.\nThese investments may be subject to a variety of risks and other special considerations not affecting securities of U.S. issuers.\nMany foreign securities markets are not as developed or efficient as those in the United States. Securities of some foreign\nissuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. issuers. Similarly, volume and liquidity in many\nforeign securities markets are less than in the United States and, at times, price volatility can be greater than in the United\nStates. Non-U.S. issuers may be subject to less stringent financial reporting and informational disclosure standards, regulatory\noversight, practices, and requirements than those applicable to U.S. issuers.\nRisks Relating to Our Innovations Strategy\nThe carry values of our Innovations investments may differ significantly from those that would be used if we carried these\ninvestments at fair value.\nOur Innovations investments include private investments and unlisted equities in early-stage or start-up entities for which\nno active market may exist. We carry these investments on our consolidated balance sheets at cost, less impairment, plus or\nminus observable price changes. These carry values may differ significantly from those that would be used if we carried them at\nfair value. If we were required to liquidate all or a portion of these investments quickly, we could realize significantly less than\nthe carrying value. Furthermore, our Innovations investments are generally subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales that\nlimit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term. The carry value of our Innovations investments may become\nconcentrated in a limited number of entities or have significant exposure to certain geographic areas or economic sectors. The\nconcentration of investments can increase investment risk and volatility. Any of the foregoing could result in a decline in our\ninvestment performance and capital resources and, accordingly, could materially and adversely affect our financial results and\nresults of operations.\n38\nLink to Table of Contents\nOur Innovations investments support our underwriting operations and the failure to identify and consummate investment\nopportunities may materially and adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy.\nWe operate in a competitive market for Innovations investment opportunities. Many of our competitors have\nconsiderably greater resources than we do. If we fail to compete for or otherwise lose the opportunity to make Innovations\ninvestments, which support our underwriting strategy, our ability to implement our business strategy may be materially and\nadversely impacted.\nInvestments in privately held early-stage companies involve significant risks.\nOur Innovations unit primarily invests in privately held U.S. early-stage companies. Investments in privately held early-\nstage companies involve a number of significant risks, including the following:\n• these companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their operating obligations;\n• they typically have limited operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger\nbusinesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors’ actions and market conditions, as well as\ngeneral economic downturns;\n• they typically depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons. Therefore, the death,\ndisability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse effect on such\ninvestment and, in turn, on us;\n• there is generally little public information about these companies. These companies and their financial information are\ngenerally not subject to the Exchange Act and other regulations that govern public companies, and we may be unable\nto uncover all material information about these companies, which may prevent us from making a fully informed\ninvestment decision and cause us to lose money on our investments;\n• they generally have less predictable operating results and may require substantial additional capital to support their\noperations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position;\n• changes in laws and regulations (including applicable tax laws), as well as their interpretations, may adversely affect\ntheir business, financial structure or prospects; and\n• they may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs.\nEconomic recessions or downturns could impair our Innovations investment and harm our operating results.\nThe current macroeconomic environment is characterized by record-high inflation, supply chain challenges, labor\nshortages, high interest rates, foreign currency exchange volatility, volatility in global capital markets and growing recession\nrisk. The risks associated with our Innovations investments and the businesses of the entities in which we have invested are\nmore severe during periods of economic slowdown or recession.\nMany of our Innovations investments may be susceptible to economic downturns or recessions. Therefore, during these\nperiods the carry values of our Innovations portfolio may decrease if we are required to write down the values of our\ninvestments. Adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of our investments. Economic slowdowns or\nrecessions could lead to financial losses in our Innovations portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets.\nOur Innovations investments are made in entities that may incur debt or issue equity securities that rank equally with, or\nsenior to, our investments in such companies.\nOur Innovations investments are made in entities that have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt, or issue other equity\nsecurities, that rank equally with, or senior to, our investments. By their terms, such instruments may provide that the holders\nare entitled to receive payment of dividends, interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive\npayments in respect of our investments. These debt instruments would usually prohibit the investments from paying interest on\nor repaying our investments in the event and during the continuance of a default under such debt. Also, in the event of\ninsolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of an entity, holders of securities ranking senior to our\ninvestment typically are entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After\nrepaying such holders, the entity may not have any remaining assets for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of securities\nranking equally with our investments, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other security holders in\nthe event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant entity.\nAs a minority equity investor, we are often not in a position to influence the entity, and other equity holders and\nmanagement of such entity may make decisions that could decrease the value of our investment in such entity.\n39\nLink to Table of Contents\nWhen we make a minority equity investment through our Innovations unit, we are subject to the risk that an entity may\nmake business decisions with which we disagree. The other equity holders and management of the entity may take risks or\notherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests. As a result, an entity may make decisions that could decrease the value of\nour investment.\nOur Innovations investments are in entities that may be highly leveraged.\nSome of our Innovations investments are made in entities that may be highly leveraged, which may have adverse\nconsequences for those companies and for us as a shareholder. The entity may be subject to restrictive financial and operating\ncovenants and their leverage may impair the ability to finance their future operations and capital needs. As a result, such\nentity’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to take advantage of business opportunities\nmay be limited.\nOur failure to make follow-on investments in our existing Innovations investments could impair the value of our\nportfolio.\nFollowing an initial investment in an entity, we may make additional investments in the entity as “follow-on”\ninvestments to: (1) increase or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage; (2) exercise warrants, options or\nconvertible securities that we acquired in the original or subsequent financing or (3) attempt to preserve or enhance the value of\nour investment.\nWe may elect not to make follow-on investments, be constrained in our ability to employ available funds, or otherwise\nlack sufficient funds to make those investments. We have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the\navailability of capital resources. The failure to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the\ncontinued viability of an entity, dilute our investment, or result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a\nsuccessful operation. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a follow-on investment, we may elect not to make it because\nwe may not want to increase our concentration of risk, we prefer other opportunities, or we are constrained under the\nInvestment Company Act. See “–Risks Relating to Insurance and Other Regulations – We are subject to the risk of possibly\nbecoming and investment company under U.S. federal securities laws.”\nRisks Relating to Our Class A Ordinary Shares\nOur ability to achieve our business objectives depends on our ability to manage and deploy capital.\nOur ability to achieve our business objectives depends on our ability to manage and deploy capital, which depends, in\nturn, on our management’s ability, with oversight from our Board of Directors, to identity, evaluate and monitor our\nunderwriting and investment results, our liquidity and competing needs for capital. We cannot assure you that our management\nand deployment of capital will enable us to achieve our business objectives, and our failure to effectively manage and deploy\nour capital could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur level of debt may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, restrict our current and future operations, particularly our\nability to respond to business opportunities, and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nAt March 1, 2023, we had $65.8 million of convertible notes outstanding (December 31, 2022: $79.6 million) that\nmature on August 1, 2023. Our level of debt and the provisions of such debt could have significant consequences, which\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures,\nacquisitions, or other general corporate purposes;\n•\nrequire a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other\npurposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures,\nacquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n•\ndiscourage an acquisition of us by a third party;\n•\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors carrying less debt; and\n•\nmake us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures or\ntake advantage of new opportunities to grow our business.\n40\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe may refinance some or all of our indebtedness by issuing new debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. We\ncannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. Such securities offerings may\ndilute our existing shareholders, reduce the value of our Class A ordinary shares, or both. Because our decision to issue\nsecurities depends on, among other things, market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or\nestimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future offerings. Thus, holders of our Class A ordinary shares bear the risk of our\nfuture offerings diluting and potentially reducing the value of our Class A ordinary shares.\nConversion of our convertible notes or future sales or issuances of Class A ordinary shares may dilute the ownership\ninterest of existing shareholders, including holders who have previously converted their notes. Such dilution may adversely\naffect the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares,and the convertible notes and the conversion rate of the convertible\nnotes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events.\nWe may issue equity or debt securities in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and\nbusiness strategy, to acquire assets or companies, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, or in connection with our incentive and\nstock option plans. Any issuance of equity securities, including the issuance of shares, if any, upon conversion of the\nconvertible notes, could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders, including holders who have previously received shares\nupon conversion of their notes, and could substantially affect the trading price of our Class A ordinary shares and the\nconvertible notes. In addition, conversion of our convertible notes into our Class A ordinary shares could depress the price of\nour Class A ordinary shares.\nWe may not be able to repay or refinance our convertible notes, pay interest on the convertible notes, or settle conversions of\nthe convertible notes in cash or to repurchase the convertible notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt, if any,\nmay contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes.\nOur convertible notes mature in August 2023. Further, holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to\nrepurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change under the indenture governing\nthe convertible notes. In addition, upon conversion of the convertible notes, unless we elect to deliver solely Class A ordinary\nshares to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make\ncash payments in respect of the convertible notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able\nto obtain financing on favorable terms, if at all, at the time we are required to make repurchases of convertible notes\nsurrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to the convertible notes being converted.\nIn addition, our ability to make the required repurchase upon a fundamental change may be limited by law or the terms\nof other debt agreements or securities. Our failure to pay interest on the convertible notes or to make the required cash\nrepurchase or cash payment, as the case may be, would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the\nconvertible notes which, in turn, could constitute an event of default under other debt agreements or securities, thereby resulting\nin their acceleration and required prepayment and thereby further restricting our ability to make such interest payments and\nrepurchases. If, due to a default, the repayment of related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or\ngrace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness and the convertible notes. We may be required to\nrefinance all or part of our debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices, incur additional indebtedness or issue\nordinary shares or other equity securities, which we may be unable to do on terms acceptable to us, in amounts sufficient to\nmeet our needs or at all.\nA shareholder may be required to sell its Class A ordinary shares.\nOur Articles provide that we have the option, but not the obligation, to require a shareholder to sell its Class A ordinary\nshares for their fair market value to us, to other shareholders or to third parties if our Board of Directors determines that\nownership of our Class A ordinary shares by such shareholder may result in adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to us,\nany of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders and that such sale is necessary to avoid or cure such adverse consequences.\nProvisions of our Articles, the Companies Act of the Cayman Islands (the “Companies Act”) and our corporate structure\nmay each impede a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of our Class A ordinary shares.\nOur Articles contain certain provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would\nbe beneficial to our shareholders. Our Articles provide that a director may only be removed for “cause” as defined in the\nArticles, upon the affirmative vote of not less than 50% of the votes cast at a meeting at which more than 50% of our issued and\noutstanding Class A ordinary shares are represented. Further, under the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation of Greenlight Re, a director may only be removed without cause upon the affirmative vote of not less than 80% of\nthe votes cast at a meeting at which more than 50% of our issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares are represented.\n41\nLink to Table of Contents\nOur Articles permit our Board of Directors to issue preferred shares from time to time, with such rights and preferences\nas they consider appropriate. Our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions\nand under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction, deny shareholders the receipt\nof a premium on their Class A ordinary shares in the event of a tender or other offer for Class A ordinary shares and have a\ndepressive effect on the market price of the Class A ordinary shares.\nAs compared to mergers under corporate law in the United States, it may be more difficult to consummate a merger of\ntwo or more companies in the Cayman Islands or the merger of one or more Cayman Islands companies with one or more\noverseas companies, even if such transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nIn certain circumstances, the Companies Act allows for mergers or consolidations between two Cayman Islands\ncompanies, or between a Cayman Islands exempted company and a company incorporated in another jurisdiction (provided that\nis facilitated by the laws of that other jurisdiction).\nWhere the merger or consolidation is between two Cayman Islands companies, the directors of each company must\napprove a written plan of merger or consolidation containing certain prescribed information. That plan or merger or\nconsolidation must then be authorized by: (a) a special resolution of the shareholders of each company; and (b) such other\nauthorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association. No shareholder resolution is\nrequired for a merger between a parent company (i.e., a company that holds issued shares that together represent 90% of the\nvotes at a general meeting of the subsidiary company) and its subsidiary company if a copy of the plan of merger is given to\nevery member of each subsidiary company to be merged unless that member agrees otherwise. The consent of each holder of a\nfixed or floating security interest of a constituent company must be obtained, unless the court waives such requirement. If the\nCayman Islands Registrar of Companies is satisfied that the requirements of the Companies Act (which includes certain other\nformalities) have been complied with, the Registrar of Companies will register the plan of merger or consolidation.\nWhere the merger or consolidation involves a foreign company, the procedure is similar, save that with respect to the\nforeign company, the directors of the Cayman Islands exempted company are required to make a declaration to the effect that,\nhaving made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the following requirements have been met: (i) that the merger or\nconsolidation is permitted or not prohibited by the constitutional documents of the foreign company and by the laws of the\njurisdiction in which the foreign company is incorporated, and that those laws and any requirements of those constitutional\ndocuments have been or will be complied with; (ii) that no petition or other similar proceeding has been filed and remains\noutstanding or order made or resolution adopted to wind up or liquidate the foreign company in any jurisdictions; (iii) that no\nreceiver, trustee, administrator or other similar person has been appointed in any jurisdiction and is acting in respect of the\nforeign company, its affairs or its property or any part thereof; and (iv) that no scheme, order, compromise or other similar\narrangement has been entered into or made in any jurisdiction whereby the rights of creditors of the foreign company are and\ncontinue to be suspended or restricted.\nWhere the surviving company is the Cayman Islands exempted company, the directors of the Cayman Islands\nexempted company are further required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they are of the\nopinion that the following requirements have been met: (i) that the foreign company is able to pay its debts as they fall due and\nthat the merger or consolidation is bona fide and not intended to defraud unsecured creditors of the foreign company; (ii) that in\nrespect of the transfer of any security interest granted by the foreign company to the surviving or consolidated company (a)\nconsent or approval to the transfer has been obtained, released or waived; (b) the transfer is permitted by and has been approved\nin accordance with the constitutional documents of the foreign company; and (c) the laws of the jurisdiction of the foreign\ncompany with respect to the transfer have been or will be complied with; (iii) that the foreign company will, upon the merger or\nconsolidation becoming effective, cease to be incorporated, registered or exist under the laws of the relevant foreign\njurisdiction; and (iv) that there is no other reason why it would be against the public interest to permit the merger or\nconsolidation.\nThe Companies Act also includes statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies,\nprovided that such a scheme of arrangement is approved by (i) in respect of shareholders, 75% in value of the shareholders or\neach class of shareholder who attend and vote, either in person or by proxy, at a meeting or meetings convened for that purpose;\nor (ii) in respect of creditors, a majority in number representing 75% in value of creditors or each class of creditors who attend\nand vote, either in person or by proxy, at a meeting or meetings convened for that purpose.\nThe convening of the scheme meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand\nCourt of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction\nought not to be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that:\n42\nLink to Table of Contents\n● the company is not proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of its corporate authority and the statutory\nprovisions as to majority vote have been complied with;\n● the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the classes properly delineated;\n● the scheme of arrangement is such as a businessperson would reasonably approve; and\n● the scheme of arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the\nCompanies Act or that would amount to a “fraud on the minority”.\nIf a scheme of arrangement is thus approved, the dissenting shareholders would have no rights comparable to appraisal\nrights, which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of a Delaware corporation.\nIn addition, David Einhorn, Chairman of our Board of Directors, owns all of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares. As\na result, we will not be able to enter into a scheme of arrangement without the approval of Mr. Einhorn as the holder of our\nClass B ordinary shares.\nHolders of Class A ordinary shares may have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us, and they may face\ndifficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under Cayman Islands law.\nWe are an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and conduct a\nmajority of our operations outside the United States. A significant amount of our assets are located outside the United States. A\nmajority of our officers and directors reside outside the United States and substantial portion of the assets of those persons are\nlocated outside of the United States. As a result, it could be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action against us or\nagainst these individuals outside of the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed upon\nunder the applicable securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the\nCayman Islands could render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers.\nOur corporate affairs are governed by our Articles, the Companies Act and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The\nrights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors and us, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary\nresponsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the\nCayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as\nwell as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The\nrights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under the laws of the Cayman Islands are not as\nclearly defined as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the United States. Therefore, you may have\nmore difficulty protecting your interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United\nStates, due to the comparatively less well developed Cayman Islands law in this area.\nShareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies such as ours have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to\ninspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies of lists of shareholders. Our directors have discretion under our\nArticles to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders,\nbut are not obliged to make them available to our shareholders. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the\ninformation needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in\nconnection with a proxy contest.\nThe courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United\nStates predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in\noriginal actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of\nthe federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in\nnature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the\nUnited States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of\ncompetent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes\nupon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met.\nFor a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated\nsum, and must not be in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty, inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the\nsame matter, impeachable on the grounds of fraud or obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is,\ncontrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held\nto be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are\nbeing brought elsewhere.\nWe are not aware nor have we been advised of any reported class action having been brought in a Cayman Islands court.\n43\nLink to Table of Contents\nDerivative actions have been brought in the Cayman Islands courts, and the Cayman Islands courts have confirmed the\navailability for such actions. In most cases, we will be the proper plaintiff in any claim based on a breach of duty owed to us,\nand a claim against (for example) our officers or directors usually may not be brought by a shareholder. However, based both\non Cayman Islands authorities and on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority and be\napplied by a court in the Cayman Islands, exceptions to the foregoing principle apply in circumstances in which:\n● a company is acting, or proposing to act, illegally or beyond the scope of its authority;\n● the act complained of, although not beyond the scope of the authority, could be effected if duly authorized by more\n● than the number of votes which have actually been obtained; or\n● those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.”\nA shareholder may have a direct right of action against us where the individual rights of that shareholder have been\ninfringed or are about to be infringed.\nSubject to limited exceptions, under Cayman Islands law, a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action\nagainst our Board of Directors.\nProvisions of our Articles may reallocate the voting power of our Class A ordinary shares and subject holders of Class A\nordinary shares to SEC compliance.\nIn certain circumstances, the total voting power of our Class A ordinary shares held by any one person will be reduced to\nless than 9.9% of the total issued and outstanding ordinary shares, and the total voting power of the Class B ordinary shares will\nbe reduced to 9.5% of the total voting power of the total issued and outstanding ordinary shares. In the event a holder of our\nClass A ordinary shares acquires shares representing 9.9% or more of the total voting power of our total ordinary shares or the\nClass B ordinary shares represent more than 9.5% of the total voting power of our total outstanding shares, there will be an\neffective reallocation of the voting power of the Class A ordinary shares or Class B ordinary shares which may cause a\nshareholder to acquire 5% or more of the voting power of the total ordinary shares.\nSuch a shareholder may become subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of Sections 13(d) and (g) of the\nExchange Act. Such a reallocation also may result in an obligation to amend previous filings made under Section 13(d) or (g) of\nthe Exchange Act. Under our Articles, we have no obligation to notify shareholders of any adjustments to their voting power.\nShareholders should consult their own legal counsel regarding the possible reporting requirements under Section 13 of the\nExchange Act.\nAt December 31, 2022, David Einhorn owned 18.0% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares, which given that\neach Class B share is entitled to ten votes, causes him to exceed the 9.5% limitation imposed on the total voting power of the\nClass B ordinary shares. Thus, the voting power held by the Class B ordinary shares that is in excess of the 9.5% limitation will\nbe reallocated pro-rata to holders of Class A ordinary shares according to their percentage interest in the Company. However,\nno shareholder will be allocated voting rights that would cause it to have 9.9% or more of the total voting power of our ordinary\nshares. The allocation of the voting power of the Class B ordinary shares to a holder of Class A ordinary shares will depend\nupon the total voting power of the Class B ordinary shares outstanding, as well as the percentage of Class A ordinary shares\nheld by a shareholder and the other holders of Class A ordinary shares. Accordingly, we cannot estimate with precision what\nmultiple of a vote per share a holder of Class A ordinary shares will be allocated as a result of the anticipated reallocation of\nvoting power of the Class B ordinary shares.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on\nyour investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common shares.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares for the foreseeable future. Therefore, you\nare not likely to receive any dividends on your Class A ordinary shares for the foreseeable future. The success of an investment\nin our Class A ordinary shares will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that our Class A\nordinary shares will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our shareholders have purchased their shares.\nIn the event that we did declare a dividend, such dividends and other distributions on issued and outstanding ordinary\nshares may only be paid out of the funds of the Company lawfully available for such purpose. Dividends and other distributions\nwill be distributed among the holders of our Class A ordinary shares on a pro rata basis\n44\nLink to Table of Contents\nRisks Relating to Taxation\nWe may become subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands, which would negatively affect our results.\nUnder current Cayman Islands law, we are not obligated to pay any taxes in the Cayman Islands on either income or\ncapital gains. The Governor-in-Cabinet of Cayman Islands has granted us an exemption from the imposition of any such tax on\nus until February 1, 2025. We cannot be assured that after such date we would not be subject to any such tax. If we were to\nbecome subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nGreenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re and/or GRIL may be subject to United States federal income taxation.\nGreenlight Capital Re and Greenlight Re are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and GRIL is\nincorporated under the laws of Ireland. These entities intend to operate in a manner that will not cause us to be treated as\nengaging in a trade or business within the United States and will not cause us to be subject to current United States federal\nincome taxation on Greenlight Capital Re’s, Greenlight Re’s and/or GRIL’s net income. However, because there are no\ndefinitive standards provided by the Internal Revenue Code, regulations or court decisions as to the specific activities that\nconstitute being engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, and as any such determination is\nessentially factual in nature, we cannot provide assurance that the United States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), will not\nsuccessfully assert that Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re and/or GRIL are engaged in a trade or business within the United\nStates. If the IRS were to successfully assert that Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re, and/or GRIL have been engaged in a\ntrade or business within the United States in any taxable year, various adverse tax consequences could result, including the\nfollowing: Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re and/or GRIL may become subject to current United States federal income\ntaxation on its net income from sources within the United States; Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re and/or GRIL may be\nsubject to United States federal income tax on a portion of its net investment income, regardless of its source; Greenlight\nCapital Re, Greenlight Re, and/or GRIL may not be entitled to deduct certain expenses that would otherwise be deductible from\nthe income subject to United States taxation; and Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re and/or GRIL may be subject to United\nStates branch profits tax on profits deemed to have been distributed out of the United States.\nUnited States persons who own Class A ordinary shares may be subject to United States federal income taxation on our\nundistributed earnings and may recognize ordinary income upon disposition of Class A ordinary shares.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company. Significant potential adverse United States federal income tax consequences,\nincluding certain reporting requirements, generally apply to any United States person who owns shares in a passive foreign\ninvestment company, or a “PFIC”. We do not expect that any of Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re, or GRIL will be a PFIC\nfor the current taxable year. However, we cannot provide assurance that none of Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re, or GRIL\nwill be a PFIC for the current taxable year or any future taxable year.\nIn general, any of Greenlight Capital Re, Greenlight Re or GRIL would be a PFIC for a taxable year if either (i) 75% or\nmore of its income constitutes “passive income” or (ii) 50% or more of its assets produce “passive income”, or are held for the\nproduction of passive income. Passive income generally includes interest, dividends and other investment income. However,\nunder an “active insurance” exception, income is not treated as passive if it is derived in the active conduct of an insurance\nbusiness by a qualifying insurance corporation. A qualifying insurance corporation is an insurance company which has\napplicable insurance liabilities, as reported on its annual financial statement, exceeding 25% of its total assets. Applicable\ninsurance liabilities means, with respect to our property and casualty reinsurance business, reserves for loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses, and excluding unearned premium reserves.\nThe exception for insurance companies is intended to ensure that a qualifying insurance entity’s income is not treated as\npassive income, except to the extent such income is attributable to financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of the\ninsurance business. We intend to operate our business with financial reserves and applicable insurance liabilities at levels that\nshould not cause us to be deemed PFICs, although we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in structuring our\noperations to meet such levels nor can we ensure that the IRS will not successfully challenge our status. If we are unable to\nunderwrite sufficient amount of risks and maintain a sufficient amount of applicable insurance liabilities, any of Greenlight\nCapital Re, Greenlight Re or GRIL may become a PFIC.\nIn addition, sufficient risk must be transferred under an insurance entity’s contracts with its insureds in order to qualify\nfor the insurance exception. Whether our insurance contracts possess adequate risk transfer for purposes of determining whether\nincome under our contracts is insurance income, and whether we are predominantly engaged in an insurance business, are\nsubjective in nature and there is little authoritative tax guidance on these issues. We cannot provide assurance that the IRS will\n45\nLink to Table of Contents\nnot successfully challenge our interpretation of the scope of the active insurance company exception and our qualification for\nthe exception. Further, the IRS may issue regulatory or other guidance that causes us to fail to qualify for the active insurance\ncompany exception on a prospective or retroactive basis. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will satisfy the\nexception for insurance companies and will not be treated as PFICs currently or in the future.\nControlled Foreign Corporation. United States persons who, directly or indirectly or through attribution rules, own 10%\nor more of the total combined voting power or value of our shares, which we refer to as United States 10% shareholders, may\nbe subject to the controlled foreign corporation, or CFC, rules. Under the CFC rules, each United States 10% shareholder must\nannually include their pro-rata share of the CFC’s “subpart F income” and “global intangible low-tax income” in their gross\nincome in the year earned by the CFC, even if no distributions are made. In general, a foreign insurance company will be\ntreated as a CFC only if during the taxable year United States 10% shareholders collectively own more than 25% of the total\ncombined voting power or total value of the entity’s shares. We believe that the dispersion of our Class A ordinary shares\namong holders and the restrictions placed on transfer, issuance or repurchase of our Class A ordinary shares , will in most cases\nprevent shareholders who acquire Class A ordinary shares from being United States 10% shareholders. We cannot provide\nassurance, however, that these rules will not apply to you if you are or become a United States 10% shareholder. In particular,\nrecent changes to the definition of a United States 10% Shareholder, whereby both vote and value are tested, and recent changes\nto the constructive ownership rules, whereby shares owned by non-United States persons can be attributed to United States\npersons, may increase the likelihood of these rules applying. If you are a United States person, we strongly urge you to consult\nyour own tax advisor concerning the CFC rules.\nRelated Person Insurance Income. If:\n● our gross income attributable to insurance or reinsurance policies where the direct or indirect insureds are our direct or\nindirect United States shareholders or persons related to such United States shareholders equals or exceeds 20% of our\ngross insurance income in any taxable year; and\n● direct or indirect insureds and persons related to such insureds owned directly or indirectly 20% or more of the voting\npower or value of our stock,\na United States person who owns Class A ordinary shares directly or indirectly on the last day of the taxable year would most\nlikely be required to include their pro-rata share of our related person insurance income for the taxable year in their income.\nThis amount would be determined as if such related person insurance income were distributed proportionally to United States\npersons at that date. We do not expect that we will knowingly enter into reinsurance agreements in which, in the aggregate, the\ndirect or indirect insureds are, or are related to, owners of 20% or more of the Class A ordinary shares. We do not believe that\nthe 20% gross insurance income threshold will be met. However, we cannot provide assurance that this is or will continue to be\nthe case. Consequently, we cannot provide assurance that a person who is a direct or indirect United States shareholder will not\nbe required to include amounts in its income in respect of related person insurance income in any taxable year.\nIf a United States shareholder is treated as disposing of shares in a foreign insurance corporation that has related person\ninsurance income and in which United States persons own 25% or more of the voting power or value of the entity’s shares, any\ngain from the disposition will generally be treated as a dividend to the extent of the United States shareholder’s portion of the\ncorporation’s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the United States shareholder\nowned the shares. In addition, the shareholder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, regardless of the\namount of shares owned by the direct or indirect United States shareholder. Although not free from doubt, we believe these\nrules should not apply to dispositions of Class A ordinary shares because Greenlight Capital Re is not directly engaged in the\ninsurance business and because proposed United States Treasury regulations applicable to this situation appear to apply only in\nthe case of shares of corporations that are directly engaged in the insurance business. We cannot provide assurance, however,\nthat the IRS will interpret the proposed regulations in this manner or that the proposed regulations will not be promulgated in\nfinal form in a manner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of Class A ordinary shares.\nUnited States tax-exempt organizations who own Class A ordinary shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income.\nIf you are a United States tax-exempt organization you may recognize unrelated business taxable income if a portion of\nour subpart F insurance income is allocated to you. In general, subpart F insurance income will be allocated to you if we are a\nCFC as discussed above and you are a United States 10% shareholder or there is related person insurance income and certain\nexceptions do not apply. Although we do not believe that any United States persons will be allocated subpart F insurance\nincome, we cannot provide assurance that this will be the case. If you are a United States tax-exempt organization, we advise\nyou to consult your own tax advisor regarding the risk of recognizing unrelated business taxable income.\n46\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe TCJA may cause us to undertake changes to the manner in which we conduct our business and could subject United\nStates persons who own Class A ordinary shares to United States income taxation on our undistributed earnings.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA provides a bright-line test that a non-U.S. insurance\ncompany only will receive the benefit, for passive foreign investment company purposes, of being engaged in the active\nconduct of an insurance business if its applicable insurance liabilities constitute more than 25% of its total assets. For this\npurpose, the term “applicable insurance liabilities” does not include unearned premium reserves. One of the TCJA’s potential\nimpacts is that this limitation could result in the treatment of offshore insurers or reinsurers that write business on a low\nfrequency/high severity basis, such as property catastrophe companies and financial guaranty companies, as PFICs, as\nsignificant reserves for losses may not be recorded until a catastrophic event actually occurs. Accordingly, subject to any future\ncorrections or clarifications that may be made to the TCJA, or any additional regulations that may be promulgated thereunder,\nthe Company will be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year in which it does not meet the bright-line applicable insurance\nliabilities requirement of the TCJA.\nAt December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 the Company met the bright-line applicable insurance liabilities test. However,\nthere is still substantial uncertainty regarding the application of the test. The Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to\nmeet the bright-line applicable insurance liabilities test in future periods. In the event that the Company cannot meet this test,\nshareholders that are United States persons will be subject to United States income taxation on the Company’s undistributed\nearnings.\nFurther changes in United States tax regulations and laws including the rules regarding passive foreign investment\ncompanies could have a material impact on our ability to qualify for the insurance company exemption and/or change our\nstatus for United States persons who own Class A ordinary shares.\nThe IRS or Congress may issue additional regulations or legislation regarding the applicable insurance liabilities bright-\nline test of the passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) rules or other aspects of the PFIC rules applicable to foreign\ninsurance companies. On December 4, 2020, the IRS issued proposed regulations (the “2020 Proposed Regulations”) and final\nregulations (the “2020 Final Regulations”) that would provide additional guidance and requirements regarding the exclusion\nfrom the definition of “passive income” for income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a qualified\ninsurance corporation (“QIC”) and the application of certain look-through rules with respect to assets held, and income earned,\nthrough subsidiaries.\nUnder the 2020 Proposed Regulations, a QIC is in the “active conduct” of an insurance business only if it satisfies either\na “factual requirements test” or an “active conduct percentage test.” The factual requirements test requires that the officers and\nemployees of the QIC carry out substantial managerial and operational activities on a regular and continuous basis with respect\nto its core functions and that they perform virtually all of the active decision-making functions relevant to underwriting\nfunctions. The active conduct percentage test generally requires that (i) the total costs incurred by the QIC with respect to its\nofficers and employees for services rendered with respect to its core functions (other than investment activities) equal or exceed\n50 percent of total costs incurred by the QIC with respect to its officers and employees and any other person or entities for\nservices rendered with respect to its core functions (other than investment activities) and (ii) to the extent the QIC outsources\nany part of its core functions to unrelated entities, officers and employees of the QIC with experience and relevant expertise\nmust select and supervise the person that performs the outsourced functions, establish objectives for performance of the\noutsourced functions and prescribe rigorous guidelines relating to the outsourced functions which are routinely evaluated and\nupdated. Under certain exceptions, however, a QIC (a) that has no or only a nominal number of employees or (b) that is a\nvehicle that (x) has the effect of securitizing or collateralizing insurance risks underwritten by other insurance or reinsurance\ncompanies or (y) is an insurance linked securities fund that invests in securitization vehicles, is deemed not engaged in the\nactive conduct of an insurance business. A QIC’s officers and employees include those of certain affiliates for these purposes.\nThe 2020 Final Regulations contain guidance on the treatment of the assets and income of certain look-through subsidiaries of a\nQIC, among other provisions related to QICs and PFICs.\nWe currently expect that the Company would not be a PFIC for the 2023 taxable year under the rules described above,\nwere they effective for such year. However, the rules are subject to varying interpretations and are highly dependent on the\nfacts and circumstances, which may change from year to year or within a year. We can offer no assurance whether, in what\nform or when the 2020 Proposed Regulations could be adopted. We also can offer no assurance as to the potential impact of the\n2020 Proposed Regulations or the 2020 Final Regulations for the Company in any year.\nWe are monitoring developments with respect to both the applicable insurance liabilities test and the IRS regulations. At\nthis time, we cannot predict whether or what, if any, additional regulations will be adopted or additional legislation will be\nenacted. If regulations are adopted or legislation enacted that cause us to fail to meet the requirements of the insurance company\n47\nLink to Table of Contents\nexception, or if we fail to meet the applicable insurance liabilities test such failure could have a material adverse effect on the\ntaxation of our shareholders who are U.S. persons. In that event we may undertake further changes to the manner in which we\nconduct our business, which also could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nThe tax laws and interpretations regarding whether an entity is engaged in a United States trade or business, is a CFC,\nhas related party insurance income or is a PFIC are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. New regulations or\npronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be forthcoming from the IRS. We are not able to predict if, when or\nin what form such guidance will be provided and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect.\nThe TCJA may have a detrimental effect on the Company and its assets.\nThe regulatory and tax environment globally is evolving, and changes in the regulation or taxation of the Company and\nits assets may materially adversely shareholders. The TCJA among other things, made significant changes to the rules\napplicable to the taxation of the Company and its assets, such as changing the rules applicable to active insurance income for\npassive foreign investment company purposes (discussed above), changing rules applicable to controlled foreign investment\ncompany purposes, new base erosion rules, changing the general corporate tax rate to a flat 21% rate, modifying the rules\nregarding limitations on certain deductions, introducing a capital investment deduction in certain circumstances, placing certain\nlimitations on the interest deduction, modifying the rules regarding the usability of certain net operating losses, and the\nmigration from a worldwide system of taxation to a modified territorial system. At this time the ultimate outcome of the\nlegislation on the Company and its shareholders is uncertain and could be adverse. Shareholders should consult their own tax\nadvisors regarding potential changes in tax laws.\nIf investments held by GRIL are determined not to be integral to the reinsurance business carried on by GRIL, additional\nIrish tax could be imposed and our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nBased on administrative practice, taxable income derived from investments made by GRIL is generally taxed in Ireland\nat the rate of 12.5% on the grounds that such investments either form part of the permanent capital required by regulatory\nauthorities, or are otherwise integral to the reinsurance business carried on by GRIL. GRIL intends to operate in such a manner\nso that the level of investments held by GRIL does not exceed the amount that is integral to the reinsurance businesses carried\non by GRIL. If, however, investment income earned by GRIL exceeds these thresholds or if the administrative practice of the\nIrish Revenue Commissioners changes, Irish corporation tax could apply to such investment income at a higher rate (currently\n25%) instead of the general 12.5% rate, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe impact of the initiative of the OECD and the EU to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely\naffect our tax status in the Cayman Islands where we are exempt from income taxes.\nThe OECD has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non-member countries on\nmeasures to limit harmful tax competition. These measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax neutral\njurisdictions and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world. While the Cayman Islands is currently on the list of\njurisdictions that have substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard, we are not able to predict if additional\nrequirements will be imposed, and if so, whether changes arising from such additional requirements will subject us to additional\ntaxes. The Cayman Islands’ economic substance legislation had already been evaluated in June 2019 by the OECD’s Forum on\nHarmful Tax Practices as “not harmful”, which is the highest rating possible. There are no immediate regulatory, tax, trade or\nother legal impacts to the Company, but we are not able to predict any future EU actions and whether the EU will deem the\nnewly enacted laws to be compliant with its requirements in order to remove the Cayman Islands from Annex 1.\nOn October 8, 2021, the OECD announced an accord endorsing and providing an implementation plan for a global\nminimum tax rate of at least 15% for large multinational corporations on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis, known as the “two\npillar plan.” The global minimum tax rate would apply to overseas profits of multinational firms with annual revenue of more\nthan €750 million. While the implementation of the accord is uncertain and the minimum tax is not expected to apply to the\nCompany as currently proposed, adjustments to the threshold could impact the Company in future periods.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n48\nLink to Table of Contents\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe currently occupy our office space in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands under an operating lease arrangement which\nexpires in 2026. Additionally, we have an operating lease agreement for office space in Dublin, Ireland which expires in 2031,\nbut provides us an option to terminate the lease in 2026 without any penalty. We believe that for the foreseeable future the\noffice spaces in the Cayman Islands and Ireland will be sufficient for conducting our operations.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, we may be involved in formal and informal dispute resolution\nprocedures, which may include arbitration or litigation, the outcomes of which determine our rights and obligations under our\nreinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, we may seek to enforce our rights under an\nagreement or to collect funds owing to us. In other matters, we may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged\nrights. While the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of our existing\ncontractual disputes, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults.\nITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information and number of holders\nOur Class A ordinary shares began publicly trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 24, 2007, under the\nsymbol “GLRE.”\nAt March 3, 2023, the number of holders of record of our Class A ordinary shares was approximately 54, not including\nbeneficial owners of shares registered in nominee or street name who represent approximately 91.7% of the Class A ordinary\nshares issued and outstanding.\nDividends\nSince inception, we have not paid any cash dividends on our Class A ordinary shares or Class B ordinary shares, or\ncollectively, our ordinary shares.\nHolders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends when, as, and if declared by the Board of Directors in\naccordance with the provisions of our Articles and the Companies Law. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up\nof the Company, the holders of ordinary shares are entitled to share equally and ratably in our assets, if any remain after the\npayment of all of our debts and liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding preferred shares.\nWe currently do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. Our Board of\nDirectors would only approve a dividend after taking into account our capital and liquidity position. In addition, a letter of\ncredit facility prohibits us from paying dividends during an event of default as defined in the letter of credit agreement. Our\nfuture dividend policy will also depend on the requirements of any future financing agreements to which we may be a party and\nother factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors, such as our results of operations and cash flows, our financial\nposition, and capital requirements, general business conditions, rating agency guidelines, legal, tax, regulatory and any\ncontractual restrictions on the payment of dividends. Further, any future declaration and payment of dividends are discretionary,\nand our Board of Directors may, at any time, modify or revoke our dividend policy on our ordinary shares. Finally, our ability\nto pay dividends also depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. Although Greenlight Capital Re is not\nsubject to any significant legal prohibitions on the payment of dividends, Greenlight Re and GRIL are subject to regulatory\nconstraints that affect their ability to pay dividends and include minimum net worth requirements. At December 31, 2022,\nGreenlight Re and GRIL both exceeded the minimum statutory capital requirements. Any dividends we pay will be declared\nand paid in U.S. dollars.\n49\nPerformance Graph\nPresented below is a line graph comparing the yearly change in the cumulative total shareholder return on our Class A\nordinary shares for the five year period commencing December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2022 against the total return\nindex for the Russell 2000 Index, or RUT, and the S&P 500 Property & Casualty Insurance Index, or S&P Insurance Index, for\nthe same period.

References to our “Ordinary Shares” refer collectively to our Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary\nShares.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes, which appear elsewhere in this filing.\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and\n2021 and financial condition at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nWe have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by our consolidated financial statements\npresented in this report because we included that disclosure in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021,\nfiled with the SEC on March 8, 2022. You are encouraged to reference Part II, Item 7, within that report, for a discussion of our\nfinancial condition and result of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2020.\nGeneral\nWe are a global specialty property and casualty reinsurer headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with a reinsurance and\ninvestment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. Our goal is to build long-term shareholder\nvalue by providing risk management solutions to the insurance, reinsurance, and other risk marketplaces. We focus on\ndelivering risk solutions to clients and brokers who value our expertise, analytics, and customer service offerings.\nWe aim to complement our underwriting activities with a non-traditional investment approach designed to achieve\nhigher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that exclusively employ more traditional investment\nstrategies. Our investment portfolio is managed according to a value-oriented philosophy, in which our investment advisor takes\nlong positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities.\nThrough Greenlight Re Innovations, we support technology innovators in the (re)insurance market by providing\ninvestment capital, risk capacity, and access to a broad insurance network.\nBecause we seek to capitalize on favorable market conditions and opportunities, period-to-period comparisons of our\nunderwriting results may not be meaningful. Also, our historical investment results are not necessarily indicative of future\nperformance. Due to the nature of our reinsurance and investment strategies, our operating results will likely fluctuate from\nperiod to period.\nThe Company’s subsidiaries hold an A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) with a stable outlook.\nOutlook and Trends\nWe operate in a business where we expect volatility in our underwriting results. Hurricane Ian, which struck the\nsoutheast U.S. in September 2022, is likely to prove one of the costliest natural disasters ever in terms of insured losses. This\nstorm, the Russian-Ukraine conflict, and several smaller events have combined to make 2022 another challenging year for\ncompanies that participate in the global reinsurance market. We were not immune from these events; our combined ratio for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, was 102.3%.\nFurther, the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict has resulted in the U.S., United Kingdom, European Union, and other\ncountries imposing financial and economic sanctions, which have caused disruption in the global economy and have increased\neconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. If this conflict is prolonged, we and other reinsurers may incur additional losses in\nfuture periods.\n51\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe continuing widespread inflation is a significant concern to the industry, as it can add uncertainty to the cost of\nclaims, particularly for classes of business with long payout tails. As a result, it creates pricing challenges for new business and\nvaluation challenges in claims reserves. We are addressing these concerns in multiple ways:\n• Our underwriting strategy focuses on relatively short-tailed business, which is inherently less exposed to inflation than\nlong-tailed lines. We estimate the payout duration of our existing reserves at approximately two years.\n• We incorporate inflation assumptions in all our pricing and reassess these assumptions frequently.\n• We are minimizing our exposure to classes that are experiencing severe supply-chain-driven inflation.\nThe rising interest rate environment has had a mixed impact on our financial results. While we have experienced losses\ndriven by fixed-income securities held by Lloyd’s syndicates in which we participate, the higher interest rates have improved\nthe yield on our restricted cash and cash equivalents. To the extent interest rates continue to increase, we expect to see these\ntrends continue.\nThe combination of the recent loss events, continued inflation, and rising interest rates led to a significant reduction in\nthe amount of reinsurance capital available for deployment, which in turn has led to market conditions that we consider more\nfavorable than any we have experienced in more than a decade. The January 1 renewal season saw widespread pricing\nimprovements in the aviation, war and terror, and marine classes and even higher increases in the property catastrophe rates.\nThese short-tailed specialty and property catastrophe classes represents a significant portion of our 2023 business plan.\nElsewhere in our portfolio, average percentage rate improvements were in the single digits.\nAdditionally, we continue to be encouraged by our Innovations unit, whose central objective is to enhance our\nunderwriting return and risk profile by establishing a range of strategic partnerships. Our Innovations-related premiums,\nincluded premiums written by Syndicate 3456, accounted for approximately 18% of our net premiums written in 2022. We see\nthe potential for significant growth from Innovations-derived underwriting opportunities in the future.\nSILP generated a net return of 25.3% in 2022, compared to an 18.1% loss for the S&P 500 index. Effective January 1,\n2023, the Company increased its allocation to SILP to a maximum of 60% of surplus.\nSegments\nWe have one operating segment, Property & Casualty reinsurance, and we analyze our business based on the following\ncategories:\n● Property\n● Casualty\n● Other\nProperty business covers personal lines, commercial lines exposures and automobile physical damage. Property\nbusiness includes both catastrophe and non-catastrophe coverage. We expect property business to account for a small portion of\nour overall catastrophe exposure.\nCasualty business covers general liability, motor liability, professional liability, and workers’ compensation exposures.\nThe Company’s multi-line business includes the Funds at Lloyd’s business. As our Lloyd’s syndicate contracts incorporate\nproperty (including incidental catastrophe), casualty, and other exposures, we categorize them as multi-line (and therefore\ncasualty) business. However, these contracts are composed of primarily short-tailed risks.\nOther business covers accident and health, financial (including transactional liability, mortgage insurance, surety, and\ntrade credit), marine, energy, as well as other specialty business such as aviation, crop, cyber, political, and terrorism exposures.\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues from two principal sources:\n● premiums from reinsurance on property and casualty business assumed (net of any premiums ceded); and\n● income from investments.\n52\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe recognize premiums written as revenues, net of any applicable underlying reinsurance coverage, over the term of the\nrelated policy or contract. Depending on the contract structure, the earnings period could be the same as the reinsurance contract\nor based on the terms of the underlying insurance policies.\nIncome from our investments is primarily composed of:\n● income (or loss) generated from our investment in SILP;\n● gains (or losses) from our other investments, including Innovations and investments accounted for under the\nequity method;\n● interest income on our restricted cash and cash equivalents and Funds at Lloyd’s;\n● foreign exchange gains (or losses); and\n● interest income and gains (or losses) from promissory notes receivable.\nIn addition, we may from time to time derive other income from interest on deposit-accounted contracts, fees generated\nfrom advisory services, and fees relating to overrides, profit commissions, and fees due upon the early termination of contracts.\nExpenses\nOur expenses consist primarily of the following:\n● underwriting losses and loss adjustment expenses;\n● acquisition costs;\n● general and administrative expenses;\n● interest expense;\n● investment-related expenses.\nThe extent of our loss and LAE is a function of the amount and type of reinsurance contracts we write and the loss\nexperience of the underlying coverage. As described below, loss and loss adjustment expenses include an actuarially\ndetermined estimate of losses incurred, including losses incurred during the period and changes in estimates from prior periods.\nThe period over which we pay loss and LAE reserves depends on the nature of the coverage provided and generally extends\nover multiple years.\nAcquisition costs consist primarily of brokerage fees, ceding commissions, premium taxes, profit commissions, letters of\ncredit and trust fees, and federal excise taxes. We amortize deferred acquisition costs relating to successfully bound reinsurance\ncontracts over the related contract term.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and related costs, including costs\nassociated with our incentive compensation plan, bonuses, and stock compensation expenses. General and administrative\nexpenses also include professional fees, travel and entertainment, information technology, rent, and other general operating\ncosts. General and administrative expenses reported in our consolidated statements of operations include both underwriting and\ncorporate expenses.\nInterest expense consists of interest paid and accrued on senior convertible notes and the amortization of issuance\nexpenses. In addition, we incur interest expenses on some deposit-accounted contracts.\nInvestment-related expenses primarily consist of management fees and performance compensation paid to the investment\nadvisor. We net these expenses against investment income (loss) in our consolidated statements of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and have required\nmanagement to make assumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including those described\nin “Part I. Item IA. — Risk Factors,” cause actual events or results to differ materially from our underlying assumptions or\nestimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. We believe the\nfollowing accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements. We\nhave summarized the descriptions below for clarity. We have included a more detailed description of our significant accounting\npolicies and recently issued accounting standards in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n53\nLink to Table of Contents\nPremium Revenues and Risk Transfer. We record our property and casualty reinsurance premiums as premiums written\nbased on contract terms and information received from ceding companies and their brokers. Excess of loss reinsurance contracts\ntypically state premiums as a percentage of the subject premiums written by the client, subject to a minimum and deposit\npremium. The minimum and deposit premium is generally based on an estimate of subject premiums expected to be written by\nthe client during the contract term. The minimum and deposit premium is reported initially as premiums written and adjusted, if\nnecessary, in subsequent periods once the actual subject premium is known.\nCertain contracts provide for reinstatement premiums in the event of a loss. Reinstatement premiums are written and\nearned when a triggering loss event occurs.\nOur clients estimate the gross premiums they expect to write at the contract’s inception for each proportional contract we\nunderwrite. Our underwriters initially utilize the client’s estimate to determine our best estimate. In subsequent periods, we\nadjust our estimates based on our client’s actual reports and our expectations of market conditions for the applicable line of\nbusiness. As the contract progresses, we monitor premiums received in conjunction with the client’s correspondence to refine\nour estimate. Variances from initial gross premiums estimates are generally greater for proportional contracts than for non-\nproportional ones. We earn premiums over the risk coverage period. Unearned premiums represent the unexpired portion of\nreinsurance provided.\nAt the inception of each of our reinsurance contracts, we receive premium estimates from the client, which we use in\nconjunction with historical and industry data to estimate what we believe will be the ultimate premium payable under each\ncontract. We receive actual premiums written by each client as the client reports the actual results of the underlying insurance\nwritings to us monthly or quarterly (depending on the contract). We book the actual premiums written when we receive them\nfrom our client. Each reporting period, we estimate the premiums written for stub periods that have not yet been reported to us\nby the client. For example, at year-end, we may have to estimate December premiums ceded under certain contracts since the\nclient may not be required to report the actual results to us until after we have issued our audited consolidated financial\nstatements. Typically, we only use premium estimates for unreported stub periods, which account for a small percentage of our\ntotal premiums written.\nWe confirm the accuracy and completeness of premiums reported by our clients by reviewing the client’s statutory\nfilings, where available, or performing an audit of the client under the contract terms. Discrepancies between premiums ceded\nand reported under a contract are, in our experience, rare. To date, we have not had any material difference in premiums\nreported by a client that required a formal dispute resolution process.\nAssessing whether a reinsurance contract meets the conditions for risk transfer requires judgment. The determination of\nrisk transfer is critical to reporting premiums written and is based in part on the use of actuarial and pricing models and\nassumptions. If we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk to merit reinsurance accounting\ntreatment, we report the premium we receive as a deposit liability. Similarly, we report the premium we pay as a deposit asset\nfor ceded contracts that do not transfer sufficient risk to merit reinsurance accounting. Any income and expense on deposit-\naccounted contracts is calculated using the interest method and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations under the\ncaptions “Other income (expense)” and “Deposit interest expense,” respectively.\nInvestments. We carry our investment in SILP at fair value, based on the most recent net asset value obtained from\nSILP’s third-party administrator. The caption “Other investments” in our consolidated balance sheets includes private and\nunlisted equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values. We determine these private equity securities’\ncarrying value based on the original cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for an\nidentical or similar investment of the same issuer. At each reporting date, we qualitatively consider whether the investment is\nimpaired on the basis of certain impairment indicators. If we determine that the equity security is impaired on the basis of the\nqualitative assessment and the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss in the\ncaption “Net investment income (loss)” in the consolidated statements of operations. We determine realized gains and losses\nfrom other investments based on the specific identification method (by reference to cost or amortized cost, as appropriate).\nThese gains and losses are included in the captions “Net investment income (loss)” in the consolidated statements of operations.\n54\nLink to Table of Contents\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves. Estimating our loss and LAE reserves involves a considerable degree of\njudgment, and our estimates as of any given date are inherently uncertain. Estimating loss and LAE reserves requires us to\nmake assumptions regarding reporting and development patterns, frequency and severity trends, claims settlement practices,\npotential changes in legal environments, inflation, loss amplification, foreign exchange movements, and other factors. These\nestimates and judgments are based on numerous considerations and are often revised as (i) we receive changes in loss amounts\nreported by ceding companies and brokers; (ii) we obtain additional information, experience, or other data; (iii) we develop new\nor improved methodologies; or (iv) we observe changes in the legal environment.\nOur loss and LAE reserves relating to short-tail property risks are typically reported to us and settled more promptly than\nthose relating to long-tail risks. However, the timeliness of loss reporting can be affected by such factors as the nature of the\nevent causing the loss, the location of the loss, whether the loss is from policies in force with primary insurers or with\nreinsurers, and where our exposure falls within the cedent’s overall reinsurance program.\nOur loss and LAE reserves are composed of case reserves (based on claims reported to us) and IBNR reserves, including\nthe associated claims handling costs.\nWe determine case reserve estimates based on loss reports received. We determine our IBNR reserve estimates using\nstandard actuarial methods and a combination of our own historical and current loss experience, insurance industry loss\nexperience, assessments of pricing adequacy trends, and our professional judgment. In estimating our IBNR reserve, we\nestimate the total ultimate loss and LAE we expect to incur and subtract paid claims and case reserves.\nThe nature and extent of our judgment in the reserving process depend in part upon the type of business. Some of our\nproperty treaty reinsurance contracts represent business with a low frequency of claims occurrence and a high potential loss\nseverity, such as claims arising from natural catastrophes. Given the nature of these events, traditional actuarial reserving\nmethods may not be reliable indicators of the final outcome. As such, for contracts or losses of this type, we estimate the\nultimate cost associated with a single loss event rather than perform analysis on the historical development patterns of past\nevents to estimate the ultimate losses for an entire accident year. We estimate our reserves for these large events on a by-\ncontract basis by reviewing policies with known or potential exposure to a particular loss event.\nFor non-catastrophe losses, we apply standard actuarial methodologies in setting reserves, including paid and incurred\nloss development, Bornheutter-Ferguson, burning cost, and frequency and severity techniques. We supplement our analysis\nwith industry loss ratio and development pattern information in conjunction with our own experience. The weight given to a\nparticular method will depend on many factors, including the homogeneity within the class of business, the volume of losses,\nthe maturity of the accident year, and the length of the expected development tail. For example, the expected loss ratio method\nassumes that the ratio of premiums and losses remains constant. In contrast, development methods rely on observable patterns\nwithin reported losses, both historical and newly reported, to establish a view of the ultimate loss incurred. Therefore, as an\naccident year matures, we may migrate from an expected loss ratio method to an incurred development method.\nAs a predominantly broker-market reinsurer for both excess-of-loss and proportional contracts, we rely on loss\ninformation reported to brokers by primary insurers who, in turn, must estimate their losses at the policy level, often based on\nincomplete and changing information. The information we receive varies by cedent and may include paid losses, estimated case\nreserves, and an estimated provision for IBNR reserves. Reserving practices and data-reporting quality differ among ceding\ncompanies, which adds further uncertainty to our estimation of ultimate losses. The nature and extent of information received\nfrom ceding companies and brokers also vary widely depending on the type of coverage, the contractual reporting terms (which\nare affected by market conditions and practices), and other factors. Due to the lack of standardization of the terms and\nconditions of reinsurance contracts, the differences in coverage provided to individual clients, and the tendency of those\ncoverages to change rapidly in response to market conditions, we cannot always reliably measure the ongoing economic impact\nof such uncertainties and inconsistencies.\nTime lags are inherent in loss reporting, especially in the case of excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts. The time lags,\ncoupled with the combined characteristics of low claim frequency and high claim severity on such contracts, make the available\ndata less useful for predicting ultimate losses.\nIn the case of proportional contracts, we rely on an analysis of a cedent’s historical experience, industry information, and\nthe underwriters’ professional judgment in estimating reserves. We also utilize ultimate loss ratio forecasts when reported by\ncedents and brokers, which are ordinarily subject to three to six-month lags for proportional business. Due to our reliance on\nceding companies for claims reporting, our reserve estimates are highly dependent on ceding companies’ judgment.\nFurthermore, during the loss settlement period, which may last several years, additional facts regarding individual claims and\ntrends will often become known, and case law may change, affecting ultimate expected losses.\n55\nLink to Table of Contents\nSince we rely on ceding company data in establishing our loss and LAE reserves, we maintain procedures designed to\nmitigate the risk that such information is incomplete or inaccurate. These procedures include: (i) comparisons of expected\npremiums to reported premiums, which helps us to identify delinquent client periodic reports; (ii) ceding company audits to\nidentify inaccurate or incomplete reporting of claims and ensure that claims are actively and appropriately managed in line with\nagreed protocols and settlement authority limits; and (iii) underwriting reviews to ascertain that the losses ceded are covered as\nprovided under the contract terms. These procedures are incorporated in our internal controls and are regularly evaluated and\namended as market conditions, risk factors, and unanticipated areas of exposure develop.\nWe engage an independent third-party actuarial firm to perform a quarterly reserve review and annually opine on the\nreasonableness and adequacy of the aggregate loss reserves. We provide the third-party actuarial firm with our pricing models,\nreserving analysis, and other data. The actuarial firm may also inquire about the various assumptions and estimates used in the\nreserving analysis. The actuarial firm independently creates its own reserving models based on industry loss information,\naugmented by client-specific loss information and independent assumptions and estimates. Based on various reserving\nmethodologies that the actuarial firm considers appropriate, it creates a loss reserve estimate for each segment in the portfolio. It\nrecommends an aggregate loss reserve, including IBNR. In the event of material differences between our aggregated booked\nreserves and the actuarial firm's recommended reserves, the reserving committee would be notified, with the reserves adjusted\nas deemed appropriate. To date, there have been no material differences resulting from the external actuary’s reviews requiring\nadjustments to our booked reserves.\nWe monitor the development of our prior-year losses during subsequent calendar years by comparing the actual reported\nlosses against previous estimates and current expectations. The analysis of this loss development is important to the ongoing\nrefinement of our reserving assumptions. Each additional year of loss experience with a given cedent provides additional insight\ninto the accuracy and timeliness of previously reported information.\nEstimating loss reserves for our book of longer-tail casualty reinsurance business, which we write on both a proportional\nand non-proportional basis, involves further uncertainties. In addition to the uncertainties described above, casualty business is\ngenerally subject to longer reporting lags than property business, and claims often take several years to settle. During this\nperiod, additional factors and trends will be revealed, and we may adjust our reserves accordingly. Therefore, any factors that\nextend the time until our cedents settle claims add uncertainty to the reserving process.\nThe uncertainties inherent in the reserving process and the potential for unforeseen developments, including changes in\nlaws and the prevailing interpretation of policy terms, may result in our loss and LAE reserves being materially greater or less\nthan the loss and LAE reserves we initially established. We reflect adjustments to our loss and LAE reserves in our financial\nresults during the period they are determined. Changes to our prior year loss reserves will impact our current underwriting\nresults by improving our results if the prior year reserves prove redundant or impairing our results if the prior year reserves\nprove insufficient.\nWe believe that our reserves for loss and LAE are sufficient to cover losses that fall within the terms of our policies and\nagreements with our insured and reinsured customers based on the methodologies used to estimate those reserves. However, we\ncan provide no assurance that actual losses will not (i) be less than or (ii) exceed our total established reserves.\nPlease refer to Notes 2 and 7 of our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed explanation of our loss\nreserving methodology and the loss development tables by accident year, respectively, as required under U.S. GAAP.\nShare-Based Payments. We have established a stock incentive plan for directors, employees, and consultants. We\nrecognize share-based compensation transactions using the fair value at the award’s grant date. We calculate the compensation\nfor restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) based on the price of the Company’s common shares at the grant\ndate. For restricted stock awards that include both service and performance conditions, we recognize the associated expense\nwhen we determine that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. For restricted stock awards with only\nservice conditions, we recognize the associated expense, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, over the vesting period. We estimate\nthe forfeiture rate for restricted stock awards and RSUs based on our historical experience and expectations of future forfeitures.\nThe forfeiture rate reduces the unamortized grant date fair value of unvested outstanding restricted stock awards and RSUs and\nthe associated stock compensation expense. As restricted shares and RSUs are forfeited, we reduce the number of outstanding\nrestricted shares and RSUs and compare the remaining unamortized grant date fair value to the assumed forfeiture levels,\nadjusting the unamortized balance as necessary. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we have assumed a forfeiture rate of\n8.0% (2021: 9.0% and 2020: 7.0%) for restricted stock awards and RSUs granted.\nIf actual results differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions, particularly concerning our estimation of\nvolatility and forfeiture rates, share-based compensation expense, primarily relating to future share-based awards, could be\nmaterially impacted.\n56\nLink to Table of Contents\nKey Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement uses certain key financial measures, some of which are not prescribed under U.S. GAAP rules and\nstandards (“non-GAAP financial measures”), to evaluate our financial performance, financial position, and the change in\nshareholder value. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in SEC Regulation G, is a numerical measure of a\ncompany’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts\nthat are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented under U.S. GAAP.\nWe believe that these measures, which may be calculated or defined differently by other companies, provide consistent and\ncomparable metrics of our business performance to help shareholders understand performance trends and facilitate a more\nthorough understanding of the Company’s business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for\nthose determined under U.S. GAAP.\nThe key non-GAAP financial measures used in this report are:\n• Basic book value per share and fully diluted book value per share; and\n• Net underwriting income (loss)\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are described below.\nBasic Book Value Per Share and Fully Diluted Book Value Per Share\nWe believe that long-term growth in fully diluted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial\nperformance because it provides management and investors a yardstick to monitor the shareholder value generated. Fully\ndiluted book value per share may also help our investors, shareholders, and other interested parties form a basis of comparison\nwith other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry. Basic book value per share and fully diluted book\nvalue per share should not be viewed as substitutes for the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nWe calculate basic book value per share as (a) ending shareholders' equity, divided by (b) aggregate of Class A and\nClass B Ordinary shares issued and outstanding, including all unvested service-based restricted shares, and the earned portion\nof performance-based restricted shares granted after December 31, 2021. We exclude shares potentially issuable in connection\nwith convertible notes if the conversion price exceeds the share price.\nFully diluted book value per share represents basic book value per share combined with any dilutive impact of in-the-\nmoney stock options, unvested service-based RSUs, and the earned portion of unvested performance-based RSUs granted. Fully\ndiluted book value per share also includes the dilutive effect, if any, of ordinary shares expected to be issued upon settlement of\nthe convertible notes.\nOur primary financial goal is to increase fully diluted book value per share over the long term. We use fully diluted\nbook value per share as a financial measure in our annual incentive compensation.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures basic and fully diluted book value\nper share to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure:\n57\nLink to Table of Contents\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\n($ in thousands, except per share and share\namounts)\nNumerator for basic and fully diluted book value per share:\nTotal equity (U.S. GAAP) (numerator for basic and fully diluted book value\nper share) $ 503,120 $ 475,663 $ 464,857\nDenominator for basic and fully diluted book value per share: (1)\nOrdinary shares issued and outstanding as presented in the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets 34,824,061 33,844,446 34,514,790\nLess: Unearned performance-based restricted shares granted after\nDecember 31, 2021 (516,489) — —\nDenominator for basic book value per share 34,307,572 33,844,446 34,514,790\nAdd: In-the-money stock options, service-based RSUs granted, and earned\nperformance-based RSUs granted 187,750 154,134 116,722\nDenominator for fully diluted book value per share 34,495,322 33,998,580 34,631,512\nBasic book value per share $ 14.66 $ 14.05 $ 13.47\nIncrease (decrease) in basic book value per share ($) $ 0.61 $ 0.58 $ 0.57\nIncrease (decrease) in basic book value per share (%) 4.3 % 4.3 % 4.4 %\nFully diluted book value per share $ 14.59 $ 13.99 $ 13.42\nIncrease (decrease) in fully diluted book value per share ($) $ 0.60 $ 0.57 $ 0.54\nIncrease (decrease) in fully diluted book value per share (%) 4.3 % 4.2 % 4.2 %\n(1) For periods prior to January 1, 2022, all unvested restricted shares are included in the “basic” and “fully diluted”\ndenominators. Restricted shares with performance-based vesting conditions granted after December 31, 2021, are included in\nthe “basic” and “fully diluted” denominators to the extent that the Company has recognized the corresponding share-based\ncompensation expense. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate number of unearned restricted shares with performance conditions\nnot included in the “basic” and “fully diluted” denominators was 709,638 (2021: 193,149; 2020: 193,149).\nNet Underwriting Income (Loss)\nOne way that we evaluate the Company’s underwriting performance is by measuring net underwriting income (loss). We\ndo not use premiums written as a measure of performance. Net underwriting income (loss) is a performance measure used by\nmanagement to evaluate the fundamentals underlying the Company’s underwriting operations. We believe that the use of net\nunderwriting income (loss) enables investors and other users of the Company’s financial information to analyze our\nperformance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. Management also believes this measure follows\nindustry practice and allows the users of financial information to compare the Company’s performance with that of our industry\npeer group.\nNet underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used to calculate\nnet income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. We calculate net underwriting income (loss) as net premiums earned, plus other\nincome relating to reinsurance and deposit-accounted contracts, less deposit interest expense, less net loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses, acquisition costs, and underwriting expenses. The measure excludes, on a recurring basis: (1) investment income\n(loss); (2) other income (expense) not related to underwriting, including foreign exchange gains or losses, Lloyd’s interest\nincome and expense, and adjustments to the allowance for expected credit losses; (3) corporate general and administrative\nexpenses; and (4) interest expense. We exclude total investment income or loss, foreign exchange gains or losses, Lloyd’s\ninterest income or expense and expected credit losses as we believe these items are influenced by market conditions and other\nfactors unrelated to underwriting decisions. We exclude corporate and interest expenses because these costs are generally fixed\nand not incremental to or directly related to our underwriting operations. We believe all of these amounts are largely\nindependent of our underwriting process, and including them could hinder the analysis of trends in our underwriting operations.\nNet underwriting income (loss) should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income before income taxes.\n58\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe reconciliations of net underwriting income (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes (the most directly comparable\nU.S. GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis are shown below:\nYear ended December 31\n2022 2021 2020\n($ in thousands)\nIncome (loss) before income tax $ 24,526 $ 21,324 $ 4,290\nAdd (subtract):\nTotal investment (income) loss (68,983) (50,152) (25,532)\nOther non-underwriting (income) expense 11,777 880 (686)\nCorporate expenses 17,793 16,489 14,036\nInterest expense 4,201 6,263 6,280\nNet underwriting income (loss) $ (10,686) $ (5,196) $ (1,612)\n59\nLink to Table of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe table below summarizes our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n2022 2021 2020\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nUnderwriting revenue\nGross premiums written $ 563,171 $ 565,393 $ 479,791\nGross premiums ceded (33,429) (41) (2,268)\nNet premiums written 529,742 565,352 477,523\nChange in net unearned premium reserves (60,265) (26,073) (22,112)\nNet premiums earned 469,477 539,279 455,411\nUnderwriting related expenses\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred\nCurrent year 316,367 389,080 333,096\nPrior year * 118 (14,100) 4,737\nNet loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred 316,485 374,980 337,833\nAcquisition costs 143,148 144,960 109,288\nUnderwriting expenses 13,813 12,880 12,365\nDeposit accounting and other reinsurance expense (income) 6,717 11,655 (2,463)\nNet underwriting income (loss) 1 (10,686) (5,196) (1,612)\nIncome (loss) from investment in related party investment fund 54,844 18,087 4,431\nNet investment income (loss) 14,139 32,065 21,101\nTotal investment income (loss) $ 68,983 $ 50,152 $ 25,532\nNet underwriting and investment income (loss) $ 58,297 $ 44,956 $ 23,920\nCorporate expenses $ 17,793 $ 16,489 $ 14,036\nOther (income) expense, net 11,777 880 (686)\nInterest expense 4,201 6,263 6,280\nIncome tax expense (benefit) (816) 3,746 424\nNet income (loss) $ 25,342 $ 17,578 $ 3,866\nEarnings (loss) per share (Class A and Class B)\nBasic $ 0.75 $ 0.51 $ 0.11\nDiluted $ 0.73 $ 0.51 $ 0.11\nUnderwriting ratios\nLoss ratio - current year 67.4 % 72.1 % 73.1 %\nLoss ratio - prior year — % (2.6) % 1.1 %\nLoss ratio 67.4 % 69.5 % 74.2 %\nAcquisition cost ratio 30.5 % 26.9 % 24.0 %\nComposite ratio 97.9 % 96.4 % 98.2 %\nUnderwriting expense ratio 4.4 % 4.5 % 2.2 %\nCombined ratio 102.3 % 100.9 % 100.4 %\n* The net financial impacts associated with changes in the estimate of losses incurred in prior years, which incorporate earned\nreinstatement premiums assumed and ceded, and adjustments to assumed and ceded acquisition costs, were a loss of\n$12.2 million in 2022, a gain of $8.3 million in 2021, and a loss of $3.7 million in 2020.\n1 Net Underwriting income (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, basic book value per share\nincreased by $0.61, or 4.3%, to $14.66 per share from $14.05 per share at December 31, 2021. The increase in fully diluted\nbook value per share during the year ended December 31, 2022, is net of $0.07, or 0.5%, adverse impact relating to the adoption\nof ASU 2020-06 (see Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for recently issued accounting standards\nadopted).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, our net income was $25.3 million, compared to net income of $17.6 million\nreported for the equivalent 2021 period.\nThe developments that most significantly affected our financial performance during the year ended December 31,\n2022, compared to the equivalent 2021 period, are summarized below:\n• Underwriting: The underwriting loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $10.7 million, driven primarily\nby $13.6 million of losses related to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and $25.7 million of losses related to\nHurricane Ian, Typhoon Nanmadol, and wildfires in Tennessee. By comparison, the underwriting loss for the\nequivalent period in 2021 was $5.2 million, driven by losses from Hurricane Ida, the winter storm Uri, the\nEuropean floods and hailstorms, U.S. tornados, and South African riots.\nOur combined ratio was 102.3% for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 100.9% for the same period\nin 2021. The Russian-Ukrainian conflict and natural catastrophe losses contributed 8.4 percentage points to the\ncombined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2022. During the comparable period in 2021, catastrophe losses\ncontributed 6.1 percentage points to the combined ratio.\n• Investments: Our total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $69.0 million, compared to\n$50.2 million earned during the equivalent 2021 period. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our investment in\nSILP reported a gain of $54.8 million, compared to a gain of $18.1 million during the equivalent period in 2021.\nOther investment income from our Innovations investments and restricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $14.1\nmillion and $32.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n• Other income (expense): For the year ended December 31, 2022, other expense of $11.8 million was driven\nprimarily by:\n◦ foreign exchange losses, due mainly to the weakening of the pound sterling against the U.S. dollar; and\n◦ our share of Lloyd’s syndicates’ investment losses on Funds at Lloyd’s business, which is generally\nconducted on a funds withheld basis. The Lloyd’s syndicates invest a portion of these funds in fixed-\nmaturity securities and investment funds, which were negatively impacted by rising interest rates and\nmarket volatility. We record our share of these mark-to-market adjustments when the syndicates report\nthem to us, generally one quarter in arrears.\nUnderwriting results\nWe analyze our business based on three categories: “property,” “casualty,” and “other.”\n61\nLink to Table of Contents\nGross Premiums Written\nDetails of gross premiums written are provided in the following table:\nYear ended December 31\n2022 2021\n($ in thousands)\nProperty $ 85,323 15.2 % $ 52,947 9.4 %\nCasualty 325,103 57.7 379,113 67.0\nOther 152,745 27.1 133,333 23.6\nTotal $ 563,171 100.0 % $ 565,393 100.0 %\nAs a result of our underwriting philosophy, the total premiums we write and the mix of premiums between property,\ncasualty, and other business, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the market opportunities we identify.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, our gross premiums written decreased by $2.2 million, or 0.4%, compared to\nthe same period in 2021.

During the 2022\nyear, we added new Innovations partners to our portfolio, and one of our\nexisting partners grew its personal lines premium volume.\nOur decision to reduce or terminate our participation in certain motor business\npartially offset this increase.\nCasualty $(54.0) (14.2)% The decrease in casualty premiums written during the year ended December 31,\n2022, over the comparable 2021 period was due primarily to motor and\nworkers’ compensation lines which decreased by $109.7 million and $33.8\nmillion, respectively.

To a lesser extent,\nfavorable loss development relating to prior years’ catastrophe events also\ncontributed to the decrease in property losses incurred during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nThe $18.4 million decrease in motor losses was partially offset by the following:\n• our growing personal lines portfolio; and\n• losses relating to Russian-Ukrainian conflict and natural catastrophes that\noccurred during 2022, including Hurricane Ian, Typhoons Nanmadol and\nHinnamnor, and Tennessee wildfires.\nThe property loss ratio decreased 4.0 percentage points during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, over the equivalent 2021 period.

We increased our general liability and multi-line business, which\ngenerally incorporates lower loss ratios than the motor and workers’ compensation\nbusiness it replaced. Adverse loss development on certain motor, workers’\ncompensation, and multi-line contracts partially offset the loss ratio decreases.\nOther $(2.2) 0.3% The decrease in “other” losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2022,\ncompared to the same period in 2021, was due primarily to certain health contracts\non which we elected to reduce or not renew our participation. To a lesser extent, the\ndecrease related to the following:\n• loss reserves released on certain mortgage contracts; and\n• crop losses incurred in the equivalent 2021 period.\nThe decrease was partially offset by the following:\n• losses relating to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict; and.\n• growth in transactional liability and marine and energy business.\nThe “other” loss ratio increased 0.3 percentage points during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, over the equivalent 2021 period, due primarily due to the\ndecrease in “other” net earned premiums.\n64\nLink to Table of Contents\nRussian-Ukrainian Conflict\nOur loss and loss adjustment expenses from the Russian-Ukrainian conflict relate primarily to marine, energy, political\nviolence, and terrorism (“MEPVT”) policies and whole account contracts, which are included in our Other - Specialty book of\nbusiness.

As of\nDecember 31, 2022, we have not recorded any reinsurance recoveries, as the estimated losses had not impacted the excess\nlayers.

The increase was due primarily to (i) a $1.5 million increase in share-based\ncompensation and (ii) $1.1 million of separation and severance costs incurred in 2022. Lower personnel bonus expense partially\noffset the increase.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, general and administrative expenses included $4.7 million and $3.2\nmillion, respectively, of costs related to share-based compensation granted to employees and directors.\nTotal Investment Income (Loss)\nTotal investment income (loss) incorporates (i) changes in the net asset value of our investment in SILP managed by\nDME Advisors, (ii) interest income earned on the restricted cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral to our clients, and\n(iii) gains (or losses) and interest on our portfolio of strategic and Innovations investments, and investments accounted for\nunder the equity method.

On a gross basis, the long and the short portfolio earned\n0.0%, and 26.1%, respectively, while macro and other positions gained 2.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2022. For\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, the most significant contributors to SILP’s investment return were long positions in Twitter\nand Consol Energy, and a short position in a basket of stocks perceived to be overvalued. The most significant detractors for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, were long positions in Green Brick Partners, Danimer Scientific, and GoPro.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, some of our Innovations-related investees completed new financing\nrounds. The associated carry-value increases contributed to a net unrealized gain of $9.9 million (2021: $19.6 million). The\nunrealized gains are net of a $1.7 million valuation allowance recorded on certain Innovations-related investments during the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 (2021: $0.5 million).\nThe increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily related to our restricted cash and\ncash equivalents, which benefited from rising U.S. interest rates. The interest, dividend, and other expenses primarily relate to\ninterest payable on funds withheld.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we realized gains of $14.2 million related to the sale of a strategic investment.\n67\nLink to Table of Contents\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the gross investment return (loss) on our investments managed by\nDME Advisors (excluding the investment advisor performance allocation) was composed of the following:\n2022 2021\nLong portfolio gains (losses) — % 24.3 %\nShort portfolio gains (losses) 26.1 (7.9)\nMacro gains (losses) 3.8 (6.0)\nOther income and expenses 1 (1.8) (2.1)\nGross investment return 28.1 % 8.3 %\nNet investment return 1 25.3 % 7.5 %\n1 “Other income and expenses” excludes performance compensation but includes management fees. “Net investment return”\nincorporates both of these amounts.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Investment Portfolio was calculated based on 50% of GLRE\nSurplus, or the Company's shareholders' equity, as reported in the Company’s then most recent quarterly U.S. GAAP financial\nstatements adjusted monthly for our share of the net profits and net losses reported by SILP during any intervening period (the\n“adjusted GLRE Surplus”). Effective January 1, 2023, the Investment Portfolio is calculated based on 60% of adjusted GLRE\nSurplus.\nEach month, we post on our website (www.greenlightre.com) the returns from our investment in SILP.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are not obligated to pay taxes in the Cayman Islands on either income or capital gains. The Governor-In-Cabinet\nhas granted us an exemption from any income taxes that may be imposed in the Cayman Islands for the 20 years expiring\nFebruary 1, 2025.\nGRIL is incorporated in Ireland and is subject to the Irish corporation tax. We expect GRIL to be taxed at 12.5% on its\ntaxable trading income and 25% on its non-trading income, if any. Greenlight Re UK and GCM are incorporated in the United\nKingdom and therefore are subject to the U.K. corporate tax rate of 19% on their profits.\nVerdant is incorporated in Delaware and is subject to taxes under the U.S. federal rates and regulations prescribed by\nthe Internal Revenue Service. We expect Verdant’s future taxable income to be taxed at 21%. For the year ended December 31,\n2021, the income tax expense of $0.8 million was due primarily to the gain on the sale of our investment in AccuRisk.\nAt December 31, 2022, we have included a gross deferred tax asset of $2.8 million (December 31, 2021: $3.2 million)\nin the caption “Other assets” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2022, a valuation allowance of\n$2.3 million (2021: $2.7 million) partially offset this gross deferred tax asset. We have concluded that it is more likely than not\nthat the Company will fully realize the recorded deferred tax asset (net of the valuation allowance) in the future. We have based\nthis conclusion on the expected timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and the likelihood of generating sufficient\ntaxable income to realize the future tax benefit. We have not taken any other tax positions that we believe are subject to\nuncertainty or reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal investments\nThe total investments reported in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022, was $248.5 million, compared\nto $231.0 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $17.5 million, or 7.6%. The increase was primarily related to gains on\nSILP and Innovations-related investments and the purchase of certificates of deposit. The increase was partially offset by net\nredemptions from SILP.\nAt December 31, 2022, 91.6% of SILP’s portfolio was valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets (Level\n1), 6.3% was composed of instruments valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2), and a nominal\namount was composed of instruments valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). At December 31, 2022, 2.1% of SILP’s\nportfolio consisted of private equity funds valued using the funds’ net asset values as a practical expedient.\n68\nLink to Table of Contents\nAt December 31, 2022, 86% of our Innovations-related portfolio was carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,\nmeasured as of the investees’ most recently completed financing round, and 14% was carried at the original cost.\nOther than our investment in SILP (see Notes 3 and 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements), we\nhave not participated in transactions that created relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including\nVIEs, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCash and cash equivalents; Restricted cash and cash equivalents\nUnrestricted cash and cash equivalents decreased by $38.1 million, or 49.9%, from $76.3 million at December 31, 2021, to\n$38.2 million at December 31, 2022, primarily due to cash used for operations, repurchase of senior convertible debt, purchase\nof Innovations-related investments and collateral posted to our ceding insurers.\nWe use our restricted cash and cash equivalents for funding trusts and letters of credit issued to our ceding insurers. Our\nrestricted cash increased by $33.5 million, or 5.3%, from $634.8 million at December 31, 2021, to $668.3 million, at\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to collateral required by our ceding insurers.\nReinsurance balances receivable\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, reinsurance balances receivable increased by $100.2 million, or 24.7%, to\n$505.6 million from $405.4 million at December 31, 2021. This increase was related primarily to funds withheld by cedents. At\nDecember 31, 2022, funds held by cedents were $337.4 million, compared to $246.9 million at December 31, 2021. Funds\nwithheld predominantly relate to premiums withheld by Lloyd’s syndicates and funds contributed by the Company to Lloyd's as\nsecurity for members’ underwriting activities. The remaining increase related to premiums receivable on new contracts bound\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves; Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Recoverable\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses were composed of the following:\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nCase Case\nReserves IBNR Total Reserves IBNR Total\n($ in thousands)\nProperty $ 20,354 $ 41,361 $ 61,715 $ 21,357 $ 49,486 $ 70,843\nCasualty 146,702 227,979 374,681 151,734 219,949 371,683\nOther 17,700 101,372 119,072 17,129 64,355 81,484\nTotal $ 184,756 $ 370,712 $ 555,468 $ 190,220 $ 333,790 $ 524,010\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the total gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves increased by\n$31.5 million, or 6.0%, to $555.5 million from $524.0 million at December 31, 2021. See Note 7 of the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements for a summary of changes in outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and a\ndescription of prior period loss developments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, total loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable increased by $2.1\nmillion, or 19.3%, to $13.2 million from $11.1 million at December 31, 2021. See Note 8 of the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements for a description of the credit risk associated with our retrocessionaires.\nFor most of the contracts we write, defined limits of liability limit our risk exposure. Once each contract’s limit of\nliability has been reached, we have no further exposure to additional losses from that contract. However, certain contracts,\nparticularly quota share contracts covering first-dollar exposure, do not contain aggregate limits.\nOur property and Lloyd’s business, and to a lesser extent our casualty and other business, incorporate contracts that\ncontain natural peril loss exposure. We currently monitor our catastrophe loss exposure in terms of our PML.\nWe anticipate that our PMLs will vary from period to period depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the\ncomposition of our in-force book of business.\n69\nLink to Table of Contents\nWe monitor our natural peril PMLs on a worldwide basis, with a particular focus on our peak peril regions. When\nthese perils consist of a large geographic area, we split them into sub-regions, where the underlying geographic components can\nalso be considered individual peril zones.\nFor our natural catastrophe PMLs, we utilize the output of catastrophe models at the 1-in-250-year return period. The\n1-in-250-year return period PML means that we believe there is a 0.4% probability that, in any given year, an occurrence of a\nnatural catastrophe will lead to losses exceeding the stated estimate.\nIt is important to note that PMLs are best estimates based on the modeled data available for each underlying risk. As a\nresult, we cannot provide assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events\nsimilar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML.\nOur PML estimates incorporate all significant exposure from our reinsurance operations, including coverage for\nproperty, marine and energy, motor, and catastrophe workers’ compensation exposures.\nAt January 1, 2023, our estimated largest PML (net of retrocession and reinstatement premiums) at a 1-in-250-year\nreturn period for a single event and in aggregate was $77.5 million and $83.5 million, respectively, both relating to the peril of\nNorth Atlantic Hurricane.\nThe below table contains the expected modeled loss for each of our peak peril regions and sub-regions for both a\nsingle event loss and aggregate loss measures at the 1-in-250-year return period.\nJanuary 1, 2023\nNet 1-in-250 Year Return Period\nPeril Single Event Loss Aggregate Loss\n($ in thousands)\nNorth Atlantic Hurricane $ 77,503 $ 83,521\nSoutheast Hurricane 64,207 65,714\nGulf of Mexico Hurricane 51,106 55,608\nNortheast Hurricane 50,603 50,603\nNorth America Earthquake 66,958 69,979\nCalifornia Earthquake 61,100 64,216\nOther N.A.

The increase in shareholders’ equity during the year ended December\n31, 2022, was primarily due to the net income of $25.3 million reported for the year, partially offset by the adoption of ASU\n2020-06 (see Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). For details of other movements in shareholders’\nequity, please see the “Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity” in the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nGreenlight Capital Re is a holding company with no operations of its own. As a holding company, Greenlight Capital\nRe has minimal continuing cash needs, most of which are related to the payment of corporate and general administrative\nexpenses and interest expenses. We conduct all our underwriting operations through our wholly-owned reinsurance\nsubsidiaries, Greenlight Re and GRIL, which underwrite property and casualty reinsurance. There are restrictions on Greenlight\nRe’s and GRIL’s ability to pay dividends described in more detail below. Our current policy is to retain earnings to support the\ngrowth of our business. We currently do not expect to pay dividends on our ordinary shares.\n70\nLink to Table of Contents\nAt December 31, 2022, Greenlight Re and GRIL were each rated “A- (Excellent)” with a stable outlook by A.M. Best.\nThe ratings reflect A.M. Best’s opinion of our reinsurance subsidiaries’ financial strength, operating performance, and ability to\nmeet obligations. They are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold\nour Class A ordinary shares. If A.M. Best downgrades our ratings below “A- (Excellent)” or withdraws our rating, we could be\nseverely limited or prevented from writing any new reinsurance contracts, which would significantly and negatively affect our\nbusiness. Our A.M. Best ratings may be revised or revoked at the sole discretion of the rating agency.\nSome of our assumed reinsurance contracts contain provisions that permit our clients to cancel the contract or require\nadditional collateral in the event of a downgrade in our A.M. Best ratings below A- (Excellent) or a reduction of our capital or\nsurplus below specified levels over the course of the agreement. In the periods presented, there were no such cancellations or\nother adjustments relating to novations, commutations, or similar actions that had a material impact on our premiums written,\nnet income, or liquidity position, either individually or in the aggregate.\nContracts containing such cancellation rights represented approximately 8% of gross premiums written during 2022.\nWe believe if all additional collateral requirements had been triggered at December 31, 2022, additional required collateral\nwould equal approximately $92 million.\nSources and Uses of Funds\nOur sources of funds consist primarily of premium receipts (net of brokerage and ceding commissions), investment\nincome, and other income. We use cash from our operations to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses, profit commissions,\ninterest, and general and administrative expenses. At December 31, 2022, all of our investable assets, excluding strategic and\nInnovations investments and funds required for business operations and capital risk management, are invested by DME\nAdvisors in SILP, subject to our investment guidelines. We can redeem funds from SILP at any time for operational purposes\nby providing three days’ notice to the general partner. At December 31, 2022, the majority of SILP’s long investments were\ncomposed of cash and cash equivalents and publicly traded equity securities, which can be readily liquidated to meet our\nredemption requests. We record all investment income (loss), including any changes in the net asset value of SILP, and any\nunrealized gains and losses, in our consolidated statements of operations for each reporting period.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the net cash used in operating activities was $31.8 million and\n$56.3 million, respectively. The net cash used in operating activities was used primarily for our underwriting activities and for\npayment of corporate and general administrative expenses. Generally, if the premiums collected exceed claim payments within\na given period, we generate cash from our underwriting activities. Our underwriting activities represented a net use of cash for\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, as the losses we paid exceeded the premiums we collected. On our Lloyd’s\nsyndicate contracts, we do not receive any premiums until the year of account is settled, net of losses, at the end of three years.\nOur Lloyd’s syndicate business has been growing in recent years. The increase in funds contributed to Lloyd's as security for\nmembers' underwriting activities has contributed to the net use of cash for underwriting activities. The cash used in and\ngenerated from underwriting activities may vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of business, the\nnature of underwriting opportunities available, and the volume of claims submitted to us by our cedents.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, our investing activities provided net cash of $47.0 million. We redeemed\n$60.2 million of cash from SILP (net of contributions) and used $13.2 million for new Innovations and other investments. By\ncomparison, for the same period in 2021, our investing activities provided net cash of $23.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we used $19.8 million to repurchase our convertible senior notes. During the\nsame period in 2021, we used $10.0 million to repurchase our Class A ordinary shares.\nAt December 31, 2022, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable financial requirements. We do\nnot expect the recent global events, including Hurricane Ian, the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and the COVID-19 pandemic, to\nmaterially impact our operational liquidity needs. These needs will be met by cash, funds generated from underwriting\nactivities, and investment income, including withdrawals from SILP if necessary. At December 31, 2022, we expect to fund our\noperations for the foreseeable future from operating and investing cash flows.\nWe are evaluating various alternatives in relation to the convertible senior notes that mature in August 2023. In\naddition, we may explore various financing options, including debt refinancing and other capital raising alternatives, to fund our\nbusiness strategy, improve our capital structure, increase surplus, pay claims, or make acquisitions. We can provide no\nassurances regarding the terms of such transactions or that any such transactions will occur. If we are unable to refinance the\nconvertible senior notes, we will be required to fund settlement at maturity using cash on hand, or withdrawals from SILP,\nwhich may negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy.\n71\nLink to Table of Contents\nAlthough GLRE is not subject to any significant legal prohibitions on the payment of dividends, Greenlight Re and\nGRIL are each subject to regulatory minimum capital requirements and regulatory constraints that affect their ability to pay\ndividends to us. In addition, any dividend payment would have to be approved by the relevant regulatory authorities prior to\npayment. At December 31, 2022, Greenlight Re and GRIL exceeded their regulatory minimum capital requirements.\nLetters of Credit and Trust Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2022, neither Greenlight Re nor GRIL was licensed or admitted as a reinsurer in any jurisdiction\nother than the Cayman Islands and the European Economic Area, respectively. Many jurisdictions do not permit domestic\ninsurance companies to take credit on their statutory financial statements for loss recoveries or ceded unearned premiums unless\nappropriate measures are in place for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers. As a result, we anticipate\nthat all of our U.S. clients and some non-U.S. clients will require us to provide collateral through funds withheld, trust\narrangements, letters of credit, or a combination thereof.\nAt December 31, 2022, we had one (2021: one) letter of credit facility available with an aggregate capacity of $275.0\nmillion (2021: $275.0 million). See Note 15 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for details on the letter of\ncredit facility. We provide collateral to cedents in the form of letters of credit and trust arrangements. At December 31, 2022,\nthe aggregate amount of collateral provided to cedents under such arrangements was $667.6 million (2021: $633.9 million). At\nDecember 31, 2022, the letters of credit and trust accounts were secured by restricted cash and cash equivalents with a total fair\nvalue of $668.3 million (2021: $634.8 million).\nThe letter of credit facility contains customary events of default and restrictive covenants, including but not limited to\nlimitations on liens on collateral, transactions with affiliates, mergers, and sales of assets, as well as solvency and maintenance\nof certain minimum pledged equity requirements and restricts issuance of any debt without the consent of the letter of credit\nprovider. Additionally, if an event of default exists, as defined in the letter of credit facility, Greenlight Re would be prohibited\nfrom paying dividends to its parent company. The Company was in compliance with all the covenants of this facility at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nCapital\nOur capital structure currently consists of senior convertible notes and equity issued in two classes of ordinary shares.\nWe expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business strategy for\nthe foreseeable future. Consequently, we do not presently anticipate that we will incur any additional material indebtedness in\nthe ordinary course of our business. However, to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should\nwe require additional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, we\nhave filed a Form S-3 registration statement, which expires in July 2024. In addition, as noted above, we may explore various\nfinancing alternatives, although there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms when\nneeded or desired. We did not make any significant commitments for capital expenditures during the year ended December 31,\n2022.\nThe Board of Directors had previously approved a share repurchase plan authorizing the Company to repurchase up to\n$25.0 million of Class A ordinary shares or securities convertible into Class A ordinary shares in the open market through\nprivately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans.\nOn April 26, 2022, the Board of Directors renewed and extended the share repurchase plan until June 30, 2023. The\nCompany is not required to repurchase any Class A ordinary shares, and the repurchase plan may be modified, suspended, or\nterminated at the election of our Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December 31, 2022,\nthe Company repurchased 4,933 Class A ordinary shares at an average share price of $7.04.\nThe Company may, from time to time, repurchase some of its 4.00% convertible senior notes due 2023 (the “Notes”) in\nprivately negotiated transactions, in open market repurchases, or pursuant to one or more tender offers. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company repurchased and retired Notes with a face value of $20.4 million. Subsequent to\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company repurchased and retired an additional $13.8 million of Notes.\nUnder the Company’s stock incentive plan, the number of Class A ordinary shares authorized for issuance is 8.0\nmillion shares. At December 31, 2022, 2,011,426 Class A ordinary shares were available for future issuance under the\nCompany’s stock incentive plan. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the stock incentive plan.\n72\nLink to Table of Contents\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nDue to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our\nreinsurance contractual liabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain. At December 31, 2022,\nwe estimate that we will pay the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as follows:\nLess than More than\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total\n($ in thousands)\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves (1) 275,512 164,974 62,768 52,214 555,468\n(1) Due to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance\ncontractual liabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain.\nGreenlight Re entered into a lease agreement for office space in the Cayman Islands commencing July 1, 2021 and\nexpiring June 30, 2026, unless Greenlight Re exercises its right to renew it for another five years. GRIL entered into a lease\nagreement for office space in Dublin, Ireland commencing October 1, 2021, and expiring September 30, 2031, unless GRIL\nexercises the break clause by providing a notice of termination at least nine months prior to September 30, 2026. The aggregate\nannual lease obligation ranges from $0.5 million to $0.6 million.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company has $79.6 million of senior convertible notes payable, which mature on August\n1, 2023. The Company is obligated to make semiannual interest payments of $2.0 million at an interest rate of 4.0% per annum.\nThe Company has received regulatory approval to declare dividends from Greenlight Re to meet the interest payments\nobligation.\nPursuant to the IAA between SILP and DME Advisors, DME Advisors is entitled to a monthly management fee equal\nto 0.125% (1.5% on an annual basis) of each limited partner’s Investment Portfolio, as provided in the SILP LPA. The IAA has\nan initial term ending on August 31, 2023, subject to automatic extension for successive three-year terms. Pursuant to the SILP\nLPA, DME II is entitled to a performance allocation equal to 20% of the net profit, calculated per annum, of each limited\npartner’s share of the capital account managed by DME Advisors, subject to a loss carry-forward provision. DME II is not\nentitled to earn a performance allocation in a year in which SILP incurs a loss. The loss carry-forward provision contained in\nthe SILP LPA allows DME II to earn a reduced performance allocation of 10% of net profits in years subsequent to the year in\nwhich the capital accounts of the limited partners incur a loss until all losses are recouped, and an additional amount equal to\n150% of the loss is earned. At December 31, 2022, we estimate the reduced performance allocation of 10% to continue to be\napplied until SILP achieves additional investment returns of 148.5%, at which point the performance allocation will revert to\n20%. For detailed breakdowns of management fees and performance compensation for the year ended December 31, 2022, and\n2021, please refer to Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has entered into a service agreement with DME Advisors pursuant to which DME Advisors will provide\ninvestor relations services to us for compensation of $5,000 per month plus expenses. The service agreement had an initial term\nof one year and continues for sequential one-year periods until terminated by us or DME Advisors. Either party may terminate\nthe service agreement for any reason with 30 days prior written notice to the other party.\nOur related party transactions are presented in Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation generally affects the cost of claims and claim expenses. Long-tailed lines of business generally have greater\nexposure to inflation than short-tailed lines, with this differential becoming more pronounced as the severity of inflation\nincreases. Our underwriting portfolio is predominantly short-tailed, and we actively manage our exposures to classes that\nexperience significant inflation. Our pricing and reserving models incorporate the anticipated effects of inflation on our claim\ncosts, and we regularly review and update our assumptions. However, we cannot predict or estimate the onset, duration, and\nseverity of an inflationary period with precision. The actual effect of inflation may differ significantly from our assumptions.\nInflation can also affect the asset values in SILP’s investment portfolio. DME Advisors regularly monitors and re-\npositions SILP’s investment portfolio to deal with the impact of inflation on its underlying investments, and holds macro\npositions to benefit from a rising inflationary environment.\n73\nLink to Table of Contents\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe believe we are principally exposed to the following types of market risk:\n•\nequity price risk;\n•\ncommodity price risk;\n•\nforeign currency risk;\n•\ninterest rate risk;\n•\ncredit risk; and\n•\npolitical risk.\nEquity Price Risk\nAt December 31, 2022, our investments consisted primarily of an investment in SILP. Among SILP’s holdings are\nequity securities, the carrying values of which are based primarily on quoted market prices. Generally, market prices of\ncommon equity securities are subject to fluctuation, which could cause the amount to be realized upon closing a position to\ndiffer significantly from its current reported value. This risk is partly mitigated by the presence of both long and short equity\nsecurities as part of our investment strategy. At December 31, 2022, a 10% decline in the price of each of the underlying listed\nequity securities and equity-based derivative instruments would result in an $8.1 million loss to our Investment Portfolio.\nComputations of the prospective effects of hypothetical equity price changes are based on numerous assumptions,\nincluding the maintenance of the current composition of SILP’s portfolio. The computations should not be relied on as\nindicative of future results.\nCommodity Price Risk\nGenerally, market prices of commodities are subject to fluctuation. SILP’s investments periodically include long or\nshort investments in commodities or derivatives directly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of commodities. At\nDecember 31, 2022, SILP’s investments incorporate unhedged exposure to changes in gold, silver, uranium, and crude oil\nprices.\nThe following table summarizes the net impact that a 10% increase and decrease in commodity prices would have on\nthe value of our Investment Portfolio at December 31, 2022. The below table excludes the indirect effect that changes in\ncommodity prices might have on equity securities in our Investment Portfolio.\n10% increase in commodity 10% decrease in commodity\nprices prices\nChange in Change in\nCommodity fair value fair value\n($ in millions)\nGold $ 3.6 $ (3.6)\nSilver 0.3 (0.3)\nUranium 0.3 (0.3)\nCrude oil 0.2 (0.2)\nTotal $ 4.4 $ (4.4)\nForeign Currency Risk\nCertain of our reinsurance contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, whereby premiums are receivable and\nlosses are payable in foreign currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that our foreign currency\nreinsurance balances are more than (or less than) the corresponding foreign currency cash balances, and there is an increase (or\ndecrease) in the exchange rate of that foreign currency.\nWhile we do not seek to precisely match our liabilities under reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies\nwith investments denominated in such currencies, we continually monitor our exposure to potential foreign currency losses and\nmay use foreign currency cash and cash equivalents or forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate against adverse\nforeign currency movements.\n74\nLink to Table of Contents\nCertain cedents, particularly the Lloyd’s syndicates, report to us in foreign currencies even though some or all of the\nunderlying exposure is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our consolidated statements of operations may report a foreign exchange\ngain or loss associated with this exposure when reported by the cedents. Additionally, we may report foreign exchange gains or\nlosses due to the mismatch between the currency exchange rates applied to foreign-denominated (i) monetary balances and (ii)\nnon-monetary balances under U.S. GAAP. See Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further\ninformation regarding our accounting treatment of foreign currency transactions.\nWe monitor our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities on an “underlying exposure” basis without\ndistinguishing between monetary and non-monetary balances.\nAt December 31, 2022, our underlying exposure to GBP-denominated net reinsurance asset balance was £5.2 million.\nAt December 31, 2022, a 10% decrease in the U.S. dollar against the GBP (all else constant) would result in an estimated $0.6\nmillion foreign exchange gain. Alternatively, a 10% increase in the U.S. dollar against the GBP would result in an estimated\n$0.6 million foreign exchange loss. Similarly, at December 31, 2022, our net underlying exposure to Euro-denominated\nreinsurance liability balances was €10.5 million. At December 31, 2022, a 10% decrease in the U.S. dollar against the Euro (all\nelse constant) would result in an estimated $1.1 million foreign exchange loss. Alternatively, a 10% increase in the U.S. dollar\nagainst the Euro would result in an estimated $1.1 million foreign exchange gain.\nWe may also be exposed to foreign currency risk through SILP’s underlying cash, forwards, options, and investments\nin securities denominated in foreign currencies. At December 31, 2022, most of SILP’s currency exposures resulting\nfrom foreign-denominated securities (longs and shorts) were reduced by offsetting cash balances denominated in the\ncorresponding foreign currencies.\nAt December 31, 2022, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would\nhave no meaningful impact on the value of our Investment Portfolio.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe primary market risk exposure for any debt instrument is interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, the fair value of a\nlong fixed-income portfolio generally falls. Similarly, falling interest rates generally lead to increases in the fair value of fixed-\nincome securities. Additionally, some derivative investments may be sensitive to interest rates, and their value may indirectly\nfluctuate with changes in interest rates.\nThe caption “Reinsurance balances receivable” in our consolidated balance sheets incorporates amounts held by\ncedents, including the Lloyd’s syndicates in which we participate. These syndicates invest a portion of the premiums withheld\nin fixed-income and variable-yield securities, which expose us to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2022, a 100 basis points\nincrease or decrease in interest rates would result in an estimated $2.2 million loss or gain, respectively, which would be\nrecorded in our consolidated statements of operations under the captions “Other income (expense).”\nOur restricted cash and cash equivalents earn interest at rates that generally follow the movements of the short-term\nU.S. Treasury rates. At December 31, 2022, a 100 basis points increase or decrease in U.S. Federal Funds Rate would result in\napproximately a $5.7 million increase or decrease, respectively, in our interest income on an annualized basis.\nOur investment in SILP includes interest-rate sensitive securities, such as corporate and sovereign debt instruments\nand interest-rate options. At December 31, 2022, a 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a $4.4\nmillion gain or a $4.9 million loss, respectively, to our Investment Portfolio.\nWe, along with DME Advisors, monitor the net exposure to interest rate risk and generally do not expect changes in\ninterest rates to have a materially adverse impact on our operations.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk relates to the uncertainty of a counterparty’s ability to make timely payments in accordance with the terms\nof the instrument or contract. Our maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of our financial assets. We evaluate the\nfinancial condition of our business partners and clients relating to balances receivable under our reinsurance contracts, including\npremiums receivable, losses recoverable, and commission adjustments recoverable. We obtain collateral in the form of funds\nwithheld, trusts, and letters of credit from our counterparties to mitigate this credit risk. We monitor our net exposure to each\ncounterparty relative to the financial strength of our counterparties and assess the collectibility of these balances on a regular\nbasis. See Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details on allowance for credit loss on\nreinsurance assets.\n75\nLink to Table of Contents\nIn addition, the securities, commodities, and cash in SILP’s investment portfolio are held with several prime brokers\nand derivative counterparties, subjecting SILP, and indirectly us, to a significant concentration of credit risk. While we have no\ndirect control over SILP, DME Advisors regularly monitors the concentration of credit risk with each counterparty and, if\nappropriate, transfers cash or securities between counterparties or requests collateral to diversify and mitigate this credit risk.\nPolitical Risk\nThrough our assumed reinsurance contracts, we currently provide a limited amount of political risk insurance\ncoverage. We do not expect this exposure to have a materially adverse impact on our underwriting results.\nWe are exposed to political risk to the extent that we underwrite business from entities located in foreign markets and\nto the extent that DME Advisors, on behalf of SILP and subject to our investment guidelines, trades securities listed on various\nU.S. and foreign exchanges and markets. The governments in any of these jurisdictions could impose restrictions, regulations,\nor other measures, which may have a material adverse impact on our underwriting operations and investment strategy. See\n“Item 1A. Risk Factors - We could face unanticipated losses from political instability, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our financial condition and results of operations.”\nITEM 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE\nNot applicable.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in such rules) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports prepared in accordance with the rules and\nregulations of the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules\nand forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These\ninherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur\nbecause of simple error or mistake.\nAdditionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,\nor by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its\nstated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,\nor the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-\neffective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n76\nLink to Table of Contents\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal controls\nover financial reporting, and may, from time to time, make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that\nthe Company’s systems evolve with its business.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our\ninternal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and\nprocedures that:\n● pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the Company;\n● provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only\nin accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n● provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition\nof the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable\nassurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to\ncorrect deficiencies as they are identified.\nOur management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework in the Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (the 2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our system of\ninternal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting has been audited by Deloitte Ltd., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report,\nwhich is included herein.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. and subsidiaries (the “Company”)\nas of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our\nreport dated March 8, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s\nAnnual Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\n77\nLink to Table of Contents\nmaterial respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\nthat a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte Ltd.\n________________________\nHamilton, Bermuda\nMarch 8, 2023\nITEM 9B.

(the \"Company\") as of December\n31, 2022, the related consolidated statement of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the\n\"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31,\n2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission and our report dated March 8, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nWe did not audit the financial statements of Solasglas Investments, LP, an equity method investment of the Company, as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company’s investment in Solasglas Investments, LP as of\nDecember 31, 2022 was $178.2 million, and its equity in net income of Solasglas Investments, LP was $54.8 million for the\nyear ended December 31, 2022. The financial statements of Solasglas Investments, LP were audited by other auditors whose\nreport has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Solasglas Investments, LP, is\nbased solely on the report of the other auditors.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and\nwe are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is derived using expected trends in claim severity and\nfrequency and other factors that may vary significantly as claims are settled. The estimate is sensitive to significant\nassumptions, including the initial expected loss ratio and loss development factors. The estimate is also sensitive to the selection\nof actuarial methods and weighting of these methods applied to project the ultimate losses, the estimation of ultimate reserves\nassociated with catastrophic events, and other factors. Further, not all catastrophic events can be modeled using traditional\nactuarial methodologies, which increases the degree of judgment needed in estimating loss reserves for such events.\nAuditing the Company’s methods, assumptions and best estimate of the cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of\nclaims represented by the incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") claims included in recorded Loss and loss adjustment expense\nF-1\nLink to Table of Contents\nreserves involved especially subjective auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our\nactuarial specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to loss and loss adjustment expense reserves included the following, among others\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of the recorded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves,\nincluding the review and approval process that management has in place for significant actuarial methods and\nassumptions used and the approval of management’s best estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.\n• We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company’s actuarial\nanalysis, including historical claims data, to test the reasonableness of key inputs to the actuarial estimate.\n• With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:\n– We independently developed an estimate of the reserves for selected contracts, compared our estimates to\nthose booked by the Company, and evaluated the differences.\n– We evaluated the Company’s methodologies against recognized actuarial practices for the remaining\ncontracts. We also evaluated the assumptions used by the Company using our industry knowledge and\nexperience and other analytical procedures.\n– We compared the results of the quarterly reserve studies prepared by independent external actuaries to\nmanagement’s best estimate and evaluated the differences.\n/s/ Deloitte Ltd.\n_____________________________\nHamilton, Bermuda\nMarch 8, 2023\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2022.\nF-2\nLink to Table of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd.\nGrand Cayman, Cayman Islands\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd.

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE”) was incorporated as an exempted company under the Companies Law of the\nCayman Islands on July 13, 2004. GLRE’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Greenlight Re”), provides\nglobal specialty property and casualty reinsurance. Greenlight Re has a Class D insurer license issued in accordance with the\nterms of The Insurance Act, 2010 (as amended) and underlying regulations thereto (the “Act”) and is subject to regulation by\nthe Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. Greenlight Re commenced underwriting in April 2006. Verdant Holding Company,\nLtd. (“Verdant”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GLRE, was incorporated in 2008 in the state of Delaware. During 2010, GLRE\nestablished Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company (“GRIL”), a wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiary\nbased in Dublin, Ireland. GRIL is authorized as a non-life reinsurance undertaking in accordance with the provisions of the\nEuropean Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015. GRIL provides multi-line property and casualty reinsurance\ncapacity to the European broker market and provides GLRE with an additional platform to serve clients located in Europe and\nNorth America. In 2020, GLRE established Greenlight Re Marketing (UK) Limited (“Greenlight Re UK”) as a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary to increase the Company’s presence in the London market. In 2022, Greenlight Innovation Syndicate 3456\n(“Syndicate 3456”) commenced underwriting under the Lloyd’s syndicate-in-a-box model, with Greenlight Re as the sole\ncapital provider. As used herein, the “Company” refers collectively to GLRE and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe Class A ordinary shares of GLRE are listed on Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE.”\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of GLRE and the\nconsolidated financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Greenlight Re, GRIL, Verdant, and Greenlight Re UK, as\nwell as Syndicate 3456. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.\nSignificant estimates used to prepare the Company’s consolidated financial statements, including those associated with\npremiums and the estimations of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, may be subject to significant adjustments in future\nperiods.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nperiod. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The significant estimates reflected in the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements include, but are not limited to, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, premiums written, earned and\nreceivable, variability underlying risk transfer assessments, allowances for credit losses, share-based compensation, valuation\nallowances associated with deferred tax assets and investment impairments.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Restricted Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments and certificates of deposit with\noriginal maturity dates of three months or less. Certificates of deposit with original maturities greater than three months are\nincluded under the caption \"Other investments\" on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances to collateralize regulatory trusts and letters of credit issued to\ncedents (see Notes 6 and 15).\nF-9\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe following table reconciles the cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the consolidated balance\nsheets to the total presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows:\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\n($ in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 38,238 $ 76,307\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents 668,310 634,794\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash presented in the\nconsolidated statements of cash flows $ 706,548 $ 711,101\nPremium Revenue Recognition\nThe Company writes excess of loss contracts and quota share contracts and estimates the ultimate premiums for the\ncontract period. The Company bases these estimates on actuarial pricing models and information received from ceding\ncompanies. For excess of loss contracts, the Company writes the total ultimate estimated premiums at the contract’s inception.\nFor quota share contracts, the Company writes premiums in the same periods in which the underlying insurance contracts are\nwritten, based on cession statements from cedents. The Company typically receives these statements monthly or quarterly,\ndepending on the terms specified in each contract. For any reporting lag, the Company estimates premiums written based\non the portion of the estimated ultimate premiums relating to the risks bound during the lag period.\nThe Company’s management reviews premium estimates at least quarterly. Such review includes a comparison of\nreported premiums to expected ultimate premiums, along with a review of the aging and collection of premiums. Management\nevaluates the appropriateness of the premium estimates on the basis of these reviews and records any adjustments to these\nestimates in the period in which they are determined. Changes in premium estimates, including premium receivable on both\nexcess of loss and quota share contracts, are not unusual and may result in significant adjustments in any period. A portion of\namounts included in the caption “Reinsurance balances receivable” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets represent\nestimated premiums written, net of commissions and brokerage, that are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying\ncontracts. Additional premiums due on a contract with no remaining coverage period are earned in full when written.\nCertain contracts allow for reinstatement premiums in the event of a loss. Reinstatement premiums are written and\nearned when a triggering loss event occurs.\nPremiums written are generally recognized as earned over the contract period in proportion to the risk covered. Unearned\npremiums represent the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided.\nFunds Held by Cedents\nThe caption “Reinsurance balances receivable” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets includes financial assets\nheld by cedents. At December 31, 2022, funds held by cedents were $337.4 million (December 31, 2021: $246.9 million). Such\namounts include premiums withheld by Lloyd’s syndicates and funds contributed by the Company to Lloyd's as security for\nmembers’ underwriting activities. The Lloyd’s syndicates invest a portion of the premiums withheld in investment funds and\nfixed-maturity securities. The Company records its share of income (or expense) from these assets, when reported by the\nsyndicates, in its consolidated statements of operations under the caption “Other income (expense).”\nReinsurance Premiums Ceded\nThe Company reduces the risk of future losses on business assumed by reinsuring certain risks and exposures with other\nreinsurers (referred to as “retrocessionaires”). The Company remains liable to the extent that any retrocessionaire fails to meet\nits obligations and to the extent the Company does not hold sufficient security for its unpaid obligations.\nCeded premiums are written during the period in which the risks incept and the associated expense is recognized over the\ncontract period in proportion to the protection provided. Unearned premiums ceded represent the unexpired portion of\nreinsurance obtained.\nAcquisition Costs\nPolicy acquisition costs vary with, and are directly related to, the successful production of new and renewal business and\nconsist principally of commissions, taxes, and brokerage expenses. The Company presents acquisition costs incurred on\nreinsurance assumed net of commissions earned on reinsurance ceded. However, if the sum of a contract’s expected losses and\nloss expenses and deferred acquisition costs exceeds associated unearned premiums and expected investment income, a\nF-10\nLink to Table of Contents\npremium deficiency is determined to exist. In this event, the Company writes off deferred acquisition costs to the extent\nnecessary to eliminate the premium deficiency. If the premium deficiency exceeds deferred acquisition costs, the Company\naccrues a liability for the deficiency. The Company did not recognize any premium deficiency adjustments during the periods\npresented.\nPolicy acquisition costs also include profit commissions, which the Company recognized on a basis consistent with its\nestimate of losses and loss expenses. At December 31, 2022, $1.6 million of profit commission reserves were recoverable, net\nof profit commissions payable (December 31, 2021: $8.3 million). For the year ended December 31, 2022, net profit\ncommission expense (income) of $16.0 million, (2021: $8.6 million, 2020: $(7.7) million) was included in the caption\n“Acquisition costs” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nFunds Withheld\nFunds withheld represent reinsurance balances retained as collateral by the Company on retroceded contracts. Any\ninterest expense that the Company incurs while these funds are withheld is included under the caption “Net investment income\n(loss)” in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves and Recoverable\nThe Company’s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are composed of:\n● case reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses resulting from claims notified to the Company by its clients;\nand\n● reserves for estimated loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by insureds and reinsureds but not yet reported\nto the insurer or reinsurer (“IBNR”), including unknown future developments on loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses that are known to the insurer or reinsurer.\nThe Company estimates these reserves based on reports from ceding companies, industry data, and historical experience\nanalyzed using standard actuarial and statistical techniques.\nThe analysis includes assessing currently available data, predictions of future developments, estimates of future trends,\nand other factors. These estimates are reviewed by the Company’s reserving committee at least quarterly and adjusted as\nnecessary.\nThe final settlement of losses may vary, perhaps materially, from the reserves recorded. The Company recognizes\nall adjustments to the estimates in the period they are determined. U.S. GAAP does not permit establishing loss reserves, which\ninclude case reserves and IBNR loss reserves, until the occurrence of an event that may give rise to a claim. As a result, only\nloss reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date are established. There is no allowance for the establishment\nof loss reserves to account for expected future loss events.\nThe caption, “Loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets represents\nthe amounts due from retrocessionaires for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses on retrocession agreements. Ceded IBNR\nrecoverable amounts are estimated based on the Company’s actuarial estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically and\nadjusted when deemed necessary. The Company may be unable to recover the loss and loss adjustment expense recoverable\namounts due as a result of the retrocessionaires’ inability to pay. The Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of its\nretrocessionaires and calculates an allowance for expected credit losses (see “Reinsurance Assets” below).\nFor losses stemming from exposure to natural perils, loss reserves are generally established based on loss payments and\ncase reserves reported by clients when, and if, received. Estimates for IBNR losses are added to the case reserves as the\nCompany deems appropriate. To establish catastrophe IBNR loss estimates, the Company uses estimates communicated by\nceding companies, industry data and information, knowledge of the business written, and management’s judgment.\nFor contracts without significant exposure to natural perils, initial reserves for each contract are determined based on a\ncombination of (i) the pricing analysis performed prior to binding the contract; (ii) the underwriter’s detailed knowledge of the\ncedent, its operations and future business plans; and (iii) the professional judgment and recommendation of the Chief Actuary.\nIn the pricing analysis, the Company utilizes information from the client and industry data. This information typically includes,\nbut is not limited to, data related to premiums, losses, exposure, business mix, industry performance, and associated trends\ncovering as much history as deemed appropriate. The level of detail within the data obtained varies greatly depending on the\nunderlying contract, line of business, client, and coverage provided. In all cases, the Company requests each client to provide\ndata for each reporting period, which, depending on the contract, could be on a monthly or quarterly basis. The terms and\nconditions of each contract specify the data reporting requirements.\nF-11\nLink to Table of Contents\nGenerally, the Company obtains regular updates of premium and loss-related information for the current and historical\nperiods and utilizes them to update the initially expected loss ratio. There may be a lag between (i) claims being reported by the\nunderlying insured to the Company’s cedent and (ii) claims being reported by the Company’s cedent to the Company. This lag\nmay impact the Company’s loss reserve estimates. Client reports have pre-determined due dates (for example, fifteen days after\neach month-end). The timing of the reporting requirements is designed so that the Company receives premium and loss\ninformation as soon as practicable once the client has closed its books. Accordingly, there should be a short lag in such\nreporting. Additionally, most contracts that have the potential for large single-event losses have provisions that such loss\nnotifications are provided to the Company immediately upon the occurrence of an event.\nOnce the updated information is received, the Company uses various standard actuarial methods for its quarterly\nanalysis. Such methods typically include the following:\n● Paid loss development method: Ultimate losses are estimated by calculating past paid loss development factors and\napplying them to exposure periods with further expected paid loss development. This method assumes that losses are\npaid in a consistent pattern. It provides an objective test of reported loss projections because paid losses contain no\nreserve estimates.\n● Reported loss development method: Ultimate losses are estimated by calculating past reported loss development\nfactors and applying them to exposure periods with further expected reported loss development. This method\nincorporates changes in payments and case reserves.\n● Expected loss ratio method: Ultimate losses are estimated by multiplying earned premiums by an expected loss ratio.\nThe expected loss ratio is often determined using industry data, historical company data, past pricing or reserving\nanalysis performed, and actuarial judgment. This method is typically used for lines of business and contracts where\nthere are no (or insignificant) historical losses or where past loss experience is not considered applicable to the current\nperiod.\n● Bornhuetter-Ferguson paid loss method: Ultimate losses are estimated by modifying expected loss ratios to the\nextent losses paid to date differ from what would have been expected based upon the selected paid loss development\npattern. This method avoids some distortions that could result from a large development factor being applied to a\nsmall base of paid losses to calculate ultimate losses.\n● Bornhuetter-Ferguson reported loss method: Ultimate losses are estimated by modifying expected loss ratios to the\nextent losses reported to date differ from what would have been expected based upon the selected reported loss\ndevelopment pattern. This method avoids some distortions that could result from a large development factor being\napplied to a small base of reported losses to calculate ultimate losses.\n● Frequency / Severity method: Ultimate losses are estimated by multiplying the ultimate number of claims (i.e., the\nfrequency multiplied by the exposure base) by the estimated average cost per claim (i.e., the severity). This approach\nenables trends and patterns in the rates of claims emergence (i.e., reporting) and settlement (i.e., closure) and the\naverage cost of claims to be analyzed separately.\nIn addition, the Company may supplement its analysis with other reserving methodologies that it deems relevant to\nspecific contracts.\nFor each contract, the Company utilizes reserving methodologies it considers appropriate to calculate a best estimate of\nreserves. Whether the Company uses a single methodology or a combination depends upon the portfolio segment being\nanalyzed and the actuary’s judgment. The Company’s reserving methodology does not require a fixed weighting of the various\nmethods used. Certain methods are considered more appropriate than others depending on the type, structure, age, maturity, and\nduration of the expected losses on the contract. For example, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson reported loss method might be more\nappropriate than a paid loss development method for relatively new contracts that have experienced little paid loss\ndevelopment.\nThe Company’s gross aggregate reserves are the sum of the best estimate reserves of all portfolio exposures. Generally,\nIBNR loss reserves are calculated by estimating the ultimate incurred losses and subtracting cumulative paid claims and case\nreserves. Each quarter, the Company’s Reserving Committee, led by the Chief Actuary, meets to assess the adequacy of our\nloss reserves based on the reserve analysis and recommendations prepared by the Company’s reserving department.\nThe Company does not typically experience significant claims processing backlogs, although such backlogs may occur\nfollowing a major catastrophic event. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company did not have a significant backlog in our\nclaims processing.\nThe Company did not make any significant changes to the actuarial methodology or assumptions relating to its loss and\nloss adjustment expense reserves during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021.\nF-12\nLink to Table of Contents\nReinsurance Assets\nThe Company calculates an allowance for expected credit losses for its reinsurance balances receivable and loss and loss\nadjustment expenses recoverable by applying a Probability of Default (“PD”) / Loss Given Default (“LGD”) model. The PD /\nLGD approach considers the Company’s collectibility history on its reinsurance assets and representative external loss history.\nIn calculating the probability of default, the Company also considers the estimated duration of its reinsurance assets.\nThe Company evaluates each counterparty’s creditworthiness based on credit ratings that independent agencies assign to\nthe counterparty. The Company manages its credit risk in its reinsurance assets by transacting only with insurers and reinsurers\nthat it considers financially sound. Credit ratings of the counterparties are forward-looking and consider various economic\nscenarios. The Company's evaluation of the required allowance for reinsurance balances receivable and loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses recoverable considers the current economic environment as well as potential macroeconomic developments.\nFor its retrocessional counterparties that are unrated, the Company may hold collateral in the form of funds withheld,\ntrust accounts, or irrevocable letters of credit. In evaluating credit risk associated with reinsurance balances receivable, the\nCompany considers its right to offset loss obligations against premiums receivable. The Company regularly evaluates its net\ncredit exposure to assess the ability of cedents and retrocessionaires to honor their respective obligations.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded an allowance for expected credit loss on its Reinsurance Assets of\n$0.4 million (December 31, 2021, $0.1 million).\nDeposit Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company applies deposit accounting to reinsurance contracts that do not transfer sufficient insurance risk to merit\nreinsurance accounting. Under deposit accounting, the Company recognizes an asset or liability based on its paid or received\nconsideration. The deposit asset or liability balance is subsequently adjusted using the interest method with the corresponding\nincome and expense recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations under the captions “Other income\n(expense)” and “Deposit interest expense,” respectively. The Company records deposit assets and liabilities in its consolidated\nbalance sheets in the caption “Reinsurance balances receivable” and “Reinsurance balances payable,” respectively. At\nDecember 31, 2022, deposit assets and liabilities were $3.1 million and $10.7 million, respectively (December 31, 2021: $3.5\nmillion and $18.6 million, respectively). For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the interest income and\n(expense) on deposit-accounted contracts were as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\n($ in thousands)\nDeposit interest income $ — $ — $ 1,711\nDeposit interest expense (6,717) (11,655) —\nDeposit interest income (expense), net $ (6,717) $ (11,655) $ 1,711\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Company purchases “other investments,” which may include investments in private and unlisted equity securities,\nlimited partnerships, and commodities. Private investments and unlisted equities include securities that do not have readily\ndeterminable fair values. The carrying values of these holdings are determined based on their original cost minus impairment, if\nany, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes.\nFor securities classified as “other investments,” any realized and unrealized gains or losses are determined on the basis of\nthe specific identification method (by reference to cost or amortized cost, as appropriate) and included in the caption “Net\ninvestment income (loss)” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company records interest income and interest expense on an accrual basis.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company has established a stock incentive plan for directors, employees, and consultants.\nF-13\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation costs based on the fair value at the award’s grant date. The\nCompany measures compensation for restricted shares and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) based on the price of the Company’s\ncommon shares at the grant date. For restricted shares and RSUs with service and performance vesting conditions, the expense\nis recognized based on management’s estimate of the probability of the performance conditions being achieved based on\nhistorical results and expectations of future results. If the Company expects to meet the performance conditions, it attributes the\nexpense to the period the requisite service is rendered. For restricted shares and RSUs with only service vesting conditions, the\nCompany recognizes the associated expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, net of any estimated or expected\nforfeitures.\nThe forfeiture rate is estimated based on the Company’s historical actual forfeitures relating to restricted shares and\nRSUs granted to employees. The forfeiture rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary. The Company applies no\nforfeiture rate to restricted shares granted to directors, which vest over a maximum twelve-month period.\nDetermining the fair value of share purchase options at the grant date requires significant estimation and judgment. The\nCompany uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to assist in the calculation of fair value for share purchase options. The\nmodel requires estimating various inputs such as the term, forfeiture and dividend rates, and expected volatility. In determining\nthe grant date fair value, the Company uses the entire ten-year life of the options as the estimated term and assumes no\nforfeitures and no dividends paid during the life of the options. The Company bases its estimate of expected volatility on the\ndaily historical trading data of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares from the date they commenced trading (May 24, 2007)\nto the grant date.\nFor share purchase options issued under the employee stock incentive plan, the compensation cost is calculated and\nrecognized over the vesting periods on a graded vesting basis (see Note 11).\nConvertible Notes\nPrior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06 in January 2022, “Debt - Debt with Conversion\nand Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”),” the Company determined\nthat the senior convertible notes’ cash conversion option represented an embedded derivative and bifurcated it from the\nunderlying contract for financial reporting purposes. For the debt component, the Company recorded a liability equivalent to the\npresent value of comparable debt without the conversion features at the time of issuance. The remainder of the proceeds, which\nrepresented the embedded derivative, was included in the caption “Additional paid-in capital” in the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nUpon adoption of ASU 2020-06, U.S. GAAP no longer permits entities to bifurcate embedded conversion features from\nthe underlying contract. Therefore, effective January 1, 2022, the Company no longer presents the embedded conversion\nfeatures separately in equity; instead, the Company’s senior convertible debt is presented as a single liability in the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheet. See the below section captioned “Recently Issued Accounting Standards Adopted” for the impact of\nthe new accounting standard on the Company’s accounting of its senior convertible notes.\nCosts incurred in issuing the convertible notes consisted primarily of underwriting, legal, accounting, and printing fees.\nThese costs are amortized over the term of the debt and are included in the caption “Interest expense” in the Company’s\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nForeign Exchange\nThe reporting and functional currency of the Company and all its significant subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The\nCompany records foreign currency transactions at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary assets and\nliabilities in foreign currencies are converted at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are carried at their historical exchange rates. The Company includes any foreign\nexchange gains and losses under the caption “Other income (expense), net” in the Company’s consolidated statements of\noperations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, $(6.2) million, $(1.6) million, and $0.3 million, respectively, of\nforeign exchange gains (losses) were included in the Company’s net income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nDerivative instruments\nF-14\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe Company recognizes derivative financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair values. It\nincludes any realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized gains and losses in the caption “Net investment income (loss)”\nin the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company’s derivatives do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes. The Company records the\nassociated assets and liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. The Company does not offset these balances\nagainst collateral pledged or received.\nOther Assets\nThe caption “Other assets” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets consists primarily of prepaid expenses, right-\nof-use lease assets, other receivables, taxes recoverable, and deferred tax assets.\nOther Liabilities\nThe caption “Other liabilities” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets consists primarily of accruals for legal and\nother professional fees, employee bonuses, taxes payable, and lease liabilities.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe Company has no comprehensive income or loss other than the net income or loss disclosed in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe Company has issued unvested restricted stock awards, some of which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or\ndividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid. These awards are considered “participating securities” for the purposes of\ncalculating earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of\nordinary shares and participating securities outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (or loss) per share includes the\ndilutive effect, if any, of the following:\n• Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) issued that convert to ordinary shares upon vesting;\n• Unvested restricted share awards which are not considered “participating securities”;\n• Additional potential ordinary shares issuable when in-the-money stock options are exercised, determined using\nthe treasury stock method;\n• For periods prior to January 1, 2022, those ordinary shares with the potential to be issued in connection with\nconvertible notes and other such convertible instruments, determined using the treasury stock method; and\n• Effective January 1, 2022, the dilutive effect of the convertible notes calculated using the if-converted method.\nUnder the if-converted method, the convertible notes are assumed to be converted at the beginning of the\nperiod. The resulting common shares are included in the denominator of the diluted net income per common\nshare calculation. Interest expense related to the convertible notes incurred in the period is added back to the\nnumerator for purposes of the if-converted calculation.\nDiluted earnings (or loss) per share contemplates a conversion to ordinary shares of all convertible instruments only if\nthey are dilutive. In the event of a net loss, all RSUs, stock options, shares potentially issuable in connection with convertible\nnotes, and participating securities are excluded from the calculation of both basic and diluted loss per share as their inclusion\nwould be anti-dilutive.\nF-15\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) and weighted average shares used in computing basic and diluted net\nincome per share for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 (expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per\nshare and share amounts):\n2022 2021 2020\nNumerator for earnings per share\nNet income (loss) - basic $ 25,342 $ 17,578 $ 3,866\nAdd: interest on convertible notes 4,201 — —\nLess: gain on debt repurchases (343) — —\nNet income (loss) - diluted $ 29,200 $ 17,578 $ 3,866\nDenominator for earnings per share\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 33,908,156 34,204,364 36,172,216\nEffect of dilutive employee and director share-based awards 368,096 146,652 105,812\nShares potentially issuable in connection with convertible notes 5,493,538 — —\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 39,769,790 34,351,016 36,278,028\nAnti-dilutive stock options outstanding 690,337 735,627 835,627\nEarnings (loss) per share (Class A and Class B)\nBasic $ 0.75 $ 0.51 $ 0.11\nDiluted 0.73 0.51 0.11\nTaxation\nUnder current Cayman Islands law, no corporate entity, including GLRE and Greenlight Re, is obligated to pay taxes in\nthe Cayman Islands on either income or capital gains. The Company has an undertaking from the Governor-in-Cabinet of the\nCayman Islands, pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Concessions Act, as amended, that, in the event that the Cayman Islands\nenacts any legislation that imposes a tax on profits, income, gains, or appreciations, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or\ninheritance tax, such tax will not be applicable to GLRE, Greenlight Re nor their respective operations, or to the Class A or\nClass B ordinary shares or related obligations, before February 1, 2025.\nVerdant is incorporated in Delaware and therefore is subject to taxes in accordance with the U.S. federal rates and\nregulations prescribed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). Verdant’s taxable income is generally expected to be\ntaxed at a marginal rate of 21% (2021: 21%). Verdant’s tax years 2018 and beyond remain open and may be subject to\nexamination by the IRS.\nGRIL is incorporated in Ireland and therefore is subject to the Irish corporation tax rate of 12.5% on its trading income\nand 25% on its non-trading income.\nGreenlight Re UK is incorporated in the United Kingdom and therefore is subject to the U.K. corporate tax rate of 19%\non its profits.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance to the extent that the Company considers it more likely than not that all or a\nportion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future. Other than this valuation allowance, the Company has not\ntaken any income tax positions subject to significant uncertainty that is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the\nCompany.\nSegment Information\nThe Company has one operating segment, Property and Casualty Reinsurance.\nF-16\nLink to Table of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.\n2022-03 “Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale\nRestrictions.” (“ASU 2022-03”). ASU 2022-03 clarifies the guidance for measuring the fair value of an equity security subject\nto contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security and introduces new disclosure requirements for equity\nsecurities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. ASU 2022-03 is\neffective for public business entities for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect ASU 2022-03 to have a material impact on its\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Adopted\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)\nand Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments\nand Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 is designed to simplify the accounting for certain\nfinancial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments. The amendments remove\nthe separation models in Subtopic 470-20 for certain contracts. As a result, entities will no longer present embedded conversion\nfeatures separately in equity; instead, the convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its\namortized cost. ASU 2020-06 also addresses the computation of earnings per share for convertible debt instruments, requiring\nthe application of the if-converted method when calculating diluted earnings per share. Under the if-converted method, the\nshares potentially issuable in connection with convertible debt are assumed to be converted at the beginning of the period. The\nresulting ordinary shares are included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation for the period presented.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2020-06 during the first quarter of 2022, using the “modified retrospective” transition\nmethod. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 resulted in a decrease in the Company’s opening shareholders’ equity of approximately\n$2.5 million, with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the senior convertible notes (see Note 9). The adoption of\nASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the Company’s net income, cash flows, or any other balances.\n3. INVESTMENT IN RELATED PARTY INVESTMENT FUND\nThe Company has entered into the Second Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement (the “SILP\nLPA”) of Solasglas Investments, LP (“SILP”), with DME Advisors II, LLC (“DME II”), as General Partner, Greenlight Re, and\nGRIL, (together, the “GLRE Limited Partners”). SILP has entered into a SILP investment advisory agreement (“IAA”) with\nDME Advisors. LP (“DME Advisors”), pursuant to which DME Advisors is the investment manager for SILP. DME II and\nDME Advisors are related to the Company, and each is an affiliate of David Einhorn, Chairman of the Company’s Board of\nDirectors (the “Chairman”).\nAt December 31, 2022, the SILP LPA included the following proviso: “The Investment Portfolio of each Partner will not\nexceed the product of (a) such Partner’s surplus (Greenlight Re Surplus or GRIL Surplus, as the case may be) multiplied by (b)\nthe Investment Cap (50%), and the General Partner will designate any portion of a Partner’s Investment Portfolio as Designated\nSecurities to effectuate such limit.” Effective January 1, 2023, the Investment Cap was amended to 60%.\nThe Company has concluded that SILP qualifies as a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under U.S. GAAP. In assessing its\ninterest in SILP, the Company noted the following:\n• DME II serves as SILP’s general partner and has the power to appoint the investment manager. The Company does not\nhave the power to appoint, change or replace the investment manager or the general partner except “for cause.” Neither\nof the GLRE Limited Partners can participate in the investment decisions of SILP as long as SILP adheres to the\ninvestment guidelines provided within the SILP LPA. For these reasons, the GLRE Limited Partners are not\nconsidered to have substantive participating rights or kick-out rights.\n• DME II holds an interest in excess of 10% of SILP’s net assets, which the Company considers to represent an\nobligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits of SILP that are significant to SILP.\nF-17\nLink to Table of Contents\nConsequently, the Company has concluded that DME II’s interests, not the Company’s, meet both the “power” and\n“benefits” criteria associated with VIE accounting guidance. Therefore DME II is SILP’s primary beneficiary. The Company\npresents its investment in SILP in its consolidated balance sheets in the caption “Investment in related party investment fund.”\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss relating to SILP is limited to the net asset value of the GLRE Limited\nPartners’ investment in SILP. At December 31, 2022, the net asset value of the GLRE Limited Partners’ investment in SILP\nwas $178.2 million (December 31, 2021: $183.6 million), representing 69.3% (December 31, 2021: 78.2%) of SILP’s total net\nassets. DME II held the remaining 30.7% (December 31, 2021: 21.8%) of SILP’s total net assets. The investment in SILP is\nrecorded at the GLRE Limited Partners’ share of the net asset value of SILP as reported by SILP’s third-party administrator.\nThe GLRE Limited Partners can redeem their assets from SILP for operational purposes by providing 3 business days’ notice to\nDME II. At December 31, 2022, the majority of SILP’s long investments were composed of cash and publicly-traded equity\nsecurities, which could be readily liquidated to meet the GLRE Limited Partners’ redemption requests.\nThe Company’s share of the change in the net asset value of SILP for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and\n2020, was $54.8 million, $18.1 million, and $4.4 million, respectively, and shown in the caption “Income (loss) from\ninvestment in related party investment fund” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s investments in SILP exceeded 10% of the Company’s total shareholders’ equity,\nwith a fair value of $178.2 million (December 31, 2021: $183.6 million), representing 35.4% (December 31, 2021: 38.6%), of\ntotal shareholders’ equity.\nThe Company has determined that for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s investment in SILP met\nat least one of the conditions of a significant subsidiary under SEC’s Regulation S-X, Rule 3-09. Accordingly, the audited\nfinancial statements for SILP have been attached as an exhibit (Exhibit 99.1) to this Form 10-K.\nThe summarized financial statements of SILP are presented below.\nSummarized Statement of Assets and Liabilities of Solasglas Investments, LP\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\n($ in thousands)\nAssets\nInvestments, at fair value $ 304,806 $ 297,937\nDerivative contracts, at fair value 17,547 2,542\nDue from brokers 109,169 84,775\nInterest and dividends receivable 527 28\nTotal assets 432,049 385,282\nLiabilities and partners’ capital\nLiabilities\nInvestments sold short, at fair value (159,382) (132,360)\nDerivative contracts, at fair value (12,443) (7,253)\nDue to brokers (2,050) —\nCapital withdrawals payable (75) (10,000)\nInterest and dividends payable (760) (580)\nOther liabilities (159) (358)\nTotal liabilities (174,869) (150,551)\nNet Assets $ 257,180 $ 234,731\nGLRE Limited Partners’ share of Net Assets $ 178,197 $ 183,591\nF-18\nLink to Table of Contents\nSummarized Statement of Operations of Solasglas Investments, LP\nYear ended December 31\n2022 2021 2020\n($ in thousands)\nInvestment income\nDividend income (net of withholding taxes) $ 1,586 $ 641 $ 1,365\nInterest income 2,390 228 654\nTotal Investment income 3,976 869 2,019\nExpenses\nManagement fee (3,580) (3,492) (2,808)\nInterest (1,950) (1,055) (798)\nDividends (1,374) (1,147) (861)\nProfessional fees and other (988) (1,221) (949)\nTotal expenses (7,892) (6,915) (5,416)\nNet investment income (loss) (3,916) (6,046) (3,397)\nRealized and change in unrealized gains (losses)\nNet realized gain (loss) 75,172 (3,420) (61,616)\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) 11,886 35,482 71,948\nNet gain (loss) on investment transactions 87,058 32,062 10,332\nNet income (loss) $ 83,142 $ 26,016 $ 6,935\nGLRE Limited Partners’ share of net income (loss) (1) $ 54,844 $ 18,087 $ 4,431\n1 Net income (loss) is net of management fees and performance allocation presented below:\nYear ended December 31\n2022 2021 2020\n($ in thousands)\nManagement fees $ 3,580 $ 3,492 $ 2,808\nPerformance allocation 6,094 2,010 443\nTotal $ 9,674 $ 5,502 $ 3,251\nSee Note 14 for further details on management fees and performance allocation.\n4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nPurchases and sales of financial instruments are disclosed in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows. The\nfollowing table summarizes the change in unrealized gains and losses and the realized gains and losses on financial instruments\nincluded in the caption “Net investment income (loss)” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\nF-19\nLink to Table of Contents\nYear ended December 31\n2022 2021 2020\n($ in thousands)\nGross realized gains $ — $ 14,210 $ 5,766\nGross realized losses — — (15,000)\nNet realized gains (losses) $ — $ 14,210 $ (9,234)\nChange in unrealized gains and losses $ 9,858 $ 19,560 $ 25,909\nInvestments\nOther Investments\nThe Company’s “Other investments” are composed of the following:\n• Private investments, unlisted equities, and debt and convertible debt instruments, which consist primarily of\nInnovations-related investments supporting technology innovators in the (re)insurance market; and\n• Certificates of deposit with original maturities greater than three months.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company included the following securities in the caption “Other investments”:\nUnrealized Unrealized Fair value /\nCost gains losses carrying value\n($ in thousands)\nPrivate investments and unlisted\nequities $ 22,787 $ 42,461 $ (2,815) $ 62,433\nDebt and convertible debt securities 1,846 — — 1,846\nCertificates of deposit 6,000 — — 6,000\nTotal other investments $ 30,633 $ 42,461 $ (2,815) $ 70,279\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company included the following securities in the caption “Other investments”:\nUnrealized Unrealized Fair value /\nCost gains losses carrying value\n($ in thousands)\nPrivate investments and unlisted\nequities $ 17,411 $ 31,438 $ (1,800) $ 47,049\nDerivative financial instruments (not\ndesignated as hedging instruments) — 335 — 335\nTotal other investments $ 17,411 $ 31,773 $ (1,800) $ 47,384\nAt December 31, 2021, Company’s derivative financial instruments were composed of warrants granting the Company\nthe right, but not the obligation, to purchase shares at a specified price on or before the maturity date. The Company has not\ndesignated any of its derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss\nrelating to these warrants is limited to the warrants’ carrying amount.\nPrivate investments and unlisted equity securities without readily determinable fair values\nThe Company measures its private investments and unlisted equity securities without readily determinable fair values at\ncost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from identical or similar investments of the same issuers\n(the “measurement alternative”), with such changes recognized in the caption “Net investment income (loss)” in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company considers the need for impairment on a by-investment basis based on\ncertain indicators. Under the measurement alternative, the Company makes two types of valuation adjustments:\n• When the Company observes an orderly transaction of an investee’s identical or similar equity securities, the\nCompany adjusts the carrying value based on the observable price as of the transaction date. Once the Company\nF-20\nLink to Table of Contents\nrecords such an adjustment, the investment is considered an “asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis.”\n• If the Company determines that the investment is impaired and the fair value is less than its carrying value, it\nwrites down the investment to its fair value. Once the Company records such an adjustment, the investment is\nconsidered an “asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.”\nThe following table presents the carrying values of the private investments and unlisted equity securities carried under\nthe measurement alternative at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and the related adjustments recorded during the years then\nended.\nYear ended December 31\n2022 2021 2020\n($ in thousands)\nCarrying value (1) $ 62,433 $ 47,049 $ 21,793\nUpward carrying value changes (2) $ 11,277 $ 20,814 $ 10,576\nDownward carrying value changes and impairment (3) $ (1,073) $ (500) $ (1,500)\n(1) The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value\nchanges.\n(2) The cumulative upward carrying value changes from inception to December 31, 2022, totaled $42.9 million.\n(3) The cumulative downward carrying value changes and impairments from inception to December 31, 2022, totaled $3.1\nmillion.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received in an asset sale or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between unaffiliated market participants. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized\nbased on the extent to which the inputs are observable in the market. The categorization of financial instruments within the\nvaluation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is\nprioritized into three levels (with Level 3 being the lowest) defined as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value of the assets\nand liabilities. The term “unobservable inputs” includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, and similar techniques.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nAt December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company held $53.6 million and $40.5 million, respectively, of\nprivate investments and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The Company classifies these assets as\nLevel 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The following table summarizes the periods between the most recent fair value\nmeasurement dates and December 31, 2022, for the private and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:\nLess than 6\nmonths 6 to 12 months Over 1 year Total\n($ in thousands)\nFair values measured on a nonrecurring basis $ 599 $ 33,028 $ 19,929 $ 53,556\nAt December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company held $8.9 million and $6.5 million, respectively, of\nprivate investments and unlisted equities measured at cost.\nF-21\nLink to Table of Contents\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nIn accordance with ASC 320, “Investments - Debt Securities,” the Company has classified debt and convertible debt\nsecurities as “trading” measured at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in net income. The Company\nclassifies these securities as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. It estimates their fair values primarily based on third-party\nquotes, issuers’ book value, market multiples, and other inputs. Valuation of these securities is subjective as the markets’\nilliquidity may increase the likelihood that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an\nactual transaction could occur.\nThe carrying value of certificates of deposit with original maturities of one year or less approximates their fair values.\nThe Company classifies these assets as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nAt December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company did not carry any other investments at fair value with an\nassigned Level within the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s investment in the related party investment fund is measured at\nfair value using the net asset value practical expedient. Therefore, this investment is not classified within the fair value\nhierarchy. (See Note 3 for further details on the related party investment fund.)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, there were no transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nFinancial Instruments Disclosed, But Not Carried, at Fair Value\nThe caption “Convertible senior notes payable” represents financial instruments that the Company carries at amortized\ncost. The fair value of the convertible senior notes payable is estimated based on the bid price observed in an inactive market\nfor the identical instrument (Level 2 input) (see Note 9).\n5. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022, and 2021 were composed of cash at banks.\nDue to the short-term nature of cash and cash equivalents, the carrying values of cash at banks approximate their fair\nvalue. Cash at banks includes cash held at non-U.S. financial institutions not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or other deposit insurance programs.\n6. RESTRICTED CASH AND RESTRICTED CASH EQUIVALENTS\nRestricted cash and restricted cash equivalents include amounts held by the Company but pledged as security to provide\ncollateral required by the cedents in the form of trust accounts and letters of credit (see Note 15). At December 31, 2022, and\n2021, the restricted cash and cash equivalents were composed of the following:\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\n($ in thousands)\nCash held as collateral in trust accounts $ 463,659 $ 497,149\nCash collateral relating to letters of credit issued 204,651 137,645\nTotal restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 668,310 $ 634,794\n7. LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves included estimated amounts for several\ncatastrophe events. For significant catastrophe events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornados, typhoons, floods,\nearthquakes, wildfires, war and pandemics, loss reserves are generally established based on loss payments and case reserves\nreported by clients when received. To establish IBNR loss estimates, the Company makes use of, among other things, the\nfollowing information:\n• estimates communicated by ceding companies;\n• information received from clients, brokers, and loss adjusters;\n• an understanding of the underlying business written and its exposures to catastrophe event-related losses;\nF-22\nLink to Table of Contents\n• industry data;\n• catastrophe scenario modeling software; and\n• management’s judgment.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves included $13.6 million from the\nRussian-Ukrainian conflict and $19.5 million from Hurricane Ian. Additional information the Company considered in\nestimating its loss reserves included the following:\n• a review of in-force treaties that may provide coverage and incur losses;\n• catastrophe and scenario modeling analyses and results shared by cedents;\n• preliminary loss estimates received from clients, brokers, and loss adjusters;\n• reviews of industry insured loss estimates and market share analyses; and\n• management’s judgment.\nThe Company’s Russian-Ukrainian conflict loss estimates include actuarial assumptions, including:\n• the areas within the affected regions that have incurred losses;\n• the scope of coverage provided by the underlying policies;\n• the interpretation of contract terms;\n• the determination of loss-triggering events;\n• regulatory, legislative, and judicial actions that could influence contract interpretations across the insurance industry;\nand\n• the ability of the cedents and insured to mitigate some or all of their losses.\nDue to the uncertainty associated with the foregoing assumptions, the Company’s loss estimates are subject to significant\nvariability, and actual losses may ultimately differ materially from the Company's current estimates. The Company will\nevaluate its assumptions as new information becomes available and may adjust its loss estimates in future periods. Such\nadjustments may be material to the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, if the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is prolonged, the Company may incur additional losses in subsequent\nperiods.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were composed of the following:\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\n($ in thousands)\nCase reserves $ 184,756 $ 190,220\nIBNR 370,712 333,790\nTotal $ 555,468 $ 524,010\nF-23\nLink to Table of Contents\nA summary of changes in outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for all lines of business consolidated\nfor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 is as follows:\nConsolidated 2022 2021 2020\n($ in thousands)\nGross balance at January 1 $ 524,010 $ 494,179 $ 470,588\nLess: Losses recoverable (11,100) (16,851) (27,531)\nNet balance at January 1 512,910 477,328 443,057\nIncurred losses related to:\nCurrent year 316,367 389,080 333,096\nPrior years 118 (14,100) 4,737\nTotal incurred 316,485 374,980 337,833\nPaid losses related to:\nCurrent year (78,517) (152,214) (109,509)\nPrior years (198,897) (185,549) (195,726)\nTotal paid (277,414) (337,763) (305,235)\nForeign currency revaluation (9,752) (1,635) 1,673\nNet balance at December 31 542,229 512,910 477,328\nAdd: Losses recoverable 13,239 11,100 16,851\nGross balance at December 31 $ 555,468 $ 524,010 $ 494,179\nLoss development\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company experienced $0.1 million in net adverse development on prior\nyear loss and LAE reserves. This net adverse development resulted primarily from the following:\n• $8.1 million of adverse development on motor and health business attributed to inflation-driven increases in claims\ncosts;\n• $7.1 million of adverse development on multi-line business driven by worse than expected claims experience on whole\naccount contracts written from 2014-2018;\n• $3.7 million of adverse development on professional liability contracts written from 2014 to 2017;\n• $3.0 million of adverse development on workers’ compensation contracts driven by poor claims experience across\nseveral states in the U.S.; and\n• $2.0 million of adverse development on general liability contracts due to reported claims being settled above expected\nlevels.\nThe adverse developments were partially offset by favorable developments relating to prior accident years primarily due\nto the following:\n• $9.8 million of favorable experience on mortgage business. On a financial-impact basis, the favorable loss\ndevelopment on these contracts was offset by increased profit commissions, which are included in the caption\n“Acquisition costs” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations;\n• $9.2 million of favorable development on multi-line business driven primarily by a loss portfolio transfer on a whole\naccount contract and better than anticipated claims experience on a combined workers’ compensation and commercial\npackages account across multiple years; and\n• $7.2 million of loss reserves released relating to catastrophe events, COVID-19, and property covers based on updated\nclaims reporting received from cedents.\nF-24\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe remaining development on prior year loss and LAE reserves recognized in 2022 related to several smaller\nadjustments made across various lines of business.\nYear ended December 31, 2021\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company experienced $14.1 million in net favorable development on\nprior year loss and LAE reserves. This net favorable development resulted primarily from the following:\n• $14.7 million of better-than-expected claims reporting on motor contracts, primarily relating to contracts that incepted\nin 2015 and 2016;\n• $8.9 million favorable loss development on various specialty lines of business, including crop, space, and marine and\nenergy, as actual losses reported were better than expected;\n• $5.0 million of favorable loss development on mortgage contracts resulting from lower delinquencies and fewer\nreported claims than initially anticipated. On a financial-impact basis, the favorable loss development on these\ncontracts was offset by increased profit commissions, which are included in the caption “Acquisition costs” in the\nCompany’s consolidated statements of operations; and\n• $3.5 million favorable loss development on a multi-line contract that incepted in 2019.\nThe favorable developments were partially offset by adverse developments relating to prior accident years primarily due\nto the following:\n• $14.4 million of adverse development on multi-line casualty contracts primarily relating to contracts that incepted in\n2014 and 2015, resulting from unfavorable development in reported claims;\n• $2.9 million of adverse development on a general liability contract resulting from unfavorable development in reported\nclaims; and\n• $1.2 million of adverse development on workers’ compensation contracts resulting from higher than anticipated losses.\nThe remaining development on prior year loss and LAE reserves recognized in 2021 related to several smaller\nadjustments made across various lines of business.\nYear ended December 31, 2020\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced $4.7 million in net adverse development on prior\nyear loss and LAE reserves. This net adverse development resulted primarily from the following:\n• $7.6 million of adverse loss development on multi-line contracts that incepted from 2015 to 2018, resulting from\nunfavorable development in reported claims;\n• $1.9 million of adverse loss development on general liability contracts, primarily relating to unfavorable development\nin reported claims on a contract that incepted in 2019;\n• $1.9 million of adverse loss development on specialty health contracts primarily arising from a few large medical\nclaims reported on a contract that incepted in 2019; and\n• $1.5 million of adverse loss development on motor contracts relating to the 2018 and 2019 treaty years, partially offset\nby favorable loss development on contracts that incepted from 2015 to 2017.\nThe adverse developments were partially offset by favorable developments relating to prior accident years primarily due\nto the following:\n• $4.5 million of favorable development on property contracts primarily resulting from lower than anticipated losses\nrelating to the 2017 and 2018 catastrophe events, partially offset by adverse loss development on 2019 contracts;\n• $2.2 million of favorable loss development on solicitors’ professional indemnity contracts resulting primarily from\nlower than expected claims on prior accident years.\n• $1.9 million of favorable loss development on a professional liability contract relating to a contract that incepted in\n2008 where the reported claims have been lower than those previously anticipated.\nF-25\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe remaining development on prior year loss and LAE reserves recognized in 2020 related to several smaller\nadjustments made across various lines of business.\nThe changes in the outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for health claims for the years ended December\n31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 are as follows:\nHealth 2022 2021 2020\n($ in thousands)\nGross balance at January 1 $ 11,894 $ 18,629 $ 19,306\nLess: Losses recoverable — — —\nNet balance at January 1 11,894 18,629 19,306\nIncurred losses related to:\nCurrent year 8,667 38,109 37,064\nPrior years 2,822 (780) 870\nTotal incurred 11,489 37,329 37,934\nPaid losses related to:\nCurrent year (5,219) (28,896) (21,313)\nPrior years (11,532) (15,168) (17,298)\nTotal paid (16,751) (44,064) (38,611)\nForeign currency revaluation — — —\nNet balance at December 31 6,632 11,894 18,629\nAdd: Losses recoverable 665 — —\nGross balance at December 31 $ 7,297 $ 11,894 $ 18,629\nDisclosures about Short-Duration Contracts\nThe Company has one operating segment, Property & Casualty Reinsurance, and categorizes its business as Property,\nCasualty, and Other.

As a result, all prior year information has been restated to reflect\nDecember 31, 2022, foreign exchange rates. This treatment prevents changes in foreign currency exchange rates from distorting\nthe claims development between the years presented.\nF-36\nLink to Table of Contents\nFor assumed contracts, the Company does not generally receive claims information by accident year from the ceding\ninsurers but instead receives claims information by the treaty year of the contract. Claims reported by the ceding insurer to the\nCompany may have the covered losses occurring in an accident year other than the treaty year. Some incurred and paid claims\nhave been allocated to the accident years for the loss development tables based on the proportion of premiums earned for each\ncontract during such accident year.\nFor example, a one-year quota-share reinsurance treaty incepting on October 1, 2020 (with underlying policies each\nhaving a one-year duration) would have a 24-month period over which the premiums would be earned. Therefore, claims would\nbe allocated to accident years 2020, 2021 and 2022 based on the proportion of the premiums earned during each accident year.\nFor illustration of this contract, any claims reported during 2020 would be allocated to the 2020 accident year. For losses\nreported during 2021, the claims would be allocated between 2020 and 2021 based on the percentage of premiums earned\nduring 2020 and 2021. Similarly, for losses reported during 2022 and thereafter, the losses would be allocated to the 2020, 2021\nand 2022 accident years based on the proportion of premiums earned during each of those years. However, natural catastrophes\nand certain other large losses are addressed separately and are assigned to the accident year in which they occurred.\nThe reconciliation of the net incurred and paid claims development tables to the liability for claims and claim\nadjustment expenses in the consolidated balance sheet is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2022\n($ in thousands)\nNet outstanding liabilities\nHealth $ 6,632\nMultiline 220,711\nGeneral Liability 31,672\nMotor Casualty 33,099\nMotor Property 6,152\nProperty 50,648\nProfessional Liability 13,844\nWorkers' Compensation 61,421\nFinancial Lines 49,543\nOther 64,013\nLiabilities for claims and claims adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance 537,735\nAdd: Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid claims 13,239\nAdd: Unallocated claims adjustment expenses 4,432\nAdd: Allowance for credit losses 62\nTotal gross liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense $ 555,468\nF-37\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe average historical annual percentage payout of net incurred claims (excluding health) at December 31, 2022, is as\nfollows:\nYears 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n(Unaudited - Supplementary Information)\nMultiline 11.2 % 16.1 % 14.0 % 11.9 % 10.5 % 10.2 % 10.4 % 8.8 % 4.7 % 2.2 %\nGeneral Liability 4.7 % 13.6 % 12.9 % 12.2 % 18.1 % 27.6 % 7.2 % 2.9 % 0.5 % 0.3 %\nMotor Casualty 49.0 % 35.8 % 7.8 % 3.7 % 1.7 % 1.0 % 0.8 % 0.2 % — % — %\nMotor Property 53.3 % 40.8 % 4.9 % 1.0 % — % — % — % — % — % — %\nProperty 49.5 % 34.7 % 8.0 % 2.9 % 2.5 % 0.8 % 1.0 % 0.5 % 0.1 % — %\nProfessional Liability 2.9 % 10.4 % 15.2 % 13.5 % 9.4 % 7.9 % 5.8 % 2.2 % 3.2 % 29.5 %\nWorkers' Compensation 30.9 % 36.5 % 22.4 % 7.6 % 1.6 % 0.8 % 0.1 % 0.1 % — % — %\nFinancial Lines 20.9 % 34.3 % 21.2 % 11.3 % 4.5 % 3.7 % 1.8 % 1.0 % — % 1.3 %\nOther 20.6 % 27.2 % 11.2 % 10.0 % 8.3 % 7.7 % 7.6 % 7.4 % — % — %\nThe historical annual percentage payout pattern for health claims is excluded from the table above because health\nclaims have short settlement periods, and including it would skew the results presented.\nAs a reinsurance entity, the Company generally does not receive detailed claims frequency information or claims\ncounts from ceding insurers and third-party claim handlers. Due to the nature of the reinsurance contracts, the underlying\ninsured reports claims to the insurer who cedes losses to the Company. The Company is contractually obligated to reimburse\nthe ceding insurer for its share of the losses. While the Company has the right to conduct audits of the ceding insurer’s claims\nfiles, the insurer is generally not obligated to provide a detailed listing of claims counts or other claims frequency information.\nTherefore it is impracticable for the Company to present the cumulative number of reported claims by accident year.\n8. RETROCESSION\nFrom time to time, the Company purchases retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to manage\nits overall exposure, reduce its net liability on individual risks, obtain additional underwriting capacity, and balance its\nunderwriting portfolio. The Company records loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable from retrocessionaires as assets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s earned ceded premiums were $15.3 million (2021: $0.0 million\nand 2020: $3.2 million). For the year ended December 31, 2022, loss and loss adjustment expenses recovered and changes in\nlosses recoverable were $6.6 million (2021: $0.0 million and 2020: $5.9 million).\nRetrocession contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to its cedents. Failure of retrocessionaires to\nhonor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. At December 31, 2022, the Company’s loss reserves recoverable\nof $13.2 million (December 31, 2021: $11.1 million) consisted of (i) $9.5 million (December 31, 2021: $8.4 million)\nrecoverable from unrated retrocessionaires, of which $9.2 million (December 31, 2021: $8.2 million) were secured by cash,\nletters of credit and collateral held in trust accounts for the benefit of the Company and (ii) $3.8 million (December 31, 2021:\n$2.8 million) recoverable from retrocessionaires rated A- or above by A.M. Best.\nThe Company regularly evaluates its net credit exposure to assess the ability of the retrocessionaires to honor their\nrespective obligations. At December 31, 2022, the Company had recorded an allowance for expected credit losses of $0.1\nmillion (December 31, 2021: $0.1 million).\n9. SENIOR CONVERTIBLE NOTES\nOn August 7, 2018, the Company issued $100.0 million of senior unsecured convertible notes (the “Notes”), which\nmature on August 1, 2023. The Notes bear interest at 4.0%, payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year\nbeginning February 1, 2019.\nNoteholders have the option, under certain conditions, to redeem the Notes prior to maturity. At December 31, 2022, the\nCompany’s share price was lower than the conversion price of $17.19 per share.\nF-38\nLink to Table of Contents\nIf a holder redeems the Notes, the Company shall have the option to settle the conversion obligation in cash, ordinary\nshares of the Company, or a combination thereof pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Notes. Prior to January 1,\n2022, the Company bifurcated the Notes into liability and equity components. Effective January 1, 2022, upon adoption of ASU\n2020-06, the Company no longer bifurcates the Notes and presents the entire balance as a single liability on the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets (see Note 2 for recently issued accounting standards adopted).\nThe Company’s effective borrowing rate for non-convertible debt at the time of issuance of the Notes was estimated to\nbe 6.0%. The Company incurred issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the Notes. At December 31, 2022, the\nunamortized portion of these costs was $0.4 million (December 31, 2021: $1.0 million), which the Company expects to\namortize through the maturity date.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased and canceled $20.4 million of the Notes. The\ncarrying value of the Notes outstanding at December 31, 2022, including accrued interest of $1.3 million, was $80.5 million\n(December 31, 2021: $98.1 million). At December 31, 2022, the Company estimated the fair value of the Notes (excluding\naccrued interest) to be $77.1 million (December 31, 2021: $97.5 million) (see Note 4 Financial Instruments).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized interest expenses of $4.2 million (2021: $6.3 million;\n2020: $6.3 million), which included the interest coupon and the amortization of issuance costs. The comparative amounts for\n2021 and 2020 also included the amortization of the discount.\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants relating to the Notes at December 31, 2022, and December 31,\n2021. At December 31, 2022, the Company had a remaining obligation for interest and principal payments of $82.8 million\nduring 2023.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased and canceled $13.8 million of the Notes.\n10. SHARE CAPITAL\nThe holders of all ordinary shares are entitled to share equally in dividends declared by the Board of Directors. In the\nevent of a winding-up or dissolution of the Company, the ordinary shareholders share equally and ratably in the Company’s\nassets after payment of all debts and liabilities and after the liquidation of any issued and outstanding preferred shares. The\nBoard of Directors is authorized to establish the rights and restrictions for preferred shares as they deem appropriate. At\nDecember 31, 2022, no preferred shares were issued or outstanding.\nThe Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, as revised by special resolution on July 10,\n2008 (the “Articles”), provide that the holders of Class A ordinary shares generally are entitled to one vote per share. However,\nexcept upon unanimous consent of the Board of Directors, no Class A shareholder is permitted to vote a number of shares that\nwould cause any United States person to own (directly, indirectly, or constructively under applicable United States tax\nattribution and constructive ownership rules) 9.9% or more of the total voting power of all issued and outstanding ordinary\nshares. The Articles further provide that the holders of Class B ordinary shares generally are entitled to ten votes per share.\nHowever, holders of Class B ordinary shares, together with their affiliates, are limited to voting that number of Class B ordinary\nshares equal to 9.5% of the total voting power of the total issued and outstanding ordinary shares.\nPursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement, dated August 11, 2004, by and among the Company and certain of its\nshareholders (the “Shareholders’ Agreement”), the holders of at least 50% of the outstanding Registrable Securities (as defined\nin the Shareholders’ Agreement), may, subject to certain conditions, request to have all or part of their Registrable Securities to\nbe registered. The Shareholders’ Agreement requires, among other things, that the Company use its commercially reasonable\nbest efforts to have a registration statement covering such Registrable Securities to be declared effective. The registration rights\ngranted pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement are not deemed to be liabilities; therefore, there has been no recognition in the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements of the registration rights granted pursuant to the Shareholders’ Agreement.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company has an effective Form S-3 registration statement on file with the SEC for an\naggregate principal amount of $200.0 million in securities.\nUnder the Company’s stock incentive plan, the number of Class A ordinary shares authorized for issuance is 8.0 million\nshares. At December 31, 2022, 2,011,426 (December 31, 2021: 3,128,276) Class A ordinary shares remained available for\nfuture issuance under the Company’s stock incentive plan. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers\nthe stock incentive plan.\nF-39\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe Board has adopted a share repurchase plan. The timing of such repurchases and the actual number of shares\nrepurchased will depend on various factors, including price, market conditions, and applicable regulatory and corporate\nrequirements. The Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase plan, which expires on June 30, 2023, authorizing the\nCompany to repurchase up to $25.0 million of Class A ordinary shares or securities convertible into Class A ordinary shares in\nthe open market through privately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans. The Company is not required to\nrepurchase any of the Class A ordinary shares. The repurchase plan may be modified, suspended, or terminated at the election\nof our Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nThe Company repurchased 4,933 Class A ordinary shares at an average price of $7.04 per share during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 (2021: 1,079,544 at an average price of $9.26 per share). All Class A ordinary shares repurchased are\ncanceled immediately upon repurchase.\nThe following table is a summary of ordinary shares issued and outstanding:\n2022 2021 2020\nClass A Class B Class A Class B Class A Class B\nBalance – beginning of year 27,589,731 6,254,715 28,260,075 6,254,715 30,739,395 6,254,715\nIssue of ordinary shares, net of\nforfeitures 984,548 — 409,200 — 67,777 —\nRepurchase of ordinary shares (4,933) — (1,079,544) — (2,547,097) —\nBalance – end of year 28,569,346 6,254,715 27,589,731 6,254,715 28,260,075 6,254,715\nAdditional paid-in capital includes the premium per share paid by the subscribing shareholders for Class A and B\nordinary shares, which have a par value of $0.10 each. It also includes the earned portion of the grant-date fair value of share-\nbased awards that have not yet vested.\nStatutory Capital and Surplus\nGreenlight Re is subject to the Cayman Islands’ Insurance (Capital and Solvency) (Classes B, C, and D Insurers)\nRegulations, (2018 Revision) (the “Insurance Regulations”). The Insurance Regulations impose a Minimum Capital\nRequirement (“MCR”) of $50.0 million and a Prescribed Capital Requirement (“PCR”) on Greenlight Re which was $226.5\nmillion at December 31, 2022 (2021: $222.6 million). At December 31, 2022, Greenlight Re’s statutory capital and surplus of\n$475.0 million exceeded the MCR and PCR. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, Greenlight Re’s net\nincome was $32.3 million, $15.9 million, and $12.6 million, respectively.\nGreenlight Re is not required to prepare separate statutory financial statements for filing with CIMA. There were no\nmaterial differences between Greenlight Re’s GAAP capital, surplus, and net income and its statutory capital, surplus, and net\nincome at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and for the years then ended.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company was not restricted from payment of dividends to the Company’s\nshareholders. However, since most of the Company’s capital and retained earnings are invested in its subsidiaries, a dividend\nfrom one or more of the Company’s subsidiaries would likely be required to fund a dividend to the Company’s\nshareholders. Any dividends declared and paid from Greenlight Re to the Company would require CIMA’s approval.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, $60.1 million of dividends (2021: $4.0 million, 2020: $39.5 million) were\ndeclared or paid by Greenlight Re to the Company. The dividends were approved by CIMA and resulted in the return of\nadditional share capital to the Company. The dividends were used primarily to repurchase the Company’s Notes and pay\ninterest on them. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, $248.5 million and $281.3 million, respectively, of Greenlight Re’s capital\nand surplus was available for distribution as dividends.\nGRIL is obligated to maintain a minimum level of statutory capital. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, GRIL met such\nrequirements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, GRIL’s statutory capital was $68.9 million and $65.2 million, respectively. At\nDecember 31, 2022, GRIL’s statutory minimum capital required under Solvency II was approximately $10.5 million (2021:\n$10.6 million). GRIL’s statutory net income (loss) was $4.6 million, $3.8 million and $(2.6) million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The amount of dividends that GRIL is permitted to distribute is limited to its\nretained earnings. The Central Bank of Ireland has powers to intervene if a dividend payment were to breach regulatory capital\nrequirements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, none of GRIL’s capital and surplus was available for distribution as dividends.\nF-40\nLink to Table of Contents\n11. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company has a stock incentive plan for directors, employees, and consultants administered by the Compensation\nCommittee of the Board of Directors.\nEmployee and Director Restricted Shares\nThe restricted shares issued to certain employees contain restrictions relating to vesting, forfeiture in the event of\ntermination of employment, transferability, and other matters.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued to non-employee directors an aggregate of 107,763 (2021:\n74,769, 2020: 71,330) restricted Class A ordinary shares as part of their remuneration for services to the Company. These\nrestricted shares contain similar restrictions to those issued to employees. They will vest on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary\nof the date of the share issuance and (ii) the Company’s next annual general meeting, subject to the grantee’s continued service\nwith the Company. During the vesting period, non-employee directors holding these restricted shares retain voting rights and\nare entitled to any dividends declared by the Company.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued 849,872 (2021: 334,312, 2020: 306,264) Class A ordinary\nshares to employees pursuant to the Company’s stock incentive plan. The restricted shares granted to employees in 2022\ninclude (i) restricted shares with both performance and service-based vesting conditions (“Performance RSs”) and (ii) restricted\nshares with only service-based vesting conditions (“Service RSs”). The Service RSs vest evenly each year on January 1, subject\nto the grantee’s continued service with the Company. If performance goals are achieved, the Performance RSs will cliff vest at\nthe end of a three-year performance period within a range of 25% and 100% of the awarded Performance RSs, with a target of\n50%. During the vesting period, the holder of the Service RSs and Performance RSs retains voting rights but is entitled to any\ndividends declared by the Company only upon vesting.\nPrior to fiscal year 2022, the restricted shares granted to employees cliff vested three years after the date of issuance,\nsubject to the grantee’s continued service with the Company. During the vesting period, the holder of the restricted shares\nretains voting rights and is entitled to any dividends declared by the Company.\nPrior to fiscal year 2021, the Company issued Class A ordinary shares to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) pursuant\nto the Company’s stock incentive plan (“CEO RSs”). These shares contain performance and service conditions and certain\nrestrictions relating to, among other things, vesting, forfeiture in the event of termination of the CEO’s employment, and\ntransferability. The CEO RSs cliff vest five years after the date of issuance, subject to the performance condition being met and\nthe CEO’s continued service with the Company. At December 31, 2022, there were 193,149 non-vested CEO RSs with a\nweighted average grant date fair value of $10.10 per share. As the performance conditions associated with these restricted\nshares have not been met, the Company recognized no compensation cost relating to the unvested CEO RSs for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense associated with Performance RSs and Service RSs based on the fair\nvalue of the Company's Class A ordinary shares measured at the grant date. For Service RSs, the Company recognizes this\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For Performance RSs, the Company recognizes the associated\ncompensation expense based on achieving established performance criteria during the performance period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, grantees forfeited 8,476 (2021: 20,592, 2020: 462,388) restricted shares.

Such RSUs contain restrictions\nrelating to vesting, forfeiture in the event of termination of employment, transferability, and other matters. On the vesting date,\nthe Company converts each RSU into one Class A ordinary share and issues new Class A ordinary shares from the shares\nauthorized for issuance as part of the Company’s stock incentive plan.\nThe RSUs granted to employees in 2022 include (i) RSUs with both performance and service-based vesting conditions\n(“Performance RSUs”) and (ii) RSUs with only service-based vesting conditions (“Service RSUs”). The Service RSUs vest\nevenly each year on January 1, subject to the grantee’s continued service with the Company. If performance goals are achieved,\nthe Performance RSUs will cliff vest at the end of a three-year performance period within a range of 25% and 100% of the\nawarded Performance RSUs, with a target of 50%.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense associated with Performance RSUs and Service RSUs based on the fair\nvalue of the Company's Class A ordinary shares measured at the grant date. For Service RSUs, the Company recognizes this\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For Performance RSUs, the Company recognizes the\nassociated compensation expense based on achieving established performance criteria during the performance period.\nPrior to 2022, the RSUs issued to employees cliff vested three years after the date of issuance, subject to the grantee’s\ncontinued service with the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued 159,215 (2021: 58,123,\n2020: 60,622) RSUs to employees pursuant to the Company’s stock incentive plan.

TAXATION\nEach of the Company and Greenlight Re intends to conduct all of its operations in a manner that will not cause it to be\ntreated as engaging in a trade or business within the United States and will not cause it to be subject to current U.S. federal\nincome taxation on its net income. However, because there are no definitive standards provided by the Internal Revenue Code,\nregulations, or court decisions as to the specific activities that constitute “engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within\nthe United States,” and as any such determination is essentially factual in nature, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not\nsuccessfully assert that the Company or Greenlight Re is engaged in a trade or business within the U.S.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a gross deferred tax asset of $2.8 million (2021: $3.2 million) and a\ndeferred tax asset valuation allowance of $2.3 million (2021: $2.7 million). The net deferred tax asset is included in the caption\n“Other assets” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company has determined that it is more likely than not that it\nwill fully realize the recorded deferred tax asset (net of the valuation allowance) in the future. The Company has based this\ndetermination on the expected timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and the likelihood of generating sufficient\ntaxable income to realize the future tax benefit.\nAt December 31, 2022, GRIL had a net operating loss carryforward of $20.4 million (2021: $25.8 million) which can be\ncarried forward indefinitely.\nF-44\nLink to Table of Contents\nThe following table sets forth our current and deferred income tax benefit (expense) on a consolidated basis for the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n2022 2021 2020\n($ in thousands)\nCurrent tax (expense) benefit $ (671) $ (3,997) $ (48)\nTax recovered 1,487 — —\nDeferred tax (expense) benefit (442) (3) 5\nDecrease (increase) in deferred tax valuation allowance 442 254 (381)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit $ 816 $ (3,746) $ (424)\nFederal Excise Taxes\nThe United States imposes an excise tax on reinsurance premiums paid to non-U.S. insurers or reinsurers with respect to\nrisks located in the United States. Unless exempted or reduced by an applicable U.S. tax treaty, the tax rate is 1.0% for all\nreinsurance premiums. The Company incurs federal excise taxes on certain reinsurance transactions, including amounts ceded\nthrough intercompany transactions. For the years ended 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company incurred approximately $2.4\nmillion, $3.3 million, and $3.6 million, respectively, of federal excise taxes, net of any refunds received. These amounts are\nincluded in the caption “Acquisition costs” in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\n14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nEach of DME, DME II, and DME Advisors is an affiliate of the Chairman and, therefore, is a related party to the\nCompany.\nThe Company has entered into the SILP LPA (as described in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements). DME II\nreceives a performance allocation equal to (with capitalized terms having the meaning provided under the SILP LPA) (a) 10%\nof the portion of the Positive Performance Change for each limited partner’s capital account that is less than or equal to the\npositive balance in such limited partner’s Carryforward Account, plus (b) 20% of the portion of the Positive Performance\nChange for each limited partner’s capital account that exceeds the positive balance in such limited partner’s Carryforward\nAccount. The Carryforward Account for Greenlight Re and GRIL includes the amount of investment losses to be recouped,\nincluding any loss generated on the assets invested in SILP, subject to adjustments for redemptions. The loss carry-forward\nprovision in the SILP LPA allows DME II to earn a reduced performance allocation of 10% of profits in years subsequent to\nany year in which SILP has incurred a loss until all losses are recouped, and an additional amount equal to 150% of the loss is\nearned.\nIn accordance with the SILP LPA, DME Advisors constructs a levered investment portfolio as agreed by the Company\n(the “Investment Portfolio” as defined in the SILP LPA). On September 1, 2018, SILP entered into the IAA with DME\nAdvisors, which entitles DME Advisors to a monthly management fee equal to 0.125% (1.5% on an annual basis) of each\nlimited partner’s Investment Portfolio. The IAA has an initial term ending on August 31, 2023, subject to an automatic\nextension for successive three-year terms.\nFor a detailed breakdown of management fees and performance compensation for the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021, and 2020, refer to Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements.\nPursuant to the SILP LPA and the IAA, the Company has agreed to indemnify DME, DME II, and DME Advisors for\nany expense, loss, liability, or damage arising out of any claim asserted or threatened in connection with DME Advisors serving\nas the Company’s or SILP’s investment advisor. The Company will reimburse DME, DME II, and DME Advisors for\nreasonable costs and expenses of investigating and defending such claims provided such claims were not caused due to gross\nnegligence, breach of contract, or misrepresentation by DME, DME II, or DME Advisors. The Company incurred no\nindemnification amounts during the periods presented.\nF-45\nLink to Table of Contents\nGreen Brick Partners, Inc.\nDavid Einhorn also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Green Brick Partners, Inc.

Under applicable securities laws, DME Advisors may\nsometimes be limited in its ability to trade GRBK shares held in SILP. At December 31, 2022, SILP held 2.7 million shares of\nGRBK.\nService Agreement\nThe Company has entered into a service agreement with DME Advisors, pursuant to which DME Advisors provides\ncertain investor relations services to the Company for compensation of five thousand dollars per month (plus expenses). The\nagreement automatically renews annually until terminated by either the Company or DME Advisors for any reason with 30\ndays prior written notice to the other party.\nCollateral Assets Investment Management Agreement\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company (and its subsidiaries) entered into a collateral assets investment management\nagreement (the “CMA”) with DME Advisors, pursuant to which DME Advisors manages certain assets of the Company that are\nnot subject to the SILP LPA and are held by the Company to provide collateral required by the cedents in the form of trust\naccounts and letters of credit. In accordance with the CMA, DME Advisors receives no fees and is required to comply with the\ncollateral investment guidelines.

At December 31, 2022, the Company had pledged total cash and cash equivalents with a\nfair value in the aggregate of $204.7 million (December 31, 2021: $137.6 million) as collateral against the letters of credit\nissued and included in the caption “Restricted cash and cash equivalents” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The\ncredit facility contains customary events of default and restrictive covenants, including but not limited to limitations on liens on\ncollateral, transactions with affiliates, mergers, and sales of assets, as well as solvency and maintenance of certain minimum\npledged equity requirements. It also restricts the issuance of any debt without the consent of the letter of credit provider.\nAdditionally, if an event of default exists, as defined in the letter of credit facility, Greenlight Re will be prohibited from paying\ndividends to its parent company. The Company was in compliance with all the credit facility covenants at December 31, 2022\nand 2021.\nThe Company has also established regulatory trust arrangements for certain cedents.

At the\ncommencement date, the Company determined the lease term by assuming the exercise of those renewal options deemed\nreasonably certain. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion, and these options do not contain\nany material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company’s weighted-average remaining operating\nlease term is approximately 4.0 years at December 31, 2022.\nF-46\nLink to Table of Contents\nAs the lease contracts generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, the Company used the weighted-average\ndiscount rate of 6.0% to determine the present value of lease payments. This discount rate represents the Company’s\nincremental borrowing rate for a term similar to that of the associated lease based on information available at the\ncommencement date, The Company has made an accounting policy election not to include renewal, termination, or purchase\noptions that are not reasonably certain of exercise when determining the borrowing term.\nAt December 31, 2022, the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities relating to the operating leases were $1.9 million and\n$2.0 million, respectively (2021: $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively).

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE”) was incorporated as an exempted company under the Companies Law of the\nCayman Islands on July 13, 2004. GLRE’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Greenlight Re”), provides\nglobal specialty property and casualty reinsurance. Greenlight Re has a Class D insurer license issued in accordance with the\nterms of The Insurance Act, 2010 (as amended) and underlying regulations thereto (the “Act”) and is subject to regulation by\nthe Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. Greenlight Re commenced underwriting in April 2006. Verdant Holding Company,\nLtd. (“Verdant”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GLRE, was incorporated in 2008 in the state of Delaware. During 2010, GLRE\nestablished Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company (“GRIL”), a wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiary\nbased in Dublin, Ireland. GRIL is authorized as a non-life reinsurance undertaking in accordance with the provisions of the\nEuropean Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015. GRIL provides multi-line property and casualty reinsurance\ncapacity to the European broker market and provides GLRE with an additional platform to serve clients located in Europe and\nNorth America. In 2020, GLRE established Greenlight Re Marketing (UK) Limited (“Greenlight Re UK”) as a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary to increase the Company’s presence in the London market. In 2022, Greenlight Innovation Syndicate 3456\n(“Syndicate 3456”) commenced underwriting under the Lloyd’s syndicate-in-a-box model, with Greenlight Re as the sole\ncapital provider. As used herein, the “Company” refers collectively to GLRE and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe Class A ordinary shares of GLRE are listed on Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE.”\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information, and with the\ninstructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes\nrequired by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In addition, the year-end balance sheet data was derived from\naudited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited\nconsolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2021, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 8, 2022. The condensed consolidated financial\nstatements include the accounts of GLRE and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Greenlight Re, GRIL, Verdant, and Greenlight Re\nUK. The condensed consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of Syndicate 3456. All significant intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.\nCertain amounts in the prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial\nstatements presentation. These reclassifications do not affect previously reported net income or retained earnings.\nIn the opinion of management, these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments\n(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and\nresults of operations as at the end of and for the periods presented.\nSignificant estimates used to prepare the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements, including those\nassociated with premiums and the estimations of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, may be subject to significant\nadjustments in future periods.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in its Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The significant estimates reflected in the Company’s\n7\nReturn to table of contents\ncondensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves,\npremiums written, earned, and receivable, variability underlying risk transfer assessments, allowances for credit losses, share-\nbased compensation, valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets and investment impairments.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Restricted Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments and certificates of deposit with\noriginal maturity dates of three months or less. Certificates of deposit with original maturities greater than three months are\nincluded under the caption \"Other investments\" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances to collateralize regulatory trusts and letters of credit issued to\ncedents (see Note 12). The following table reconciles the cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets to the total presented in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows:\nSeptember 30, 2022 December 31, 2021\n($ in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 32,278 $ 76,307\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents 648,897 634,794\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of cash flows $ 681,175 $ 711,101\nFunds Held by Cedents\nThe caption “Reinsurance balances receivable” in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets includes\nfinancial assets held by cedents. At September 30, 2022, funds held by cedents were $303.1 million (December 31, 2021:\n$246.9 million). Such amounts include premiums withheld by Lloyd’s syndicates and funds contributed by the Company to\nLloyd's as security for members’ underwriting activities. The syndicates invest a portion of the premiums withheld in fixed\nmaturity securities and investment funds. The Company records its share of income (or expense) from these assets in its\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations under the caption “Other income (expense).”\nReinsurance Assets\nThe Company calculates an allowance for expected credit losses for its reinsurance balances receivable and loss and loss\nadjustment expenses recoverable by applying a Probability of Default (“PD”) / Loss Given Default (“LGD”) model. The PD /\nLGD approach considers the Company’s collectibility history on its reinsurance assets and representative external loss history.\nIn calculating the probability of default, the Company also considers the estimated duration of its reinsurance assets.\nThe Company evaluates each counterparty’s creditworthiness based on credit ratings that independent agencies assign to\nthe counterparty. The Company manages its credit risk in its reinsurance assets by transacting only with insurers and reinsurers\nthat it considers financially sound. Credit ratings of the counterparties are forward-looking and consider various economic\nscenarios. The Company's evaluation of the required allowance for reinsurance balances receivable and loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses recoverable considers the current economic environment as well as potential macroeconomic developments.\nFor its retrocessional counterparties that are unrated, the Company may hold collateral in the form of funds withheld,\ntrust accounts, or irrevocable letters of credit. In evaluating credit risk associated with reinsurance balances receivable, the\nCompany considers its right to offset loss obligations against premiums receivable. The Company regularly evaluates its net\ncredit exposure to assess the ability of cedents and retrocessionaires to honor their respective obligations.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company has recorded an allowance for expected credit loss on its Reinsurance Assets of\n$0.1 million (December 31, 2021: $0.1 million).\n8\nReturn to table of contents\nDeposit Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company applies deposit accounting to reinsurance contracts that do not transfer sufficient insurance risk to merit\nreinsurance accounting. Under deposit accounting, the Company recognizes an asset or liability based on its paid or received\nconsideration. The deposit asset or liability balance is subsequently adjusted using the interest method with the corresponding\nincome or expense recorded in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations under the captions “Other\nincome (expense)” and “Deposit interest expense,” respectively. The Company records deposit assets and liabilities in its\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets in the caption “Reinsurance balances receivable” and “Reinsurance balances payable,”\nrespectively. At September 30, 2022, deposit assets and deposit liabilities were $3.2 million and $13.7 million, respectively\n(December 31, 2021: $3.5 million and $18.6 million, respectively). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022,\nand 2021, the interest income and expense on deposit accounted contracts were as follows:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2022 2021 2022 2021\n($ in thousands) ($ in thousands)\nDeposit interest income $ — $ — $ — $ —\nDeposit interest expense $ (6,148) $ (38) $ (6,373) $ (2,957)\nDeposit interest income/(expense), net $ (6,148) $ (38) $ (6,373) $ (2,957)\nForeign Exchange\nThe reporting and functional currency of the Company and all its significant subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The\nCompany records foreign currency transactions at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary assets and\nliabilities in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are converted at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are carried at their historical exchange rates. The\nCompany includes any foreign exchange gains and losses under the caption “Other income (expense), net” in the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, $5.0 million and $10.4 million, respectively, (three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2021: $0.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively), of foreign exchange loss was included in the\nCompany’s net income (loss) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nDerivative instruments\nThe Company recognizes derivative financial instruments in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at their fair\nvalues. It includes any realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized gains and losses in the caption “Net investment\nincome (loss)” in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company’s derivatives do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes. The Company records the\nassociated assets and liabilities in its condensed consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. The Company does not offset\nthese balances against collateral pledged or received.\n9\nReturn to table of contents\nOther Assets\nThe caption “Other assets” in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets consists primarily of prepaid\nexpenses, fixed assets, right-of-use lease assets, other receivables, taxes recoverable, and deferred tax assets.\nOther Liabilities\nThe caption “Other liabilities” in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets consists primarily of accruals\nfor legal and other professional fees, employee bonuses, taxes payable, and lease liabilities.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe Company has issued unvested restricted stock awards, some of which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or\ndividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid. These awards are considered “participating securities” for the purposes of\ncalculating earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of\nordinary shares and participating securities outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (or loss) per share includes the\ndilutive effect, if any, of the following:\n• Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) issued that convert to ordinary shares upon vesting;\n• Unvested restricted share awards which are not considered “participating securities”;\n• Additional potential ordinary shares issuable when in-the-money stock options are exercised, determined using\nthe treasury stock method;\n• For periods prior to January 1, 2022, those ordinary shares with the potential to be issued in connection with\nconvertible notes and other such convertible instruments, determined using the treasury stock method; and\n• Effective January 1, 2022, the dilutive effect of the convertible notes is calculated using the if-converted\nmethod. Under the if-converted method, the convertible notes are assumed to be converted at the beginning of\nthe period, and the resulting common shares are included in the denominator of the diluted net income per\ncommon share calculation. Interest expense related to the convertible notes incurred in the period is added back\nto the numerator for purposes of the if-converted calculation.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the effect of the assumed conversion of the convertible notes\nwas anti-dilutive and was not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\nDiluted earnings (or loss) per share contemplates a conversion to ordinary shares of all convertible instruments only if\nthey are dilutive. In the event of a net loss, all RSUs, stock options, shares potentially issuable in connection with convertible\nnotes, and participating securities are excluded from the calculation of both basic and diluted loss per share as their inclusion\nwould be anti-dilutive.\n10\nReturn to table of contents\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) and weighted average shares used in computing basic and diluted net\nincome (loss) per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (expressed in thousands of U.S.\ndollars, except per share and share amounts):\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nNumerator for earnings per share\nNet income (loss) - basic $ (18,469) $ (13,853) $ (9,408) $ (6,726)\nAdd: interest on convertible notes — — — —\nNet income (loss) - diluted $ (18,469) $ (13,853) $ (9,408) $ (6,726)\nDenominator for earnings per share\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 33,127,384 32,929,097 33,119,814 33,507,060\nEffect of dilutive employee and director share-based awards — — — —\nShares potentially issuable in connection with convertible notes — — — —\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 33,127,384 32,929,097 33,119,814 33,507,060\nAnti-dilutive stock options outstanding 690,337 735,627 690,337 735,627\nParticipating securities excluded from calculation of loss per\nshare 848,841 946,556 848,841 946,556\nShares potentially issuable in connection with convertible notes\nexcluded from calculation of diluted loss per share 5,686,747 — 5,773,889 —\nEarnings (loss) per Class A and Class B Ordinary share:\nBasic $ (0.56) $ (0.42) $ (0.28) $ (0.20)\nDiluted $ (0.56) $ (0.42) $ (0.28) $ (0.20)\nTaxation\nUnder current Cayman Islands law, no corporate entity, including GLRE and Greenlight Re, is obligated to pay taxes in\nthe Cayman Islands on either income or capital gains. The Company has an undertaking from the Governor-in-Cabinet of the\nCayman Islands, pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Concessions Act, as amended, that, in the event that the Cayman Islands\nenacts any legislation that imposes a tax on profits, income, gains, or appreciations, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or\ninheritance tax, such tax will not be applicable to GLRE, Greenlight Re nor their respective operations, or to the Class A or\nClass B ordinary shares or related obligations, before February 1, 2025.\nVerdant is incorporated in Delaware and therefore is subject to taxes in accordance with the U.S. federal rates and\nregulations prescribed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). Verdant’s taxable income is generally expected to be\ntaxed at a marginal rate of 21% (2021: 21%). Verdant’s tax years 2018 and beyond remain open and may be subject to\nexamination by the IRS.\nGRIL is incorporated in Ireland and therefore is subject to the Irish corporation tax rate of 12.5% on its trading income\nand 25% on its non-trading income.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance to the extent that the Company considers it more likely than not that all or a\nportion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future. Other than this valuation allowance, the Company has not\ntaken any income tax positions subject to significant uncertainty that is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the\nCompany.\n11\nReturn to table of contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.\n2022-03 “Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale\nRestrictions.” (“ASU 2022-03”). ASU 2022-03 clarifies the guidance for measuring the fair value of an equity security subject\nto contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security, and introduces new disclosure requirements for equity\nsecurities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value in accordance with Topic 820. ASU 2022-03 is\neffective for public business entities for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect ASU 2022-03 to have a material impact on its\nfinancial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Adopted\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)\nand Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments\nand Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 is designed to simplify the accounting for certain\nfinancial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments. The amendments remove\nthe separation models in Subtopic 470-20 for certain contracts. As a result, entities will no longer present embedded conversion\nfeatures separately in equity; instead, the convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its\namortized cost. ASU 2020-06 also addresses the computation of earnings per share for convertible debt instruments, requiring\nthe application of the if-converted method when calculating diluted earnings per share. Under the if-converted method, the\nshares potentially issuable in connection with convertible debt are assumed to be converted at the beginning of the period. The\nresulting ordinary shares are included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation for the period presented.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2020-06 during the first quarter of 2022, using the “modified retrospective” transition\nmethod. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 resulted in a decrease in the Company’s opening shareholders’ equity of approximately\n$2.5 million, with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the senior convertible notes (see Note 7). The adoption of\nASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the Company’s net income, cash flows, or any other balances.\n3. INVESTMENT IN RELATED PARTY INVESTMENT FUND\nThe Company has entered into the Second Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement (the “SILP\nLPA”) of Solasglas Investments, LP (“SILP”), with DME Advisors II, LLC (“DME II”), as General Partner, Greenlight Re, and\nGRIL, (together, the “GLRE Limited Partners”). SILP has entered into a SILP investment advisory agreement (“IAA”) with\nDME Advisors. LP (“DME Advisors”) pursuant to which DME Advisors is the investment manager for SILP. DME II and\nDME Advisors are related to the Company, and each is an affiliate of David Einhorn, Chairman of the Company’s Board of\nDirectors (the “Chairman”).\nThe SILP LPA includes the following proviso: “The Investment Portfolio of each Partner will not exceed the product of\n(a) such Partner’s surplus (Greenlight Re Surplus or GRIL Surplus, as the case may be) multiplied by (b) the Investment Cap\n(50%), and the General Partner will designate any portion of a Partner’s Investment Portfolio as Designated Securities to\neffectuate such limit.”\nThe Company has concluded that SILP qualifies as a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under U.S. GAAP. In assessing its\ninterest in SILP, the Company noted the following:\n• DME II serves as SILP’s general partner and has the power of appointing the investment manager. The Company does\nnot have the power to appoint, change or replace the investment manager or the general partner except “for cause.”\nNeither of the GLRE Limited Partners can participate in the investment decisions of SILP as long as SILP adheres to\nthe investment guidelines provided within the SILP LPA. For these reasons, the GLRE Limited Partners are not\nconsidered to have substantive participating rights or kick-out rights.\n• DME II holds an interest in excess of 10% of SILP’s net assets, which the Company considers to represent an\nobligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits of SILP that are significant to SILP.\n12\nReturn to table of contents\nConsequently, the Company has concluded that DME II’s interests, not the Company’s, meet both the “power” and\n“benefits” criteria associated with VIE accounting guidance, and therefore DME II is SILP’s primary beneficiary. The\nCompany presents its investment in SILP in its condensed consolidated balance sheets in the caption “Investment in related\nparty investment fund.”\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss relating to SILP is limited to the net asset value of the GLRE Limited\nPartners’ investment in SILP. At September 30, 2022, the net asset value of the GLRE Limited Partners’ investment in SILP\nwas $195.2 million (December 31, 2021: $183.6 million), representing 75.3% (December 31, 2021: 78.2%) of SILP’s total net\nassets. DME II held the remaining 24.7% (December 31, 2021: 21.8%) of SILP’s total net assets. The investment in SILP is\nrecorded at the GLRE Limited Partners’ share of the net asset value of SILP as reported by SILP’s third-party administrator.\nThe GLRE Limited Partners can redeem their assets from SILP for operational purposes by providing three business days’\nnotice to DME II. At September 30, 2022, the majority of SILP’s long investments were composed of cash and publicly traded\nequity securities, which could be readily liquidated to meet the GLRE Limited Partners’ redemption requests.\nThe Company’s share of the change in the net asset value of SILP for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2022, was $8.5 million and $24.5 million, respectively (three and nine months ended September 30, 2021: $(6.2) million and\n$(4.2) million, respectively), and shown in the caption “Income (loss) from investment in related party investment fund” in the\nCompany’s condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nThe summarized financial statements of SILP are presented below.\n13\nReturn to table of contents\nSummarized Statement of Assets and Liabilities of Solasglas Investments, LP\nSeptember 30, 2022 December 31, 2021\n($ in thousands)\nAssets\nInvestments, at fair value $ 258,386 $ 297,937\nDerivative contracts, at fair value 15,727 2,542\nDue from brokers 149,071 84,775\nInterest and dividends receivable 64 28\nTotal assets 423,248 385,282\nLiabilities and partners’ capital\nLiabilities\nInvestments sold short, at fair value (153,892) (132,360)\nDerivative contracts, at fair value (9,739) (7,253)\nCapital withdrawals payable — (10,000)\nDue to brokers (10) —\nInterest and dividends payable (295) (580)\nOther liabilities (201) (358)\nTotal liabilities (164,137) (150,551)\nNet Assets $ 259,111 $ 234,731\nGLRE Limited Partners’ share of Net Assets $ 195,199 $ 183,591\n14\nReturn to table of contents\nSummarized Statement of Operations of Solasglas Investments, LP\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2022 2021 2022 2021\n($ in thousands)\nInvestment income\nDividend income (net of withholding taxes) $ 305 $ 146 $ 928 $ 509\nInterest income 693 51 1,028 770\nTotal Investment income 998 197 1,956 1,279\nExpenses\nManagement fee (901) (883) (2,686) (2,632)\nInterest (464) (205) (1,199) (874)\nDividends (356) (306) (938) (852)\nProfessional fees and other (262) (227) (756) (786)\nTotal expenses (1,983) (1,621) (5,579) (5,144)\nNet investment income (loss) (985) (1,424) (3,623) (3,865)\nRealized and change in unrealized gains\n(losses)\nNet realized gain (loss) 7,221 (1,411) 58,196 (14,809)\nNet change in unrealized appreciation\n(depreciation) 6,464 (5,437) (17,027) 12,143\nNet gain (loss) on investment transactions 13,685 (6,848) 41,169 (2,666)\nNet income (loss) $ 12,700 $ (8,272) $ 37,546 $ (6,531)\nGLRE Limited Partners’ share of net\nincome (loss) (1) $ 8,521 $ (6,214) $ 24,474 $ (4,196)\n(1) Net income (loss) is net of management fees and performance allocation presented below:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2022 2021 2022 2021\n($ in thousands)\nManagement fees $ 901 $ 883 $ 2,686 $ 2,632\nPerformance allocation 947 $ (224) 2,719 —\nTotal $ 1,848 $ 659 $ 5,405 $ 2,632\nSee Note 11 for further details on related party management fees and performance allocation.\n4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nInvestments\nOther Investments\nThe Company’s “Other investments” are composed of the following:\n• Private investments, unlisted equities, and convertible debt instruments, which consist primarily of Innovations-\nrelated investments supporting technology innovators in the (re)insurance market; and\n15\nReturn to table of contents\n• Certificates of deposit with original maturities greater than three months.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company included the following securities in the caption “Other investments”:\nUnrealized Unrealized Fair value /\nCost gains losses carrying value\n($ in thousands)\nPrivate investments and unlisted equities $ 22,037 $ 42,412 $ (3,368) $ 61,081\nConvertible debt securities 1,000 — — 1,000\nCertificates of deposit 3,000 — — 3,000\nTotal other investments $ 26,037 $ 42,412 $ (3,368) $ 65,081\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company included the following securities in the caption “Other investments”:\nUnrealized Unrealized Fair value /\nCost gains losses carrying value\n($ in thousands)\nPrivate investments and unlisted equities $ 17,411 $ 31,438 $ (1,800) $ 47,049\nDerivative financial instruments (not designated\nas hedging instruments) — 335 — 335\nTotal other investments $ 17,411 $ 31,773 $ (1,800) $ 47,384\nPrivate investments and unlisted equity securities without readily determinable fair values\nThe Company measures its private investments and unlisted equity securities without readily determinable fair values at\ncost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from identical or similar investments of the same issuers\n(the “measurement alternative”), with such changes recognized in the caption “Net investment income (loss)” in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. The Company considers the need for impairment on a by-investment basis, based on\ncertain indicators. Under the measurement alternative, the Company makes two types of valuation adjustments:\n• When the Company observes an orderly transaction of an investee’s identical or similar equity securities, the\nCompany adjusts the carrying value based on the observable price as of the transaction date. Once the Company\nrecords such an adjustment, the investment is considered an “asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis.”\n• If the Company determines that the investment is impaired and the fair value is less than its carrying value, it\nwrites down the investment to its fair value. Once the Company records such an adjustment, the investment is\nconsidered an “asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.”\nThe following table presents the carrying values of the private investments and unlisted equity securities carried under\nthe measurement alternative at September 30, 2022, and 2021, and the related adjustments recorded during the periods then\nended.\nNine months ended September 30\n2022 2021\n($ in thousands)\nCarrying value (1) $ 61,081 $ 42,349\nUpward carrying value changes (2) $ 11,260 $ 13,355\nDownward carrying value changes and impairment (3) $ (1,676) $ (500)\n(1) The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value\nchanges.\n(2) The cumulative upward carrying value changes from inception to September 30, 2022, totaled $42.8 million.\n(3) The cumulative downward carrying value changes and impairments from inception to September 30, 2022, totaled $3.7\nmillion.\n16\nReturn to table of contents\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received in an asset sale or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between unaffiliated market participants. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized\nbased on the extent to which the inputs are observable in the market. The categorization of financial instruments within the\nvaluation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is\nprioritized into three levels (with Level 3 being the lowest) defined as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value of the assets\nand liabilities. The term “unobservable inputs” includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, and similar techniques.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nAt September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company held $53.0 million and $40.5 million, respectively, of\nprivate investments and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The Company classifies these assets as\nLevel 3 within the fair value hierarchy. The following table summarizes the periods between the most recent fair value\nmeasurement dates and September 30, 2022, for the private and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:\nLess than 6\nmonths 6 to 12 months Over 1 year Total\n($ in thousands)\nFair values measured on a nonrecurring basis $ 24,451 $ 17,080 $ 11,423 $ 52,954\nAt September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company held $8.1 million and $6.5 million, respectively, of\nprivate investments and unlisted equities measured at cost.\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nIn accordance with ASC 320, “Investments - Debt Securities,” the Company has classified the convertible debt securities\nas “trading” measured at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in net income. The Company classifies\nthese securities as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy and estimates their fair values primarily based on inputs such as third-\nparty quotes, issuers’ book value, market multiples, and other inputs. Valuation of these securities is subjective as the markets’\nilliquidity may increase the likelihood that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an\nactual transaction could occur.\nThe carrying value of certificates of deposit with original maturities of one year or less approximates their fair values.\nThe Company classifies these assets as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nAt September 30, 2022, and December 31, 2021, the Company did not carry any other investments at fair value with an\nassigned Level within the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s investment in the related party investment fund is measured at\nfair value using the net asset value practical expedient. It is therefore not classified within the fair value hierarchy. (See Note 3\nfor further details on the related party investment fund.)\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no transfers between Level 2 and\nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nFinancial Instruments Disclosed, But Not Carried, at Fair Value\nThe caption “Convertible senior notes payable” represents financial instruments that the Company carries at amortized\ncost. The fair value of the convertible senior notes payable is estimated based on the bid price observed in an inactive market\nfor the identical instrument (Level 2 input) (see Note 7).\n17\nReturn to table of contents\n5. LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company’s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves included estimated amounts for\nseveral catastrophe events. For significant catastrophe events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornados, typhoons,\nfloods, earthquakes, wildfires, and pandemics, loss reserves are generally established based on loss payments and case reserves\nreported by clients when received. To establish IBNR loss estimates, the Company makes use of, among other things, the\nfollowing information:\n• estimates communicated by ceding companies;\n• information received from clients, brokers, and loss adjusters;\n• an understanding of the underlying business written and its exposures to catastrophe event-related losses;\n• industry data;\n• catastrophe scenario modeling software; and\n• management’s judgment.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company’s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves included $13.6 million from the\nRussian-Ukrainian conflict and $19.5 million from Hurricane Ian. Additional information the Company considered in\nestimating its loss reserves included the following:\n• a review of in-force treaties that may provide coverage and incur losses;\n• catastrophe and scenario modeling analyses and results shared by cedents;\n• preliminary loss estimates received from clients, brokers, and loss adjusters;\n• reviews of industry insured loss estimates and market share analyses; and\n• management’s judgment.\nThe Company’s Russian-Ukrainian conflict loss estimates include actuarial assumptions, including:\n• the areas within the affected regions that have incurred losses;\n• the scope of coverage provided by the underlying policies;\n• the interpretation of contract terms;\n• the determination of loss-triggering events;\n• regulatory, legislative, and judicial actions that could influence contract interpretations across the insurance industry;\nand\n• the ability of the cedents and insured to mitigate some or all of their losses.\nDue to the uncertainty associated with the foregoing assumptions, the Company’s loss estimates are subject to significant\nvariability, and actual losses may ultimately differ materially from the Company's current estimates. The Company will\nevaluate its assumptions as new information becomes available and may adjust its loss estimates in future periods. Such\nadjustments may be material to the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, if the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is prolonged, the Company may incur additional losses in subsequent\nperiods.\nThe Company made no significant changes in the actuarial methodology or reserving process related to its loss and loss\nadjustment expense reserves for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nAt September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were composed of the\nfollowing:\nSeptember 30, 2022 December 31, 2021\n($ in thousands)\nCase reserves $ 186,945 $ 190,220\nIBNR 353,882 333,790\nTotal $ 540,827 $ 524,010\n18\nReturn to table of contents\nA summary of changes in outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for all lines of business consolidated for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nConsolidated 2022 2021\n($ in thousands)\nGross balance at January 1 $ 524,010 $ 494,179\nLess: Losses recoverable (11,100) (16,851)\nNet balance at January 1 512,910 477,328\nIncurred losses related to:\nCurrent year 251,231 296,333\nPrior years 1,558 (1,255)\nTotal incurred 252,789 295,078\nPaid losses related to:\nCurrent year (54,866) (96,442)\nPrior years (160,094) (146,545)\nTotal paid (214,960) (242,987)\nForeign currency revaluation (20,516) (1,722)\nNet balance at September 30 530,223 527,697\nAdd: Losses recoverable 10,604 13,082\nGross balance at September 30 $ 540,827 $ 540,779\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the estimate of net losses incurred relating to prior accident years\nincreased by $1.6 million, primarily due to the following:\n• adverse development on motor and health business driven by the inflationary increase in claims costs;\n• adverse development on a multi-line quota share program resulting from newly reported losses received from the\ncedent;\n• newly reported claims received relating to excess of loss marine and energy contracts; and\n• claims deterioration on a cyber contract.\nThe adverse developments were partially offset by favorable developments relating to prior accident years primarily due\nto the following:\n• favorable experience on mortgage business;\n• loss reserves released relating to catastrophe events and COVID-19 based on updated claims reporting received from\ncedents; and\n• loss reserves released on an excess of loss workers’ compensation contract.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the estimate of net losses incurred relating to prior accident years\ndecreased by $1.3 million due primarily to favorable development on catastrophe events, a mortgage contract associated with\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, and certain health contracts. The decrease in prior accident years was partially offset by adverse loss\ndevelopment on certain workers’ compensation and multi-line casualty contracts written between 2014 and 2018.\n19\nReturn to table of contents\nThe changes in the outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for health claims for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nHealth 2022 2021\n($ in thousands)\nGross balance at January 1 $ 9,938 $ 17,485\nLess: Losses recoverable — —\nNet balance at January 1 9,938 17,485\nIncurred losses related to:\nCurrent year 6,567 31,189\nPrior years 3,552 (1,898)\nTotal incurred 10,119 29,291\nPaid losses related to:\nCurrent year (3,051) (20,224)\nPrior years (11,146) (13,824)\nTotal paid (14,197) (34,048)\nForeign currency revaluation — —\nNet balance at September 30 5,860 12,728\nAdd: Losses recoverable — —\nGross balance at September 30 $ 5,860 $ 12,728\n6. RETROCESSION\nFrom time to time, the Company purchases retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to\nmanage its overall exposure, reduce its net liability on individual risks, obtain additional underwriting capacity and balance its\nunderwriting portfolio. The Company records loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable from retrocessionaires as assets.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company’s earned ceded premiums were $4.4 million and\n$8.4 million, respectively (insignificant for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021). For the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022, loss and loss adjustment expenses recovered and changes in losses recoverable were $2.5\nmillion and $2.5 million, respectively. The recoveries recognized by the Company for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021, were nil and $0.1 million, respectively.\nRetrocession contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to its cedents. Failure of retrocessionaires to\nhonor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. At September 30, 2022, the Company’s loss reserves recoverable\nconsisted of (i) $7.9 million (December 31, 2021: $8.4 million) recoverable from unrated retrocessionaires, of which $6.9\nmillion (December 31, 2021: $8.2 million) were secured by cash, letters of credit and collateral held in trust accounts for the\nbenefit of the Company and (ii) $2.7 million (December 31, 2021: $2.8 million) recoverable from retrocessionaires rated A- or\nabove by A.M. Best.\nThe Company regularly evaluates its net credit exposure to assess the ability of the retrocessionaires to honor their\nrespective obligations. At September 30, 2022, the Company had recorded an allowance for expected credit losses of $47\nthousand (December 31, 2021: $47 thousand).\n7. SENIOR CONVERTIBLE NOTES\nOn August 7, 2018, the Company issued $100.0 million of senior unsecured convertible notes (the “Notes”), which\nmature on August 1, 2023. The Notes bear interest at 4.0%, payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year\nbeginning February 1, 2019.\nNote holders have the option, under certain conditions, to redeem the Notes prior to maturity. At September 30, 2022, the\nCompany’s share price was lower than the conversion price of $17.19 per share.\n20\nReturn to table of contents\nIf a holder redeems the Notes, the Company shall have the option to settle the conversion obligation in cash, ordinary\nshares of the Company, or a combination thereof pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Notes. Prior to January 1,\n2022, the Company bifurcated the Notes into liability and equity components. Effective January 1, 2022, upon adoption of ASU\n2020-06, the Company no longer bifurcates the Notes and presents the entire balance as a single liability on the Company’s\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets (see Note 2 for recently issued accounting standards adopted).\nThe Company’s effective borrowing rate for non-convertible debt at the time of issuance of the Notes was estimated to\nbe 6.0%. The Company incurred issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the Notes. At September 30, 2022, the\nunamortized portion of these costs was $0.6 million (December 31, 2021: $1.0 million), which the Company expects to\namortize through the maturity date.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 the Company repurchased and canceled $6.6 million of the\nNotes. The carrying value of the Notes at September 30, 2022, including accrued interest of $0.6 million, was $93.4 million\n(December 31, 2021: $98.1 million). At September 30, 2022, the Company estimated the fair value of the Notes to be $90.2\nmillion (December 31, 2021: $97.5 million) (see Note 4 Financial Instruments).\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized interest expenses of $1.1 million and\n$3.4 million, respectively (three and nine months ended September 30, 2021: $1.6 million and $4.7 million, respectively).\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants relating to the Notes at September 30, 2022, and December 31,\n2021. At September 30, 2022, the Company had a remaining obligation for interest and principal payments of nil and $97.2\nmillion during 2022 and 2023, respectively.\nSubsequent to September 30, 2022, the Company repurchased and canceled $13.8 million of the Notes.\n8. SHARE CAPITAL\nThe Company’s share capital is made up of ordinary share capital and additional paid-in capital. Ordinary share capital\nrepresents the issued and outstanding Class A and Class B ordinary shares at their par values of $0.10 per share. Additional\npaid-in capital includes the premium paid per share by the subscribing shareholders for Class A and Class B ordinary shares, as\nwell as the earned portion of the grant-date fair value of share-based awards.\nOn October 29, 2020, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the stock incentive plan to increase the\nnumber of Class A ordinary shares available for issuance by 3.0 million shares from 5.0 million to 8.0 million. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, 2,011,426 (December 31, 2021: 3,128,276) Class A ordinary shares remained available for future issuance\nunder the Company’s stock incentive plan. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the stock\nincentive plan.\nThe Board has adopted a share repurchase plan. The timing of such repurchases and the actual number of shares\nrepurchased will depend on various factors, including price, market conditions, and applicable regulatory and corporate\nrequirements. The Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase plan, which expires on June 30, 2023, authorizing the\nCompany to repurchase up to $25.0 million of Class A ordinary shares or securities convertible into Class A ordinary shares in\nthe open market, through privately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans. The Company is not required to\nrepurchase any of the Class A ordinary shares. The repurchase plan may be modified, suspended, or terminated at the election\nof our Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nThe Company repurchased 4,933 Class A ordinary shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. All Class A\nordinary shares repurchased are canceled immediately upon repurchase.\n21\nReturn to table of contents\nThe following table is a summary of ordinary shares issued and outstanding:\nNine months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2022 2021\nClass A Class B Class A Class B\nBalance – beginning of period 27,589,731 6,254,715 28,260,075 6,254,715\nIssue of ordinary shares, net of forfeitures 984,548 — 409,200 —\nRepurchase of ordinary shares (4,933) — (1,079,544) —\nBalance – end of period 28,569,346 6,254,715 27,589,731 6,254,715\nAdditional paid-in capital includes the premium per share paid by the subscribing shareholders for Class A and B\nordinary shares, which have a par value of $0.10 each. It also includes the earned portion of the grant-date fair value of share-\nbased awards that have not yet vested.\n9. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company has a stock incentive plan for directors, employees, and consultants administered by the Compensation\nCommittee of the Board of Directors.\nEmployee and Director Restricted Shares\nThe restricted shares issued to certain employees contain restrictions relating to vesting, forfeiture in the event of\ntermination of employment, transferability, and other matters.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued to non-employee directors an aggregate of 107,763\n(2021: 74,769) restricted Class A ordinary shares as part of their remuneration for services to the Company. These restricted\nshares contain similar restrictions to those issued to employees. They will vest on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the\ndate of the share issuance and (ii) the Company’s next annual general meeting, subject to the grantee’s continued service with\nthe Company. During the vesting period, non-employee directors holding these restricted shares retain voting rights and are\nentitled to any dividends declared by the Company.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued 849,872 (2021: 334,312) Class A ordinary shares to\nemployees pursuant to the Company’s stock incentive plan. The restricted shares granted to employees in 2022 include (i)\nrestricted shares with both performance and service-based vesting conditions (“Performance RSs”) and (ii) restricted shares\nwith only service-based vesting conditions (“Service RSs”). The Service RSs vest evenly each year on January 1, subject to the\ngrantee’s continued service with the Company. If performance goals are achieved, the Performance RSs will cliff vest at the end\nof a three-year performance period within a range of 25% and 100% of the awarded Performance RSs, with a target of 50%.\nDuring the vesting period, the holder of the Service RSs and Performance RSs retains voting rights but is entitled to any\ndividends declared by the Company only upon vesting.\nPrior to fiscal year 2022, the restricted shares granted to employees cliff vested three years after the date of issuance,\nsubject to the grantee’s continued service with the Company. During the vesting period, the holder of the restricted shares\nretained voting rights and are entitled to any dividends declared by the Company.\nPrior to fiscal year 2021, the Company issued Class A ordinary shares to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) pursuant\nto the Company’s stock incentive plan (“CEO RSs”). These shares contain performance and service conditions and certain\nrestrictions relating to, among other things, vesting, forfeiture in the event of termination of the CEO’s employment, and\ntransferability. The CEO RSs cliff vest five years after the date of issuance, subject to the performance condition being met and\nthe CEO’s continued service with the Company. At September 30, 2022, there were 193,149 non-vested CEO RSs with a\nweighted average grant date fair value of $10.10 per share. As the performance conditions associated with these restricted\nshares have not been met, the Company recognized no compensation cost relating to the unvested shares for the nine months\nended September 30, 2022, and 2021.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense associated with Performance RSs and Service RSs based on the fair\nvalue of the Company's Class A ordinary shares measured at the grant date. For Service RSs, the Company recognizes this\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For Performance RSs, the Company recognizes the associated\ncompensation expense based on achieving established performance criteria during the performance period.\n22\nReturn to table of contents\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2022, grantees forfeited 8,476 (2021: 20,592) restricted shares.

Such RSUs contain restrictions\nrelating to vesting, forfeiture in the event of termination of employment, transferability, and other matters. On the vesting date,\nthe Company converts each RSU into one Class A ordinary share and issues new Class A ordinary shares from the shares\nauthorized for issuance as part of the Company’s stock incentive plan.\nThe RSUs granted to employees in 2022 include (i) RSUs with both performance and service-based vesting conditions\n(“Performance RSUs”) and (ii) RSUs with only service-based vesting conditions (“Service RSUs”).

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nDME, DME II, and DME Advisors are each an affiliate of the Chairman and therefore are related parties to the\nCompany.\nThe Company has entered into the SILP LPA (as described in Note 3 of the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements). DME II receives a performance allocation equal to (with capitalized terms having the meaning provided under the\nSILP LPA) (a) 10% of the portion of the Positive Performance Change for each limited partner’s capital account that is less\nthan or equal to the positive balance in such limited partner’s Carryforward Account, plus (b) 20% of the portion of the Positive\nPerformance Change for each limited partner’s capital account that exceeds the positive balance in such limited partner’s\nCarryforward Account. The Carryforward Account for Greenlight Re and GRIL includes the amount of investment losses to be\nrecouped, including any loss generated on the assets invested in SILP, subject to adjustments for redemptions. The loss carry-\nforward provision in the SILP LPA allows DME II to earn a reduced performance allocation of 10% of profits in years\nsubsequent to any year in which SILP has incurred a loss until all losses are recouped, and an additional amount equal to 150%\nof the loss is earned.\nIn accordance with the SILP LPA, DME Advisors constructs a levered investment portfolio as agreed by the Company\n(the “Investment Portfolio”, as defined in the SILP LPA). On September 1, 2018, SILP entered into the IAA with DME\nAdvisors, which entitles DME Advisors to a monthly management fee equal to 0.125% (1.5% on an annual basis) of each\nlimited partner’s Investment Portfolio. The IAA has an initial term ending on August 31, 2023, subject to an automatic\nextension for successive three-year terms.\nFor a detailed breakdown of management fees and performance compensation for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, and 2021, refer to Note 3 of the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nPursuant to the SILP LPA and the IAA, the Company has agreed to indemnify DME, DME II, and DME Advisors for\nany expense, loss, liability, or damage arising out of any claim asserted or threatened in connection with DME Advisors serving\nas the Company’s or SILP’s investment advisor. The Company will reimburse DME, DME II, and DME Advisors for\nreasonable costs and expenses of investigating and defending such claims, provided such claims were not caused due to gross\nnegligence, breach of contract, or misrepresentation by DME, DME II, or DME Advisors. The Company incurred no\nindemnification amounts during the periods presented.\nGreen Brick Partners, Inc.\nDavid Einhorn also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Green Brick Partners, Inc. (“GRBK”), a\npublicly-traded company. At September 30, 2022, SILP, along with certain affiliates of DME Advisors, collectively owned\n38% of the issued and outstanding common shares of GRBK. Under applicable securities laws, DME Advisors may sometimes\nbe limited in its ability to trade GRBK shares held in SILP. At September 30, 2022, SILP held 2.7 million shares of GRBK.\n25\nReturn to table of contents\nService Agreement\nThe Company has entered into a service agreement with DME Advisors, pursuant to which DME Advisors provides\ncertain investor relations services to the Company for compensation of five thousand dollars per month (plus expenses). The\nagreement automatically renews annually until terminated by either the Company or DME Advisors for any reason with 30\ndays prior written notice to the other party.\nCollateral Assets Investment Management Agreement\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company (and its subsidiaries) entered into a collateral assets investment management\nagreement (the “CMA”) with DME Advisors, pursuant to which DME Advisors manages certain assets of the Company that are\nnot subject to the SILP LPA and are held by the Company to provide collateral required by the cedents in the form of trust\naccounts and letters of credit. In accordance with the CMA, DME Advisors receives no fees and is required to comply with the\ncollateral investment guidelines. The CMA can be terminated by any of the parties upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the\nother parties.\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLetters of Credit and Trusts\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company had one letter of credit facility, which automatically renews each year unless\nterminated by either party in accordance with the applicable required notice period:\nMaximum Termination Notice period required for\nFacility Limit Date termination\n($ in thousands)\nCitibank Europe plc $ 275,000 August 20, 2023 120 days before the termination date\nAt September 30, 2022, an aggregate amount of $180.2 million (December 31, 2021: $136.8 million) in letters of credit\nwas issued under the credit facility.

The credit facility contains customary events of default and restrictive covenants, including but not limited to limitations\non liens on collateral, transactions with affiliates, mergers, and sales of assets, as well as solvency and maintenance of certain\nminimum pledged equity requirements and restricts issuance of any debt without the consent of the letter of credit provider.\nAdditionally, if an event of default exists, as defined in the letter of credit facility, Greenlight Re will be prohibited from paying\ndividends to its parent company. The Company was in compliance with all the credit facility covenants at September 30, 2022\nand December 31, 2021.\nThe Company has also established regulatory trust arrangements for certain cedents. At September 30, 2022, collateral of\n$468.0 million (December 31, 2021: $497.1 million) was provided to cedents in the form of regulatory trust accounts and\nincluded in the caption “Restricted cash and cash equivalents” in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nLease Obligations\nThe Company has determined that its lease agreements for office space qualify as operating lease arrangements. At the\ncommencement date, the Company determined the lease term by assuming the exercise of those renewal options deemed to be\nreasonably certain. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company's sole discretion, and these options do not contain\nany material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company’s weighted-average remaining operating\nlease term is approximately 4.0 years at September 30, 2022.\nAs the lease contracts generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, the Company used the weighted-average\ndiscount rate of 6%, representing its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date, to\ndetermine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on a borrowing with a term similar to\nthat of the associated lease. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to include renewal, termination, or\npurchase options that are not reasonably certain of exercise when determining the term of the borrowing.\n26\nReturn to table of contents\nAt September 30, 2022, the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities relating to the operating leases were $2.0 million and\n$2.1 million, respectively. The operating expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, was $0.2 million\nand $0.5 million, respectively (three and nine months ended September 30, 2021: $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively).\nAt September 30, 2022, the commitment for operating lease liabilities for future annual periods was as follows:\nYear ending December 31, ($ in thousands)\n2022 $ 149\n2023 611\n2024 627\n2025 644\n2026 345\nThereafter —\nTotal lease payments 2,376\nLess Imputed Interest (280)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,096\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may be involved in formal and informal dispute\nresolution procedures, which may include arbitration or litigation. The outcomes of these procedures determine the rights and\nobligations under the Company’s reinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, the Company may\nseek to enforce its rights under an agreement or collect funds owed. In other matters, the Company may resist attempts by\nothers to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of legal disputes with certainty,\nthe Company does not believe that any existing dispute, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, or operating results.\n27\nReturn to table of contents\n13.

These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,”\n“project,” “predict,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will\ncontinue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and\nassumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-\nlooking statements. We have included a detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events\nto differ materially from such forward-looking statements in the section entitled “Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our\nForm 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on\nMay 3, 2022, and in the section entitled “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” contained in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2022. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n• A downgrade or withdrawal of either of our A.M. Best ratings would materially and adversely affect our ability to\nimplement our business strategy successfully;\n• Our results of operations will likely fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term\nprospects;\n• Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by the ongoing conflict between Russia\nand Ukraine and related disruptions in the global economy;\n• The impact of COVID-19 and related risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial\nposition, and liquidity;\n• SILP may be concentrated in a few large positions, which could result in investment volatility;\n• The performance of our Innovations investments could result in financial losses and reduce our capital;\n• If our losses and loss adjustment expenses greatly exceed our loss reserves, our financial condition may be materially\nand adversely affected;\n• Inflation may adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition;\n• The effect of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business is uncertain;\n• The property and casualty reinsurance market may be affected by cyclical trends; and\n• The loss of key executives could adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new\ninformation, future events, or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements,\nwhich speak only to the dates they were made.\nWe intend to communicate certain events that we believe may have a material adverse impact on our operations or\nfinancial position, including property and casualty catastrophic events and material losses in our investment portfolio, in a\ntimely manner through a public announcement. Other than as required by the Exchange Act, we do not intend to make public\nannouncements regarding reinsurance or investment events that we do not believe, based on management’s estimates and\ncurrent information, will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.\n29\nReturn to table of contents\nGeneral\nWe are a global specialty property and casualty reinsurer headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with a reinsurance and\ninvestment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. Our goal is to build long-term shareholder\nvalue by providing risk management solutions to the insurance, reinsurance, and other risk marketplaces. We focus on\ndelivering risk solutions to clients and brokers who value our expertise, analytics, and customer service offerings.\nWe aim to complement our underwriting activities with a non-traditional investment approach designed to achieve\nhigher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that exclusively employ more traditional investment\nstrategies. Our investment portfolio is managed according to a value-oriented philosophy, in which our investment advisor takes\nlong positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities.\nThrough Greenlight Re Innovations, we support technology innovators in the (re)insurance market by providing\ninvestment capital, risk capacity, and access to a broad insurance network.\nBecause we seek to capitalize on favorable market conditions and opportunities, period-to-period comparisons of our\nunderwriting results may not be meaningful. Also, our historical investment results are not necessarily indicative of future\nperformance. Due to the nature of our reinsurance and investment strategies, our operating results will likely fluctuate from\nperiod to period.\nThe Company’s subsidiaries hold an A.M. Best Financial Strength Rating of A- (Excellent) with a stable outlook.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective and have\nrequired management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including those\ndescribed in “Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as filed\nwith the SEC on May 3, 2022, and in “Part I. Item IA. — Risk Factors” included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2022, cause actual events or results to differ materially from our\nunderlying assumptions or estimates. In that case, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial\ncondition, or liquidity. “Part II. Item 7. — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results on\nOperations” included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, describes our critical\naccounting policies and estimates. The most significant estimates relate to premium revenues and risk transfer, loss and loss\nadjustment expense reserves, investment impairments, allowances for credit losses, and share-based compensation.\nRecently issued and adopted accounting standards and their impact on the Company, if any, are presented under\n“Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nSegments\nWe have one operating segment, Property & Casualty reinsurance, and we analyze our business based on the following\ncategories:\n● Property\n● Casualty\n● Other\nProperty business covers automobile physical damage, personal lines, and commercial lines exposures. Property\nbusiness includes both catastrophe and non-catastrophe coverage. We expect catastrophe business to make up a small\nproportion of our property business.\nCasualty business covers general liability, motor liability, professional liability, and workers’ compensation exposures.\nThe Company’s multi-line business relates predominantly to casualty reinsurance, and as such, the Company includes all multi-\nline business within the casualty category. Casualty business generally has losses reported and paid over a longer period than\nproperty business. We categorize Lloyd’s syndicate contracts, which incorporate incidental catastrophe exposure, as multi-line\n(and therefore casualty) business.\n30\nReturn to table of contents\nOther business covers accident and health, financial lines (including transactional liability, mortgage insurance, surety,\nand trade credit), marine, energy, as well as other specialty business such as aviation, crop, cyber, political, and terrorism\nexposures.\nOutlook and Trends\nWe operate in a business where we expect volatility in our underwriting results. Hurricane Ian, which struck the\nsoutheast U.S. in September, 2022, is likely to prove one of the costliest natural disasters ever in terms of insured losses. This\nstorm, along with the Russian-Ukraine conflict and several smaller events, have combined to make the first nine months of\n2022 another challenging period for companies that participate in the global reinsurance market. We were not immune from\nthese events; our combined ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, was 104.8%.\nFurther, the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict has resulted in the U.S., United Kingdom, European Union, and other\ncountries imposing financial and economic sanctions, which have caused disruption in the global economy and have increased\neconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. If this conflict is prolonged, we and other reinsurers may incur additional losses in\nfuture periods.\nThe continuing widespread inflation is a significant concern to the industry, as it can add uncertainty to the cost of\nclaims, particularly for classes of business with long payout tails. As a result, it creates pricing challenges for new business and\nvaluation challenges in claims reserves. We are addressing these concerns in multiple ways:\n• Our underwriting strategy focuses on relatively short-tailed business, which is inherently less exposed to high inflation\nthan long-tailed lines. We estimate the payout duration of our existing reserves at approximately two years.\n• We incorporate inflation assumptions in all our pricing, and reassess these assumptions frequently.\n• We are minimizing our exposure to classes that are experiencing severe supply-chain-driven inflation.\nWe expect that the rising interest rate environment will have a mixed impact on our financial results. While we have\nsome exposure to interest rate risk from fixed income securities held by the Lloyd’s syndicates in which we participate, we\nexpect that the higher interest rates will improve the yield on our restricted cash and cash equivalents.\nThe combination of the recent loss events, continued inflation and rising interest rates have led to a significant\nreduction in the amount of reinsurance capital available for deployment. As we approach the January 1 renewal season, we see\nmarket conditions that we consider more favorable than any we have experienced in more than a decade.\nAdditionally, we continue to be encouraged by our Innovations unit, whose central objective is to enhance our\nunderwriting return and risk profile by establishing a range of strategic partnerships. Our Innovations-related premiums\naccounted for approximately 12% of our net premiums written in the first nine months of 2022. We see the potential for\nsignificant growth from Innovations-derived underwriting opportunities going forward.\nKey Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement uses certain key financial measures, some of which are not prescribed under U.S. GAAP rules and\nstandards (“non-GAAP financial measures”), to evaluate our financial performance, financial position, and the change in\nshareholder value. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in SEC Regulation G, is a numerical measure of a\ncompany’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts\nthat are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented under U.S. GAAP.\nWe believe that these measures, which may be calculated or defined differently by other companies, provide consistent and\ncomparable metrics of our business performance to help shareholders understand performance trends and facilitate a more\nthorough understanding of the Company’s business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for\nthose determined under U.S. GAAP.\nThe key non-GAAP financial measures used in this report are:\n• Basic book value per share and fully diluted book value per share; and\n• Net underwriting income (loss)\nThese non-GAAP measures are described below.\n31\nReturn to table of contents\nBasic Book Value Per Share and Fully Diluted Book Value Per Share\nWe believe that long-term growth in fully diluted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial\nperformance because it provides management and investors a yardstick to monitor the shareholder value generated. Fully\ndiluted book value per share may also help our investors, shareholders, and other interested parties form a basis of comparison\nwith other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry. Basic book value per share and fully diluted book\nvalue per share should not be viewed as substitutes for the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nWe calculate basic book value per share as (a) ending shareholders' equity, divided by (b) aggregate of Class A and\nClass B Ordinary shares issued and outstanding, including all unvested service-based restricted shares, and the earned portion\nof performance-based restricted shares granted after December 31, 2021. We exclude shares potentially issuable in connection\nwith convertible notes if the conversion price exceeds the share price.\nFully diluted book value per share represents basic book value per share combined with any dilutive impact of in-the-\nmoney stock options, unvested service-based RSUs, and the earned portion of unvested performance-based RSUs granted. Fully\ndiluted book value per share also includes the dilutive effect, if any, of ordinary shares expected to be issued upon settlement of\nthe convertible notes.\nOur primary financial goal is to increase fully diluted book value per share over the long term. We use fully diluted\nbook value per share as a financial measure in our annual incentive compensation.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures basic and fully diluted book value\nper share to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure:\nSeptember 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30,\n2022 2022 2022 2021 2021\n($ in thousands, except per share and share amounts)\nNumerator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share:\nTotal equity (U.S. GAAP) (numerator for\nbasic and fully diluted book value per share) $ 466,952 $ 484,293 $ 468,407 $ 475,663 $ 450,514\nDenominator for basic and fully diluted\nbook value per share: (1)\nOrdinary shares issued and outstanding as\npresented in the Company’s condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets 34,824,061 34,721,231 34,721,231 33,844,446 33,844,446\nLess: Unearned performance-based\nrestricted shares granted after December 31,\n2021 (539,161) (560,927) (581,593) — —\nDenominator for basic book value per share 34,284,900 34,160,304 34,139,638 33,844,446 33,844,446\nAdd: In-the-money stock options, service-\nbased RSUs granted, and earned\nperformance-based RSUs granted 183,790 179,988 176,379 154,134 154,134\nDenominator for fully diluted book value\nper share 34,468,690 34,340,292 34,316,017 33,998,580 33,998,580\nBasic book value per share $ 13.62 $ 14.18 $ 13.72 $ 14.05 $ 13.31\nIncrease (decrease) in basic book value per\nshare ($) $ (0.56) $ 0.46 $ (0.33) $ 0.58 $ (0.35)\nIncrease (decrease) in basic book value per\nshare (%) (3.9) % 3.4 % (2.3) % 4.3 % (2.6) %\nFully diluted book value per share $ 13.55 $ 14.10 $ 13.65 $ 13.99 $ 13.25\nIncrease (decrease) in fully diluted book\nvalue per share ($) $ (0.55) $ 0.45 $ (0.34) $ 0.57 $ (0.35)\nIncrease (decrease) in fully diluted book\nvalue per share (%) (3.9) % 3.3 % (2.4) % 4.2 % (2.6) %\n32\nReturn to table of contents\n(1) For periods prior to January 1, 2022, all unvested restricted shares are included in the “basic” and “fully diluted”\ndenominators. Restricted shares with performance-based vesting conditions granted after December 31, 2021, are included in\nthe “basic” and “fully diluted” denominators to the extent that the Company has recognized the corresponding share-based\ncompensation expense. At September 30, 2022, the aggregate number of unearned restricted shares with performance\nconditions not included in the “basic” and “fully diluted” denominators was 732,310 (June 30, 2022: 754,076, March 31, 2022:\n774,742, December 31, 2021: 193,149, September 30, 2021: 193,149).\nNet Underwriting Income (Loss)\nOne way that we evaluate the Company’s underwriting performance is by measuring net underwriting income (loss). We\ndo not use premiums written as a measure of performance. Net underwriting income (loss) is a performance measure used by\nmanagement to evaluate the fundamentals underlying the Company’s underwriting operations. We believe that the use of net\nunderwriting income (loss) enables investors and other users of the Company’s financial information to analyze our\nperformance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. Management also believes that this measure\nfollows industry practice and allows the users of financial information to compare the Company’s performance with that of our\nindustry peer group.\nNet underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used to calculate\nnet income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. We calculate net underwriting income (loss) as net premiums earned, plus other\nincome relating to reinsurance and deposit-accounted contracts, less deposit interest expense, less net loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses, acquisition costs, and underwriting expenses. The measure excludes, on a recurring basis: (1) investment income\n(loss); (2) other income (expense) not related to underwriting, including foreign exchange gains or losses, Lloyd’s interest\nincome or expense and adjustments to the allowance for expected credit losses; (3) corporate general and administrative\nexpenses; and (4) interest expense.

This\nunderwriting loss included $19.5 million of losses estimated from Hurricane Ian and $3.2 million from Typhoons\nNanmadol and Hinnamnor. By comparison, the equivalent period in 2021 reported an underwriting loss of $12.6\nmillion, which included $25.9 million of catastrophe losses from Hurricane Ida, the European floods and\nhailstorms, and South African riots. The underwriting loss for the three months ended September 30, 2022, also\nincluded $6.1 million of expense relating to deposit-accounted contracts.\nOur combined ratio was 115.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2022, compared to 109.3% during the\nequivalent 2021 period.

The weakening of the pound sterling\nagainst the U.S. dollar drove the foreign exchange loss. In addition, the other income (expense) included our share\nof Lloyd’s syndicates’ investment losses on the Funds at Lloyd’s business, which is generally conducted on a\nfunds withheld basis.

During the 2022 period, a higher proportion of the property business we\nwrote related to excess of loss contracts, which incorporate lower commissions than the\nquota share contracts that comprised a larger proportion of the business we wrote during\nthe third quarter of 2021.\nCasualty 5.5 The increase in the casualty acquisition cost ratio during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, over the comparable 2021 period, was due primarily to changes in\nour business mix. Our motor and workers’ compensation premium, which decreased in\n2022, generally incorporates lower ceding commission ratios than our general liability and\nmulti-line business, which grew compared to the equivalent 2021 period.\nOther 3.4 The increase in the “other” acquisition cost ratio during the three months ended September\n30, 2022, over the comparable 2021 period was due primarily to the following:\n• growth in transactional liability business, which carries higher ceding\ncommission ratios than other specialty business; and\n• new specialty quota share contracts bound in 2022, which incorporate relatively\nhigh acquisition costs.\nThe changes in the acquisition cost ratios during the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to the\nequivalent period in 2021, were attributable to the following:\nChange in Acquisition Cost Ratios\nNine months ended September 30, 2022\nIncrease / (decrease)\nin acquisition cost Explanation\nratio points\nProperty 1.4 The year-to-date increase was driven by the higher ceding commissions on the growing\npersonal property quota share contracts relative to the shrinking motor business.\nCasualty 2.7 The year-to-date increase was driven by the same trends as those discussed above in\nreference to the third quarter.\nOther 5.2 The year-to-date increase was driven by the same trends as those discussed above in\nreference to the third quarter.

The increase was due primarily to higher expenses relating to (i) share-based\ncompensation, (ii) Syndicate 3456-related expenses, (iii) information technology costs, and (iv) legal and other professional\nfees. Lower D&O insurance and personnel costs partially offset the increase.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, general and administrative expenses included $3.3 million\nand $2.4 million, respectively, of costs related to share-based compensation granted to employees and directors.\nTotal Investment Income (Loss)\nTotal investment income (loss) incorporates (i) changes in the net asset value of our investment in SILP managed by\nDME Advisors, (ii) interest income earned on the restricted cash and cash equivalents pledged as collateral to our clients, and\n(iii) gains (or losses) and interest on our portfolio of strategic and Innovations investments, notes receivable and investments\naccounted for under the equity method.

The associated carry-value increases contributed to a net unrealized gain of $9.2 million. The unrealized gains\nare net of a $2.2 million valuation allowance on certain Innovations-related investments recorded during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022.\nThe increase in interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, was primarily related to our\nrestricted cash and cash equivalents, which benefited from rising U.S. interest rates.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, the gross investment return (loss) on our investments\nmanaged by DME Advisors (excluding the investment advisor performance allocation) was composed of the following:\nThree months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nLong portfolio gains (losses) 6.0 % (3.5) % (10.5) % 12.3 %\nShort portfolio gains (losses) (0.1) 1.1 21.1 (7.9)\nMacro gains (losses) (1.4) — 2.6 (5.2)\nOther income and expenses 1 (0.5) (0.4) (1.5) (1.4)\nGross investment return 4.0 % (2.8) % 11.7 % (2.2) %\nNet investment return 1 3.6 % (2.7) % 10.5 % (2.2) %\n1 “Other income and expenses” excludes performance compensation but includes management fees. “Net investment return”\nincorporates both of these amounts.\nEffective January 1, 2021, the Investment Portfolio is calculated based on 50% of GLRE Surplus, or the Company’s\nshareholders’ equity, as reported in the Company’s then most recent quarterly U.S. GAAP financial statements, adjusted\nmonthly for our share of the net profits and net losses reported by SILP during any intervening period. Prior to January 1, 2021,\nthe Investment Portfolio was calculated based on several factors, including our share of SILP’s net asset value and our posted\ncollateral and net reserves.\nEach month, we post on our website (www.greenlightre.com) the returns from our investment in SILP.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are not obligated to pay taxes in the Cayman Islands on either income or capital gains. The Governor-In-Cabinet\nhas granted us an exemption from any income taxes that may be imposed in the Cayman Islands for the 20 years expiring\nFebruary 1, 2025.\nGRIL is incorporated in Ireland and is subject to the Irish corporation tax. We expect GRIL to be taxed at 12.5% on its\ntaxable trading income and 25% on its non-trading income, if any.\nVerdant is incorporated in Delaware and is subject to taxes under the U.S. federal rates and regulations prescribed by\nthe Internal Revenue Service. We expect Verdant’s future taxable income to be taxed at 21%.\nAt September 30, 2022, we have included a gross deferred tax asset of $3.7 million (December 31, 2021: $3.2 million)\nin the caption “Other assets” in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2022, a valuation\nallowance of $3.2 million (December 31, 2021: $2.7 million) partially offset this gross deferred tax asset. We have concluded\nthat it is more likely than not that the Company will fully realize the recorded deferred tax asset (net of the valuation allowance)\nin the future. We have based this conclusion on the expected timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and the\nlikelihood of generating sufficient taxable income to realize the future tax benefit. We have not taken any other tax positions\nthat we believe are subject to uncertainty or reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company.\n46\nReturn to table of contents\nFinancial Condition\nTotal investments\nThe total investments reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2022, was $260.3 million,\ncompared to $231.0 million at December 31, 2021, an increase of $29.3 million, or 12.7%. The increase was primarily related\nto gains on SILP and Innovations-related investments and purchase of certificates of deposit. The increase was partially offset\nby net redemptions from SILP.\nAt September 30, 2022, 91.5% of SILP’s portfolio was valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets (Level\n1), 6.0% was composed of instruments valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2), and 0.0% was\ncomposed of instruments valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). At September 30, 2022, 2.5% of SILP’s portfolio\nconsisted of private equity funds valued using the funds’ net asset values as a practical expedient.\nAt September 30, 2022, 87% of our Innovations-related portfolio was carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,\nmeasured as of the investees’ most recent completed financing round, and 13% was carried at original cost.\nOther than our investment in SILP (see Notes 3 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements), we\nhave not participated in transactions that created relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including\nVIEs, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCash and cash equivalents; Restricted cash and cash equivalents\nThe unrestricted cash and cash equivalents decreased by $44.0 million, or 57.7%, from $76.3 million at December 31,\n2021, to $32.3 million at September 30, 2022, primarily due to cash used for operations, including the repurchase of senior\nconvertible debt, purchase of Innovations-related investments and collateral posted to our ceding insurers.\nWe use our restricted cash and cash equivalents for funding trusts and letters of credit issued to our ceding insurers. Our\nrestricted cash increased by $14.1 million, or 2.2%, from $634.8 million at December 31, 2021, to $648.9 million at\nSeptember 30, 2022, primarily due to collateral required by our ceding insurers.\nReinsurance balances receivable\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, reinsurance balances receivable increased by $68.2 million, or\n16.8%, to $473.6 million from $405.4 million at December 31, 2021. This increase was related primarily to funds withheld by\ncedents. At September 30, 2022, funds held by cedents were $303.1 million, compared to $246.9 million at December 31, 2021.\nThe remaining increases related to premiums receivable on new contracts bound during nine months ended September 30,\n2022.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves; Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Recoverable\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses were composed of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2022 December 31, 2021\nCase Case\nReserves IBNR Total Reserves IBNR Total\n($ in thousands)\nProperty $ 32,716 $ 84,009 $ 116,725 $ 21,357 $ 49,486 $ 70,843\nCasualty 117,847 148,746 266,593 151,734 219,949 371,683\nOther 36,382 121,127 157,509 17,129 64,355 81,484\nTotal $ 186,945 $ 353,882 $ 540,827 $ 190,220 $ 333,790 $ 524,010\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the total gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves increased\nby $16.8 million, or 3.2%, to $540.8 million from $524.0 million at December 31, 2021.

See Note 6 of the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated financial statements for a description of the credit risk associated with our retrocessionaires.\nFor most of the contracts we write, defined limits of liability limit our risk exposure. Once each contract’s limit of\nliability has been reached, we have no further exposure to additional losses from that contract. However, certain contracts,\nparticularly quota share contracts covering first-dollar exposure, may not contain aggregate limits.\nOur property and Lloyd’s business, and to a lesser extent our casualty and other business, incorporate contracts that\ncontain natural peril loss exposure. We currently monitor our catastrophe loss exposure in terms of our PML (probable\nmaximum loss).\nWe anticipate that our PMLs will vary from period to period depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the\ncomposition of our in-force book of business.\nWe monitor our natural peril PMLs on a worldwide basis, with a particular focus on our peak peril regions. When\nthese perils consist of a large geographic area, we split them into sub-regions, where the underlying geographic components can\nalso be considered individual peril zones.\nFor our natural catastrophe PMLs, we utilize the output of catastrophe models at the 1-in-250 year return period. The\n1-in-250 year return period PML means that we believe there is a 0.4% probability that in any given year, an occurrence of a\nnatural catastrophe will lead to losses exceeding the stated estimate.\nIt is important to note that PMLs are best estimates based on the modeled data available for each underlying risk. As a\nresult, we cannot provide assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events\nsimilar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML.\nOur PML estimates incorporate all significant exposure from our reinsurance operations, including coverage for\nproperty, marine and energy, motor, and catastrophe workers’ compensation.\n48\nReturn to table of contents\nAt October 1, 2022, our estimated largest PML (net of retrocession and reinstatement premiums) at a 1-in-250 year\nreturn period for a single event and in aggregate was $88.7 million and $95.9 million, respectively, both relating to the peril of\nNorth Atlantic Hurricane.\nThe below table contains the expected modeled loss for each of our peak peril regions and sub-regions, for both a\nsingle event loss and aggregate loss measures at the 1-in-250 year return period.\nOctober 1, 2022\nNet 1-in-250 Year Return Period\nPeril Single Event Loss Aggregate Loss\n($ in thousands)\nNorth Atlantic Hurricane $ 88,673 $ 95,876\nSoutheast Hurricane 66,247 71,541\nGulf of Mexico Hurricane 59,936 64,145\nNortheast Hurricane 62,020 63,404\nNorth America Earthquake 60,793 65,126\nCalifornia Earthquake 53,957 56,977\nOther N.A.

The decrease in shareholders’ equity during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2022, was primarily due to the net loss of $9.4 million reported for the period, partially offset by\nthe adoption of ASU 2020-06 (see Note 2 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements). For details of\nother movements in shareholders’ equity, please see the “Condensed Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity.”\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nGreenlight Capital Re is a holding company with no operations of its own. As a holding company, Greenlight Capital\nRe has minimal continuing cash needs, most of which are related to the payment of corporate and general administrative\nexpenses and interest expenses. We conduct all our underwriting operations through our wholly-owned reinsurance\nsubsidiaries, Greenlight Re and GRIL, which underwrite property and casualty reinsurance. There are restrictions on Greenlight\nRe’s and GRIL’s ability to pay dividends, described in more detail below. It is our current policy to retain earnings to support\nthe growth of our business. We currently do not expect to pay dividends on our ordinary shares.\nAt September 30, 2022, Greenlight Re and GRIL were each rated “A- (Excellent)” with a stable outlook by A.M. Best.\nThe ratings reflect A.M. Best’s opinion of our reinsurance subsidiaries’ financial strength, operating performance, and ability to\nmeet obligations. They are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold\nour Class A ordinary shares.\n49\nReturn to table of contents\nSources and Uses of Funds\nOur sources of funds consist primarily of premium receipts (net of brokerage and ceding commissions), investment\nincome, and other income. We use cash from our operations to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses, profit commissions,\ninterest, and general and administrative expenses. At September 30, 2022, all of our investable assets, excluding strategic and\nInnovations investments and funds required for business operations and capital risk management, are invested by DME\nAdvisors in SILP, subject to our investment guidelines. We can redeem funds from SILP at any time for operational purposes\nby providing three days’ notice to the general partner. At September 30, 2022, the majority of SILP’s long investments were\ncomposed of cash and cash equivalents and publicly traded equity securities, which can be readily liquidated to meet our\nredemption requests. We record all investment income (loss), including any changes in the net asset value of SILP, and any\nunrealized gains and losses, in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for each reporting period.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the net cash used in operating activities was $27.4 million\nand $18.8 million, respectively. The net cash used in operating activities was used primarily for our underwriting activities and\nfor payment of corporate and general administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nGenerally, if the premiums collected exceed claim payments within a given period, we generate cash from our underwriting\nactivities. Our underwriting activities represented a net use of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, as\nthe losses we paid exceeded the premiums we collected. On our Lloyd’s syndicate contracts we do not receive any premiums\nuntil the year of account is settled, net of losses, at the end of three years. Our Lloyd’s syndicate business has been growing in\nrecent years, contributing to the net use of cash for underwriting activities. The cash used in, and generated from, underwriting\nactivities may vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of business, the nature of underwriting\nopportunities available and volume of claims submitted to us by our cedents.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2022, our investing activities provided $12.9 million of cash from\nredemptions from SILP (net of contributions) and used $8.6 million for new Innovations and other investments. By comparison,\nfor the same period in 2021 our investing activities provided net cash of $4.4 million.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we used $6.4 million to repurchase our convertible senior notes.\nDuring the same period in 2021, we used $10.0 million to repurchase our Class A ordinary shares.\nAt September 30, 2022, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable financial requirements. We do\nnot expect the recent global events, including Hurricane Ian, the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, and the COVID-19 pandemic, to\nmaterially impact our operational liquidity needs. These needs will be met by cash, funds generated from underwriting\nactivities, and investment income, including withdrawals from SILP if necessary. At September 30, 2022, we expect to fund our\noperations for the next twelve months from operating and investing cash flow.\nWe are evaluating various alternatives in relation to the convertible senior notes that mature in August 2023. In\naddition, we may explore various financing options, including debt refinancing and other capital raising alternatives, to fund our\nbusiness strategy, improve our capital structure, increase surplus, pay claims or make acquisitions. We can provide no\nassurances regarding the terms of such transactions or that any such transactions will occur. If we are unable to refinance the\nconvertible senior notes, we will be required to fund settlement at maturity using cash on hand, or withdrawals from SILP,\nwhich may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy.\nAlthough GLRE is not subject to any significant legal prohibitions on the payment of dividends, Greenlight Re and\nGRIL are each subject to regulatory minimum capital requirements and regulatory constraints that affect their ability to pay\ndividends to us. In addition, any dividend payment would have to be approved by the relevant regulatory authorities prior to\npayment. At September 30, 2022, Greenlight Re and GRIL exceeded their regulatory minimum capital requirements.\nLetters of Credit and Trust Arrangements\nAt September 30, 2022, neither Greenlight Re nor GRIL was licensed or admitted as a reinsurer in any jurisdiction\nother than the Cayman Islands and the European Economic Area, respectively. Many jurisdictions do not permit domestic\ninsurance companies to take credit on their statutory financial statements for loss recoveries or ceded unearned premiums unless\nappropriate measures are in place for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers. As a result, we anticipate\nthat all of our U.S. clients and some non-U.S. clients will require us to provide collateral through funds withheld, trust\narrangements, letters of credit, or a combination thereof.\nAt September 30, 2022, we had one letter of credit facility available with an aggregate capacity of $275.0 million\n(December 31, 2021: $275.0 million). See Note 12 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for details\n50\nReturn to table of contents\non the letter of credit facility. We provide collateral to cedents in the form of letters of credit and trust arrangements. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, the aggregate amount of collateral provided to cedents under such arrangements was $648.2 million\n(December 31, 2021: $633.9 million). At September 30, 2022, the letters of credit and trust accounts were secured by restricted\ncash and cash equivalents with a total fair value of $648.9 million (December 31, 2021: $634.8 million).\nThe letter of credit facility contains customary events of default and restrictive covenants, including but not limited to\nlimitations on liens on collateral, transactions with affiliates, mergers and sales of assets, as well as solvency and maintenance\nof certain minimum pledged equity requirements, and restricts issuance of any debt without the consent of the letter of credit\nprovider. Additionally, if an event of default exists, as defined in the letter of credit facility, Greenlight Re would be prohibited\nfrom paying dividends to its parent company. The Company was in compliance with all the covenants of this facility at\nSeptember 30, 2022.\nCapital\nOur capital structure currently consists of senior convertible notes and equity issued in two classes of ordinary shares.\nWe expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business strategy for\nthe foreseeable future. Consequently, we do not presently anticipate that we will incur any additional material indebtedness in\nthe ordinary course of our business. However, to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should\nwe require additional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes, we\nhave filed a Form S-3 registration statement, which expires in July 2024. In addition, as noted above, we may explore various\nfinancing alternatives, although there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms when\nneeded or desired. We did not make any significant commitments for capital expenditures during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022.\nThe Board of Directors had previously approved a share repurchase plan authorizing the Company to repurchase up to\n$25.0 million of Class A ordinary shares or securities convertible into Class A ordinary shares in the open market, through\nprivately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans. On April 26, 2022, the Board of Directors renewed and\nextended the share repurchase plan until June 30, 2023. The Company is not required to repurchase any Class A ordinary\nshares, and the repurchase plan may be modified, suspended, or terminated at the election of our Board of Directors at any time\nwithout prior notice. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company repurchased 4,933 Class A ordinary\nshares at an average share price of $7.04.\nUnder the Company’s stock incentive plan, the number of Class A ordinary shares authorized for issuance is 8.0\nmillion shares. At September 30, 2022, 2,011,426 Class A ordinary shares were available for future issuance under the\nCompany’s stock incentive plan. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the stock incentive plan.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nDue to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our\nreinsurance contractual liabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain. At September 30, 2022,\nwe estimate that we will pay the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as follows:\nLess than More than\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years 5 years Total\n($ in thousands)\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves (1) $ 278,526 $ 157,381 $ 49,215 $ 55,706 $ 540,827\n(1) Due to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance\ncontractual liabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain.\nGreenlight Re has entered into a lease agreement for office space in the Cayman Islands commencing from July 1,\n2021. The lease expires on June 30, 2026, unless Greenlight Re exercises its right to renew the lease for another five-year\nperiod. GRIL has entered into a lease agreement for office space in Dublin, Ireland commencing from October 1, 2021. This\nlease expires on September 30, 2031, unless GRIL exercises the break clause by providing a notice of termination at least nine\nmonths prior to September 30, 2026. The aggregate annual lease obligation ranges from $0.5 million to $0.6 million.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company has $93.4 million of senior convertible notes payable, which mature on August\n1, 2023. The Company is obligated to make semiannual interest payments of $2.0 million at an interest rate of 4.0% per annum.\n51\nReturn to table of contents\nThe Company has received regulatory approval to declare dividends from Greenlight Re to meet the interest payments\nobligation.\nPursuant to the IAA between SILP and DME Advisors, DME Advisors is entitled to a monthly management fee equal\nto 0.125% (1.5% on an annual basis) of each limited partner’s Investment Portfolio, as provided in the SILP LPA. The IAA has\nan initial term ending on August 31, 2023, subject to automatic extension for successive three-year terms. Pursuant to the SILP\nLPA, DME II is entitled to a performance allocation equal to 20% of the net profit, calculated per annum, of each limited\npartner’s share of the capital account managed by DME Advisors, subject to a loss carry-forward provision. DME II is not\nentitled to earn a performance allocation in a year in which SILP incurs a loss. The loss carry-forward provision contained in\nthe SILP LPA allows DME II to earn reduced performance allocation of 10% of net profits in years subsequent to the year in\nwhich the capital accounts of the limited partners incur a loss, until all losses are recouped and an additional amount equal to\n150% of the loss is earned. At September 30, 2022, we estimate the reduced performance allocation of 10% to continue to be\napplied until SILP achieves additional investment returns of 164%, at which point the performance allocation will revert to\n20%. For detailed breakdowns of management fees and performance compensation for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 and 2021, please refer to Note 3 of the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company has entered into a service agreement with DME Advisors pursuant to which DME Advisors will provide\ninvestor relations services to us for compensation of $5,000 per month plus expenses. The service agreement had an initial term\nof one year and continues for sequential one-year periods until terminated by us or DME Advisors. Either party may terminate\nthe service agreement for any reason with 30 days prior written notice to the other party.\nOur related party transactions are presented in Note 11 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial\nstatements.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation generally affects the cost of claims and claim expenses. Long-tailed lines of business generally have greater\nexposure to inflation than short-tailed lines, with this differential becoming more pronounced as the severity of inflation\nincreases. Our underwriting portfolio is predominantly short-tailed, and we actively manage our exposures to classes that\nexperience significant inflation. Our pricing and reserving models incorporate the anticipated effects of inflation on our claim\ncosts, and we regularly review and update our assumptions. However, we cannot predict or estimate the onset, duration, and\nseverity of an inflationary period with precision. The actual effect of inflation may differ significantly from our assumptions.\nInflation can also affect the asset values in SILP’s investment portfolio. DME Advisors regularly monitors and re-\npositions SILP’s investment portfolio to deal with the impact of inflation on its underlying investments, and holds macro\npositions to benefit from a rising inflationary environment.\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe believe we are principally exposed to the following types of market risk:\n•\nequity price risk;\n•\ncommodity price risk;\n•\nforeign currency risk;\n•\ninterest rate risk;\n•\ncredit risk; and\n•\npolitical risk.\n52\nReturn to table of contents\nEquity Price Risk\nAt September 30, 2022, our investments consisted primarily of an investment in SILP. Among SILP’s holdings are\nequity securities, the carrying values of which are based primarily on quoted market prices. Generally, market prices of\ncommon equity securities are subject to fluctuation, which could cause the amount to be realized upon the closing of a position\nto differ significantly from its current reported value. This risk is partly mitigated by the presence of both long and short equity\nsecurities as part of our investment strategy. At September 30, 2022, a 10% decline in the price of each of the underlying listed\nequity securities and equity-based derivative instruments would result in a $2.2 million loss to our Investment Portfolio.\nComputations of the prospective effects of hypothetical equity price changes are based on numerous assumptions,\nincluding the maintenance of the current composition of SILP’s portfolio. The computations should not be relied on as\nindicative of future results.\nCommodity Price Risk\nGenerally, market prices of commodities are subject to fluctuation. SILP’s investments periodically include long or\nshort investments in commodities or derivatives directly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of commodities. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, SILP’s investments incorporate unhedged exposure to changes in gold, silver, uranium and crude oil\nprices.\nThe following table summarizes the net impact that a 10% increase and decrease in commodity prices would have on\nthe value of our Investment Portfolio at September 30, 2022. The below table excludes the indirect effect that changes in\ncommodity prices might have on equity securities in our Investment Portfolio.\n10% increase in 10% decrease in\ncommodity prices commodity prices\nChange in Change in\nCommodity fair value fair value\n($ in millions)\nGold $ 3.0 $ (3.0)\nSilver 0.3 (0.3)\nUranium 0.2 (0.2)\nCrude oil — (0.1)\nTotal $ 3.5 $ (3.6)\nForeign Currency Risk\nCertain of our reinsurance contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, whereby premiums are receivable and\nlosses are payable in foreign currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that our foreign currency\nreinsurance balances are more than (or less than) the corresponding foreign currency cash balances and there is an increase (or\ndecrease) in the exchange rate of that foreign currency.\nWhile we do not seek to precisely match our liabilities under reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies\nwith investments denominated in such currencies, we continually monitor our exposure to potential foreign currency losses and\nmay use foreign currency cash and cash equivalents or forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate against adverse\nforeign currency movements.\nCertain cedents report to us in foreign currencies even though some or all of the underlying exposure is denominated in\nU.S. dollars. Our condensed consolidated statements of operations may report a foreign exchange gain or loss associated with\nthis exposure when reported by the cedents. Additionally, we may report foreign exchange gains or losses due to the mismatch\nbetween the currency exchange rates applied to foreign-denominated (i) monetary balances and (ii) non-monetary balances\nunder U.S. GAAP. See Note 2 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further information\nregarding our accounting treatment of foreign currency transactions.\nWe monitor our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities on an “underlying exposure” basis without\ndistinguishing between monetary and non-monetary balances.\n53\nReturn to table of contents\nAt September 30, 2022, our underlying exposure to GBP denominated net reinsurance asset balance was £5.9 million.\nAt September 30, 2022, a 10% decrease in the U.S. dollar against the GBP (all else constant) would result in an estimated $0.7\nmillion foreign exchange gain. Alternatively, a 10% increase in the U.S dollar against the GBP would result in an estimated\n$0.7 million foreign exchange loss. Similarly, at September 30, 2022, our net underlying exposure to Euro-denominated\nreinsurance liability balances was €11.6 million. At September 30, 2022, a 10% decrease in the U.S. dollar against the Euro (all\nelse constant) would result in an estimated $1.1 million foreign exchange loss. Alternatively, a 10% increase in the U.S dollar\nagainst the Euro would result in an estimated $1.1 million foreign exchange gain.\nWe may also be exposed to foreign currency risk through SILP’s underlying cash, forwards, options, and investments\nin securities denominated in foreign currencies. At September 30, 2022, most of SILP’s currency exposures resulting\nfrom foreign denominated securities (longs and shorts) were reduced by offsetting cash balances denominated in the\ncorresponding foreign currencies.\nAt September 30, 2022, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies would\nhave no meaningful impact on the value of our Investment Portfolio.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe primary market risk exposure for any debt instrument is interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, the fair value of a\nlong fixed-income portfolio generally falls. Similarly, falling interest rates generally lead to increases in the fair value of fixed-\nincome securities. Additionally, some derivative investments may be sensitive to interest rates, and their value may indirectly\nfluctuate with changes in interest rates.\nThe caption “Reinsurance balances receivable” in our condensed consolidated balance sheets incorporates amounts\nheld by cedents, including the Lloyd’s syndicates that we participate on. These syndicates invest a portion of the premiums\nwithheld in fixed-income and variable-yield securities, which expose us to interest rate risk. At September 30, 2022, a 100 basis\npoints increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an estimated $1.6 million loss or gain, respectively, which would be\nrecorded in our condensed consolidated statements of operations under the captions “Other income (expense).”\nOur restricted cash and cash equivalents earn interest at rates that generally follow the movements of the short-term U.S.\nTreasury rates. At September 30, 2022, a 100 basis points increase or decrease in U.S. Federal Funds Rate would result in\napproximately $4.8 million, increase or decrease, respectively, in our interest income on an annualized basis.\nOur investment in SILP includes interest-rate sensitive securities, such as corporate and sovereign debt instruments\nand interest rate options. At September 30, 2022, a 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a $1.1\nmillion gain or a $1.7 million loss, respectively, to our Investment Portfolio.\nWe, along with DME Advisors, monitor the net exposure to interest rate risk and generally do not expect changes in\ninterest rates to have a materially adverse impact on our operations.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk relates to the uncertainty of a counterparty’s ability to make timely payments in accordance with terms of\nthe instrument or contract. Our maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of our financial assets. We evaluate the\nfinancial condition of our business partners and clients relating to balances receivable under our reinsurance contracts, including\npremiums receivable, losses recoverable, and commission adjustments recoverable. We obtain collateral in the form of funds\nwithheld, trusts, and letters of credit from our counterparties to mitigate this credit risk. We monitor our net exposure to each\ncounterparty relative to the financial strength of our counterparties and assess the collectibility of these balances on a regular\nbasis. See Note 2 of the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for further details on allowance for credit\nloss on reinsurance assets.\nIn addition, the securities, commodities, and cash in SILP’s investment portfolio are held with several prime brokers\nand derivative counterparties, subjecting SILP, and indirectly us, to a significant concentration of credit risk. While we have no\ndirect control over SILP, DME Advisors regularly monitors the concentration of credit risk with each counterparty and, if\nappropriate, transfers cash or securities between counterparties or requests collateral to diversify and mitigate this credit risk.\n54\nReturn to table of contents\nPolitical Risk\nThrough our assumed reinsurance contracts, we currently provide a limited amount of political risk insurance\ncoverage. We do not expect this exposure to have a materially adverse impact on our underwriting results.\nWe are exposed to political risk to the extent that we underwrite business from entities located in foreign markets and\nto the extent that DME Advisors, on behalf of SILP and subject to our investment guidelines, trades securities listed on various\nU.S. and foreign exchanges and markets. The governments in any of these jurisdictions could impose restrictions, regulations,\nor other measures, which may have a material adverse impact on our underwriting operations and investment strategy. See\n“Item 1A. Risk Factors - We could face unanticipated losses from political instability which could have a material adverse\neffect on our financial condition and results of operations” included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2021.\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of\nmanagement, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls\nand procedures (as defined in such rules) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief\nExecutive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to\nensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports prepared in accordance with the rules and\nregulations of the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules\nand forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated\nand communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or\npersons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nFurther, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must\nbe considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can\nprovide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These\ninherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur\nbecause of simple error or mistake.\nAdditionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,\nor by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain\nassumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its\nstated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,\nor the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-\neffective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal controls\nover financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the\nCompany’s systems evolve with its business.\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\n55\nReturn to table of contents\nItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, we may be involved in formal and informal dispute resolution\nprocedures, which may include arbitration or litigation, the outcomes of which determine our rights and obligations under our\nreinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, we may seek to enforce our rights under an\nagreement or to collect funds owing to us. In other matters, we may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged\nrights. While the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of our existing\ncontractual disputes, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nFactors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report are any of the risks described in\n“Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, as filed with the\n\"Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on March 8, 2022 (the “Form 10-K”) and in “Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors”\nincluded in our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2022, as filed with the SEC on May 3, 2022 (the “Q1 Form\n10-Q”). Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial\ncondition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business\nor results of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2022, there have been no other material changes to the risk factors disclosed in “Part I. Item 1A.\nRisk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and in “Part II. Item\n1A. Risk Factors” included in our Q1 Form 10-Q. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from\ntime to time in our future filings with the SEC.\nItem 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nOur board of directors has adopted a share repurchase plan authorizing the Company to repurchase Class A ordinary\nshares. From time to time, the repurchase plan has been re-approved or modified at the election of our Board of Directors. The\nprevious plan expired on June 30, 2022. On April 26, 2022, the Board of Directors re-approved the share repurchase plan\neffective from July 1, 2022, until June 30, 2023, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $25.0 million of Class A ordinary\nshares or securities convertible into Class A ordinary shares in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or\nRule 10b5-1 stock trading plans.\nThe Company is not required to repurchase any Class A ordinary shares and the repurchase plan may be modified,\nsuspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.\nThe table below details the share repurchases that were made under the plan during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022:\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nTotal Number of Average Price Total Number of Shares Maximum Value of\nShares Purchased Paid per Share Purchased as Part of Shares that May Yet\n(1) Publicly Announced Be Purchased Under\nPlans or Programs the Plans or Programs\nPeriod (1) (1)\nJuly 1 - 31, 2022 4,026 $ 7.00 4,026 $ 24,971,818\nAugust 1 - 31, 2022 — $ — — $ 24,971,818\nSeptember 1 - 30, 2022 907 $ 7.23 907 $ 24,965,260\nTotal 4,933 $ 7.04 4,933 $ 24,930,532\n(1) Class A ordinary shares.\nItem 3.

The decrease in gross premiums written of\n$157.0m is driven by the non-renewal of the Funds at Lloyd's book which is now underwritten by another entity within the\nGroup.\nThe combined ratio has improved in the year primarily driven by a combination of improved market conditions, favourable\nprior year development of reserves and lower Catastrophe losses.\nThe net investment return from the Solasglas Investments L.P fund is 4.4% for the year 2023 compared to 27.8% for the\nprior year.\nThe Company is optimistic about market opportunities in 2024.\nResults and dividends\nThe results for the year were as follows:\n2023 2022\nUS$ US$\nProfit before taxation 10,871,986 4,612,041\nCorporation tax benefit * 607,277 —\nProfit brought to reserves 11,479,263 4,612,041\n*See note 8\nThe directors intend to recommend a dividend payment to be made in 2024 following the reconstitution of our Capital\n(2022: nil).\nThe Statement of Comprehensive income for the Company for the year ended 31 December 2023 is set out on pages 14 and\n15. The Statement of Financial Position of the Company at the same due date is set out on page 16.

Brady’s beneficial interests in the Parent comprised of an insignificant number of common shares of the Parent. Ms.\nQuigley and Mr. M. Brady do not own common shares in the Parent.\nThe directors remuneration is disclosed in Note 6.\nStatement of directors’ responsibilities\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with Irish law\nand regulations. Irish company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under the\nlaw, the directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with Companies Act 2014 and Financial\nReporting Standard 102 \"The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland\" and Financial\nReporting Standard 103 \"Insurance Contracts\". Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements\nunless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Company as\nat the financial year end date and of the statement of comprehensive income of the Company for the financial year and\notherwise comply with the Companies Act 2014.\nIn preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\n• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n• state whether the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards,\nidentify those standards, and note the effect and the reasons for any material departure from those standards; and\n• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company\nwill continue in business.\nThe directors are responsible for ensuring that the Company keeps or causes to be kept adequate accounting records which\ncorrectly explain and record the transactions of the Company, enable at any time the assets, liabilities, financial position\nand statement of comprehensive income of the Company to be determined with reasonable accuracy, enable them to ensure\nthat the financial statements and directors’ report comply with the Companies Act 2014 and the European Union (Insurance\nand Reinsurance Undertakings: Financial Statements) Regulations 2016 and enable the financial statements to be audited.\nThey are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the\nprevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n3\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nDirectors’ report - continued\nGoing concern\nThe directors have assessed the going concern impact of various risks on the Company’s operations through conducting a\nrigorous assessment of the potential risk outcomes. These factors have been considered by the directors as part of the\nCompany’s annual Own Risk and Solvency Assessment process, with the likely financial impact on profitability and\nsolvency assessed in terms of the going concern basis of preparation of the financial statements.\nAs at year end the Company’s net asset position is $74.4m (2022: $62.3m) and a solvency coverage ratio of 149.2% (2022:\n164.6%). By virtue of the strength of its net asset position, the directors have concluded that there is a reasonable\nexpectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least twelve\nmonths from the date of approval of these financial statements. Furthermore, the directors are not aware of any material\nuncertainties that may cast significant doubt upon the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Thus, they\ncontinue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual financial statements.\nPolitical donations\nThe Company did not make any political donations during the year (2022: nil).\nClimate change\nClimate change has the potential to have a significant impact on weather patterns and loss events. The Company is exposed\nto climate change primarily from its FAL book and a limited number of natural catastrophe reinsurance contracts it writes.\nThe Company has seen elevated levels of cat activity and unusual weather events in recent years. The Company will\ncontinue to closely monitor cat activity and amend its appetite for natural catastrophe business to reflect market conditions\nand climate change developments. As this business is predominantly short tail in nature, the Company can re-balance the\nportfolio quickly, if required. The risks associated with climate change were also considered in the Own Risk and Solvency\nAssessment (ORSA) process. The non renewal of the FAL book, effective January 1, 2023, significantly reduces the\nCompany’s exposure to climate change.\nInflation\nGlobal inflation rates are expected to fall in 2024 but remain elevated and it is possible that inflation could remain elevated\nfor some time. Higher than anticipated inflation could lead to an increase in loss costs and the need to strengthen loss\nreserves. The impact of inflation on loss costs will likely be more pronounced for longer tail business lines, where it takes a\nperiod of time to finalise and settle claims. In general, the Company’s underwriting book is skewed towards shorter tail\nclasses and therefore the impact should be less pronounced.\nInternational conflict\nThe Company has exposure through its FAL and Specialty books to the Russia Ukraine conflict and the Israel Palestine\nconflict. The Company continues to monitor the situation closely. The Company has included in the loss and loss\nadjustment reserves its best estimate of losses arising from the conflicts. As the conflicts are ongoing the situation remains\nuncertain, accordingly, estimates used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, primarily those associated\nwith the estimations of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves may be subject to adjustments in future periods.\nEvents since the year end\nThere are no events since the statement of financial position date to report.\nCorporate Governance\nThe Company is subject to “Corporate Governance Requirements for Insurance Undertakings 2015\" (the “Code”) but is not\ndeemed to be a “major institution” under the terms of the Code.\nAccounting records\nThe measures taken by the directors to secure compliance with the requirements of sections 281 to 285 of the Companies\nAct 2014 with regard to the keeping of accounting records are the design and implementation of necessary policies and\nprocedures for recording transactions, the employment of competent accounting personnel with appropriate expertise and\nthe provision of adequate resources to the financial function. The accounting records of the Company are located at 50 City\nQuay, Dublin 2, Ireland, D02 F588 .\n4\n\nDeloitte Ireland LLP\nChartered Accountants &\nStatutory Audit Firm\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF\nGREENLIGHT REINSURANCE IRELAND DAC\nReport on the audit of the financial statements\nOpinion on the financial statements of Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland DAC (the ‘company’)\nIn our opinion the financial statements:\n give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the company as at 31 December 2023 and of the\nprofit for the financial year then ended; and\n have been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework and, in particular, with the\nrequirements of the Companies Act 2014.\nThe financial statements we have audited comprise:\n the Statement of Comprehensive Income: Technical Account;\n the Statement of Comprehensive Income: Non-technical Account;\n the Statement of Financial Position;\n the Statement of Changes in Equity; and\n the related notes 1 to 25, including a summary of significant accounting policies as set out in note 3.\nThe relevant financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is the Companies Act 2014 and FRS 102 ‘The\nFinancial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland’ issued by the Financial Reporting Council and FRS 103\n‘Insurance Contracts’ issued by the Financial Reporting Council (“the relevant financial reporting framework”).\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) (ISAs (Ireland)) and applicable law. Our\nresponsibilities under those standards are described below in the “Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements”\nsection of our report.\nWe are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial\nstatements in Ireland, including the Ethical Standard issued by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), as\napplied to public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nSummary of our approach\nKey audit matters The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:\n Valuation of incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves\nWithin this report, any new key audit matters are identified with and any key audit matters which\nare the same as the prior year identified with .\nMateriality The materiality that we used in the current year was $2m which was determined on the basis of\n2.7% of Shareholder's Funds.\nScoping We determined the scope of our audit by obtaining an understanding of the company and its\nenvironment, including the identification of relevant controls. We designed our audit by determining\nmateriality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. As part of\nour risk assessment, we assessed the control environment in place to the extent relevant to our\naudit. The risk of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit is identified as the\nkey audit matter in the “Key Audit Matters” section of our report.\nContinued on next page/\n6\n/Continued from previous page\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF\nGREENLIGHT REINSURANCE IRELAND DAC\nSignificant changes in There were no significant changes in our approach which we feel require disclosure.\nour approach\nConclusions relating to going concern\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the\npreparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\nOur evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting\nincluded:\n Obtaining an understanding of the company’s process for assessing the appropriateness of the going concern\ndetermination;\n Obtaining an understanding of the annual process to determine Solvency II regulatory capital and the calculation of the\ncompany’s solvency ratio including an understanding of management’s process to complete the Own Risk and Solvency\nAssessment (‘ORSA’) report;\n Obtaining the directors’ assessment of going concern and challenging the key assumptions used in this assessment;\n Obtaining the annual Solvency Financial Condition Report, the ORSA report 2023 and the Board approved 2024 plan and\nconsidering whether the information was consistent with the going concern assessment supporting the going concern\nconclusion;\n Performing a retrospective assessment of the current year performance and year-end position of the company including\nprofitability, loss ratios and solvency capital required against prior year plans and budgets; and\n Evaluating the adequacy of the relevant disclosures made in the financial statements.\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,\nindividually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least\ntwelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of\nthis report.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial\nstatements of the current financial year and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due\nto fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the\naudit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial\nstatements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nValuation of incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves\nKey audit matter Total IBNR reserves as at 31 December 2023 amounted to USD 167 million. The methodologies and\ndescription assumptions used to estimate IBNR reserves involve a significant degree of judgement by\nmanagement as there is less information available than with reported claims.\nThe estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, including the initial expected loss ratios and loss\ndevelopment factors. The estimate is also sensitive to the selection of actuarial methods and methods\napplied to project the ultimate losses, the estimation of ultimate reserves associated with catastrophic\nevents, and other factors.\nKey assumptions used in the determination of ultimate losses, including initial expected loss ratios and\nloss development factors, involve significant judgment and estimation and could give rise to a material\nmisstatement due to fraud and error. The estimation and measurement of IBNR reserves is a major\ndetermining factor in the results and financial position of the company and, therefore, there is a\nContinued on next page/\n7\n/Continued from previous page\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF\nGREENLIGHT REINSURANCE IRELAND DAC\npossibility of management bias. We have, therefore, identified valuation of IBNR reserves as a key\naudit matter.\nRefer to the accounting policy in note 3.6 and the disclosures in note 17 and note 20 of the financial\nstatements.\nHow the scope of our The procedures performed to address the key audit matter included the following:\naudit responded to the  We evaluated the design, determined the implementation and tested the operating\nkey audit matter effectiveness of the company’s relevant controls over the valuation of the recorded loss\nreserves, including the review and approval process that management has in place for\nsignificant actuarial methods and assumptions used and the approval of management’s best\nestimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.\n We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data that served as the basis for\nthe company’s actuarial analysis, including historical claims data, to test the reasonableness\nof key inputs to the actuarial estimate.\n With the assistance of our actuarial specialists as part of our team:\no We independently developed an estimate of the reserves for a sample of selected classes\nof business, compared our estimates to those booked by the company, and evaluated the\ndifferences;\no We evaluated and challenged the company’s methodologies against recognized actuarial\npractices for the remaining classes. We also evaluated and challenged the assumptions used\nby the company using our industry knowledge and experience and other analytical\nprocedures; and\no We compared the results of the reserve study prepared by third party actuaries to\nmanagement’s best estimate and evaluated the differences.\n We also evaluated the adequacy of the IBNR disclosures in the financial statements.\nKey observations Based on the audit procedures performed, we determined the methodologies and assumptions used\nin the valuation of IBNR reserves to be reasonable. We also determined the valuation of IBNR reserves\nto be with an acceptable range.\nWe concluded that the related IBNR disclosures in the financial statements are appropriate.\nOur audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and\nnot to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect\nto any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.\nOur application of materiality\nWe define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic\ndecisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of\nour audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\nMateriality $2m (2022 : $1.6m)\nBasis for 2.7% of Shareholder's Funds\ndetermining\nmateriality\nContinued on next page/\n8\n/Continued from previous page\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF\nGREENLIGHT REINSURANCE IRELAND DAC\nRationale for the Deloitte considered various different benchmarks upon which to base materiality. It was concluded that the\nbenchmark applied primary focus for key users of the financial statements, including shareholders, insured entities and\nregulators, is the capital strength of the company and that the Shareholder’s Funds benchmark is the most\nappropriate metric for capital strength\nShareholder's Funds $74m Materiality $2m\nAudit Committee\nreporting threshold $0.1m\nShareholder's Funds Materiality\nWe set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and\nundetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole.\nPerformance materiality was set at 80% of materiality for the 2023 audit (2022: 80%). In determining performance materiality, we\nconsidered the following factors:\n1. Considerations in relation to the effectiveness of the control environment;\n2. No fraud risk factors or ineffective entity level controls, with strong governance controls and competent personnel; and\n3. There have been no major changes in the business that would affect our ability to forecast potential misstatements.\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all audit differences in excess of $0.1m (2022 : $0.08m) as well\nas differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit\nCommittee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\nAn overview of the scope of our audit\nWe determined the scope of our audit by obtaining an understanding of the company and its environment, including the\nidentification of relevant controls. We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material\nmisstatement within the financial statements. The risk of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit is\nidentified as a key audit matter in the “Key Audit Matters” section of our report. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of\nGreenlight Capital Reinsurance Limited and as such benefits from certain support services offered by the Greenlight Group. In\nestablishing the overall scope of the audit, we determined the type of work that was needed to be performed by component\nauditors at group shared service locations for the purposes of our audit. We received clearance from the Deloitte member firm in\nBermuda, operating under our instructions, in relation to the testing of financial assets, technical provisions, premium, debtors and\ncreditors. We had regular interaction with the component team in Deloitte member firm in Bermuda including video meetings and\nreview of certain working papers. This, together with the additional procedures performed in Ireland, gave us the evidence we\nneeded to form our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.\nContinued on next page/\n9\n/Continued from previous page\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF\nGREENLIGHT REINSURANCE IRELAND DAC\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Reports and Financial Statements, other than the financial\nstatements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Reports\nand Financial Statements.\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in\nour report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent\nwith the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify\nsuch material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material\nmisstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have\nperformed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial\nstatements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view and otherwise comply with the Companies Act 2014, and for\nsuch internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,\ndisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either\nintend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material\nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a\nhigh level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (Ireland) will always detect a material\nmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the\naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial\nstatements.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on IAASA’s website at:\nhttps://iaasa.ie/publications/description-of-the-auditors-responsibilities-for-the-audit-of-the-financial-statements. This description\nforms part of our auditor’s report.\nExtent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our\nresponsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our\nprocedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\nIdentifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws\nand regulations, we considered the following:\n the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the\ncompany’s remuneration policies, key drivers for directors’ remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;\n results of our enquiries of management, internal audit, and the audit committee about their own identification and\nassessment of the risks of irregularities;\nContinued on next page/\n10\n/Continued from previous page\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF\nGREENLIGHT REINSURANCE IRELAND DAC\n any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the company’s documentation of their policies and procedures\nrelating to:\no identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances\nof non-compliance;\no detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or\nalleged fraud;\no the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations\n the matters discussed among the audit engagement team including significant component audit teams and relevant\ninternal specialists, including actuarial specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements\nand any potential indicators of fraud.\nAs a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and\nidentified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas:\nthe valuation of IBNR reserves\nIn common with all audits under ISAs (Ireland), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of\nmanagement override.\nWe also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework that the company operates in, focusing on provisions of\nthose laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the The key laws and regulations we considered in\nthis context included the Companies Act 2014 and the relevant accounting framework..\nIn addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but\ncompliance with which may be fundamental to the company’s ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the\nIrish insurance laws and regulations and supervisory requirements of the Central Bank of Ireland including the Solvency II Regulations.\nAudit response to risks identified\nAs a result of performing the above, we identified the Valuation of incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves as a key audit matter\nrelated to the potential risk of fraud.

REPORTING ENTITY\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company, (the “Company”) was incorporated as a private limited\ncompany (registration number 475022) under the Irish Companies Acts on 7 September 2009 and is a licensed reinsurance\nentity domiciled in Dublin, Ireland. The registered office of the Company is 50 City Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland, D02 F588.\nThe Company provides multi-line property and casualty reinsurance.\nThe Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd., a company resident in the Cayman Islands. The\nlargest and smallest group in which the financial statements of Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity\nCompany, are consolidated is that headed by Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. The consolidated financial statements of\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd. are publicly available on the website www.greenlightre.com.\n2. STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE\nThese financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted\nAccounting Practice in Ireland (accounting standards issued by the Financial Reporting Council of the UK, including\nFinancial Reporting Standard 102 \"The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland\" (\"FRS\n102\") and Financial Reporting Standard 103 \"Insurance Contracts\" (\"FRS 103\"). The Company's financial statements have\nbeen prepared on a going concern basis.\n3. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company's financial statements are set out below. These\npolicies have been consistently applied to all financial years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n3.1. Basis of preparation\nThe financial statements are expressed in United States Dollars (US$) to the nearest dollar, which is the Company’s\nfunctional currency, and have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except for\ninvestment in related party investment fund which is measured at fair value and in accordance with FRS 102 and FRS 103\naccounting standards issued by the Financial Reporting Council and promulgated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants\nin Ireland. The Company is also subject to the requirements of the Companies Acts 2014 and the European Union\n(Insurance Undertakings: Financial Statements) (Amendment) Regulations 2016.\n3.2. Significant judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with FRS 102 and 103 requires management to make judgements,\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the year. The\nestimated and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be\nreasonable under the circumstances.\nActual results could differ from these estimates.\nCertain critical accounting judgements in applying the Company’s policies are detailed below.\n(a) Loss reserves\nThe Company establishes reserves for contracts based on estimates of the ultimate cost of all losses including losses\nincurred but not reported (“IBNR”) that are dependent on actuarial judgement and assumptions. These are discussed in\nmore detail in note 3.6.\n18\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\n(b) Estimation of employee bonus\nUnder the Company's bonus program, an employee’s target bonus generally consists of a Group performance bonus and an\nindividual performance bonus. Each of the Group performance bonus and the individual performance bonus may be earned\nindependent of one another.\nThe Group performance bonus criteria is driven by underwriting profitability and strategic investment income. The Group\nCompensation Committee, set a threshold, target and maximum level of achievement and the bonus is accrued based on\nmanagements best estimate of each employee's likely payment. The ultimate amount paid may differ from the amount\naccrued.\nThe individual performance bonus is based on a qualitative assessment of each employee’s performance.\nPerformance and bonus achievement will be measured following the end of each applicable Plan Year.\n(c) Premium estimation\nThe Company estimates the ultimate premiums for the entire contract year. These estimates are based on information\nreceived from ceding companies and estimates from actuarial pricing models used by the Company. This is discussed in\nmore detail in note 3.3.\n(d) Deferred tax valuation allowance\nThe Company records a valuation allowance to the extent that the Company considers it more likely than not that all or a\nportion of the deferred tax asset will not be realised in the future. Other than this valuation allowance, the Company has not\ntaken any income tax positions that are subject to significant uncertainty that are reasonably likely to have a material\nimpact on the Company.\n3.3. Revenue recognition\nIn accordance with FRS 103 the Company has applied the existing accounting policies for insurance contracts. The\nCompany's contracts are classified at inception, for accounting purposes, as insurance contracts. Insurance contracts are\nthose contracts that transfer significant insurance risk.\nThe Company estimates the ultimate premiums for the entire contract year. These estimates are based on information\nreceived from ceding companies and estimates from actuarial pricing models used by the Company. For excess of loss\ncontracts, the total ultimate estimated premiums are recorded as premiums written at the inception of the contract. For quota\nshare contracts, the premiums are recorded as written based on cession statements from cedants which typically are\nreceived monthly or quarterly depending on terms specified in each contract. For any reporting lag, premiums written are\nestimated based on the portion of the ultimate estimated premiums relating to the risks underwritten during the lag period.\nChanges in premium estimates, including premium receivable on both excess of loss and quota share contracts are expected\nand may result in significant adjustments in any period. These estimates change over time as additional information\nregarding the underlying business volume is obtained. Any subsequent adjustments arising on such estimates are recorded\nin the period in which they are determined. A significant portion of amounts included in the caption “Debtors/Creditors\narising out of reinsurance operations” in the Company’s statement of financial position represent estimated premiums\nwritten, net of commissions and brokerage, and are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts.\nAdditional premiums due on a contract that has no remaining coverage period are earned in full when written. An estimate\nfor doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when\nidentified.\nPremiums written are generally recognised as earned over the contract period in proportion to the period of risk covered.\nUnearned premiums consist of the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided. The unearned premium reserve is treated as a\nmonetary liability under FRS 103 and revalued at the date of the statement of financial position.\nInterest income is included in the statements of comprehensive income on an accrual basis.\n19\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\n3.4 Reinsurance premiums ceded\nThe Company reduces the risk of future losses on business assumed by reinsuring certain risks and exposures with other\nreinsurers (retrocessionaires). The Company remains liable to the extent that any retrocessionaire fails to meet its\nobligations and to the extent the Company does not hold sufficient security for their unpaid obligations. Ceded premiums\nare written during the period in which the risks incept and are expensed over the contract period in proportion to the period\nof protection. Unearned premiums ceded consist of the unexpired portion of reinsurance obtained.\n3.5 Deferred acquisition costs\nPolicy acquisition costs, such as commission and brokerage costs, relate directly to and vary with the writing of reinsurance\ncontracts. Acquisition costs relating solely to bound contracts are deferred subject to ultimate recoverability and are\namortised over the related contract term. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs by\ndetermining if the sum of future earned premiums and anticipated investment income is greater than the expected future\nclaims and expenses. If a loss is probable on the unexpired portion of policies in force, a premium deficiency loss is\nrecognised. At 31 December 2023 and 2022, the deferred acquisition costs were considered fully recoverable and no\npremium deficiency loss was recorded. Deferred acquisition costs are treated as a monetary asset under FRS 103 and\nrevalued at the date of the statement of financial position.\n3.6. Insurance losses, reserves and recoverables - technical provisions\nThe Company establishes reserves for contracts based on estimates of the ultimate cost of all losses including losses\nincurred but not reported (“IBNR”). These estimated ultimate reserves are based on the Company’s own actuarial estimates\nderived from reports received from ceding companies, industry data and historical experience. These estimates are\nreviewed by the Company periodically and adjusted as necessary. Since reserves are estimates, the final settlement of losses\nmay vary from the reserves established and any adjustments to the estimates, which may be material, are recorded in the\nperiod they are determined. Changes in estimates are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which the\nestimates are changed. The Company does not discount its loss reserves.\nLoss reserves recoverable include the amounts due from retrocessionaires for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses on\nretrocession agreements. Ceded losses incurred but not reported are estimated based on the Company’s actuarial estimates.\nThese estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted when deemed necessary. The Company may not be able to\nultimately recover the losses recoverable amounts due to the retrocessionaires’ inability to pay. The Company regularly\nevaluates the financial condition of its retrocessionaires and records provisions for uncollectible reinsurance expenses\nrecoverable when recovery is no longer probable.\n3.7. Financial instruments\nAs permitted by FRS 102, the Company has elected to apply the recognition and measurement provisions of International\nAccounting Standard 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, (“IAS 39”) to account for all of its\nfinancial instruments. Financial instruments include listed and unlisted equities, corporate and sovereign debt, commodities,\nfutures, put and call options, currency forwards, other derivatives and similar instruments sold, not yet purchased. The\nCompany’s financial instruments are recognised on the statement of financial position and measured at fair value through\nthe profit or loss account, and all unrealised gains or losses are included in \"Income from investment in related party\ninvestment fund\" in the statements of comprehensive income in accordance with IAS 39.\nFinancial assets and liabilities\nFinancial instruments are recognised initially at fair value of the consideration given (in case of an asset) or received (in the\ncase of a liability). Except for financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), the initial measurement of\nfinancial assets includes transaction costs.\nFinancial assets are derecognised when and only when:\na) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are settled;\nb) the Company transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset; or\nc) the Company, despite having retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred control of the\nasset to another party and the other party has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party\nand is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without needing to impose additional restrictions on the transfer.\n20\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised only when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.\nFair value measurement\nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price for an identical asset in an active market. When quoted prices are\nunavailable, the price of a recent transaction for an identical asset provides evidence of fair value as long as there has not\nbeen a significant change in economic circumstances or a significant lapse of time since the transaction took place. If the\nmarket is not active and recent transactions of an identical asset on their own are not a good estimate of fair value, the fair\nvalue is estimated by using a valuation technique.\nImpairment of financial assets\nFinancial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each\nbalance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events\nthat occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the asset have been\nimpacted. The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets.\nIf in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an\nevent occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the\nstatement of comprehensive income to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is\nreversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.\nOffsetting of Financial Instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position if,\nand only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on\na net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The company assesses that it has a currently\nenforceable right of offset if the right is not contingent on a future event, and is legally enforceable in the normal course of\nbusiness, event of default, and event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company and all of the counter parties.\n3.8. Employee Benefits\n(a) Defined contribution pension plans\nThe Company operates a defined contribution plan for its staff. Under this plan, the Company pays fixed contributions into\na separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions or to make direct benefit payments\nto employees if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to the employee service in the\ncurrent or prior periods. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in independently\nadministered funds managed by Irish Life. Pension costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the\nperiod in which they are incurred and are disclosed in note 7. Amounts not paid are shown as accruals in the statement of\nfinancial position.\n(b) Short term employee benefits\nShort term employee benefits including annual leave entitlements, annual bonus arrangements, termination payments,\nhealth benefits and group stock compensation are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income in\nthe financial year in which the employees render the related service.\n3.9. Fixed Assets\nFixed assets are included in the statement of financial position and are recorded at cost when acquired, less accumulated\ndepreciation. Fixed assets are comprised of furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements and are depreciated, using\nthe straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives, which is five years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold\nimprovements are amortised over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or remaining lease term.\n3.10. Taxation and deferred taxation\nThe income tax benefit represents the sum of the tax currently receivable and deferred tax. Any tax currently payable is\nprovided on taxable profits at current attributable rates.\nDeferred tax is calculated on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed as of the date of the statement of\n21\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\nfinancial position where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less\ntax in the future, have occurred at the statements of financial position date.\nTiming differences are temporary differences between profits as computed for tax purposes, and profits as stated in the\nfinancial statements which arise because certain items of income and expenditure in the financial statements are dealt with\nin different years for tax purposes.\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised in full in respect of net unfavourable timing differences. Deferred tax assets in\nrespect of net favourable timing differences, including taxation losses available for carry forward, are recognised only\nwhen it is considered more probable than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of\ntiming differences can be deducted.\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the years in which the timing differences are\nexpected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statements of\nfinancial position date. Deferred tax is not discounted.\n3.11. Foreign exchange\nThe reporting and functional currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar (US$). Transactions in foreign currencies are\nrecorded in U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign\ncurrencies at the statements of financial position date are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the statements of\nfinancial position date and translation exchange gains and losses, if any, are included in the statements of comprehensive\nincome. For this purpose, all assets and liabilities arising from insurance contracts (including unearned premium and\ndeferred acquisition costs) are monetary items. Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are measured at\nhistorical cost and are not retranslated.\n3.12. Provisions and Contingencies\nThe Company does not hold any general provisions in the statement of financial position. Provisions are recognised when\nthe Company has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and it is more likely than not that an outflow\nof resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.\n3.13. Operating lease\nThe Company has leased office space which has been classified as an operating lease. Operating leases are not recognised\nin the Company’s statements of financial position. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss\non a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives are recognised as an integral part of the total lease\nexpense, over the term of the lease.\n3.14. Deposits with ceding undertakings\nThe Company provides collateral in the form of cash and letters of credit to support the Fund's at Lloyd's transactions. The\nCompany earns investment income on the funds held balances based upon prevailing interest rates. However, in certain\ncircumstances, the Company may receive an investment return based upon either the result of a pool of assets held by the\ncedant, generally used to collateralise the funds held balance, or the investment return earned by the cedant on its entire\ninvestment portfolio. In these arrangements, investment returns are included in net investment income in the statement of\ncomprehensive income.\n3.15 Cash at bank and in hand\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and certain short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of\nthree months or less.\n3.16 Funds withheld\nFunds withheld represents cash collateral and reinsurance balances retained as collateral by the Company on retroceded\ncontracts along with net reinsurance payable in respect of those contracts.\n22\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\n3.17 Debtors and creditors arising out of reinsurance operations\nReinsurance receivables are recognised and measured on initial recognition of gross premiums written less acquisition costs\nand losses payable. The carrying value of reinsurance receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events of\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, with the impairment recorded in the statement of\ncomprehensive income. There were no such impairments in 2023 or 2022.\nReinsurance payables are recognised and measured on initial recognition of outwards reinsurance premiums written net of\nreinsurance commissions and profit participation and losses receivable.\n3.18 Restricted cash and cash equivalents\nThe company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances to collateralise trusts issued to cedants (see note 14).\n3.19 Disclosure exemptions for qualifying entities under FRS 102\nThe Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 102 and has therefore taken advantage of the disclosure\nexemptions available to it in respect of its separate financial statements.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are\ncategorised based on whether the inputs are observable in the market and the degree that the inputs are observable. The\ncategorisation of financial instruments within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is\nsignificant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is prioritised into three levels (with Level 3 being the lowest)\ndefined as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to\naccess.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar\nassets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in\nmarkets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable\nmarket data.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to\nthe fair value of the assets and liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\n30\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\nThe following table presents the Company’s investments, categorised by the level of the fair value hierarchy.\nFair Value Measurements as of\n31 December 2023\nSignificant Other Significant\nQuoted Prices in Observable Unobservable\nActive Markets Inputs Inputs\nDescription (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\nUS$\nAssets:\nInvestment in related\nparty investment fund — 25,396,295 — 25,396,295\nOther investments — — 657,141 657,141\nTotal investments — 25,396,295 657,141 26,053,436\nFair Value Measurements as of\n31 December 2022\nSignificant Other Significant\nQuoted Prices in Observable Unobservable\nActive Markets Inputs Inputs\nDescription (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total\nUS$\nAssets:\nInvestment in related\nparty investment fund — 28,493,286 — 28,493,286\nOther investments — — 511,350 511,350\nTotal investments — 28,493,286 511,350 29,004,636\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the balances for all investments measured at fair value using significant\nunobservable inputs (Level 3) as of 31 December 2023:\n31\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\nFair Value Measurements Using Significant\nUnobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nAssets\nPrivate Investments Total\nUS$\nBeginning balance 511,350 511,350\nPurchases 80,179 80,179\nSales — —\nTotal realized and unrealized gains (losses)\nincluded in earnings, net 65,612 65,612\nEnding balance 657,141 657,141\nFair Value Measurements Using Significant\nUnobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nAssets\nUnlisted equity Total\nUS$\nBeginning balance 363,600 363,600\nPurchases 184,071 184,071\nSales — —\nTotal realized and unrealized gains (losses)\nincluded in earnings, net (36,321) (36,321)\nEnding balance 511,350 511,350\nPrivate investments consist of innovations-related investments supporting technology innovators in the (re)insurance\nmarket.

RETROCESSION\nLoss reserves recoverable from the retrocessionaires are recorded as assets. Retrocession contracts do not relieve the\nCompany from its obligations to insureds. Failure of retrocessionaires to honour their obligations could result in losses to\nthe Company.

The Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of its retrocessionaires to assess the\nability of the retrocessionaires to honour their obligations. At 31 December 2023 and 2022, no provision for uncollectible\nlosses recoverable was considered necessary.\nAggregate stop loss retrocession agreement\nThe Company has entered into a further retrocession agreement with Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd, whereby Greenlight\nReinsurance, Ltd provides an aggregate stop loss protection to the Company in return for premiums ceded by the Company\nto Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd. For the year ended 31 December 2023, the Company ceded $715,717 (2022: $933,006) of\nwritten premiums to Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd. The threshold for coverage was not breached for the 2023 year.\n34\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\n19. OTHER RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company undertakes transactions with other group undertakings. Transactions between the Company and other wholly\nowned subsidiaries Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd are not disclosed as the Company has taken advantage of the exemption\nunder FRS 102 (section 33) not to disclose transactions between two or more members of a group provided that any\nsubsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by the ultimate parent undertaking.\n20. INSURANCE, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nINSURANCE RISK\nThe primary underwriting goal is to build a reinsurance portfolio that maximises profitability, subject to risk and volatility\nconstraints.\nThe approach to underwriting begins at the class-of-business level. This analysis includes identifying and assessing the\nstructural drivers of risk and emerging loss trends, and understanding the market participants and results, capacity\nconditions for supply and demand, and other factors. Our underwriting professionals specialise in business lines and our\nquantitative professionals assist in evaluating all risks we underwrite. Combined with cross-line management, we believe\nthis approach enables us to build and deploy expertise and insight into the business line’s risk dynamics and external risk\nfactors that will affect each transaction.\ni. Underwriting risk\nThe principal risk to which the Company is exposed is underwriting risk, which is the risk that the total cost of claims,\nclaims adjustment expenses and premium acquisition expenses will exceed premiums received and can arise as a result of\nnumerous factors, including reserving risk, catastrophe risk and pricing risk. Failure to accurately assess underwriting risk\nand establish adequate premium rates and terms and conditions as a result of market cycle fluctuations, competition,\nmacroeconomic trends, and regulatory/legal issues can result in reduced earnings and capital.\nThe Board sets parameters for aggregate property catastrophic caps and limits for maximum loss potential under any\nindividual contract. The Board must approve any exceptions to the established limits. The Board may amend the maximum\nunderwriting authorities periodically and to align with our capital base. The Board designs the underwriting authorities to\nensure the underwriting portfolio is appropriate on a risk-adjusted basis.\nii. Reserving risk\nReserve risk is the risk that claims and claim expense reserves subsequently prove to be insufficient to cover eventual\nclaims. Deterioration in reserves can originate from frequency of claims being more than expected, severity of claims being\nhigher than expected and difference between timing of claims payments versus expected. Reserving risk relates to all\nbusiness earned at the valuation date. Risk relating to claims on unearned and future business is considered as part of\nunderwriting risk. The reserve adequacy of the Company is monitored through quarterly review of reserves by the Actuarial\nFunction as well as through an annual assessment performed by our Independent Actuary.\nReserves represent an estimate rather than an exact quantification. Although the methods for establishing reserves are well\nestablished, many assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. We base\nour estimates on our assessment of facts and circumstances known at the time of the estimate, as well as estimates of future\ntrends in claim severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability, and other factors, including the actions of third parties,\nwhich are beyond our control.\niii. Pricing Risk\nWe write reinsurance in the property and casualty markets, which are subject to pricing cycles. Primary insurers’\nunderwriting results, prevailing general economic and market conditions, liability retention decisions of companies and\nprimary insurers and reinsurance premium rates influence the demand for property and casualty reinsurance. Prevailing\nprices and available surplus to support assumed business influence reinsurance supply.

Sensitivity to insurance risk\nThe principal assumption underlying the claims liabilities estimates is that the Company's future claims development will\nfollow similar pattern to past claims development experience. These estimates are based on various quantitative and\nqualitative factors including:\n• average claim costs including claim handling costs;\n• trends in claims severity and frequency, and\n• other factors such as inflation, expected or in-force government pricing and coverage reforms, and the level of\ninsurance fraud.\nMost or all of the qualitative factors are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis, and the effects of these\nand unforeseen factors could negatively impact the Company's ability to accurately assess the risk of the insurance\ncontracts that the Company underwrites. In addition, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the\ninsured event and the time it is actually reported to the Company and additional lags between the time of reporting and final\nsettlement of claims.\nThe company refines its claims liabilities estimates on an ongoing basis as claims are reported and settled. Establishing an\nappropriate level of claims liabilities is an inherently uncertain process and the policies surrounding this are overseen by the\nActuarial department.\nREGULATORY RISK\nRegulatory risk is the risk of loss and/ or damage to reputation owing to a breach of regulatory requirements or failure to\nrespond to regulatory change. Solvency II was introduced with effect from January 1, 2016 and governs the prudential\nregulation of insurers and reinsurers, and requires insurers and reinsurers in Europe to meet risk-based solvency\nrequirements. It also imposes group solvency and governance requirements on groups with insurers and/or reinsurers\noperating in the European Economic Area. A number of European Commission delegated acts and technical standards have\nbeen adopted, which set out more detailed requirements based on the overarching provisions of the Solvency II Directive.\nHowever, further delegated acts, technical standards and guidance are likely to be published on an ongoing basis.\n37\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\n20.

Equity Price Risk\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Company’s investment portfolio included an investment in SILP, which holds underlying\nequity securities and equity-based derivative instruments, the carrying values of which are primarily based on quoted\nmarket prices. Generally, market prices of common equity securities are subject to fluctuation, which could cause the\namount to be realised upon the closing of the position to differ significantly from the current reported value. This risk is\npartly mitigated by the presence of both long and short equity securities. As of 31 December 2023, a 10% decline in the\nprice of each of these listed equity securities and equity-based derivative instruments would result in a $1,204,593 or 3.6%\nof the Company's investment portfolio.\nComputations of the prospective effects of hypothetical equity price changes are based on numerous assumptions, including\nthe maintenance of the existing level and composition of investment securities and should not be relied on as indicative of\nfuture results.\nii. Foreign Currency Risk\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes\nin exchange rates and produce an adverse effect of net income and capital when measured in the Company's functional\ncurrency.\n39\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\n20. INSURANCE, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nMARKET RISK - continued\nThe Company's cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variations. Foreign currency risk\nexists by nature of the Company's underwriting and investment strategy. The Company's principal transactions are carried\nout in US dollars though it has exposure to foreign exchange risk principally with respect to Sterling and Euro.\nThe Company does not seek to specifically match the liabilities under reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign\ncurrencies with investments denominated in such currencies; the Company continually monitors the exposure to potential\nforeign currency losses and may consider the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate\nagainst adverse foreign currency movements.\nThe schedule below shows the surplus or deficiency held in each of the main currencies by the Company at the year ended\n31 December 2023:\nLiabilities and Surplus /\nForeign Currency Assets Equity (Deficiency)\nUS$ US$ US$\nBritish Pound 223,861,769 218,940,944 4,920,825\nEuro 12,999,021 14,128,439 (1,129,418)\nUnited States Dollar 280,532,393 285,224,996 (4,692,308)\nOther 4,044,257 3,143,060 901,196\nTotal 521,437,439 521,437,439 —\nThe schedule below shows the surplus or deficiency held in each of the main currencies by the Company at the year ended\n31 December 2022:\nLiabilities and Surplus /\nForeign Currency Assets Equity (Deficiency)\nUS$ US$ US$\nBritish Pound 352,208,257 348,915,679 3,292,578\nEuro 10,515,990 9,566,696 949,295\nUnited States Dollar 246,635,062 251,548,323 (4,913,262)\nOther 3,204,683 2,533,295 671,389\nTotal 612,563,992 612,563,992 —\nThe following table summarises the net impact that a 10% increase and decrease in the value of the United States dollar\nagainst foreign currencies would have on the Company as of 31 December 2023:\n40\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\n20.

Interest Rate Risk\nThe investment in SILP includes interest rate sensitive securities, such as corporate and sovereign debt instruments and\ninterest rate swaps. The primary market risk exposure for any debt instrument is interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, the\nfair value of a long fixed-income portfolio generally falls. Similarly, falling interest rates generally lead to increases in the\nfair value of fixed-income securities. Additionally, some of the derivative investments may also be sensitive to interest rates\nand their value may indirectly fluctuate with changes in interest rates.\nThe caption “Debtors arising out of reinsurance operations” in our Statement of Financial Position represents amounts held\nby cedents, including the Lloyd’s syndicates in which we participate. These syndicates invest a portion of the premiums\nwithheld in fixed-income and variable-yield securities, which expose us to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2023, a 100\nbasis points increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an estimated $272k loss or gain, respectively.\nOur “Restricted cash and cash equivalents” earn interest at rates that generally follow the movements of the short-term U.S.\nTreasury rates. At December 31, 2023, a 100 basis points increase or decrease in U.S. Federal Funds Rate would result in\napproximately a $97k increase or decrease, respectively, in our interest income on an annualised basis.\nAs of December 31, 2023, a 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would result in approximately a $152k\nincrease or a decrease of $347k on the value of our Investment Portfolio.\nThe Company, along with DME Advisors, monitors the net exposure to interest rate risk and generally do not expect\nchanges in interest rates to have a materially adverse impact on our operations.\nCREDIT RISK\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk primarily from the possibility that counterparties may default on their obligations to\nit. The amount of the maximum exposure to credit risk is indicated by the carrying value of the Company's financial assets.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk from its business partners and clients relating to balances receivable under the\nreinsurance contracts, including premiums receivable, losses recoverable and commission adjustments recoverable. The\nCompany monitors the financial strength of its counterparties and assesses the collectability of these balances on a regular\nbasis and obtains collateral in the form of funds withheld, trusts and letters of credit from its counterparties to mitigate their\ncredit risk.\nIn addition, the securities, commodities, and cash in SILP’s investment portfolio are held with several prime brokers and\nderivative counterparties, subjecting SILP, and indirectly us, to the related credit risk from the possibility that one or more\nof them may default on their obligations. While the Company has no direct control over SILP, DME Advisors closely and\nregularly monitors the concentration of credit risk with each counterparty and, if necessary, transfers cash or securities\n41\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\n20. INSURANCE, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nCREDIT RISK - continued\nbetween counterparties or requests collateral to diversify and mitigate credit risk. Other than the Company's investment in\nSILP and the fact that SILP’s investments and the majority of cash balances are held by prime brokers, the Company has no\nother significant concentrations of investment credit risk.\nThe Company retrocedes a significant portion of its reinsurance liabilities via internal reinsurance to its sister Company,\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ltd., (\"GRL\") a wholly owned subsidiary of GLRE, which is rated \"A-(excellent)\" by A.M. Best.\nThe Company closely monitors the financial strength of GRL and while the amount recoverable is material (see note 18)\nthe Company does not regard the recoverability of reinsurance assets as a material credit risk given the financial strength of\nthe group.\nThe Company holds cash deposits with HSBC Continental Europe which has a A+ credit rating from Standard and Poor’s.\nLIQUIDITY RISK\nAs of 31 December 2023, the majority of the Company’s investments in SILP were valued based on quoted prices in active\nmarkets for identical assets. Given the Company’s value-oriented long and short investment strategy, if equity markets\ndecline, the obligations for covering short positions would also decline. Any reduction in the short portfolio would reduce\nthe need for restricted cash and thereby cash would be freed up to be used for any purpose. Additionally, since the majority\nof the Company’s investments in SILP are liquid, even in distressed markets, the invested assets can be liquidated to\ngenerate cash to pay claims, hence mitigating any liquidity risk.\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION\nGlobal inflation rates are expected to fall in 2024 but remain elevated. Higher than anticipated inflation could lead to an\nincrease in loss costs and the need to strengthen loss reserves. The impact of inflation on loss costs will likely be more\npronounced for longer tail business lines, where it takes a period of time to finalise and settle claims. In general, the\nCompany’s underwriting book is skewed towards shorter tail classes and therefore the impact should be less pronounced.\n21. LETTERS OF CREDIT AND TRUSTS\nThe Company’s related company, GRL, issues letters of credit on behalf of the Company under various facilities, for the\nbenefit of the Company’s insureds. The collateral pledged as security relating to these letters of credit is also provided by\nGRL. In the event that the Company’s insureds draw upon any letters of credit, the Company shall be obligated to\nreimburse GRL the amount of the letters of credit drawn down by the insured. As of 31 December 2023, $16,948,316\n(2022: $16,707,680) of letters of credit were issued by GRL on behalf of the Company and no letters of credits were drawn\nby the Company’s insureds for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nIn addition to the letters of credit, the Company has established regulatory trust arrangements for certain cedants. As of 31\nDecember 2023, collateral of $10,433,518 (2022: $11,161,986) was provided to cedants in the form of regulatory trust\naccounts (see note 14).\n22. COMMITMENTS - OPERATING LEASE\nThe Company entered into a lease agreement for office space in Dublin, Ireland in October 2021. Under the terms of this\nlease agreement, the Company is committed to minimum annual rent payments denominated in Euros approximating\n€71,500 per annum until September 2026. The Company has the option to terminate the lease agreement in 2026. Included\nin the schedule below are the net minimum lease payment obligations for the remaining years relating to this lease as of 31\nDecember 2023.\n2024 2025 2026 Total\nOperating lease obligations 78,911 78,911 59,183 217,005\n42\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company\nNotes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 - continued\n23. EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD\nSince the reporting date the Company has appointed Alan Holmes to the position of non-executive Director effective from\nJanuary 1, 2024. On February 1, 2024 the Company entered a new lease for office space in Dublin, Ireland at the current\npremises occupied. This lease will run concurrently alongside our existing lease for office space.\n24.

The ultimate parent company is Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd (“GLRE” or the “Parent”),\nwhich is a reinsurance group registered on the NASDAQ exchange in New York.\nThe principal activity of the Company is that of a Property and Casualty reinsurance business. The\nCompany is based in Dublin, Ireland and focuses mainly on serving clients based in the London,\nEuropean and Middle Eastern markets.\nThe Company produces annual financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard\nFRS 102 & 103 (‘FRS’). On this basis, the Company produced a pre-tax profit for the year ended 31\nDecember 2023 of $10.9m compared to $4.6m profit in the prior period. Gross Premiums Written\n(“GPW”) and Net Premiums Earned (‘NPE’) were $89.6m and $31.4m respectively compared to\n$246.6m and $41.5m in the prior period.\nAs at the period end the Company was rated “A- Excellent” by A.M Best.\nSystem of governance\nThe Company is subject to the various requirements set out by the CBI including the Corporate\nGovernance Requirements for Insurance Undertakings 2015, the Probability Risk and Impact system\n(‘PRISM’) as well as those requirements imposed as part of the Greenlight Re Group.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors sets corporate objectives and strategy and is responsible for\nensuring that the Company’s system of governance is appropriately maintained and delivered. The\nCompany has set up a governance structure comprising of the Board and sub-committees as follows:\n2\nThe Board recognizes the importance of strong corporate governance and oversees the framework and\noperation of the system through its Audit and Risk sub-committees.\nThe Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) is responsible for the day to day management of risk control\nwithin the business operations as well as delivering the strategy set by the Board and optimising\nbusiness performance within the governance and risk framework set by the Board.\nThe Chief Risk Officer (‘CRO’) and Compliance Officer (‘CO’) are functions independent from the\noperational departments and provide assurance to the Risk and Audit committees with regard to the\noverall operation and effectiveness of the risk management system and provide an independent\nassurance to the Board that the Company is conducting its business in a compliant manner.\nRisk management, compliance, actuarial and internal audit are key functions in the Company’s\nsystem of governance. Each of these functions reports regularly to the Board, Risk Committee and/or\nAudit Committee.\nAnnual audits are carried out by the Internal Audit function. These provide the Board with an\nindependent review of the activities of the Executive Management and operational departments.\nFindings and recommendations are reported directly to the Audit Committee.\nAll persons who are either involved in the day to day running of the Company or hold positions in\nkey functions are required to demonstrate that they meet the appropriate level of fitness and probity to\nfulfill the requirements of those roles. Those persons holding positions in key functions are subject to\nthe CBI’s Pre-Approved Control Function (PCF) regime, which requires pre-approval by the CBI\nbefore they can take up the position.\nDuring the year a new Head of Finance, a new Chief Risk Officer, a new Head of Compliance and a\nnew non-executive Director were appointed following the resignation of an existing non-executive\nDirector and the individual holding the dual designated role of Head of Compliance and Chief Risk\nOfficer. As of January 1, 2024 a new independent non-executive Director was appointed. Otherwise\nthere were no further material changes made to the Company’s system of governance during 2023 or\nat the time of publication.\nRisk profile\nThe Company maintains a risk register to identify and monitor all significant risks it is exposed to.\nThe Board of Directors set the Company’s risk appetite and assesses the risk profile on a regular\nbasis. The Company carries out an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (‘ORSA’) at least annually\nand calculates its Solvency Capital Requirement (‘SCR’) at least quarterly using the SII Standard\nFormula model.\nThe Board considers that the following key risks could either separately or in aggregate cause\nmaterial impairment to capital:\ni. Underwriting Risk\nUnderwriting risk is the risk that the total cost of claims, claims adjustment expenses and premium\nacquisition expenses will exceed premiums received. It can arise as a result of numerous factors,\nincluding premium (pricing) risk, reserving risk, catastrophe risk and lapse risk (the risk of non-\nrenewal of a material part of the portfolio).\nii. Counterparty Risk\n3\nCounterparty default risk is the risk that companies or individuals will be unable to make the required\npayments on their debt obligations.\niii. Market Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate\nbecause of changes in market prices.\nThese risks are monitored on a regular basis by our Risk Management function and more detail is\ndescribed in Section C below.\nThe Company purchases both quota share and an aggregate stop loss reinsurance from a Group\naffiliated entity and purchases external reinsurance protection to limit risk exposure, reduce volatility\nand to maintain a level of capital above the Solvency II SCR, aligned to Board approved risk appetite.\nThis level is set by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and is periodically reviewed in line\nwith the Company’s risk appetite and profile.\nThe Company has reduced its gross premium volume materially in 2023, with the non-renewal of the\nFunds at Lloyd’s (FAL) book, which is now written by another Group entity. The Company’s\nexposure to climate change has significantly reduced as a result of the non-renewal of the FAL\nbusiness.There were no other material changes to the Company’s business profile during 2023 or at the\ntime of publication.\nIn considering future changes to the Company’s risk profile the Board has specifically considered the\nfollowing risks:\nInternational conflict\nThe Company has exposure through its Funds At Lloyd’s (“FAL”) and Specialty books to the Russia\nUkraine conflict and the Israel Palestine conflict. The Company continues to monitor the situation\nclosely. The Company has included in the loss and loss adjustment reserves its best estimate of losses\narising from the conflicts. As the conflicts are ongoing the situation remains uncertain, accordingly,\nestimates used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, primarily those associated\nwith the estimations of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves may be subject to adjustments in\nfuture periods.\nInflation\nGlobal inflation rates are expected to fall in 2024 but remain elevated and it is possible that inflation\ncould remain elevated for some time. Higher than anticipated inflation could lead to an increase in\nloss costs and the need to strengthen loss reserves. The impact of inflation on loss costs will likely be\nmore pronounced for longer tail business lines, where it takes a period of time to finalise and settle\nclaims. In general, the Company’s underwriting book is skewed towards shorter tail classes and\ntherefore the impact should be less pronounced.\nClimate change\nClimate change has the potential to have a significant impact on weather patterns and loss events. The\nCompany is exposed to climate change primarily from its FAL book and a limited number of natural\ncatastrophe reinsurance contracts it writes. The Company has seen elevated levels of cat activity and\nunusual weather events in recent years. The Company will continue to closely monitor cat activity\nand amend its appetite for natural catastrophe business to reflect market conditions and climate\nchange developments. As this business is predominantly short tail in nature, the Company can re-\n4\nbalance the portfolio quickly, if required. The risks associated with climate change were also\nconsidered in the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) process. The non renewal of the FAL\nbook, effective January 1, 2023, significantly reduces the Company’s exposure to climate change.\nValuation for solvency purpose\nAssets, technical provisions and other liabilities are valued in the Company’s Solvency II Balance\nSheet according to the Solvency II Directive and related guidance. The principle that underlies the\nvaluation methodology for Solvency II purposes is the amount for which they could be exchanged,\ntransferred or settled by knowledgeable and willing third parties in an arm’s length transaction.\nThe Company carried out a reconciliation of differences between the valuation of assets and liabilities\nmade under FRS and Solvency II. These include the valuation of technical provisions and reinsurance\nrecoveries and the exclusion of certain assets and liabilities. The reconciliation for the year ended\n2023 is disclosed in section D.\nThere were no material changes to the Company’s method of valuation for solvency purpose during\n2023, or at the time of publication.\nCapital management\nThe Company aims to hold sufficient own funds in order that it maintains a margin to cover the\nSolvency Capital Requirement(‘SCR’) and Minimum Capital Requirement (‘MCR’) in line with the\nBoard approved risk appetite. Further details on capital management policies can be found in section\nE.\nAt 31 December 2023, the Company had Own Funds of US$58.7m (2022: US$68.9m) and a solvency\ncapital requirement of US$39.4m (2022: US$41.9m), giving an SCR ratio of 149% (2022: 165%). The\ndecline in own funds can be primarily attributed to the inclusion of a foreseeable dividend of $20m in\nthe own funds calculation.\nThere were no material changes to the Company’s method of capital management during 2023 or at\nthe time of publication.\nA.

The Chairperson is an independent non-executive director.\nThe Risk Committee meets as often as necessary but at least 3 times a year.\nInformation on Director’s shares and interests during the reporting period\nThe directors and secretary, who held office at 31 December 2023, had no beneficial interest in the\nshare capital of the Company or any other group Company at any time during the financial year except\nthat certain directors had beneficial ownership in the parent company, Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd (the\n“Parent”), a NASDAQ listed publicly held company. Cumulatively the directors beneficial interest in\nthe Parent included 275,255 restricted shares subject to forfeiture and 657,783 ordinary shares held\ndirectly.\nRemuneration Policies & Practices\nThe Company offers a range of benefits to its employees, which include compensation based on salary,\nincentive compensation, health benefits, pension benefits, and group stock compensation in the form of\nrestricted share units of the parent.\n16\nRemuneration plays an important behavioural role in the Company’s risk management process. The\nCompany’s Remuneration Policy establishes a Remuneration Framework that attracts, rewards and\nretains high performing employees while at all times aligning the interests of such employees with\nthose of shareholders in a manner consistent with business strategy and within our stated risk appetite.\nIn particular, a portion of overall compensation is deferred and dependent on long-term financial\nperformance.\nThe remuneration of the directors is set annually by the Shareholder and is externally benchmarked to\nensure consistency with the market.\nFurther information on the following key functions can be found in the sections below;\n– Risk Management function (see Section B.3)\n– Compliance function (see Section B.4)\n– Internal Audit function (see Section B.5)\n– Actuarial function (see Section B.6)\nB.2 Fit and proper requirements\nThe Company’s Fitness, Probity and Conduct policy has been aligned with the CBI’s Guidance on\nFitness and Probity Standards 2023 and the Fitness and Probity Standards 2023 (collectively the “F&P\nrequirements”), Part 3 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010 (the ‘Act’), and The Central Bank\n(Individual Accountability Framework) Act, 2023 (“IAF Act”) .\nThe Board will satisfy itself on reasonable grounds that a person complies with the F&P Standards\nbefore appointing that person to a controlled function (“CF”). The Board will not appoint a person to a\npre-approval controlled function (“PCF”), until the CBI has approved the appointment in writing.\nThe following factors are taken into account when deciding whether an individual is fit and proper:\n• their honesty, integrity and reputation;\n• their competence and capability; and\n• their financial soundness.\nFitness and propriety checks are made before an individual is appointed to carry out a controlled\nfunction and also periodically thereafter.\nThe Compliance function will assist the Board to comply with the obligations set out in the Act, some\nof which include:\n• due diligence;\n• outsourcing;\n• continuing obligations;\n• ensuring that all PCF holders are pre-approved by the CBI prior to appointment;\n• maintaining records of all persons performing CF’s and PCF’s; and\n• verifying that persons in controlled functions have the necessary skills, experience, and\nqualifications.\nThe IAF Act introduces prescribed standards of behaviour that will apply to CFs and PCFs when\nperforming their roles; specifically, the Common Conduct Standards (apply to all CFs and all PCFs, as\na sub-set of CFs) and Additional Conduct Standards (apply to all PCFs and CF1s only) (hereinafter\ncollectively referred to as ‘the Conduct Standards’).The application of the Conduct Standards have\n17\nbeen notified to all CFs/ PCFs on implementation of the IAF Act and will be notified on the\nappointment of any new CFs/ PCFs thereafter.\nB.3 Risk management system including the own risk and solvency assessment\nRisk Management System\nRisk is not a concept that exists independently of people. We believe that our success will be\ndetermined by the strength of our people, and we seek to employ a diverse array of talented and\nexperienced people who perform well as a team. Our executive management team promotes a risk\nmanagement culture and all staff are encouraged to be active participants in the management of risks\nfaced by the Company.\nWe employ risk management as a continuous process to ensure we have an appropriate understanding\nof the nature and significance of the risks to which our business activities expose us, including our\nsensitivity to those risks and our ability to mitigate them. Risk management is used to provide a\ncommon ‘risk language’ within the Company. In particular, we transpose our business strategy into a\nRisk Appetite Statement that clearly captures the risks inherent in our strategy and our tolerance for\nthose risks.\nRisk Appetite Statement\nThe Risk Appetite Statement identifies the material risks, including emerging risks, inherent in our\nbusiness strategy and model, and our appetite for those risks over a short, medium, and long-term\nhorizon. The Risk Appetite Statement includes:\n• Risk categories inherent in our business strategy and model, specifically;\n◦ Strategic\n◦ Governance\n◦ Risk management\n◦ Group support\n◦ Capital management\n◦ Underwriting\n◦ Investing\n◦ Reserving\n◦ Claims management\n◦ Counterparty default\n◦ Reputation\n◦ Regulatory\n◦ Operations\n◦ Legal\n◦ Information technology (“IT”)\n• Risk mitigation efforts to manage risk and aggregation of risk;\n• Risk metrics and tolerances to measure risk;\n• Solvency metrics to measure capital requirements arising from our planning and ORSA process;\nand\n• Stress scenarios and the situations that would warrant ad-hoc stress tests.\nRisk Management Policy\nAnnually, the Chief Risk Officer presents the Company’s Risk Management Policy to the Board of\nDirectors (the “Board”) for review and approval. The goals of this policy are to:\n18\n• Set out the roles and responsibilities for:\n◦ Implementing and reviewing an effective Risk Management Framework;\n◦ Setting and communicating the risk appetite;\n◦ Instilling a risk culture within the Company;\n◦ Ensuring remuneration arrangements do not encourage excessive risk-taking;\n◦ Contingency planning;\n◦ Reviewing, approving, and communicating of policies;\n◦ Putting appropriate controls in place;\n◦ The assessment and reporting of the Company’s risk profile in relation to the risk appetite;\n◦ Escalated risks and remediation plans; and\n◦ Ensuring sufficient knowledge, expertise and resources are available, and adequate\nprocedures and communication channels are in place for risk management purposes;\n• Set out the rights and powers of the Risk Management function;\n• Set out the elements of the Risk Management Framework;\n• Set out the structure and contents of the Risk Appetite Statement; and\n• Set out the risk escalation procedure.\nThe Board has overall responsibility for ensuring there is an effective Risk Management Framework.\nThe Board receives regular reporting updates from the Chief Risk Officer. The Risk Management\nFramework is also managed through the following functions:\nRisk Committee\nThe Risk Committee is responsible for advising the Board on matters relating to the Company’s Risk\nManagement Framework.\nGroup Remuneration Committee\nThe remuneration strategy is overseen at a Group level and adopted by the Company’s Board of\nDirectors. The Group Remuneration Committee, in conjunction with the Risk Committee, is\nresponsible for ensuring that remuneration arrangements do not encourage excessive risk-taking.\nRisk Management Function\nThe Risk Management function is responsible for monitoring and advising the Executive Management\nteam and Risk Committee of the Company’s risk profile in relation to its risk appetite. This is done\nquarterly, or as soon as practicable, if there is a material change to the risk profile.\nOther Functions and Organisational Units\nOther functions and organisational units, such as Internal Audit, Compliance, Actuarial, Finance,\nOperations and Underwriting, are responsible for performing risk management related tasks as needed\nand providing the Executive Management team and Risk Management function with pertinent,\naccurate and timely information.\nRights and Powers of the Risk Management Function\nThe Risk Management function is a key function within the Company. The Chief Risk Officer has\noverall responsibility for the Risk Management function. As such, the Chief Risk Officer has the right\nand power to ensure that:\n• The Risk Management function has sufficient resources;\n• There are sufficient resources for other functions and organisational units to be able to\neffectively perform risk management related tasks as well as business tasks; and\n• There are adequate policies and procedures in place so that information required from other\nfunctions and organisational units within the Company is pertinent, accurate and timely.\n19\nRisk Management Framework\nRisk management does not exist in a vacuum but is used to allow for an appropriate understanding of\nthe nature and significance of the risks inherent in the business strategy and model. The elements of\nthe Risk Management Framework are:\n• Risk Appetite Statement (see above);\n• Risk culture (including remuneration);\n• Policies (including procedures therein);\n• Contingency plans;\n• Internal controls;\n• Reporting - the reporting of appropriate information to allow effective governance of risks and\nthe Risk Management Framework;\n• Communication - the communication of the risk appetite, contingency plans, policies, and any\nother appropriate information within the Company as a whole;\n• Governance;\n• Compliance; and\n• Internal audit.\nRisk Escalation\nThe escalation of a risk is the responsibility of the Executive Management Team. A risk is escalated\nwhenever deemed necessary by the Executive Management Team but must be escalated in the event\nthat a risk tolerance breaches the Red threshold (see Risk Appetite Statement). In the event of a risk\nescalation, the Executive Management Team shall determine if an ad hoc meeting of the Risk\nCommittee is warranted, or if the risk can be considered at the next scheduled Risk Committee\nmeeting. The Executive Management Team shall also draw up a remediation plan for the escalated risk\nand provide it to the Risk Committee.\nThe Risk Committee reviews and monitors any escalated risks. The Risk Committee will determine\nwhether a risk should be escalated to the Board. Ultimately, the Board is responsible for determining if\nan escalated risk is a material breach of the Risk Appetite Statement. A material breach and\nappropriate remedy will be communicated to the Central Bank of Ireland within five business days of\nthe Board becoming aware of the breach.\nRisk Management Culture\nThe following activities were performed in 2023 to promote a risk management culture, and will\ncontinue to be performed in the future:\n• Regular ‘Town Hall’ meetings were held;\n• Training was provided to staff on IT security awareness;\n• The Risk Appetite Statement and ORSA were shared with employees; and\n• Background check and due diligence was carried on all new hires (including directors and PCF\nholders).\nOwn Risk and Solvency Assessment\nThe Company is responsible for completing an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”), which\nis not only an integral part of the Company’s overall Solvency II regime, but also of the Company’s\nsystem of governance. The ORSA is reviewed and approved by the Board at least annually, or more\nfrequently if there are significant changes to the Company’s risk profile. The main purpose of the\n20\nORSA is to evaluate all material risks faced by the Company and assess whether the level of capital is\nadequate to cover the risks presented.\nThe material risks are fully documented in our Risk Appetite Statement and the review of the risk\nenvironment of the ORSA closely follows the structure of the Risk Appetite Statement. The ORSA\nalso collates work performed in other areas of the risk management system and ensures that proper\nevaluation and reviews are being conducted in line with regulatory guidelines.\nAs part of the ORSA process, the Company examines the significance with which the risk profile of\nthe Company deviates from the assumptions underlying the Standard Formula and the impact of these\ndeviations on the Own Solvency Needs of the Company. The ORSA reviews the level of surplus\ncapital, produces reports, and makes strategic recommendations on the adequacy of capital. The ORSA\nalso applies stressed scenarios and considers adverse conditions the Company may face and\ndetermines measures to address the capital needs under these conditions.\nWhile the Company feels that all material quantifiable risks are fully covered in the Standard Formula,\ncertain underlying assumptions within the Standard Formula may not accurately reflect the risk profile\nof the Company. The most material differences that impact the Standard Formula are:\n• Whole-account aggregate stop-loss - cannot be applied under the Standard Formula, in a manner\nwhich reflects the commercial effect of the cover.\n• Long-short equity investments - no credit is given for short positions or the ability to reallocate to\nother securities (such as cash or bonds) in a short timeframe.\n• Funds withheld treatment - counterparty credit exposure to GRL is mitigated by the funds withheld\nnature of our FAL business, where we do not pay any reinsurance premium to GRL until the\nconclusion of the contract. We do not currently reflect this in the Standard Formula.\nThe scope of the ORSA process includes, but is not limited to, the following list of inputs and\nprocedures:\n• Board evaluation of business strategy, objectives, and draft business plan;\n• Review of Risk Appetite Statement, risk profile and evaluation of key risks identified;\n• Risk management system processes, policies, and outputs;\n• Consideration of the results of stress tests and pessimistic scenarios applied to each risk area;\n• Deliberation on how additional capital can be sourced if required;\n• The Company’s investment strategy and risks;\n• Consideration of how risk can be mitigated including through diversification;\n• Review of the results of the SCR, MCR and appropriateness and compliance with the Standard\nFormula;\n• Review of the competence and capability of the Actuarial and Risk functions;\n• Risk Committee review of risk tolerance limits set by the Board; and\n• Decisions and action plans following the output of the ORSA process.\nThe results and conclusions from the ORSA process are communicated to senior management and key\nstaff through the ORSA Report, following Board approval, and a copy is provided to the CBI.\nFollowing the ORSA assessments under the Solvency II regime, the Board has considered the level of\ncapital held to be adequate.\nB.4 Internal control system\nThe Company’s Board has ultimate responsibility for the operation of the corporate governance\nframework. A corporate governance framework shall not remain effective unless it develops to take\naccount of new and emerging risks, control failures, market expectations or changes in the Company’s\n21\ncircumstances or business objectives. It is in this spirit that it is acknowledged that the effectiveness of\nthe corporate governance framework needs to be reviewed on a continual basis.\nThe Board delegates its authority through a structure of committees and sub-committees which are\nthere to facilitate the effectiveness and efficiency of operations and to assist in the compliance with\nlaws and regulations. The committees of the Board currently comprise of the Audit Committee and the\nRisk Committee. However, despite delegating responsibilities, the overall Board has collective\nresponsibility and accountability for the corporate governance of the Company, and this cannot be\ndelegated.\nWhilst certain decisions are reserved exclusively for the Board, an effective control system of\ndelegated authority operates from top to bottom, within the Company, through Terms of Reference\n(TOR) for the Board and sub-committees and through individual job descriptions. These TOR’s are\nreviewed, at least annually, to ensure they remain relevant by taking into account the continually\nevolving business environment.\nThe Company’s internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting. The internal controls over financial reporting includes\npolicies and procedures relating to maintenance of financial records; accurate recording of\ntransactions, authorised processing of receipts and payments; and the prevention or detection of\nunauthorised use, purchase or sale of the Company’s assets.\nThe Company maintains and evaluates the effectiveness of the financial reporting and disclosure\ncontrols annually as part of the Group’s annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company’s internal controls are part of its Risk Management Framework, being the first line of\ndefence in the ‘three lines of defence’ model the Company has implemented:\n1. Business Operations - Internal Controls\nInternal controls are the measures that are incorporated into systems and processes to control day-to-\nday activities. The internal controls for the Company are based on the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganisations of the Treadway Commission’s (COSO’s) Internal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013 COSO Framework).\nThe objectives of internal controls are:\n• Effective and efficient operations, including safeguarding of assets against loss;\n• Internal and external financial and non-financial reporting, in accordance with the Company’s\npolicies and procedures; and\n• Adherence to laws and regulations.\nComponents of internal controls include:\n• Control environment;\n• Risk assessment;\n• Control activities;\n• Information and communication; and\n• Monitoring activities.\nThere are adequate controls implemented to ensure compliance and to highlight any significant\nbreakdown in controls or inadequacy of process.\n2. Oversight Functions\nThis includes the Compliance and Risk functions. The Company has implemented policies which\n22\ndescribe the Board’s approach to key areas of the business, and procedures, where appropriate, which\ndescribe how the Board fulfills its responsibilities.\n3. Independent Assurance Providers\nThe Company's Internal Audit function prepares, with the approval of the Audit Committee, a three-\nyear audit plan which covers all the key areas of the Company over the three year period. Additionally,\nthe Audit Committee has the ability to request ad-hoc reviews to be conducted at any point during the\nyear.\nIn addition, the external auditors provide an independent opinion that the audited financial statements\ngive a true and fair view in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in Ireland (“Irish\nGAAP”) and that they have been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of the\nCompanies Act 2014 and the European Communities Regulations 2015.\nThe Compliance function, in liaison with the Board, is responsible for ensuring that all Company\npolicies are reviewed at least annually to make certain that they are still fit for purpose. Each relevant\narea of the business is responsible for ensuring that their procedure(s) are up to date and reflect how\nthe business operates. All reviews are recorded, and version control is maintained. All amendments to\npolicies are submitted to the Board for approval.\nThere is a compliance monitoring programme in place to ensure that the Company has fulfilled all its\nlegislative and regulatory requirements, and adheres to its policies and procedures. This is completed\nby the Compliance function on a continuous basis and presented to the Board on a quarterly basis.\nCompliance Function\nThe Company’s Compliance Policy sets out the role and responsibilities of the Compliance function\nand is reviewed by the Board on an annual basis. The role of the Compliance function is to act as a\ndefence, working alongside the Risk and Internal Audit functions, for the business and its customers,\nand provide an independent assurance to the Board and Non-Executive Directors that the Company is\nconducting its business in a compliant manner. This is achieved by completing the following\nobjectives:\n• Developing a compliance plan to provide comfort to the Risk Committee on the Company’s\noverall compliance with Board approved polices, the Companies Act 2014 (“the Act”), CBI\nrequirements and other applicable legislation;\n• Regular reporting to the Company’s Risk Committee, senior management, and Group\npersonnel on compliance matters;\n• Managing the Company’s relationship with the CBI;\n• Monitoring regulatory change and communicating impactful developments;\n• Reviewing and developing policies required under the Corporate Governance Code and/or\nEIOPA guidelines for Board approval;\n• Assisting the Company in complying with Solvency II requirements with a focus on Pillar 2\nand Pillar 3 requirements; and\n• Reviewing internal controls, processes and procedures on a planned basis from the viewpoint\nof effective compliance and advising on steps necessary to ensure compliance.\nThe Board supports the Compliance function, makes available such resources as is necessary, and\nprovides access to all relevant documentation and information from the business, in order that the\nCompliance function can meet its objectives.\nB.5 Internal audit function\nThe Company supports Internal Audit as an independent and objective assurance activity designed to\n23\nadd value and improve the Company’s operations. It assists the Company in accomplishing its\nobjectives by bringing an independent, systemic and disciplined approach to the process of evaluating\nand improving the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management, control and governance\nprocesses.\nInternal Audit derives its authority from the Board through the Audit Committee. The Internal Auditor\nreports functionally to the Audit Committee and administratively to the Chief Executive Officer\n(“CEO”). The Internal Auditor meets with the Audit Committee and the CEO to discuss all audits. The\nInternal Auditor operates with independence and authority in relation to audits carried out and has\nunrestricted access to the Chairman, the Executive Management Team and the Chairs of the Audit and\nRisk Committees. Internal Audit is authorised to examine any of the activities of the Company and has\nunrestricted access to all records, assets and personnel necessary to discharge its responsibilities.\nThe Company’s Internal Audit function has been outsourced to EisnerAmper Ireland (“EisnerAmper”).\nA Partner at EisnerAmper is approved by the CBI for the PCF-13 (Head of Internal Audit) role.\nEisnerAmper prepares, with the approval of the Audit Committee, a three-year audit plan which covers\nall the key areas of the Company over the three year period. Additionally, the Audit Committee has the\nability to request ad-hoc reviews to be conducted by EisnerAmper. EisnerAmper works closely with\nmanagement and any outsourced service provider of the Company and reports directly to the Audit\nCommittee.\nThe purpose, scope, authority and responsibilities of the Internal Audit function are set out in full\nwithin the Internal Audit Policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors and which is\nreviewed and updated on an annual basis, or more frequently, if required. There have been no\nsignificant changes to the policy in the current year.\nB.6 Actuarial Function\nThe Actuarial services to support the business are outsourced to a combination of:\na) Group Actuarial Department in GRL; and\nb) Allied Risk Management.\nThe activities of the Actuarial Department are split between those involved in pricing and GAAP\nreserving, performed by the Company, the Group Actuarial Department in GRL and those activities of\nthe Actuarial function, performed by Allied Risk Management, who coordinate the calculation of the\ntechnical provisions and provide independent oversight and validation. The role of the Head of\nActuarial Function (HoAF) is outsourced to Allied Risk Management.\nThe Actuarial function derives its authority from the Board through the Audit Committee. The Head of\nActuarial Function (HoAF) reports functionally to the Audit Committee and administratively to the\nChief Executive Officer (CEO).\nThe objective of the Actuarial function is to ensure a standard and appropriate calculation of reserves\nand technical provisions, consistent with our business strategy and statutory and regulatory\nrequirements and within our stated risk appetite. The detailed objectives are to:\n• Coordinate the calculation of technical provisions;\n• Ensure the appropriateness of the methodologies and underlying models used as well as the\nassumptions made in the calculation of technical provisions;\n• Assess the sufficiency and quality of the data used in the calculation of technical provisions;\n• Compare best estimates against experience;\n• Inform the Board of the reliability and adequacy of the calculation of technical provisions;\n24\n• Oversee the calculation of technical provisions in cases where there is insufficient data quality\n(as set out in Article 82 of the Directive);\n• Express an opinion on the overall underwriting policy;\n• Express an opinion on the adequacy of reinsurance arrangements; and,\n• Contribute to the effective implementation of the risk-management system, in particular with\nrespect to the risk modelling underlying the calculation of the capital requirements.\nEach of these activities is undertaken on at least an annual basis and the outcome reported to the Board\nin an internal actuarial report.\nIn addition to responsibilities in relation to the technical provisions, and the requirements to express\nopinions on underwriting policy and reinsurance arrangements, the HoAF contributes to the effective\nimplementation of the risk management system of the Company. In particular:\n• In relation to the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) and Minimum Capital Requirement\n(MCR), the HoAF reviews the model used by the Company to calculate the SCR and MCR.\nSpecifically, any perceived or possible inconsistencies or issues identified in the model results\nare raised.\n• The HoAF provides an Actuarial Opinion on the ORSA process annually. The opinion\naddresses the following:\n• The range of risks and the adequacy of stress scenarios considered as part of the ORSA\nprocess.\n• The appropriateness of the financial projections included within the ORSA process.\n• Whether the undertaking is continuously complying with the requirements regarding the\ncalculation of TPs and potential risks arising from the uncertainties connected to this\ncalculation.\nB.7 Outsourcing\nThe Company recognises the need for an Outsourcing Policy which is consistent with and promotes\nsound and effective risk management and enables the Company to identify, manage, monitor, and\nreport on such outsourcing risk to which it is or might be exposed. The Board have adopted this policy\nand it:\n• Sets out the roles and responsibilities within the Company in relation to outsourcing;\n• Sets out those functions which may be outsourced by the Company;\n• Provides clarity on the set of principles on which the Company outsources critical or important\nfunctions or activities (“CIFAs”);\n• Describes the processes and procedures that the Company carries out prior to outsourcing,\nincluding the assessment and impact of the outsourcing on its business; and\n• Describes the processes and procedures post outsourcing, including the level of review,\nreporting and monitoring required by the Company.\nThe following is a list of the CIFAs the Company has outsourced together with the jurisdiction in\nwhich the service providers of such functions or activities are located. The person within the Company\nwith responsibility for these outsourced functions is the Chief Executive Officer. The Company will\nnot outsource a CIFA where the outsourcing would materially impair the quality of the Company’s\nsystem of governance, unduly increase operational risk, impair the ability of the CBI to review the\nCompany’s compliance with its obligations or undermine the continuous and satisfactory service to\npolicyholders (Article 49(2) of the SII Directive).\n25\nName of Service/Function Name of Service Provider (SP) Jurisdiction\nExternal Outsourcing:\nInvestment Advisor DME Advisors, L.P.

Risk Profile\nRisk Management\nThe goal of the Company’s management of risk is to set out the level of risk the Company is willing to\nassume in implementing its business strategy. The Company’s business strategy cannot be\nimplemented without taking risks. The Company seeks to comprehensively quantify all risks inherent\nin the business strategy through scenario testing and ad hoc stress tests, and where necessary apply risk\nmitigation techniques.\nThe Company implements appropriate polices, contingency plans and controls as part of the\nCompany’s overall risk management system. Further information is detailed in Section B.3 above.\nC.1 Underwriting risk\nThe Company has a broad underwriting appetite for Property and Casualty business providing the\npricing and risk selection is appropriate. In general, the Company will write business selectively and in\nthose areas of the market believed to have the best risk-adjusted returns.\nRisk mitigation\nThe Company has entered into two retrocession contracts with its sister company, GRL:\n1. An 80% quota share on non-U.S. business; and\n2. An unlimited aggregate stop-loss which limits underwriting losses (including expenses, reserve\ndeterioration, counterparty default and collateral drawdown) to 5% of the Company’s\nShareholders Equity.\nThe Company has also entered into a number of external retrocession contracts to manage its overall\nexposure. Key contracts include an excess of loss contract to protect the Company’s Marine, Energy\nand Terror book and a number of quota share contracts related to specific Specialty and Motor\ncontracts.\nLine of business\nSee Section A.2. Underwriting Performance for a breakdown of the lines of business the Company\nwrote in 2023 and 2022.\nGeography\nSee Section A.2. Underwriting Performance for a breakdown of the geographies the Company wrote in\n2023.\nTarget profitability\nWe seek to underwrite a portfolio that is profitable and contributes to book value per share.\nSee Section A.2. Underwriting Performance for breakdown of the Company’s 2023 and 2022\nunderwriting performance.\nUnderwriting process\nThe assessment and pricing of reinsurance risk are key components of the Company’s underwriting\nprocess. Each submitted transaction is underwritten and priced by an underwriting team consisting of\nat least one underwriter and actuary. If the underwriting team wishes to write the transaction, then a\n27\ndeal meeting with senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Head of Underwriting,\nGroup Chief Executive Officer, and Group Chief Risk Officer, is held to obtain approval before\nbinding. The Board plays an active role in overseeing underwriting. The Board approves the\nUnderwriting Plan and Underwriting Guidelines annually and is required to authorise deals which\nmeet specific criteria. An underwriting update is provided to the Board quarterly.\nRisk factors\nUnderwriting inherently involves assuming reinsurance risk. Potential external risk factors that could\nimpact our current or future underwriting portfolio are:\n1. Rating\n2. Climate change\n3. Inflation\n4. Emerging risks\nRating\nIn September 2023, the A.M. Best rating of the Company and its sister company, Greenlight\nReinsurance Ltd. (“GRL”) was re-affirmed at “A- Excellent” rating with a rating outlook of stable.\nA.M. Best highlighted that Greenlights financial strength remains “very strong,”.\nA downgrade below “A-” is likely to have a significant negative impact on the Company and its ability\nto underwrite London market specialty business.\nClimate change\nThe Company monitors the underwriting environment to track changes in innovation, climate, and the\npolitical environment.\nGlobal warming has the potential to have a significant impact on weather patterns and loss events. The\nCompany is exposed to Climate change primarily from its FAL book and a limited number of natural\ncatastrophe reinsurance contracts it writes. This exposure is reducing with the non-renewal of the FAL\nbook, effective January 1, 2023.\nThe Company will continue to closely monitor cat activity and amend its appetite for natural\ncatastrophe business to reflect market conditions and climate change developments. As this business is\npredominantly short tail in nature, the Company can re-balance the portfolio quickly, if required.\nAs a small specialty reinsurer our strategy is primarily to be nimble and to position ourselves to take\nadvantage of market opportunity. We do not have any long-term commitments to any particular class,\nand we consider our strategy annually, as part of our annual planning process. If climate change\nsignificantly impacts the profitability of certain classes, we can amend our strategy accordingly.\nThe Company is also exposed to a certain amount of operational risk linked to cat exposures, as certain\nservices are outsourced to GRL, which is based in the Cayman Islands and are exposed to Atlantic\nhurricanes. GRL has a robust Business Continuity Plan which is designed to respond to a major\nhurricane event. In particular, all IT systems are backed up outside the Cayman Islands and the\nCompany has concluded that the services provided by GRL will not be significantly impacted in the\nevent of a major hurricane hitting the Cayman Islands.\nInflation\nWe have seen an increase in inflationary pressures in recent years linked to supply chain issues and\nincreased geopolitical tension.It is possible that inflation could remain elevated for some time. Higher\n28\nthan anticipated inflation could lead to an increase in loss costs and the need to strengthen loss\nreserves. The impact of inflation on loss costs will likely be more pronounced for longer tail business\nlines, where it takes a period of time to finalise and settle claims. In general, the Company’s\nunderwriting book is skewed towards shorter tail classes and therefore the impact should be less\npronounced.\nEmerging risks\nEmerging risks are newly developing or changing risks which are difficult to quantify, and which may\nhave a major impact. The Company monitors the underwriting environment to track changes in\ninnovation, climate, and political environment. Some of the initial emerging risks identified include:\n• Taxation - During 2021, the Irish Government agreed to sign up to the OECD International Tax\nAgreement which may increase Corporation Tax rates for multinationals with revenues in\nexcess of $750m from 12.5% to 15%. Currently the Group falls below the $750m threshold,\nhowever in time, this may result in an increase in the corporation tax rate applied to the\nCompany. In the short term, the Company has deferred tax losses and as such this change will\nnot be material.\n• Offshore Jurisdictions - The Company is reliant on the support of its parent and sister\ncompanies who are both domiciled in the Cayman Islands. Any clamp down on offshore\njurisdictions could impact the Cayman Islands and, as a result, the Company. Recent\ndiscussions, regarding international taxation have highlighted the possibility of a withholding\ntax on certain transactions with offshore jurisdictions. If the Company was to withhold tax on\nany premium due to GRL under the current intercompany agreements, it may significantly\nimpact the effectiveness of these agreements. The Company will continue to monitor\ndevelopments in this area.\n• Cyber risks - Cyber risk is considered as a major disruptor to financial services. Cyber risk\nthreatens data integrity and business continuity in an ever-interconnected financial system. The\nuse of cloud and the dependency on external service providers also adds to the complexity of\nmanaging this risk. The Company and its parent have agreed to implement the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework. The Company is\nstrengthening its IT controls with a view to being compliant with the NIST Cybersecurity\nFramework.\nC.2 Market risk\nThe Company is exposed to market risk including interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations on\nfinancial instruments that are valued at market prices. Market movements can be volatile and difficult\nto predict. This may affect the ultimate gains or losses realised upon the sale of its holdings, as well as\nthe amount of net investment income reported in the statements of comprehensive income.\nManagement has regular dialogue with the Company’s investment advisor to monitor the Company’s\npositions and changes in market conditions.\nEquity Price Risk\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Company’s investment portfolio consisted primarily of an investment in\nSolasglas Investments LP (“SILP”), which holds underlying equity securities and equity-based\nderivative instruments, the carrying values of which are primarily based on quoted market prices.\n29\nGenerally, market prices of common equity securities are subject to fluctuation, which could cause the\namount to be realised upon the closing of the position to differ significantly from the current reported\nvalue. This risk is partly mitigated by the presence of both long and short equity securities. As of 31\nDecember 2023, a 10% decline in the price of each of these listed equity securities and equity-based\nderivative instruments would result in a loss of US$1.2m.\nComputations of the prospective effects of hypothetical equity price changes are based on numerous\nassumptions, including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of investment securities,\nand should not be relied on as indicative of future results.\nForeign Currency Risk\nForeign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate\nbecause of changes in exchange rates and produce an adverse effect of net income and capital when\nmeasured in the Company's functional currency. The Company's cash flows and earnings are subject to\nfluctuations due to exchange rate variations. Foreign currency risk exists by nature of the Company's\nglobal reinsurance program. The Company's principal transactions are carried out in US dollars though\nit has exposure to foreign exchange risk principally with respect to Sterling and Euro.\nThe Company does not seek to specifically match the liabilities under reinsurance policies that are\npayable in foreign currencies with investments denominated in such currencies; the Company\ncontinually monitors the exposure to potential foreign currency losses and would consider the use of\nforward foreign currency exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate against adverse foreign currency\nmovements.\nThe schedule below shows the surplus or deficiency held in each of the main currencies by the\nCompany at the year ended December 31st 2023:\nLiabilities and Surplus /\nForeign Currency Assets Equity (Deficiency)\n(US$ in thousands) (US$ in thousands) (US$ in thousands)\nBritish Pound 223,862 218,941 4,921\nEuro 12,999 14,128 (1,129)\nUnited States Dollar 280,532 285,225 (4,692)\nOther 4,044 3,143 901\nTotal 521,437 521,437 —\nThe following table summarises the net impact that a 10% increase and decrease in the value of the\nUnited States dollar against foreign currencies would have on the Company as of December 31st\n2023:\n30\n10% increase in 10% decrease in\nU.S. dollar U.S. dollar\nChange in Change in\nForeign Currency fair value fair value\n(US$ in thousands) (US$ in thousands)\nBritish Pound 492 (492)\nEuro (113) 113\nOther 90 (90)\nTotal 469 (469)\nComputations of the prospective effects of hypothetical currency price changes are based on numerous\nassumptions, including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of investment in\nsecurities denominated in foreign currencies and related hedges, and should not be relied on as\nindicative of future results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company has limited exposure to interest rate risk given the mix of its investment portfolio.\nOur “Deposits other than cash equivalents” earn interest at rates that generally follow the movements\nof the short-term U.S. Treasury rates. At December 31, 2023, a 100 basis points increase or decrease in\nU.S. Federal Funds Rate would result in approximately a $97k increase or decrease, respectively in our\ninterest income on an annualised basis.\nThe caption “Deposits to Cedants” in our SII Balance Sheet represents amounts held by cedents,\nincluding the Lloyd’s syndicates in which we participate. These syndicates invest a portion of the\npremiums withheld in fixed-income and variable-yield securities, which expose us to interest rate risk.\nAt December 31st 2023, a 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an\nestimated $272k loss or gain, respectively.\nThe Company’s investment in SILP includes interest rate sensitive securities, such as corporate and\nsovereign debt instruments and interest rate swaps. The primary market risk exposure for any debt\ninstrument is interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, the market value of the Company's long fixed-\nincome portfolio falls, and the opposite is also true as interest rates fall. Additionally, some derivative\ninvestments may also be sensitive to interest rates and their value may indirectly fluctuate with\nchanges in interest rates.\nAs of December 31st 2023, a 100 basis points increase or decrease in interest rates would have would\nresult in approximately a $152k increase or a decrease of $347k on the value of our Investment\nPortfolio.\nThe Company, along with DME Advisors, monitors the net exposure to interest rate risk and generally\ndo not expect changes in interest rates to have a materially adverse impact on our operations.\nPrudent Person Principle\nOur investment strategy seeks long term returns through disciplined security selection, portfolio\ndiversity and an integrated approach to risk management. Investments are to be selected and monitored\n31\nto balance the goals of safety, stability, liquidity, growth and after-tax total return with the need to\ncomply with regulatory investment requirements.\nWe recognise that under the Solvency II Prudent Person Principle, assets held to cover the technical\nprovisions must be invested “in a manner appropriate to the nature and duration” of the liabilities, and\n“in the best interest of all policyholders and beneficiaries taking into account any disclosed policy\nobjectives” (Reg.141(2)(c) of S.I. 485 of 2015). Therefore, the assets covering the technical provisions\ntakes account of the type of business carried on by the Company in such a way as to secure the safety,\nyield and marketability of its investments, which the Company will ensure are diversified and\nadequately spread. The Company, where applicable, and in accordance with A. 132(2) of the SII\nDirective, only invests in assets whose risks it can properly identify, measure, monitor, control, report\nand take into account in its ORSA.\nOur equity portfolio consists primarily of long and short equities. The Investment Advisor seeks to\nachieve capital appreciation by buying securities with trading values materially lower than their\nintrinsic values and by selling short securities with trading values materially higher than their intrinsic\nvalues. The portfolio aims to achieve high absolute rates of return while minimising the risk of capital\nloss. We seek to combine the analytical discipline of determining intrinsic value with a practical\nunderstanding of markets. We seek to invest in mispriced securities where we can ascertain the reason\nfor the market’s mispricing. Our approach is rooted in fundamental analysis and rigorous examination\nof financial statements.\nWe believe the investment guidelines continue to be appropriate and reasonable and meet the Prudent\nPerson Principle, as they currently restrict the level of long/short equity investing, promote a lower\nlevel of investment fees correlated with current and past investment performance, curtail excessive\nconcentration in a small number of investments whilst enabling the Company to participate in higher\nAssets Under Management and yields through active management of the portfolio.\nInvesting and ESG risks\nAs part of investing and overall portfolio management, global financial events are monitored and\nconsidered. Discussions have been held with the Investment Manager on events such as the Covid 19\npandemic, Inflation, and International conflicts. The Company’s investment strategy is based on a\nvalue orientated investing strategy (i.e., buy undervalued securities (longs) and sell overvalued\nsecurities (shorts)). As such, the portfolio in general is not heavily correlated with specific global\nevents or market trends. In recent years there has been a growth in ESG (Environmental, Social and\nGovernance) investing or sustainable investing. It is possible that the continued focus on sustainable\ninvesting will lead to additional disclosures and possible market and regulatory pressures. The\nCompany are cognisant of the risk of stranded assets which are defined by Lloyd’s as “as assets that\nhave suffered from unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluation or conversion to liabilities.”\nThese write downs are caused by environmental factors such as climate change and society’s attitudes\ntowards it, has become increasingly high profile. Changes to the physical environment driven by\nclimate change, and society’s response to these changes, could potentially strand entire regions and\nglobal industries within a short timeframe, leading to direct and indirect impacts on investment\nstrategies and liabilities. We will continue to monitor developments in this area and will continue to\nreview investment guidelines on a regular basis. Our portfolio is liquid, and changes can be\nimplemented at short notice if required.\nEmerging risks\nAs part of investing and overall portfolio management, global financial events are monitored and\nconsidered. Discussions were held with the Investment Manager on events such as Covid 19, Inflation,\nthe US\\China trade war, and International conflicts. The Company’s investment strategy is based on a\nvalue orientated investing strategy (i.e. buy undervalued securities (longs) and sell overvalued\nsecurities (shorts)). As such the portfolio is generally not heavily correlated with specific global events\nor market trends.\n32\nC.3 Credit risk\nThe Company conducts business with multiple external counterparties of various types. The unlimited\naggregate stop-loss purchased from GRL limits the loss of default or collateral drawdown by clients,\nbrokers, third party administrators and any other underwriting-related counterparties to 5% of the\nCompany’s Shareholders Equity. However, the Company still seeks to reasonably minimise the risk of\nfinancial loss from counterparty default.\nThe Company’s counterparty risk comes from various sources:\nRetrocession\nDeposits to Cedants\nOther Client-related\n• Letters of credit (“LOCs”) provided to clients;\n• Premiums receivable from clients;\n• Commission adjustments on contracts with clients; and\n• Retrocession.\nThird party services\n• Reinsurance intermediaries; and\n• Claims funds with third party claims administrators.\nInvestment and banking\n• Prime brokers / Custodians; and\n• Derivative counterparties.\nThe Company does not solely rely on the credit assessments of external rating agencies when assessing\nthe credit worthiness of counterparties.\nRetrocession\nRetrocession falls into one of three categories:\n1. The retrocession is with a third party and is tied to an inwards transaction;\n2. The retrocession is with a third party and stands alone; and\n3. The retrocession is internal between the Company and its affiliates.\nThe retrocession is with a third party and is tied to an inwards transaction\nThe third party may or may not be affiliated with the client. If the retrocessionaire is affiliated with the\nclient then the arrangement will usually be for the purposes of aligning the client’s interest with that of\nthe Company’s, and the retrocessionaire will often be a captive.\n33\nThe retrocession is with a third party and stands alone\nThe third party will typically be a professional reinsurer and the retrocession is likely to be on a\nsegment of the Company’s portfolio. The Company will assess the financial strength of any such\ncounterparty as part of its counterparty due diligence.\nThe retrocession is internal to the Company\nThe Company purchases a quota share and unlimited aggregate stop-loss protection from its sister\ncompany, GRL.\nDeposits to Cedants\nThe Company participates on FAL deals and has posted cash to support these deals. The Funds are\nheld in Trust at Lloyd’s and are invested in a Money Market Fund that is denominated in US dollars.\nThe FAL can be used to offset the loss reserves underwritten by the Company and the FAL balance\ncan be offset against these liabilities. The Lloyd’s Market is strongly capitalised with total capital,\nreserves and subordinated loan notes of £40.8bn at 30 June 2023 with a solvency ratio of 438% based\non the Lloyd’s Internal Model (approved by the PRA). The FAL deals are 80% retroceded to our sister\nCompany Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd. They have provided 80% of the required FAL cash to support\nthe 2021 and 2022 year of account.\nLetters of Credit and Trusts\nThe Company's sister company, GRL, issues LOCs on behalf of the Company under various facilities,\nfor the benefit of the Company's insureds. The collateral pledged as security relating to these LOCs is\nalso provided by GRL. In the event that the Company's insureds draw upon any LOCs, the Company\nshall be obligated to reimburse GRL the amount of the LOCs drawn by the insured. As of 31\nDecember 2023, US$16.9m (2022: US$16.7m) of LOCs were issued by GRL on behalf of the\nCompany and no LOCs were drawn by the Company's insureds for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nIn the event that GRL was unable to pledge its assets as security, the Company may have to pledge its\nown assets as security relating to the LOCs.\nThe LOCs are usually unconditional in that the client may drawdown the LOC at their sole option. The\nCompany periodically amends the size of issued LOCs to ensure they do not materially exceed the size\nof the Company’s obligations to clients. If a client were to inappropriately drawdown a LOC, the\nCompany would offset its obligations against the amount drawn down, while seeking legal remedy for\nthe unauthorised drawdown.\nIn addition to the letters of credit, the Company has established regulatory trust arrangements for\ncertain cedents. As of 31 December 2023, collateral of US$10.4m (2022: US$11.2m) was provided to\ncedents in the form of regulatory trust accounts.\nPremiums receivable from clients\nThe Company’s reinsurance contracts include the right to offset losses against unpaid premium. The\naggregate stop-loss agreement with GRL includes coverage for the risk of default by a client of the\nCompany.\nCommission adjustments on contracts with clients\nOn certain contracts, the client is paid a provisional commission which is adjusted at a pre-determined\nlater date based on the actual losses incurred. The adjustment may result in commission becoming due\nback from the client. If the client is rated “A- Excellent” or higher by A.M. Best, collateral may not be\nrequested. If the client is rated lower than “A- Excellent” or unrated, the client may be required to post\ncollateral for the potential possible downward adjustment in commission.\n34\nReinsurance intermediaries\nRemittances payable and receivable under a reinsurance contract are typically made via a reinsurance\nintermediary. Usually, the contract specifies that payments by the insured to the reinsurer are deemed\npaid once the payment is received by the reinsurance intermediary, and payments made by the\nreinsurer to the insured are only deemed paid once the reinsurance intermediary has forwarded that\npayment to the insured.\nThe Company’s exposure to intermediary counterparty risk is small owing to the following reasons:\n• Payments are typically processed by intermediaries every month\n• Payments are made on a net basis (premium less losses)\n• The Company’s business is primarily with large, well-established intermediaries.\nThe internal aggregate stop-loss includes coverage for the risk of default by an intermediary.\nClaims funds with third party claims administrators\nThe Company will sometimes pre-fund claims accounts with third party claims administrators in order\nto make the claims payment process more efficient. Pre-funding amounts are restricted to 2-3 months\nof expected claims activity.\nPrime brokers\nPrime brokerage is the generic name for a bundled package of services offered by investment banks\nand securities firms to professional investors needing the ability to borrow securities and cash. The\nprime broker provides a centralised securities clearing facility for the investor so the investor's\ncollateral requirements are netted across all investments handled by the prime broker. The securities,\ncommodities, and cash in SILP’s investment portfolio are held with several prime brokers and\nderivative counterparties, subjecting SILP, and indirectly us, to a significant concentration of credit\nrisk. While we have no direct control over SILP, DME Advisors regularly monitors the concentration\nof credit risk with each counterparty and, if appropriate, transfers cash or securities between\ncounterparties or requests collateral to diversify and mitigate this credit risk.\nDerivative counterparties\nThe SILP will enter into derivative transactions, such as equity swaps and currency options, with\nfinancial counterparties. The counterparties are typically large banks. The Company requires that any\nnet exposure to a derivative counterparty is cash collateralised and collateral adjustments are made on\na frequent basis.\nC.4 Liquidity risk\nAs of 31 December 2023, the majority of the Company’s investments in SILP were valued based on\nquoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1). Given the Company’s value-oriented\nlong and short investment strategy, if equity markets decline, the obligations for covering short\npositions should also decline. Any reduction in the short portfolio would reduce the need for restricted\ncash and thereby cash would be freed up to be used for any purpose. Additionally, since the majority\nof the Company’s investments in SILP are liquid, even in distressed markets, the invested assets can be\nliquidated to generate cash to pay claims, hence mitigating any liquidity risk.\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Expected Profits In Future Premiums (“EPIFP”) US$16,249k and does\nnot impact the Company’s liquidity risk.\n35\nC.5 Operational risk\nOperational\nThe Company’s operational structure is designed to support our strategic objectives. It provides\nsufficient resources and clearly sets out responsibilities and authorities in order that the operational\nstructure is effective. Operational risks facing the Company include, but are not limited to, failures or\nweaknesses in financial reporting and controls, regulatory non-compliance, reliance on outsourced\nservice providers, fraud, and breach of information technology and data privacy security. The\nCompany also monitors legal and compliance risks as a separate category outside of operational risk.\nThe Company categorises its operational risks as follows: IT (including cyber risk), human resources,\noutsourcing, finance, and other (general). The Company also monitors emerging risks which may\nrelate to operational risks. The Company manages operational risks through policies and guidelines\nsetting out appropriate procedures and internal controls and the periodic assessment of adherence to\nthese procedures and controls by Internal Audit. Operational risk is monitored and reported to\nmanagement, the Risk Committee, and the Board. Matters are escalated to the Board as required and\nmitigating actions are assigned to bring elevated risks back within tolerance.\nThere were no material weaknesses identified in any of the operational risk categories.\nC.6 Other material risks\nGroup Support\nWe rely upon the support of our parent company, GLRE, and our sister company, GRL, to pursue our\nbusiness activities. The financial position of GRL remains strong. Proactive monitoring of the financial\nstrength of the Group will continue with the Company monitoring its exposure to reinsurance\nrecoverables from GRL.\nCapital\nGLRE is our source of capital. Capital is predominantly Tier 1 common equity.\nRating\nA.M. Best provides the Group with a group rating that applies to both GRL and the Company. The\ngroup rating is mostly derived from GRL as it is a much larger company. In September 2023, the A.M.\nBest rating of the Company and its sister company, Greenlight Reinsurance Ltd. (“GRL”) was re-\naffirmed at “A- Excellent” with a rating outlook of stable.\nRetrocession\nThe Company has two retrocession contracts with GRL and a number of retrocession contracts with\nnon-affiliated retrocessionaires as discussed in Section C.1. Remittances under the reinsurance\nagreements are made quarterly. GRL is required to provide collateral for any reinsurance recoverables\nas follows:\n• None if it has an A.M. Best rating of “A- Excellent” or higher;\n36\n• 50% collateralisation if it has an A.M Best rating of “B++ Very good” or “B+ Very good”; and\n• 100% collateralisation if it has an A.M Best rating of “B Fair” or lower.\nServices\nGroup provides the Company with various services, including legal, underwriting, actuarial,\nreserving, marketing and IT. This arrangement is formalised in a Service Level Agreement.\nC.7 Any other information\nAnticipated/future risk exposures are not expected to be different from current exposures disclosed in\nSection C of this report (A.309(2)(a) of the SII Directive).\nWe use risk scenarios to stress our core underwriting (including reserving) and investment activities,\ncounterparty recoverables and operational activities, in order to determine the impact on capital. Full\ndetails of the scenarios used and the impact on the Company’s projected capital are set out in full in\nsection E.1 of this report.\nRisk scenarios\nWe use risk scenarios to stress our core underwriting (including reserving) and investment activities,\ncounterparty recoverables and operational activities, in order to determine the impact on capital.\nFor the purposes of the scenarios, risks are divided into five categories:\n1. Investing\n2. Underwriting\n3. Reserves\n4. Counterparty\n5. Operational\nFor each risk category, there are three stress levels:\n1. No stress – expected risk levels\n2. Adverse stress – ‘unlikely but not remote’ risk levels\n3. Severe stress – ‘remote’ risk levels\nSelected risk scenarios\nThere are six risk scenarios, comprising different combinations of stress factors, which are applied to\nthe current and projected risk profiles.\nStress Levels\nScenario Investments Underwriting Reserves Counterparty Operational\n1 (Base) None\n2 Adverse None Adverse\n3 Severe None\n4 None Adverse None\n5 Adverse\n6 Severe None Severe\n37\nScenario 1 is the three-year business plan, and we aim to have a SCR ratio in excess of 130% in each\nyear. Scenarios 2, 3 and 4 represent scenarios where we expect to have a SCR ratio in excess of 100%\nfor the year in which the stress occurs.\nIn scenarios 5, which applies a stress to underwriting/reserving combined with a stress to counterparty\nrecoverables, including a 10% write off of uncollateralised reinsurance recoverables whilst assuming a\nnotch downgrade and the subsequent impact on the credit quality step (in addition to an adverse\ninvestment and operational stress), we may not have an SCR ratio in excess of 100%.\nIn scenario 6, although we apply a combined severe underwriting/reserving, investments, and\noperational stress, we expect to have an SCR ratio above 100% as we do not apply a counterparty\ndefault stress.\nWe apply the full stress to each year individually in all of the above scenarios.\nSelected stress factors\nRisk scenarios and stress factors were chosen after internal dialogue with underwriters, actuaries,\nsenior management, and directors. The Risk Committee meeting held on September 18th, 2023, and the\nBoard meeting held on September 28th 2023 discussed risk scenarios and stress factors in detail. The\nselection focused on historical Greenlight and industry performance (the Company has performed\ndetailed analysis of historical underwriting and investment performance), combined with expert\njudgement.\nInvestments\nAdverse: 15% loss to the Solasglas investment fund; 2% loss to net funds withheld (reflecting\nexposure of FAL book to rising interest rates); 0% loss to the cash portfolio.\nSevere: 30% loss to the Solasglas investment fund; 4% loss to net funds withheld (reflecting exposure\nof FAL book to rising interest rates); 0% loss to the cash portfolio.\nUnderwriting\nAdverse: A non-catastrophe net composite ratio of 100% for the next 12 months after internal quota\nshare before aggregate stop loss.\nSevere: A non-catastrophe net composite ratio of 150% for the next 12 months after internal quota\nshare before aggregate stop loss.\nReserves\nAdverse: 10% deterioration in net reserves, before internal reinsurance.\nSevere: 20% deterioration in net reserves, before internal reinsurance.\nExample events that could lead to the severe losses chosen (reserves)\nHistorically the GRIL portfolio was primarily weighted towards shorter tail classes with the Company\ntaking the majority share in a lead market capacity. This strategy has evolved significantly over the last\nfew years, with the Company writing a larger number of contracts on a subscription basis taking small\nshares in a following market capacity. The Company take some comfort in the detailed review and\noversight of reserves conducted by each lead market and the Company is less exposed to anti selection\nrisk.\nThe following table provides some context to the potential reserve deterioration.\n38\nGross reserves\nGross reserves at December 31st 2023 216,269\n10% deterioration in reserves 21,627\n20% deterioration in net reserves 43,254\nHistoric reserve deterioration / (release)\n2023 (1,843)\n2022 2,439\n2021 (9,760)\n2020 8,761\n2019 (4,742)\n2018 1,241\nThe aggregate stop loss (ASL) cover would be triggered in the event of a combined underwriting and\nreserve shock. This limits the exposure of the shock to 5% of the opening Shareholders Equity in the\nyear.\nCounterparty\nAdverse: 10% credit loss in relation to uncollateralised reinsurance recoverables (GRL).\nSevere: 20% credit loss in relation to uncollateralised reinsurance recoverables (GRL).\nOperational\nAdverse: US$500,000 additional expense due to operational failure.\nSevere: US$1,000,000 additional expense due to operational failure.\nCapital risk thresholds\nOur capital risk appetite is to maintain a SCR coverage ratio in excess of 100% in going-concern\nscenarios. Under risk scenario 5 we may fall below 100%. This scenario is considered to be extreme as\nit contains a combination of adverse stresses including a counterparty default stress.\nDependencies between Risk Modules\nThe Company uses the Standard Formula model to calculate the SCR. The quantitative data necessary\nfor determining the dependencies between risk modules and sub-modules of the BSCR are included in\nthe model.\n39\nD. Valuation for Solvency Purposes\nD.1 Assets\nThe Company’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023, are prepared in accordance\nwith Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in Ireland “Irish GAAP”, FRS 102 and FRS 103.\nAssets held by the Company as at 31 December 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n2023 2022\nGAAP SII Difference GAAP SII Difference\nAssets Accounting Valuation in Accounting Valuation in\nBasis Principles Valuation Basis Principles Valuation\n(US$ in thousands) (US$ in thousands)\nInvestments 26,053 26,053 — 29,005 29,005 —\nDeposits other than cash\nequivalents 10,434 10,434 — 11,162 11,162 —\nReinsurance receivables 62,363 — 62,363 44,739 6,623 38,116\nReinsurance recoverables 206,920 134,041 72,880 255,913 165,246 90,667\nDeposits to cedants 206,400 206,528 (129) 256,546.399 256,701 (155)\nCash & cash equivalents 6,501 6,525 (24) 11,932 11,951 (19)\nReceivables (trade, not\ninsurance) 1,378 1,378 — — — —\nAny other assets, not\nelsewhere shown 1,172 107 1,065 827 68 759\nDeferred acquisition costs (890) — (890) 1,940 — 1,940\nDeferred tax assets 1,107 1,107 — 500 500 —\nTotal assets 521,437 386,174 135,264 612,564 481,256 131,308\nInvestments\nAs permitted by FRS 102, the Company has elected to apply the recognition and measurement\nprovisions of International Accounting Standard 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and\nMeasurement, (“IAS 39”). The Company’s financial instruments are carried at fair value, and all\nunrealised gains or losses are included in investment income in the statement of comprehensive\nincome.\nDeposits other than cash equivalents\nThe Company has established regulatory trust arrangements for certain cedents.\nReinsurance receivables\nAmounts receivable from reinsurance operations are valued at settlement amount and reviewed for\nimpairment under FRS 102. At 31 December 2023 there were no provisions required. These assets are\n40\nreclassified to net technical provisions for Solvency II purposes and discounted at the risk-free rate to\nthe present value.\nReinsurance recoverables\nReinsurance recoverables form part of the reinsurers share of technical provisions under Solvency II,\nand are covered under the technical provisions note below.\nReceivables (trade, not insurance)\nTrade receivables comprise of trade receivables and other sundry receivables not related to insurance.\nUnder Solvency II and Irish GAAP these amounts are measured at fair value.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise of cash at a non-US bank and cash and cash equivalents held with\nprime brokers. All cash equivalents have an original maturity of three months or less.\nOther Assets\nOther assets include profit commissions receivable, prepayments, accrued income and deposits to\ncedents. For Solvency II purposes, profit commissions receivable have been excluded from other\nassets as they form part of technical provisions. Under Solvency II and Irish GAAP these amounts are\nmeasured at fair value.\nDeferred acquisition costs\nDeferred acquisition costs are commissions and brokerage costs directly related to writing business.\nThese costs are amortised over the term of the related contract. Under Solvency II valuation rules,\nthese costs are not recognised an asset.\nDeferred tax assets\nDeferred tax assets are calculated on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed as of\nthe date of the statement of financial position, where transactions or events result in an obligation to\npay less tax in the future. These obligations are recalculated based on the Solvency II Balance Sheet\nwhich gives rise to a different deferred tax asset or liability. Deferred tax assets have been recognised\non the basis that future taxable profits will be available against which these deferred tax assets can be\nutilised. The evidence for the future taxable profits is a forecast consistent with the operational plans\nprepared by the Company, which is subject to internal review and challenge. See Section D.3 for\ndeferred tax liability recognised on Solvency II Balance Sheet.\n41\nD.2 Technical provisions\nThe technical provisions consist of the Best Estimate of the Liabilities and the Risk Margin.

Future premium estimates are provided by\nthe Company in accordance with the Company’s calendarised plan, as used for budgeting, the Company’s\nORSA process and the premium volume measure in the Company’s SCR calculation.\nMotor vehicle liability insurance and other motor insurance is quota share reinsurance of US non-\nstandard auto business. For US non-standard auto business the claim provisions were reviewed and\nvalidated by the Actuarial function using a variety of actuarial methods - Chain Ladder, Bornhuetter\nFerguson, Cape Cod and Average Cost per Claim - applied to paid and incurred loss triangles, segmented\nby business line.\nMarine, Aviation and Transport, Fire and other damage to Property insurance, General Liability insurance\nand Non-proportional Casualty reinsurance arise from a number of reinsurance treaties of multi-line\ninsurance/reinsurance companies. The claim provisions are based on a combination of the losses reported\nby the cedants (including cedant estimates of IBNR), benchmark data and the Company’s actuaries’ view\nof the expected loss for these treaties. As the treaties mature more weight has been placed on the reported\nlosses.\nNon-proportional marine, aviation and transport reinsurance and non-proportional property reinsurance is\ncharacterised by large losses with short reporting delays and the claim provision is mainly based on\nreported claims. This business is written on both an open market basis and assumed indirectly through\nour FAL account.\nReserving for FAL business is based on the syndicate quarterly reports, supplemented by syndicate and\nmarket information, and validated by the Actuarial function.\nAs noted above, the Company has exposure through its FAL and Specialty books to the Russia Ukraine\nand Middle East conflicts. The Company has provided for potential claims arising from the conflicts on a\n43\nbest estimate basis, based on a comprehensive review of its exposure and management’s views.\nA loading for Events not in Data (ENID) is applied to the claim and premium reserves, and payables and\nreceivables not past due are allocated to the technical provisions.\nRisk Margin\nThe Risk Margin is in addition to the Best Estimate of Liabilities to ensure that the value of the technical\nprovisions as a whole is equivalent to the amount that an insurance undertaking would be expected to\nrequire to take over and meet the insurance obligations of the Company.\nThe Company uses Method 1 listed in Guideline 62 of EIOPA’s Guidelines on the valuation of technical\nprovisions to calculate its risk margin; this is the most sophisticated of the simplifications permitted.\nDifference in Bases of Valuation for Solvency Purposes and for the Financial Statements\nThe financial statement Irish GAAP reserves are used as the starting point for the claim provision.\nThe UPR in the financial statements is multiplied by the expected loss ratio (by treaty) to derive the\npremium provision in respect of written premium. Other adjustments included in the Solvency II\ntechnical provisions include:\n• Inclusion of Written but not Incepted treaties;\n• Inclusion of payables and receivables that are not past due, including future premiums;\n• Addition of loading for ENID;\n• Adjustment for retrocession default;\n• Inclusion of profit commission reserve; and\n• Discounting.\nThe Solvency II technical provisions are discounted at the EIOPA-prescribed risk-free interest rate.\nUncertainty associated with Best Estimate of Liabilities\nProjections of future ultimate losses and loss expenses for claim provisions are subject to considerable\nuncertainty, particularly for liability classes. The losses are affected by many factors, including\nemergence of latent claims, or new types of claims, claims inflation, changes in court awards, legal\njudgements, and reporting delays. To the extent that these factors are present in the historical data\n(including benchmark data) they are allowed for in the projections; in other cases, an additional loading\nfor ENID is added where appropriate.\nPremium provisions are subject to greater uncertainty - in addition to the factors above which apply\nequally to premium provisions, the premium provisions relate to future exposure periods and so are\nexposed to loss events, including catastrophe events, fire, windstorm, flood, hail, freeze etc. An\nadditional loading for ENID is added where appropriate.\nOther sources of uncertainty include payments being faster or slower than expected, expenses being\ndifferent than expected or failure of a retrocession counterparty.\nClaims Provisions\nThe main risks to the Company’s claim provisions are:\n• The emergence of large losses;\n44\n• Deterioration of existing losses;\n• Deterioration of reserves on existing treaties;\n• Higher than expected losses arising from the Russia Ukraine conflict; and\n• Higher inflation of that allowed for in the calculation of the technical provisions.\nPremium Provisions\nThe main risks to the Company’s premium provisions are:\n• Catastrophes/large losses on catastrophe transactions;\n• Higher inflation than expected\n• Performance of the London market transactions being worse than expected.\nChanges in Technical Provisions\nThere have been no material changes in the level of technical provisions other than organic changes as\nsome treaties have run-off and other new business has been written or renewed. There have been no\nmaterial changes in the relevant assumptions made in the calculation of the Technical Provisions\ncompared to the calculation of Technical Provisions for the 2022 year-end.\nAdjustments and Transitional Measures\nThe Company does not apply the matching adjustment referred to in Article 77b of Directive 2009/138/\nEC.\nThe Company does not use the volatility adjustment referred to in Article 77d of Directive 2009/138/EC.\nFurthermore, the extrapolation of the risk-free interest rate term structure referred to in Article 77a of\nDirective 2009/138/EC is not applicable. Therefore, the assessments referred to in points (a), (b) and (c)\nof the first subparagraph of Article 44 of Directive 2009/138/EC were not necessary.\nThe Company does not apply the transitional risk-free interest rate-term structure referred to Article 308c\nof Directive 2009/138/EC.\nThe Company does not apply the transitional deduction referred to in Article 308d of Directive 2009/138/\nEC.\nRetrocession Recoverables\nThe recoverables from reinsurance (retrocession) contracts in the Technical Provisions are from a number\nof Quota Share treaties and are calculated by application of the ceded proportion.\n45\nD.3 Other liabilities\nOther liabilities held by the Company as at 31 December 2023 were as follows:\n2023 2022\nGAAP SII Difference GAAP SII Difference\nOther Liabilities Accounting Valuation in Accounting Valuation in\nBasis Principles Valuation Basis Principles Valuation\n(US$ in thousands) (US$ in thousands)\nReinsurance payables 58,985 — 58,985 41,015 8,279 32,736\nPayables (trade, not\ninsurance) — — — 667 667 —\nDeposits from reinsurers 129,173 129,173 — 186,883 186,883 —\nDeferred tax liability 613 (613) — 934 (934)\nTotal other liabilities 188,158 129,786 58,372 228,566 196,763 31,803\n* Other liabilities does not include Technical Provisions (see Section D2)\nReinsurance payables\nReinsurance payables are reclassified to net technical provisions for Solvency II purposes, and\ndiscounted at the risk-free rate to the present value.

There were no dividends paid during the reporting period.\n49\nE.2 Solvency Capital Requirement and Minimum Capital Requirement\nAs at 31 December 2023, the Company has an SCR of US$39.4m and MCR of US$9.8m. The\nCompany has used EIOPA’s Solvency II Standard Formula in determining the calculation of the SCR.\nThe following table comprises the components of the SCR as at 31 December 2023 and 2022:\nComponents of the SCR: 2023 2022\n(US$ in thousands) (US$ in thousands)\nMarket risk 13,401 11,658\nHealth underwriting 196 365\nNon-Life underwriting 17,026 16,132\nCounterparty default risk 14,839 18,088\nOverall diversification effect (11,423) (11,312)\nBasic SCR 34,039 34,931\nOperational risk 5,328 6,928\nLoss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes — —\nSCR 39,367 41,859\nThe Company uses the Standard Formula calculation as the basis for calculating capital requirements\nhaving reviewed the assumptions underlying the formula and assessed them to be appropriate for the\nCompany. The Company has not used any simplified calculations or applied any Company specific\nparameters, and there were no capital add-ons requiring justification by the CBI.\nThe SCR has decreased from US$41.9m at 31 December 2022 to US$39.4m at 31 December 2023.\nThe non-life risk charge has increased marginally by US$0.9m. The counterparty risk charge has\ndecreased by US$(3.2)m primarily due to the run-off of the FAL business.\nThe table below shows the inputs into the MCR calculation and the Absolute Floor of the Minimum\nCapital Requirement (“AMCR”) 31 December 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022\n(US$ in thousands) Parameters (US$ in thousands) Parameters\n% of SCR % of SCR\nAMCR 4,125 3,946\nCap 17,715 45% 18,837 45%\nFloor 9,842 25% 10,465 25%\nMCR 9,842 10,465\nThe AMCR is the US$ equivalent of €3.9m, as defined for reinsurance undertakings in Article 129\n(1d) (iii) of the Solvency II Directive. The MCR is the result of a specified linear formula subject to a\nfloor of 25% and a cap of 45% of the SCR calculated based on the standard formula model. As at 31\nDecember 2023, the Company’s MCR is equal to the floor of the linear formula, being 25% of the\nSCR (2022: 25%).\n50\nE.3 Use of duration-based equity risk sub-module in the calculation of the Solvency\nCapital Requirement\nThe Company does not use the duration-based equity risk sub-module in the calculation of the SCR.\nE.4 Differences between the standard formula and any internal model used\nThe Company applies the Standard Formula model and does not use an internal model to calculate the\nSCR.\nE.5 Non-compliance with the Minimum Capital Requirement and non-compliance\nwith the Solvency Capital Requirement\nThe Company has been continuously compliant with both the MCR and the SCR throughout the\nreporting period. The Company has reviewed the possibility of non-compliance under several stresses\nin Section C.7. In all non-runoff scenarios the Company’s SCR and MCR remains in excess of 100%.\nE.6 Any other information on capital management\nRisks not covered by the Standard Formula Model\nWhile the Company feels that all material quantifiable risks are fully covered in the Standard Formula,\ncertain underlying assumptions within the Formula may not accurately reflect the risk profile of the\nCompany. The most material differences that impact the Standard Formula are:\n• Whole-account aggregate stop-loss - cannot be applied under the Standard Formula in a\nmanner which reflects the commercial effect.\n• Long-short equity investments - no credit is given for short positions or the ability to reallocate\nto other securities (such as cash or bonds) in a short timeframe.\n• Funds withheld treatment - counterparty credit exposure to GRL is mitigated by the funds\nwithheld nature of our FAL business, where we do not pay any reinsurance premium to GRL\nuntil the conclusion of the contract.\nAll other material information on capital management has been disclosed.\n51\nF.

The Company’s\ninvestment in Solasglas Investments, LP as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $258.9 million and 178.2 million,\nrespectively, and its equity in net income of Solasglas Investments, LP was $28.7 million and $54.8 million for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The financial statements of Solasglas Investments, LP were audited by other\nauditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for\nSolasglas Investments, LP, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\nWe believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n1\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is derived using expected trends in claim\nseverity and frequency and other factors that may vary significantly as claims are settled. The estimate is sensitive to\nsignificant assumptions, including the initial expected loss ratio and loss development factors. The estimate is also\nsensitive to the selection of actuarial methods and weighting of these methods applied to project the ultimate losses,\nthe estimation of ultimate reserves associated with catastrophic events, and other factors. Further, not all\ncatastrophic events can be modeled using traditional actuarial methodologies, which increases the degree of\njudgment needed in estimating loss reserves for such events.\nAuditing the Company’s methods, assumptions and best estimate of the cost of the ultimate settlement and\nadministration of claims represented by the incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") claims included in recorded Loss and\nloss adjustment expense reserves involved especially subjective auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort,\nincluding the involvement of our actuarial specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to loss and loss adjustment expense reserves included the following, among others:\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of the recorded loss and loss adjustment expense\nreserves, including the review and approval process that management has in place for significant actuarial\nmethods and assumptions used and the approval of management’s best estimate of loss and loss adjustment\nexpense reserves.\n• We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company’s\nactuarial analysis, including historical claims data, to test the reasonableness of key inputs to the actuarial\nestimate.\n• With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:\n− We independently developed an estimate of the reserves for selected contracts, compared our estimates to\nthose booked by the Company, and evaluated the differences.\n− We evaluated the Company’s methodologies against recognized actuarial practices for the remaining\ncontracts. We also evaluated the assumptions used by the Company using our industry knowledge and\nexperience and other analytical procedures.\n− We compared the results of the quarterly reserve studies prepared by independent external actuaries to\nmanagement’s best estimate and evaluated the differences.\nHamilton, Bermuda\nMarch 5, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2022.\n2\nTel: 616-774-7000 200 Ottawa Ave NW, Suite 300\nFax: 616-776-3680 Grand Rapids, MI 49503\nwww.bdo.com\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nGreenlight Capital Re, Ltd.\nGrand Cayman, Cayman Islands\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, changes in\nshareholders’ equity, and cash flows of Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd.

Domiciled in the U.K. since 2022, Syndicate 3456 is authorized to underwrite under the Lloyd’s\nsyndicate-in-a-box model.\nThe ordinary shares of GLRE are listed on Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE.”\nBasis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of GLRE and the\nconsolidated financial statements of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany transactions and balances\nhave been eliminated on consolidation.\nCertain amounts in the prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the\npresentation of the current consolidated financial statements. The Company has reported separately the foreign exchange gains\n(losses) from “Other income” in the consolidated statements of operations. This resulted in no change to the previously reported\ntotal revenues or net income. The Company has also included the foreign exchange gains (losses) as part of the net change in\nworking capital in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Further, the Company combined “Other assets, excluding\ndepreciation” and “Other liabilities” and presented the sum as “Other items, net” in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThese changes in presentation in the consolidated statements of cash flows have resulted in no change to the previously\nreported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\n9\nTabular dollar are in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts or otherwise noted. All amounts are reported in\nU.S. dollars.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are as follows:\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nperiod. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company’s principal estimates include:\n• loss and loss adjustment expense reserves;\n• premiums written and earned and related premium receivable, net of expected credit losses;\n• reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including expected credit losses; and\n• valuation of investments, including impairments.\nInvestments\nInvestment in related party investment fund\nThe Company records its investment in the related party investment fund based on fair value using the net asset value\npractical expedient, with the Company’s share of the fund’s net income (loss) reported as “Income (loss) from investment in\nrelated party investment fund” in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOther investments\nThe Company’s other investments include short-term investments and private investments and unlisted equity securities\nwithout readily determinable fair values.\nShort-term investments are measured at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. These include certificate of\ndeposit and other financial instruments with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year.\nThe Company measures its private investments and unlisted equity securities without readily determinable fair values at\ncost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from identical or similar investments of the same issuers\n(the “measurement alternative”), with such changes recognized in “Net investment income (loss)” in the consolidated statements\nof operations. The Company considers the need for impairment on a by-investment basis based on certain indicators. Under the\nmeasurement alternative, the Company makes two types of valuation adjustments:\n• When the Company observes an orderly transaction of an investee’s identical or similar equity securities, the\nCompany adjusts the carrying value based on the observable price as of the transaction date. Once the Company\nrecords such an adjustment, the investment is considered an “asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring\nbasis.”\n• If the Company determines that the investment is impaired and the fair value is less than its carrying value, it\nwrites down the investment to its fair value. Once the Company records such an adjustment, the investment is\nconsidered an “asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.”\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments and certificates of deposit with\noriginal maturity dates of three months or less. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are presented separately in the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n10\nPremium Revenue Recognition\nThe Company writes excess of loss contracts and quota share contracts and estimates the ultimate premiums for the\ncontract period. The Company bases these estimates on actuarial pricing models and information received from ceding\ncompanies. For excess of loss contracts, the Company writes the total ultimate estimated premiums at the contract’s inception.\nFor quota share contracts, the Company writes premiums in the same periods in which the underlying insurance contracts are\nwritten, based on cession statements from cedents. The Company typically receives these statements monthly or quarterly,\ndepending on the terms specified in each contract. For any reporting lag, the Company estimates premiums written based\non the portion of the estimated ultimate premiums relating to the risks bound during the lag period.\nFor multi-year contracts, reinsurance premiums are recorded at the inception of the contract based on management’s best\nestimate of total premiums to be received. Premiums are recognized on an annual basis for multi-year contracts where the\ncedants have the ability to unilaterally commute or cancel coverage within the term of the contract.\nManagement regularly reviews premium estimates. Such review includes the Company’s experience with the ceding\ncompanies, managing general underwriters, familiarity with each market, the timing of the reported information, a comparison\nof reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums, along with a review of the aging and collection of premiums.\nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of the premium estimates on the basis of these reviews and records any adjustments\nto these estimates in the period in which they are determined. Changes in premium estimates, including premium receivable on\nboth excess of loss and quota share contracts, are not unusual and may result in significant adjustments in any period. A portion\nof amounts included in “Reinsurance balances receivable” in the consolidated balance sheets represent estimated premiums\nwritten, net of commissions and brokerage, that are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Additional\npremiums due on a contract with no remaining coverage period are earned in full when written.\nCertain contracts allow for reinstatement premiums in the event of a loss. Reinstatement premiums are written and\nearned when a triggering loss event occurs.\nPremiums written are generally recognized as earned over the contract period in proportion to the risk covered. Unearned\npremiums represent the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided.\nReinsurance Premiums Ceded\nThe Company reduces the risk of future losses on business assumed by reinsuring certain risks and exposures with other\nreinsurers (referred to as “retrocessionaires”). The Company remains liable to the extent that any retrocessionaire fails to meet\nits obligations and to the extent the Company does not hold sufficient security for its unpaid obligations.\nCeded premiums are written during the period in which the risks incept and the associated expense is recognized over the\ncontract period in proportion to the protection provided. Unearned premiums ceded represent the unexpired portion of\nreinsurance obtained.\nAcquisition Costs\nPolicy acquisition costs vary with, and are directly related to, the successful production of new and renewal business and\nconsist principally of commissions, taxes, and brokerage expenses. The Company presents acquisition costs incurred on\nreinsurance assumed net of commissions earned on reinsurance ceded. However, if the sum of a contract’s expected losses and\nloss expenses and deferred acquisition costs exceeds associated unearned premiums and expected investment income, a\npremium deficiency is determined to exist. In this event, the Company writes off deferred acquisition costs to the extent\nnecessary to eliminate the premium deficiency. If the premium deficiency exceeds deferred acquisition costs, the Company\naccrues a liability for the deficiency. The Company did not recognize any premium deficiency adjustments during the periods\npresented.\nPolicy acquisition costs also include profit commissions, which the Company recognized on a basis consistent with its\nestimate of losses and loss expenses.\n11\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves and Recoverable\nThe Company’s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves (“LAE”) are composed of:\n● case reserves for loss and LAE resulting from claims notified to the Company by its clients; and\n● reserves for estimated loss and LAE incurred by insureds and reinsureds but not yet reported to the insurer or\nreinsurer (“IBNR”), including unknown future developments on loss and LAE that are known to the insurer or\nreinsurer.\nThe Company estimates these reserves based on reports from ceding companies, industry data, and historical experience\nanalyzed using standard actuarial and statistical techniques.\nThe analysis includes assessing currently available data, predictions of future developments, estimates of future trends,\nand other factors. These estimates are reviewed by the Company’s reserving committee at least quarterly and adjusted as\nnecessary.\nThe final settlement of losses may vary, perhaps materially, from the reserves recorded. The Company recognizes\nall adjustments to the estimates in the period they are determined. U.S. GAAP does not permit establishing loss reserves, which\ninclude case reserves and IBNR loss reserves, until the occurrence of an event that may give rise to a claim. As a result, only\nloss reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date are established. There is no allowance for the establishment\nof loss reserves to account for expected future loss events.\nThe “Loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable” in the consolidated balance sheets represents the amounts due\nfrom retrocessionaires for unpaid loss and LAE on retrocession agreements. Ceded IBNR recoverable amounts are estimated\nbased on the Company’s actuarial estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted when deemed necessary.\nThe Company may be unable to recover the loss and LAE recoverable amounts due as a result of the retrocessionaires’ inability\nto pay. The Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of its retrocessionaires and calculates an allowance for\nexpected credit losses (see “Reinsurance Assets” below).\nFor losses stemming from exposure to natural perils, loss reserves are generally established based on loss payments and\ncase reserves reported by clients when, and if, received. Estimates for IBNR losses are added to the case reserves as the\nCompany deems appropriate. To establish catastrophe IBNR loss estimates, the Company uses estimates communicated by\nceding companies, industry data and information, knowledge of the business written, and management’s judgment.\nFor contracts without significant exposure to natural perils, initial reserves for each contract are determined based on a\ncombination of (i) the pricing analysis performed prior to binding the contract; (ii) the underwriter’s detailed knowledge of the\ncedent, its operations and future business plans; and (iii) the professional judgment and recommendation of the Chief Actuary.\nIn the pricing analysis, the Company utilizes information from the client and industry data. This information typically includes,\nbut is not limited to, data related to premiums, losses, exposure, business mix, industry performance, and associated trends\ncovering as much history as deemed appropriate. The level of detail within the data obtained varies greatly depending on the\nunderlying contract, line of business, client, and coverage provided. In all cases, the Company requests each client to provide\ndata for each reporting period, which, depending on the contract, could be on a monthly or quarterly basis. The terms and\nconditions of each contract specify the data reporting requirements.\nGenerally, the Company obtains regular updates of premium and loss-related information for the current and historical\nperiods and utilizes them to update the initially expected loss ratio. There may be a lag between (i) claims being reported by the\nunderlying insured to the Company’s cedent and (ii) claims being reported by the Company’s cedent to the Company. This lag\nmay impact the Company’s loss reserve estimates. Client reports have pre-determined due dates (for example, fifteen days after\neach month-end). The timing of the reporting requirements is designed so that the Company receives premium and loss\ninformation as soon as practicable once the client has closed its books. Accordingly, there should be a short lag in such\nreporting. Additionally, most contracts that have the potential for large single-event losses have provisions that such loss\nnotifications are provided to the Company immediately upon the occurrence of an event.\nOnce the updated information is received, the Company uses various standard actuarial methods for its quarterly\nanalysis. Such methods typically include the following:\n12\n● Paid loss development method: Ultimate losses are estimated by calculating past paid loss development factors and\napplying them to exposure periods with further expected paid loss development. This method assumes that losses are\npaid in a consistent pattern. It provides an objective test of reported loss projections because paid losses contain no\nreserve estimates.\n● Reported loss development method: Ultimate losses are estimated by calculating past reported loss development\nfactors and applying them to exposure periods with further expected reported loss development. This method\nincorporates changes in payments and case reserves.\n● Expected loss ratio method: Ultimate losses are estimated by multiplying earned premiums by an expected loss ratio.\nThe expected loss ratio is often determined using industry data, historical company data, past pricing or reserving\nanalysis performed, and actuarial judgment. This method is typically used for lines of business and contracts where\nthere are no (or insignificant) historical losses or where past loss experience is not considered applicable to the current\nperiod.\n● Bornhuetter-Ferguson paid loss method: Ultimate losses are estimated by modifying expected loss ratios to the\nextent losses paid to date differ from what would have been expected based upon the selected paid loss development\npattern. This method avoids some distortions that could result from a large development factor being applied to a\nsmall base of paid losses to calculate ultimate losses.\n● Bornhuetter-Ferguson reported loss method: Ultimate losses are estimated by modifying expected loss ratios to the\nextent losses reported to date differ from what would have been expected based upon the selected reported loss\ndevelopment pattern. This method avoids some distortions that could result from a large development factor being\napplied to a small base of reported losses to calculate ultimate losses.\n● Frequency / Severity method: Ultimate losses are estimated by multiplying the ultimate number of claims (i.e., the\nfrequency multiplied by the exposure base) by the estimated average cost per claim (i.e., the severity). This approach\nenables trends and patterns in the rates of claims emergence (i.e., reporting) and settlement (i.e., closure) and the\naverage cost of claims to be analyzed separately.\nIn addition, the Company may supplement its analysis with other reserving methodologies that it deems relevant to\nspecific contracts.\nFor each contract, the Company utilizes reserving methodologies it considers appropriate to calculate a best estimate of\nreserves. Whether the Company uses a single methodology or a combination depends upon the portfolio segment being\nanalyzed and the actuary’s judgment. The Company’s reserving methodology does not require a fixed weighting of the various\nmethods used. Certain methods are considered more appropriate than others depending on the type, structure, age, maturity, and\nduration of the expected losses on the contract. For example, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson reported loss method might be more\nappropriate than a paid loss development method for relatively new contracts that have experienced little paid loss\ndevelopment.\nThe Company’s gross aggregate reserves are the sum of the best estimate reserves of all portfolio exposures. Generally,\nIBNR loss reserves are calculated by estimating the ultimate incurred losses and subtracting cumulative paid claims and case\nreserves. Each quarter, the Company’s Reserving Committee, led by the Chief Actuary, meets to assess the adequacy of our loss\nreserves based on the reserve analysis and recommendations prepared by the Company’s reserving department.\nThe Company does not typically experience material claims processing backlogs, although such backlogs may occur\nfollowing a major catastrophic event. At December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company did not have a material backlog in its\nclaims processing.\nThe Company did not make any significant changes to the actuarial methodology or assumptions relating to its loss and\nloss adjustment expense reserves for the years presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nReinsurance Assets\nThe Company calculates an allowance for expected credit losses for its reinsurance balances receivable and loss and\nLAE recoverable by applying a Probability of Default (“PD”) / Loss Given Default (“LGD”) model. The PD / LGD approach\nconsiders the Company’s collectibility history on its reinsurance assets and representative external loss history. In calculating\nthe probability of default, the Company also considers the estimated duration of its reinsurance assets.\nThe Company evaluates each counterparty’s creditworthiness based on credit ratings that independent agencies assign to\nthe counterparty. The Company manages its credit risk in its reinsurance assets by transacting only with insurers and reinsurers\nthat it considers financially sound. Credit ratings of the counterparties are forward-looking and consider various economic\nscenarios. The Company's evaluation of the required allowance for reinsurance balances receivable and loss and LAE\nrecoverable considers the current economic environment as well as potential macroeconomic developments.\n13\nFor its retrocessional counterparties that are unrated, the Company may hold collateral in the form of funds withheld,\ntrust accounts, or irrevocable letters of credit. In evaluating credit risk associated with reinsurance balances receivable, the\nCompany considers its right to offset loss obligations against premiums receivable. The Company regularly evaluates its net\ncredit exposure to assess the ability of cedents and retrocessionaires to honor their respective obligations.\nDeposit Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company applies deposit accounting to reinsurance contracts that do not transfer sufficient insurance risk to merit\nreinsurance accounting. Under deposit accounting, the Company recognizes an asset or liability based on its paid or received\nconsideration. The deposit asset or liability balance is subsequently adjusted using the interest method with the corresponding\nincome and expense recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations under “Other income (expense)” and\n“Deposit interest expense,” respectively. The Company records deposit assets and liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets in\n“Reinsurance balances receivable” and “Reinsurance balances payable,” respectively. At December 31, 2023, deposit assets\nand liabilities were $0.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively (December 31, 2022: $3.1 million and $10.7 million,\nrespectively).\nNet investment income (loss)\nThe Company records interest income and interest expense on an accrual basis.\nAny realized and unrealized gains or losses from other investments are determined on the basis of the specific\nidentification method (by reference to cost or amortized cost, as appropriate). Additionally, net investment income (loss)\nincludes realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nIn connection with the Company’s participation interest in Lloyd’s syndicates, the Lloyd’s syndicates invest a portion of\nthe premiums withheld in investment funds and fixed-maturity securities. The Company records its share of income (or\nexpense) from these assets as other income (expense) as reported by the syndicates on a quarterly lag basis due to the timing of\nthe availability of these quarterly financial reports.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation costs based on the fair value at the award’s grant date. The\nCompany measures compensation for restricted shares and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) based on the price of the Company’s\ncommon shares at the grant date. For restricted shares and RSUs with service and performance vesting conditions, the expense\nis recognized based on management’s estimate of the probability of the performance conditions being achieved based on\nhistorical results and expectations of future results. If the Company expects to meet the performance conditions, it attributes the\nexpense to the period the requisite service is rendered. For restricted shares and RSUs with only service vesting conditions, the\nCompany recognizes the associated expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, net of any estimated or expected\nforfeitures.\nThe forfeiture rate is estimated based on the Company’s historical actual forfeitures relating to restricted shares and\nRSUs granted to employees. The forfeiture rate is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary. The Company applies no\nforfeiture rate to restricted shares granted to directors, which vest over a maximum twelve-month period.\nDetermining the fair value of share purchase options at the grant date requires significant estimation and judgment. The\nCompany uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to assist in the calculation of fair value for share purchase options. The\nmodel requires estimating various inputs such as the term, forfeiture and dividend rates, and expected volatility. In determining\nthe grant date fair value, the Company uses the entire ten-year life of the options as the estimated term and assumes no\nforfeitures and no dividends paid during the life of the options. The Company bases its estimate of expected volatility on the\ndaily historical trading data of the Company’s ordinary shares from the date they commenced trading (May 24, 2007) to the\ngrant date.\nFor share purchase options issued under the employee stock incentive plan, the compensation cost is calculated and\nrecognized over the vesting periods on a graded vesting basis.\n14\nConvertible Notes\nPrior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06 in January 2022, “Debt - Debt with Conversion\nand Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40):\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”),” the Company determined\nthat the senior convertible notes’ cash conversion option represented an embedded derivative and bifurcated it from the\nunderlying contract for financial reporting purposes. For the debt component, the Company recorded a liability equivalent to the\npresent value of comparable debt without the conversion features at the time of issuance. The remainder of the proceeds, which\nrepresented the embedded derivative, was included in “Additional paid-in capital” in the consolidated balance sheets.\nUpon adoption of ASU 2020-06, U.S. GAAP no longer permits entities to bifurcate embedded conversion features from\nthe underlying contract. Therefore, effective January 1, 2022, the Company no longer presents the embedded conversion\nfeatures separately in equity; instead, the Company’s senior convertible debt is presented as a single liability in the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheet. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 resulted in a decrease in the Company’s opening shareholders’ equity\nof $2.5 million, with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the senior convertible notes.\nCosts incurred in issuing the convertible notes consisted primarily of underwriting, legal, accounting, and printing fees.\nThese costs are amortized over the term of the debt and are included in “Interest expense” in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nForeign Exchange\nThe reporting and functional currency of the Company and all its significant subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The\nCompany records foreign currency transactions at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary assets and\nliabilities in foreign currencies are converted at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are carried at their historical exchange rates.\nDerivative instruments\nThe Company recognizes derivative financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair values.\nThe Company’s derivatives do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes. The Company records the\nassociated assets and liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. The Company does not offset these balances\nagainst collateral pledged or received.\nOther Assets\nThe Company’s other assets consist primarily of prepaid expenses, right-of-use lease assets, derivative assets, taxes\nrecoverable, and deferred tax assets.\nOther Liabilities\nThe Company’s other liabilities consist primarily of accruals for legal and other professional fees, employee bonuses and\nseverances, taxes payable, derivative liabilities, and lease liabilities.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe Company has no comprehensive income or loss other than the net income or loss disclosed in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe Company has issued unvested restricted stock awards, some of which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or\ndividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid. These awards are considered “participating securities” for the purposes of\ncalculating earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings per share is calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of\nordinary shares and participating securities outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (or loss) per share includes the\ndilutive effect, if any, of the following:\n• Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) issued that convert to ordinary shares upon vesting;\n• Unvested restricted share awards which are not considered “participating securities”;\n15\n• Additional potential ordinary shares issuable when in-the-money stock options are exercised, determined using\nthe treasury stock method;\n• For periods prior to January 1, 2022, those ordinary shares with the potential to be issued in connection with\nconvertible notes and other such convertible instruments, determined using the treasury stock method; and\n• Effective January 1, 2022, the dilutive effect of the convertible notes calculated using the if-converted method.\nUnder the if-converted method, the convertible notes are assumed to be converted at the beginning of the\nperiod. The resulting common shares are included in the denominator of the diluted net income per common\nshare calculation. Interest expense related to the convertible notes incurred in the period is added back to the\nnumerator for purposes of the if-converted calculation.\nDiluted earnings (or loss) per share contemplates a conversion to ordinary shares of all convertible instruments only if\nthey are dilutive. In the event of a net loss, all RSUs, stock options, shares potentially issuable in connection with convertible\nnotes, and participating securities are excluded from the calculation of both basic and diluted loss per share as their inclusion\nwould be anti-dilutive.\nTaxation\nThe Company records current and deferred income taxes based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable in the relevant\njurisdiction in the period in which the tax becomes accruable or realizable. Deferred income taxes are provided for all\ntemporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheets and those reported\nin the various jurisdictional tax returns.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance to the extent that the Company considers it more likely than not that all or a\nportion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future. Other than this valuation allowance, the Company has not\ntaken any income tax positions subject to significant uncertainty that is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the\nCompany.\nSegment Information\nOperating segments are based on the internal information that the Chief Operating Decision Maker uses for allocating\nthe Company’s resources and assessing its performance. The Company has one operating segment, Property and Casualty\nReinsurance.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nOn November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update\n(“ASU”) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The new ASU requires\nincremental disclosures related to a public entity’s reportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment, the\nmethod for determining segments, or the criteria for aggregating operating segments into reportable segments. This new\nguidance is effective for the Company’s 2024 year-end financial statements, and should be adopted retrospectively unless\nimpracticable. Early adoption is permitted.\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic (740) - Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures. The amendments in this Update provide more transparency about income tax information through improvements\nto income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. Early adoption is\npermitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis; however, retrospective application is permitted. This\nASU is effective for the Company’s 2024 year-end financial statements.\nAs the above ASUs relate solely to financial statement disclosures, the adoption of these ASUs will not impact the\nCompany’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Adopted\nThere are none that would be relevant and material to the Company.\n16\n3. INVESTMENT IN RELATED PARTY INVESTMENT FUND\nThe Company has entered into the Second Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement (the “SILP\nLPA”) of Solasglas Investments, LP (“SILP”), with DME Advisors II, LLC (“DME II”), as General Partner, Greenlight Re, and\nGRIL, (together, the “GLRE Limited Partners”). SILP has entered into a SILP investment advisory agreement (“IAA”) with\nDME Advisors. LP (“DME Advisors”), pursuant to which DME Advisors is the investment manager for SILP. DME II and\nDME Advisors are related to the Company, and each is an affiliate of David Einhorn, Chairman of the Company’s Board of\nDirectors (the “Chairman”).\nAt December 31, 2023, the SILP LPA included the following proviso: “The Investment Portfolio of each Partner will not\nexceed the product of (a) such Partner’s surplus (Greenlight Re Surplus or GRIL Surplus, as the case may be) multiplied by (b)\nthe Investment Cap (60%), and the General Partner will designate any portion of a Partner’s Investment Portfolio as Designated\nSecurities to effectuate such limit.”\nThe Company has concluded that SILP qualifies as a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under U.S. GAAP. In assessing its\ninterest in SILP, the Company noted the following:\n• DME II serves as SILP’s general partner and has the power to appoint the investment manager. The Company does not\nhave the power to appoint, change or replace the investment manager or the general partner except “for cause.” Neither\nof the GLRE Limited Partners can participate in the investment decisions of SILP as long as SILP adheres to the\ninvestment guidelines provided within the SILP LPA. For these reasons, the GLRE Limited Partners are not\nconsidered to have substantive participating rights or kick-out rights.\n• DME II holds an interest in excess of 10% of SILP’s net assets, which the Company considers to represent an\nobligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits of SILP that are significant to SILP.\nConsequently, the Company has concluded that DME II’s interests, not the Company’s, meet both the “power” and\n“benefits” criteria associated with VIE accounting guidance. Therefore DME II is SILP’s primary beneficiary. The Company\npresents its investment in SILP in its consolidated balance sheets in the caption “Investment in related party investment fund.”\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss relating to SILP is limited to the net asset value of the GLRE Limited\nPartners’ investment in SILP. At December 31, 2023, the net asset value of the GLRE Limited Partners’ investment in SILP was\n$258.9 million (December 31, 2022: $178.2 million), representing 72.7% (December 31, 2022: 69.3%) of SILP’s total net\nassets. DME II held the remaining 27.3% (December 31, 2022: 30.7%) of SILP’s total net assets. The investment in SILP is\nrecorded at the GLRE Limited Partners’ share of the net asset value of SILP as reported by SILP’s third-party administrator.\nThe GLRE Limited Partners can redeem their assets from SILP for operational purposes by providing 3 business days’ notice to\nDME II.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received in an asset sale or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between unaffiliated market participants. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized\nbased on the extent to which the inputs are observable in the market. The categorization of financial instruments within the\nvaluation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is\nprioritized into three levels (with Level 3 being the lowest) defined as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value of the assets\nand liabilities. The term “unobservable inputs” includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, and similar techniques.\nThere have been no material change in the Company’s valuation techniques, nor have there been any transfers between\nLevel 1 and Level 2, or Level 2 and Level 3 for the years presented in these consolidated financial statements.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\n20\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company held $61.3 million (2022: $53.6 million) of private investments and unlisted\nequities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. At December 31, 2023, the Company held $9.9 million (2022:\n$8.9 million) of private investments and unlisted equities measured at cost. The Company classifies these investments as Level\n3 within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table summarizes the periods between the most recent fair value measurement dates and December 31,\n2023, for the private and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:\nLess than 6\nmonths 6 to 12 months Over 1 year Total\nFair values measured on a nonrecurring basis $ 26,438 $ 1,361 $ 33,490 $ 61,289\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nDerivative financial instruments\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps in connection with its risk management activities to hedge 50% of the interest rate\nrisk relating to the outstanding Term Loans (see Note 9). The interest rate swaps are carried at fair value and are determined\nusing a market approach valuation technique based on significant observable market inputs from third-party pricing vendors.\nAccordingly, the interest rates swaps are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. These derivative instruments are\nnot designated as accounting hedges under U.S. GAAP.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized unrealized loss for the above derivatives of $0.6\nmillion (2022: $nil), which is included in “Other liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets, in “Interest expense” in the\nconsolidated statements of operations, and in “Net realized and unrealized losses on derivatives” in the consolidated statements\nof cash flows.\nFinancial Instruments Disclosed, But Not Carried, at Fair Value\nThe carrying value of debt and convertible debt securities within “Other Investments” (see “Private investments and\nunlisted equity securities without readily determinable fair values” above) and certificates of deposit with original maturities of\none year or less approximates their fair values. The Company classifies these assets as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nAt December 31, 2023, the carrying values of the Term Loans approximate their fair values.\n7. LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES\nThe Company’s loss and LAE reserves were composed of the following:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCase reserves $ 189,050 $ 184,756\nIBNR 472,504 370,712\nTotal $ 661,554 $ 555,468\n21\nReserve Roll-forward\nThe following provides a summary of changes in outstanding loss and LAE reserves for all lines of business:\nYear ended December 31\nConsolidated 2023 2022 2021\nGross balance at January 1 $ 555,468 $ 524,010 $ 494,179\nLess: Losses recoverable (13,239) (11,100) (16,851)\nNet balance at January 1 542,229 512,910 477,328\nIncurred losses related to:\nCurrent year 348,798 316,367 389,080\nPrior years 11,206 118 (14,100)\nTotal incurred 360,004 316,485 374,980\nPaid losses related to:\nCurrent year (75,678) (78,517) (152,214)\nPrior years (198,613) (198,897) (185,549)\nTotal paid (274,291) (277,414) (337,763)\nForeign currency revaluation 7,926 (9,752) (1,635)\nNet balance at December 31 635,867 542,229 512,910\nAdd: Losses recoverable (see Note 8) 25,687 13,239 11,100\nGross balance at December 31 $ 661,554 $ 555,468 $ 524,010\nEstimates for Significant Catastrophe Events\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses include estimated amounts for\nseveral catastrophe and weather-related events (“CAT loss”). The magnitude and volume of losses arising from these events is\ninherently uncertain and, consequently, actual losses for these events may ultimately differ, potentially materially, from current\nestimates.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized CAT loss, net of reinsurance, of $28.8 million for\ncurrent year CAT loss events, driven mainly by the U.S. severe storms and the Mexican state-owned oil platform fire loss. This\nwas partially offset by $10.7 million of net favorable prior year CAT development. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the\nCompany recognized current year CAT loss of $39.7 million driven primarily by $13.6 million from the Russian-Ukrainian\nconflict and $19.5 million from hurricane Ian. This was partially offset by $5.0 million net favorable prior year CAT\ndevelopment.\nPrior Year Reserve Development\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company experienced $11.2 million in net adverse development on prior\nyear loss and LAE reserves. This was comprised of $39.8 million of reserve strengthening on casualty, workers’ compensation\nand auto classes of business due to current economic and social inflation trends (various underwriting years); homeowners\nbusiness primary due to the deterioration in the CAT loss estimate relating to Winter Storm Elliott (2022 underwriting year),\ncoupled with a final claim settlement on a professional liability contract (2008 underwriting year). This was partially offset by\n$28.6 million favorable loss development from property catastrophe events and better than expected loss emergence for\nmortgage, marine and energy, and specialty contracts from underwriting years 2020-2022.\nSee the loss development tables by lines of business below under “Disclosure about Short-Duration Contracts” for more\ninformation on prior year loss reserve development.\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company experienced $0.1 million in net adverse development on prior\nyear loss and LAE reserves. This was comprised of $21.9 million of reserve strengthening on motor, health, casualty,\n22\nprofessional liability, and workers’ compensation contracts from underwriting years 2014-2021, coupled with higher claim\nsettlements on certain general liability contracts for 2015-2016 underwriting years. This was partially offset by $21.8 million\nfavorable loss development from various pre-2021 years’ property catastrophe events, including COVID-19, and better than\nexpected loss emergence for mortgage business (from 2017-2020 underwriting years), a multi-line combined workers’\ncompensation and commercial packages contract across multiple underwriting years, coupled with favorable development on a\nwhole account contract (2020 underwriting year).\nYear ended December 31, 2021\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company experienced $14.1 million in net favorable development on\nprior year loss and LAE reserves. This was comprised of $37.4 million favorable loss development from better-than-expected\nloss emergence for motor, mortgage, and various specialty contracts (including crop, space, and marine and energy) from\nunderwriting years 2015-2018, coupled with a multi-line contract that incepted in 2019. This was partially offset by\n$23.3 million adverse loss development primarily due to reserve strengthening on multi-line casualty, general liability and\nworkers’ compensation contracts from underwriting years 2014-2019.\nDisclosures about Short-Duration Contracts\nThe Company has one operating segment, Property & Casualty Reinsurance, and categorizes its business as Property,\nCasualty, and Other. The Company’s loss development tables presented below have been disaggregated by lines of business for\nthe years ended from December 31, 2014, through 2023.\nFor purposes of the loss development tables, the property business has been further disaggregated into \"Property\" and\n\"Motor - Physical Damage.\" The casualty category has been disaggregated into \"General Liability,\" \"Motor Liability,\"\n\"Professional Liability,\" and \"Workers' Compensation.\" Contracts that cover more than one line of business, including Lloyd’s\nbusiness, are grouped as \"Multi-line.\" Other specialty business, including aviation, crop, cyber, and energy, which are\nindividually insignificant to the Company’s overall business, have been grouped as \"Other.\" As the Company’s accident and\nhealth business has become immaterial in recent years, the Company has grouped accident and health business with “Other”\nduring 2023. Additionally, the Company has elected to present the loss development table for “Marine” separately from\n“Other” due to its growth in 2023. As a result, the historical incurred and paid claims development presented in the tables below\ndiffer from those disclosed in previously issued financial statements. Conforming changes were also made to the table above\npresenting the changes in the outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for health claims as part of the\n“Consolidated” table for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. The amounts shown in “Net loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses incurred” in the consolidated statements of operations and the allocation between “Current year” and “Prior years” are\nunaffected by these revisions.\nFor each category, the following tables present the incurred and paid claims development at December 31, 2023, net of\nretrocession, and the total of incurred but not reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims included within\nthe net incurred claims amount.\nThe tables below present incurred and paid claims development for the years ended December 31, 2014 to 2022.

As a result, all prior year information has been restated to reflect\nDecember 31, 2023, foreign exchange rates. This treatment prevents changes in foreign currency exchange rates from distorting\nthe claims development between the years presented.\nFor assumed contracts, the Company does not generally receive claims information by accident year from the ceding\ninsurers but instead receives claims information by the treaty year of the contract. Claims reported by the ceding insurer to the\n33\nCompany may have the covered losses occurring in an accident year other than the treaty year. Some incurred and paid claims\nhave been allocated to the accident years for the loss development tables based on the proportion of premiums earned for each\ncontract during such accident year.\nFor example, a one-year quota-share reinsurance treaty incepting on October 1, 2020 (with underlying policies each\nhaving a one-year duration) would have a 24-month period over which the premiums would be earned. Therefore, claims would\nbe allocated to accident years 2020, 2021 and 2022 based on the proportion of the premiums earned during each accident year.\nFor illustration of this contract, any claims reported during 2020 would be allocated to the 2020 accident year. For losses\nreported during 2021, the claims would be allocated between 2020 and 2021 based on the percentage of premiums earned\nduring 2020 and 2021. Similarly, for losses reported during 2022 and thereafter, the losses would be allocated to the 2020, 2021\nand 2022 accident years based on the proportion of premiums earned during each of those years. However, natural catastrophes\nand certain other large losses are addressed separately and are assigned to the accident year in which they occurred.\nThe reconciliation of the net incurred and paid claims development tables to the liability for claims and claim\nadjustment expenses in the consolidated balance sheet is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023\nNet outstanding liabilities\nMultiline $ 247,929\nGeneral Liability 74,853\nMotor Casualty 22,622\nMotor Property 2,972\nProperty 48,914\nProfessional Liability 15,767\nWorkers' Compensation 55,792\nFinancial Lines 56,202\nMarine 27,150\nOther 77,092\nLiabilities for claims and claims adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance 629,293\nAdd: Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid claims 25,687\nAdd: Unallocated claims adjustment expenses 6,087\nAdd: Allowance for credit losses 487\nTotal gross liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense $ 661,554\nThe average historical annual percentage payout of net incurred claims (excluding health) at December 31, 2023, is as\nfollows:\nYears 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n(Unaudited - Supplementary Information)\nMultiline 11.2 % 17.3 % 16.0 % 11.6 % 9.8 % 9.9 % 9.2 % 8.1 % 4.7 % 2.2 %\nGeneral Liability 4.7 % 13.6 % 13.1 % 12.5 % 18.2 % 27.5 % 6.9 % 3.0 % 0.4 % 0.1 %\nMotor Casualty 49.5 % 35.8 % 7.7 % 3.6 % 1.5 % 0.9 % 0.8 % 0.2 % — % — %\nMotor Property 53.3 % 40.8 % 4.9 % 1.0 % — % — % — % — % — % — %\nProperty 49.0 % 34.4 % 8.2 % 3.2 % 2.7 % 0.9 % 1.0 % 0.5 % 0.1 % — %\nProfessional Liability 2.7 % 9.8 % 14.3 % 12.7 % 8.7 % 7.3 % 5.6 % 2.3 % 2.6 % 34.0 %\nWorkers' Compensation 30.9 % 35.2 % 20.4 % 9.2 % 3.0 % 0.9 % 0.2 % 0.2 % — % — %\nFinancial Lines 18.5 % 33.8 % 23.6 % 12.0 % 4.1 % 3.7 % 1.7 % 1.5 % 1.1 % — %\nMarine 4.3 % 25.2 % 40.0 % 2.3 % 11.3 % 1.7 % 15.2 % — % — % — %\nOther 19.7 % 27.2 % 7.7 % 9.3 % 7.7 % 7.1 % 7.1 % 6.9 % 7.3 % — %\n34\nThe historical annual percentage payout pattern for health claims is excluded from the table above because health\nclaims have short settlement periods, and including it would skew the results presented.\nAs a reinsurance entity, the Company generally does not receive detailed claims frequency information or claims\ncounts from ceding insurers and third-party claim handlers. Due to the nature of the reinsurance contracts, the underlying\ninsured reports claims to the insurer who cedes losses to the Company. The Company is contractually obligated to reimburse the\nceding insurer for its share of the losses. While the Company has the right to conduct audits of the ceding insurer’s claims files,\nthe insurer is generally not obligated to provide a detailed listing of claims counts or other claims frequency information.\nTherefore it is impracticable for the Company to present the cumulative number of reported claims by accident year.\n8. RETROCESSION\nFrom time to time, the Company purchases retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to manage\nits overall exposure, reduce its net liability on individual risks, obtain additional underwriting capacity, and balance its\nunderwriting portfolio. The Company records loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable from retrocessionaires as assets.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of ceded reinsurance:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022 2021\nGross ceded premiums $ 42,762 $ 33,429 $ 41\nEarned ceded premiums $ 43,653 $ 15,318 $ —\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses ceded $ 25,554 $ 6,615 $ (12)\nRetrocession contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to its cedents. Failure of retrocessionaires to\nhonor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The following table shows a breakdown of losses recoverable on\na gross and net of collateral basis:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNet of Net of\nGross Collateral(1) Gross Collateral(1)\nA- or better by A.M.

This excludes any excess collateral in order to disclose the aggregate net\nexposure for each retrocessionaire.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had 3 reinsurers (2022: 4) that accounted for 10% or more each of the total loss and loss\nadjustment expenses recoverable, net, for an aggregate gross amount of $20.4 million (2022: $11.1 million).\n9. DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES\nDebt Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s outstanding debt obligations.\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nTerm loans $ 74,062 $ —\nSenior convertible notes — 79,610\nTotal principal amount 74,062 79,610\nAccrued interest payable — 1,331\nLess: deferred financing costs (781) (407)\nTotal debt $ 73,281 $ 80,534\n35\nTerm Loans\nOn June 16, 2023, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a group of banks (the\n“Banks”), for which CIBC Bank USA is acting as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides, subject to certain\ncustomary conditions, for a delayed draw term loan facility (the “Loan Facility”), in an aggregate amount of $75.0 million.\nOutstanding loans (“Term Loans”) under the Facility will (i) amortize in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual\namount equal to 5.0% of the Term Loans and (ii) accrue interest at a rate equal to an adjusted term Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 3.5% per annum. The Company posted $10.0 million of collateral as security for the Loan\nFacility. The Loan Facility matures on August 1, 2026.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company borrowed $75.0M from the Loan Facility of which\n$63.4 million was used to repay all of the outstanding Convertible Senior Notes (see below), with the remaining proceeds for\ngeneral corporate purposes. The Company also made $0.9 million partial repayment on the Term Loans. The interest rate on\nthe outstanding Terms Loans was 8.9% at December 31, 2023. To manage interest rate risk, the Company hedged 50% of the\nfloating interest rate on the Term Loans (see Note 6).\nThe Company was in compliance with all covenants relating to the Loan Facility at December 31, 2023.\nSenior Convertible Notes\nOn August 7, 2018, the Company issued $100.0 million of senior unsecured convertible notes (the “Convertible Notes”),\nwith a maturity date of August 1, 2023. The Convertible Notes paid interest at 4.0%, payable semi-annually on February 1 and\nAugust 1 of each year beginning February 1, 2019. The conversion price was $17.19 per ordinary share of the Company.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023 the Company repurchased and canceled $17.5 million (2022: $20.4 million)\nof the Convertible Notes, respectively, resulting in realized gains of $0.3 million (2022: $0.3 million), which is included in\n“Other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statements of operations. As noted above, the Company fully repaid the\nremaining outstanding Convertible Notes on August 1, 2023, from the proceeds of the new Term Loans.\nFinancing Costs\nThe Company incurred $0.9 million of issuance costs relating to the Credit Agreement, which are deferred and amortized\nthrough the maturity of the Loan Facility. The remaining unamortized deferred financing costs are reported separately in the\nabove table.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized interest expense of $5.3 million (2022: $4.2 million,\n2021: $6.3 million) relating to the total debt, which included the interest coupon, the amortization of issuance costs and the\nchange in fair value of the interest rate swap (see Note 6).\nCredit Facilities\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had the following letter of credit (“LOC”) facilities:\nCapacity LOCs issued Termination Date\nCitibank Europe plc (\"Citi LOC\")1 $ 289,000 $ 276,756 August 20, 2024\nCIBC Bank USA (\"CIBC LOC\") 200,000 13,903 December 21, 2024\n$ 489,000 $ 290,659\n1) Includes $14.0 million of uncommitted capacity.\nThe above LOCs issued are cash collateralized (see Note 5). The LOC facilities are subject to various customary\naffirmative, negative and financial covenants. At December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all LOC facilities\ncovenants.\n36\nCiti LOC\nThe Citi LOC facility automatically renews each year unless terminated by either party subject to a 120 days notice prior\nto termination date.\nCIBC LOC\nOn December 22, 2023, through a subsidiary, the Company entered into a credit agreement with CIBC Bank USA for a\n$200.0 million committed LOC facility (the “CIBC LOC Facility”), with a $30.0 million sublimit for unsecured LOCs (the\n“CIBC Revolving Credit Facility”). Loans made under the CIBC Revolving Credit Facility, solely for supporting unsecured\nLOCs, will accrue interest at a rate of base rate plus 2.5% per annum in the event that the beneficiary draws down on an\nunsecured LOC and the Company does not provide cash collateral within the stipulated period. The CIBC LOC Facility is\nsubject to an automatic extension of one year without prior written notice by the Company. The CIBC Revolving Credit Facility\nexpires after one year.\n10.

Any shares\nrepurchased are canceled immediately upon repurchase. For the year ended December 31, 2023, there was no repurchase of\nordinary shares (2022: 4,933 at an average price of $7.04 per share).\nPreferred Shares\nThe Company’s authorized share capital also consists of 50,000,000 preference shares with a par value of $0.10 each.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company has no issued and outstanding preferred shares.\n37\n11. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nOn July 25, 2023, at the Company’s Annual General Meeting the shareholders approved the Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd.\n2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan, or the 2023 Incentive Plan. The 2023 Incentive Plan replaces the Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd.\nAmended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, or the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan. The aggregate number of ordinary shares\nthat are available to be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2023 Incentive Plan is equal to the sum of (i) 2,000,000\nshares, and (ii) any shares that remained or otherwise become available under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan as of July 25,\n2023. If, after July 25, 2023, any award granted under the 2023 Incentive Plan or the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan is forfeited or\notherwise expires, terminates or is canceled , then the number of ordinary shares subject to such award that were not issued\nshall become available for issuance under the 2023 Incentive Plan.

They will vest on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the date of the share issuance and\n(ii) the Company’s next annual general meeting, subject to the grantee’s continued service with the Company.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company granted to employees (i) 357,766 (2022: 601,213) restricted shares\nwith both performance and service-based vesting conditions (“Performance RSs”) and (ii) 177,563 (2022: 248,659) restricted\nshares with only service-based vesting conditions (“Service RSs”). Most of these Service RSs vest evenly each year on January\n1, subject to the grantee’s continued service with the Company.

At December 31, 2023, there were 162,489 non-vested CEO RSs with a weighted average\ngrant date fair value of $9.00 per share. As the performance conditions associated with these restricted shares have not been\nmet, the Company recognized no compensation cost relating to the unvested CEO RSs for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company modified certain share-based awards previously\ngranted to the CEO in connection with the Separation Agreement (see Note 15), resulting in an incremental share-based\ncompensation charge of $1.5 million (see below “Stock Compensation Expense”).\nAt December 31, 2023, there was $3.0 million (2022: $3.3 million) of unrecognized compensation cost relating to non-\nvested restricted shares (excluding the above CEO RSs), which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average\nperiod of 1.4 years (2022: 1.4 years).

DME II\nreceives a performance allocation equal to (with capitalized terms having the meaning provided under the SILP LPA) (a) 10%\nof the portion of the Positive Performance Change for each limited partner’s capital account that is less than or equal to the\npositive balance in such limited partner’s Carryforward Account, plus (b) 20% of the portion of the Positive Performance\nChange for each limited partner’s capital account that exceeds the positive balance in such limited partner’s Carryforward\nAccount. The Carryforward Account for Greenlight Re and GRIL includes the amount of investment losses to be recouped,\nincluding any loss generated on the assets invested in SILP, subject to adjustments for redemptions. The loss carry-forward\nprovision in the SILP LPA allows DME II to earn a reduced performance allocation of 10% of profits in years subsequent to\nany year in which SILP has incurred a loss until all losses are recouped, and an additional amount equal to 150% of the loss is\nearned.\nIn accordance with the SILP LPA, DME Advisors constructs a levered investment portfolio as agreed by the Company\n(the “Investment Portfolio” as defined in the SILP LPA). On September 1, 2018, SILP entered into the IAA with DME\nAdvisors, which entitles DME Advisors to a monthly management fee equal to 0.125% (1.5% on an annual basis) of each\nlimited partner’s Investment Portfolio. The IAA has an initial term ending on August 31, 2023, subject to an automatic\nextension for successive three-year terms.\nFor a detailed breakdown of management fees and performance compensation for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, refer to Note 3.\nPursuant to the SILP LPA and the IAA, the Company has agreed to indemnify DME, DME II, and DME Advisors for\nany expense, loss, liability, or damage arising out of any claim asserted or threatened in connection with DME Advisors serving\nas the Company’s or SILP’s investment advisor. The Company will reimburse DME, DME II, and DME Advisors for\nreasonable costs and expenses of investigating and defending such claims provided such claims were not caused due to gross\nnegligence, breach of contract, or misrepresentation by DME, DME II, or DME Advisors. The Company incurred no\nindemnification amounts during the periods presented.\nGreen Brick Partners, Inc.\nDavid Einhorn also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Green Brick Partners, Inc.

Under applicable securities laws, DME Advisors may\nsometimes be limited in its ability to trade GRBK shares held in SILP. At December 31, 2023, SILP held 2.7 million shares of\nGRBK.\nService Agreement\nThe Company has entered into a service agreement with DME Advisors, pursuant to which DME Advisors provides\ncertain investor relations services to the Company for compensation of five thousand dollars per month (plus expenses).

The following is a summary of the\nmaterial financial terms of the Separation Agreement:\n• $2.4 million cash severance payable over 18 months and $0.3 million salary continuance to April 30, 2024\n(these have been accrued and included in “Other liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31,\n2023);\n• $1.5 million non-cash charge for accelerated vesting for Mr. Burton’s remaining 235,936 service restricted\nshares and modified vesting condition for Mr. Burton’s remaining 532,035 performance restricted shares in which\nthe service condition is no longer a requirement for vesting (see Note 11); and\n• $1.6 million grant date fair value of performance restricted shares to be granted in March 2024.\nAs a result of the above Separation Agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a total\ncharge of $4.3 million including the incremental share-based compensation cost for the modified grants, which is included in\n“General and administrative expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations.\n16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\na) Concentration of Credit Risk\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company monitors its concentration of credit risk with financial institutions and limits acceptable counterparties\nbased on current rating, outlook and other relevant factors.\nInvestments\nThe Company’s credit risk exposure to private debt and convertible debt securities within its “Other investments” are\nimmaterial (see Note 4).\nReinsurance balances receivable, net\nThe following table shows the breakdown of reinsurance balances receivable:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAmount % Amount %\nPremiums receivable $ 186,940 30.2 % $ 160,559 31.8 %\nFunds withheld:\nFunds held by cedants 50,075 8.1 % 45,351 9.0 %\nPremiums held by Lloyds' syndicates 264,278 42.7 % 188,056 37.2 %\nFunds at Lloyd’s 115,772 18.6 % 103,947 20.5 %\nProfit commission receivable 2,302 0.4 % 4,888 1.0 %\nDeposit assets 888 0.1 % 3,110 0.6 %\nTotal before provision 620,255 100.1 % 505,911 100.1 %\nProvision for expected credit losses (854) (0.1)% (356) (0.1)%\nReinsurance balances receivable, net $ 619,401 100.0 % $ 505,555 100.0 %\nThe Company has posted deposits at Loyd’s to support underwriting capacity for certain syndicates, including\nSyndicate 3456 (see Note 18). Lloyd’s has a credit rating of “A” (Excellent) from A.M. Best.\nPremiums receivable includes a significant portion of estimated premiums not yet due. Brokers and other\nintermediaries are responsible for collecting premiums from customer on the Company’s behalf. The Company monitors its\nconcentration of credit risks from brokers (see Note 17). The diversity in the Company’s client base limits credit risk associated\n44\nwith premiums receivable and funds (premiums) held by cedents. Further, under the reinsurance contracts the Company has\ncontractual rights to offset premium balances receivable and funds held by cedants against corresponding payments for losses\nand loss expenses.\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable, net\nThe Company regularly evaluates its net credit exposure to the retrocessionaires and their abilities to honor their\nrespective obligations. See Note 8 for analysis of concentration of credit risk relating to retrocessionaires.\nb) Lease Obligations\nThe Company operates in the Cayman Islands, United Kingdom, and Ireland under various non-cancelable operating\nlease agreements. The Company’s weighted-average remaining operating lease term is approximately 2.5 years at December 31,\n2023.\nAs the lease contracts generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, the Company used the weighted-average\ndiscount rate of 6.0% to determine the present value of lease payments. This discount rate represents the Company’s\nincremental borrowing rate for a term similar to that of the associated lease based on information available at the\ncommencement date. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to include renewal, termination, or purchase\noptions that are not reasonably certain of exercise when determining the borrowing term.\nAt December 31, 2023, the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities relating to the operating leases were $1.4 million and\n$1.5 million, respectively (2022: $1.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively). For the year ended December 31, 2023, the\nCompany recognized operating lease expense $0.6 million (2022: $0.6 million, 2021: $0.4 million).\nAt December 31, 2023, the commitment for operating lease liabilities for future annual periods was as follows:\nYear ending December 31,\n2024 $ 637\n2025 653\n2026 352\nTotal lease payments 1,642\nLess Imputed Interest (142)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 1,500\nc) Litigation\nFrom time to time, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may be involved in formal and informal dispute\nresolution procedures, which may include arbitration or litigation. The outcomes of these procedures determine the rights and\nobligations under the Company’s reinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, the Company may\nseek to enforce its rights under an agreement or collect funds owed. In other matters, the Company may resist attempts by\nothers to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of legal disputes with certainty,\nthe Company does not believe that any existing dispute, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, or operating results.\n45\n17.

Under this Insurance Regulations, Greenlight Re is required to\nmaintain minimum statutory capital and surplus equal to the greater of: a) the Minimum Capital Requirement of $50.0 million\nand b) the Prescribed Capital Requirement (“PCR”) as defined in the Insurance Regulations.\nGreenlight Re is not required to prepare statutory financial statements for filing with CIMA. There were no material\ndifferences between Greenlight Re’s GAAP capital, surplus, and net income and its statutory capital, surplus, and net income at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and for the years then ended.\nAny dividends declared and paid from Greenlight Re to the Company requires CIMA’s approval. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, $8.3 million of dividends (2022: $60.1 million, 2021: $4.0 million) were declared or paid by Greenlight\nRe to the Company. The dividends were approved by CIMA and resulted in the return of additional share capital to the\nCompany. The dividends were used primarily to repurchase and repay the Company’s Convertible Notes (see Note 9). At\nDecember 31, 2023, $312.5 million (2022: $248.5 million) of Greenlight Re’s capital and surplus was available for\ndistribution as dividends.\n47\nIreland\nEffective January 1, 2016, the Company’s Irish subsidiary (GRIL) is obligated to maintain at all times the Minimum\nCapital Requirement (“Irish MCR”) and the Solvency Capital Requirement (“SCR”) as calculated by reference to Solvency II\ndefinition.\nThere were no material differences between the statutory financial statements and statements prepared in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP for GRIL at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and for the years then ended.\nThe amount of dividends that GRIL is permitted to distribute is limited to its retained earnings. The Central Bank of\nIreland has powers to intervene if a dividend payment were to breach regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2023\nand 2022, none of GRIL’s capital and surplus was available for distribution as dividends.\nLloyd’s of London\nThe Company operates in the Lloyd’s market through its corporate member, GCM, which provides 100% of Syndicate\n3456’s capital support. Syndicate 3456 is managed by a third party managing agency. GCM and Syndicate 3456 are bound by\nthe rules of Lloyd’s, which are prescribed by Bye-laws and Requirements made by the Council of Lloyd’s under powers\nconferred by the Lloyd’s Act 1982. These rules prescribe members’ membership subscription, the level of their contributions to\nthe Lloyd’s Central Fund and the assets they must deposit with Lloyd’s in support of their underwriting. Further, the Council of\nLloyd’s has broad powers to sanctions breaches of its rules, including the power to restrict or prohibit a member’s participation\non Lloyd’s syndicates.\nThe underwriting capacity of a member of Lloyd’s must be supported by providing a deposit, known as “Funds at\nLloyds” or “FAL”, in the form of cash, certain investment securities, or letters of credit. The FAL is not available for\ndistributions for the payment of dividends or for working capital requirements. Further, corporate members may also be\nrequired to maintain funds under the control of Lloyd’s in excess of their capital requirements and such funds also may not be\navailable for distribution for the payment of dividends. The amount of FAL for Syndicate 3456 is determined by Lloyd’s and is\nbased on Syndicate 3456’s solvency and capital requirement based on an internal capital model. See Note 16 for total FAL for\nSyndicate 3456 and other syndicates in which the Company has a participation interest.\n48\nSCHEDULE I\nGREENLIGHT CAPITAL RE, LTD.\nSUMMARY OF INVESTMENTS — OTHER THAN INVESTMENTS IN RELATED PARTIES\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nBalance\nType of Investment Cost Fair Value Sheet Value\nOther investments:\nPrivate investments and unlisted equities $ 28,470 $ 71,157 $ 71,157\nDebt and convertible debt securities 2,499 2,136 2,136\nTotal other investments 30,969 73,293 73,293\nTotal investments -

(the \"Company\"), which comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the related statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the two years\nin the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements (collectively referred\nto as the “financial statements”).\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows\nfor each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe did not audit the financial statements of Solasglas Investments, LP, an equity method investment of the\nCompany, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and for each of the two years in period ended December 31,\n2023. The Company’s investment in Solasglas Investments, LP as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $233.5\nmillion and 149.7 million, respectively, and its equity in net income of Solasglas Investments, LP was $26.8\nmillion and $48.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The financial statements of\nSolasglas Investments, LP were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our\nopinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Solasglas Investments, LP, is based solely on the report\nof the other auditors.\nBasis for Opinion\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s\nResponsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be\nindependent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant\nethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient\nand appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\nOther Matter\nThe financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 were audited by\nother auditors who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on March 8, 2022.\n3\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\n2\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in\nany way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which it relates.\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is derived using expected trends in claim\nseverity and frequency and other factors that may vary significantly as claims are settled. The estimate is\nsensitive to significant assumptions, including the initial expected loss ratio and loss development factors. The\nestimate is also sensitive to the selection of actuarial methods and weighting of these methods applied to\nproject the ultimate losses, the estimation of ultimate reserves associated with catastrophic events, and other\nfactors. Further, not all catastrophic events can be modeled using traditional actuarial methodologies, which\nincreases the degree of judgment needed in estimating loss reserves for such events.\nAuditing the Company’s methods, assumptions and best estimate of the cost of the ultimate settlement and\nadministration of claims represented by the incurred but not reported (\"IBNR\") claims included in recorded Loss\nand loss adjustment expense reserves involved especially subjective auditor judgment and an increased extent\nof effort, including the involvement of our actuarial specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to loss and loss adjustment expense reserves included the following, among\nothers\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of the recorded loss and loss adjustment\nexpense reserves, including the review and approval process that management has in place for\nsignificant actuarial methods and assumptions used and the approval of management’s best estimate\nof loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.\n• We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data that served as the basis for the\nCompany’s actuarial analysis, including historical claims data, to test the reasonableness of key inputs\nto the actuarial estimate.\n• With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:\n− We independently developed an estimate of the reserves for selected contracts, compared our\nestimates to those booked by the Company, and evaluated the differences.\n− We evaluated the Company’s methodologies against recognized actuarial practices for the\nremaining contracts. We also evaluated the assumptions used by the Company using our industry\nknowledge and experience and other analytical procedures.\n− We compared the results of the quarterly reserve studies prepared by independent external\nactuaries to management’s best estimate and evaluated the differences.\n4\nRequired Supplementary Information\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the incurred and paid\nclaims development information for years preceding the most recent reporting period and the historical\naverage annual percentage payout of incurred claims by age in Note 7 to the financial statements be presented\nto supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and,\nalthough not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board\nwho considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an\nappropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the\nrequired supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United\nStates of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information\nand comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic\nfinancial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We\ndo not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not\nprovide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.\nResponsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design,\nimplementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of\nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or\nevents, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free\nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our\nopinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a\nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when\nit exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting\nfrom error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override\nof internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually\nor in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial\nstatements.\n5\nIn performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we:\n• Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud\nor error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nOrganization\nGreenlight Reinsurance, Ltd. (the “Company”) was incorporated as an exempted company under the Companies Act of\nthe Cayman Islands on July 13, 2004 and has a Class “D” insurer license issued in accordance with the terms of The Insurance\nAct, 2010 (as amended) and underlying regulations thereto (the “Act”), and is subject to regulation by the Cayman Islands\nMonetary Authority (“CIMA”). Greenlight Re commenced underwriting in April 2006.\nThe Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (the “Parent”). The Parent’s ordinary shares\nare listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE”.\nAdditionally, through Syndicate 3456, Greenlight Re provides a (re)insurance platform to its growing portfolio of\ninsurtech partnerships. Domiciled in the U.K. since 2022, Syndicate 3456 is authorized to underwrite under the Lloyd’s\nsyndicate-in-a-box model. Greenlight Re Corporate Member Ltd. (“GCM”), domiciled in the U.K., is a corporate member that\nbecame a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent in 2023 and provides underwriting capacity for various Lloyd’s syndicates,\nincluding Syndicate 3456.\nBasis of Presentation\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the\ncurrent financial statements. The Company has reported separately the foreign exchange gains (losses) from “Other income” in\nthe statements of operations. This resulted in no change to the previously reported total revenues or net income. The Company\nhas also included the foreign exchange gains (losses) as part of the net change in working capital in the statements of cash\nflows. Further, the Company combined “Other assets, excluding depreciation” and “Other liabilities” and presented the sum as\n“Other items, net” in the statements of cash flows. These changes in presentation in the statements of cash flows have resulted\nin no change to the previously reported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\nTabular dollar amounts are in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts or otherwise noted. All amounts are\nreported in U.S. dollars.\n2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company’s significant accounting policies are as follows:\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ\nfrom these estimates.\nThe Company’s principal estimates include:\n• loss and loss adjustment expense reserves;\n• premiums written and earned and related premium receivable, net of expected credit losses;\n• reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including expected credit losses; and\n• valuation of investments, including impairments.\n11\nInvestments\nInvestment in related party investment fund\nThe Company records its investment in the related party investment fund based on fair value using the net asset value\npractical expedient, with the Company’s share of the fund’s net income (loss) reported as “Income (loss) from investment in\nrelated party investment fund” in the statements of operations.\nOther investments\nThe Company’s other investments include short-term investments and private investments and unlisted equity securities\nwithout readily determinable fair values.\nShort-term investments are measured at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. These include certificate of\ndeposit and other financial instruments with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year.\nThe Company measures its private investments and unlisted equity securities without readily determinable fair values at\ncost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from identical or similar investments of the same issuers\n(the “measurement alternative”), with such changes recognized in“Net investment income (loss)” in the statements of\noperations. The Company considers the need for impairment on a by-investment basis based on certain indicators. Under the\nmeasurement alternative, the Company makes two types of valuation adjustments:\n• When the Company observes an orderly transaction of an investee’s identical or similar equity securities, the Company\nadjusts the carrying value based on the observable price as of the transaction date. Once the Company records such an\nadjustment, the investment is considered an “asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.”\n• If the Company determines that the investment is impaired and the fair value is less than its carrying value, it writes\ndown the investment to its fair value. Once the Company records such an adjustment, the investment is considered an\n“asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.”\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments and certificates of deposit with\noriginal maturity dates of three months or less. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are presented separately in the balance\nsheets.\nPremium Revenue Recognition\nThe Company writes excess of loss contracts and quota share contracts, and estimates the ultimate premiums for the\ncontract period. The Company bases these estimates on actuarial pricing models and information received from ceding\ncompanies. For excess of loss contracts, the Company writes the total ultimate estimated premiums at the contract’s inception.\nFor quota share contracts, the Company writes premiums in the same periods in which the underlying insurance contracts are\nwritten, based on cession statements from cedents. The Company typically receives these statements monthly or quarterly,\ndepending on the terms specified in each contract. For any reporting lag, the Company estimates premiums written based\non the portion of the estimated ultimate premiums relating to the risks bound during the lag period.\nFor multi-year contracts, reinsurance premiums are recorded at the inception of the contract based on management’s best\nestimate of total premiums to be received. Premiums are recognized on an annual basis for multi-year contracts where the\ncedants have the ability to unilaterally commute or cancel coverage within the term of the contract.\nManagement regularly reviews premium estimates. Such review includes the Company’s experience with the ceding\ncompanies, managing general underwriters, familiarity with each market, the timing of the reported information, a comparison\nof reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the aging and collection of premiums.\nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of the premium estimates on the basis of these reviews and records any adjustments\nto these estimates in the period in which they are determined. Changes in premium estimates, including premium receivable on\nboth excess of loss and quota share contracts, are not unusual and may result in significant adjustments in any period. A portion\nof amounts included in “Reinsurance balances receivable” in the Company’s balance sheets represent estimated premiums\nwritten, net of commissions and brokerage, that are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts. Additional\npremiums due on a contract with no remaining coverage period are earned in full when written.\n12\nCertain contracts allow for reinstatement premiums in the event of a loss. Reinstatement premiums are written and\nearned when a triggering loss event occurs.\nPremiums written are generally recognized as earned over the contract period in proportion to the risk covered. Unearned\npremiums represent the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided.\nReinsurance Premiums Ceded\nThe Company reduces the risk of future losses on business assumed by reinsuring certain risks and exposures with other\nreinsurers (referred to as “retrocessionaires”). The Company remains liable to the extent that any retrocessionaire fails to meet\nits obligations and to the extent the Company does not hold sufficient security for its unpaid obligations.\nCeded premiums are written during the period in which the risks incept and the associated expense is recognized over the\ncontract period in proportion to the protection provided. Unearned premiums ceded represent the unexpired portion of\nreinsurance obtained.\nAcquisition Costs\nPolicy acquisition costs vary with, and are directly related to, the successful production of new and renewal business,\nand consist principally of commissions, taxes and brokerage expenses. The Company presents acquisition costs incurred on\nreinsurance assumed net of commissions earned on reinsurance ceded. However, if the sum of a contract’s expected losses and\nloss expenses and deferred acquisition costs exceeds associated unearned premiums and expected investment income, a\npremium deficiency is determined to exist. In this event, the Company writes off deferred acquisition costs to the extent\nnecessary to eliminate the premium deficiency. If the premium deficiency exceeds deferred acquisition costs the Company\naccrues a liability for the deficiency. The Company did not recognize any premium deficiency adjustments during the periods\npresented.\nPolicy acquisition costs also include profit commissions, which the Company recognized on a basis consistent with its\nestimate of losses and loss expenses.\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves and Recoverable\nThe Company’s loss and loss adjustment expense reserves (“LAE”) are composed of:\n● case reserves for loss and LAE resulting from claims notified to the Company by its clients; and\n● reserves for estimated loss and LAE incurred by insureds and reinsureds but not yet reported to the insurer or\nreinsurer (“IBNR”), including unknown future developments on loss and LAE that are known to the insurer or\nreinsurer.\nThe Company estimates these reserves based on reports from ceding companies, industry data and historical experience\nanalyzed using standard actuarial and statistical techniques.\nThe analysis includes assessing currently available data, predictions of future developments, estimates of future trends\nand other factors. These estimates are reviewed by the Company’s reserving committee at least quarterly and adjusted as\nnecessary.\nThe final settlement of losses may vary, perhaps materially, from the reserves recorded. The Company recognizes\nall adjustments to the estimates in the period they are determined. U.S. GAAP does not permit establishing loss reserves, which\ninclude case reserves and IBNR loss reserves, until the occurrence of an event that may give rise to a claim. As a result, only\nloss reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date are established. There is no allowance for the establishment\nof loss reserves to account for expected future loss events.\nThe “Loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable” in the Company’s balance sheets represents the amounts due from\nretrocessionaires for unpaid loss and LAE on retrocession agreements. Ceded IBNR recoverable amounts are estimated based\non the Company’s actuarial estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted when deemed necessary. The\nCompany may be unable to recover the loss and LAE recoverable amounts due as a result of the retrocessionaires’ inability to\npay. The Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of its retrocessionaires and calculates an allowance for expected\ncredit losses (see “Reinsurance Assets” below).\n13\nFor losses stemming from exposure to natural perils, loss reserves are generally established based on loss payments and\ncase reserves reported by clients when, and if, received. Estimates for IBNR losses are added to the case reserves as the\nCompany deems appropriate. To establish catastrophe IBNR loss estimates, the Company uses estimates communicated by\nceding companies, industry data and information, knowledge of the business written and management’s judgment.\nFor contracts without significant exposure to-natural perils, initial reserves for each contract are determined based on a\ncombination of (i) the pricing analysis performed prior to binding the contract; (ii) the underwriter’s detailed knowledge of the\ncedent, its operations and future business plans; and (iii) the professional judgment and recommendation of the Chief Actuary.\nIn the pricing analysis, the Company utilizes information from the client and industry data. This information typically includes,\nbut is not limited to, data related to premiums, losses, exposure, business mix, industry performance, and associated trends\ncovering as much history as deemed appropriate. The level of detail within the data obtained varies greatly depending on the\nunderlying contract, line of business, client, and coverage provided. In all cases, the Company requests each client to provide\ndata for each reporting period, which, depending on the contract, could be on a monthly or quarterly basis. The terms and\nconditions of each contract specify the data reporting requirements.\nGenerally, the Company obtains regular updates of premium and loss-related information for the current and historical\nperiods, and utilizes them to update the initially expected loss ratio. There may be a lag between (i) claims being reported by the\nunderlying insured to the Company’s cedent and (ii) claims being reported by the Company’s cedent to the Company. This lag\nmay impact the Company’s loss reserve estimates. Client reports have pre-determined due dates (for example, fifteen days after\neach month end). The timing of the reporting requirements is designed so that the Company receives premium and loss\ninformation as soon as practicable once the client has closed its books. Accordingly, there should be a short lag in such\nreporting. Additionally, most contracts that have the potential for large single event losses have provisions that such loss\nnotifications are provided to the Company immediately upon the occurrence of an event.\nOnce the updated information is received, the Company uses various standard actuarial methods for its quarterly\nanalysis. Such methods typically include the following:\n● Paid loss development method: Ultimate losses are estimated by calculating past paid loss development factors and\napplying them to exposure periods with further expected paid loss development. This method assumes that losses are\npaid in a consistent pattern. It provides an objective test of reported loss projections because paid losses contain no\nreserve estimates.\n● Reported loss development method: Ultimate losses are estimated by calculating past reported loss development\nfactors and applying them to exposure periods with further expected reported loss development. This method\nincorporates changes in payments and case reserves.\n● Expected loss ratio method: Ultimate losses are estimated by multiplying earned premiums by an expected loss ratio.\nThe expected loss ratio is often determined using industry data, historical company data, past pricing or reserving\nanalysis performed, and actuarial judgment. This method is typically used for lines of business and contracts where\nthere are no (or insignificant) historical losses or where past loss experience is not considered applicable to the current\nperiod.\n● Bornhuetter-Ferguson paid loss method: Ultimate losses are estimated by modifying expected loss ratios to the\nextent losses paid to date differ from what would have been expected based upon the selected paid loss development\npattern. This method avoids some distortions that could result from a large development factor being applied to a\nsmall base of paid losses to calculate ultimate losses.\n● Bornhuetter-Ferguson reported loss method: Ultimate losses are estimated by modifying expected loss ratios to the\nextent losses reported to date differ from what would have been expected based upon the selected reported loss\ndevelopment pattern. This method avoids some distortions that could result from a large development factor being\napplied to a small base of reported losses to calculate ultimate losses.\n● Frequency / Severity method: Ultimate losses are estimated by multiplying the ultimate number of claims (i.e., the\nfrequency multiplied by the exposure base) by the estimated average cost per claim (i.e., the severity). This approach\nenables trends and patterns in the rates of claims emergence (i.e., reporting) and settlement (i.e., closure) and the\naverage cost of claims to be analyzed separately.\nIn addition, the Company may supplement its analysis with other reserving methodologies that it deems relevant to\nspecific contracts.\nFor each contract, the Company utilizes reserving methodologies it considers appropriate to calculate a best estimate of\nreserves. Whether the Company uses a single methodology or a combination depends upon the portfolio segment being\nanalyzed and the actuary’s judgment. The Company’s reserving methodology does not require a fixed weighting of the various\nmethods used. Certain methods are considered more appropriate than others depending on the type, structure, age, maturity and\n14\nduration of the expected losses on the contract. For example, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson reported loss method might be more\nappropriate than a paid loss development method for relatively new contracts that have experienced little paid loss\ndevelopment.\nThe Company’s gross aggregate reserves are the sum of the best estimate reserves of all portfolio exposures. Generally,\nIBNR loss reserves are calculated by estimating the ultimate incurred losses and subtracting cumulative paid claims and case\nreserves. Each quarter, the Company’s Reserving Committee, led by the Chief Actuary, meets to assess the adequacy of our\nloss reserves based on the reserve analysis and recommendations prepared by the Company’s reserving department.\nThe Company does not typically experience material claims processing backlogs, although such backlogs may occur\nfollowing a major catastrophic event. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have a material backlog in its\nclaims processing.\nThe Company did not make any significant changes to the actuarial methodology or assumptions relating to its loss and\nloss adjustment expense reserves for the years presented in the financial statements.\nReinsurance Assets\nThe Company calculates an allowance for expected credit losses for its reinsurance balances receivable and loss and\nLAE recoverable by applying a Probability of Default (“PD”) / Loss Given Default (“LGD”) model. The PD / LGD approach\nconsiders the Company’s collectibility history on its reinsurance assets and representative external loss history. In calculating\nthe probability of default, the Company also considers the estimated duration of its reinsurance assets.\nThe Company evaluates each counterparty’s creditworthiness based on credit ratings that independent agencies assign to\nthe counterparty. The Company manages its credit risk in its reinsurance assets by transacting only with insurers and reinsurers\nthat it considers financially sound. Credit ratings of the counterparties are forward-looking and consider various economic\nscenarios. The Company's evaluation of the required allowance for reinsurance balances receivable and loss and LAE\nrecoverable considers the current economic environment as well as potential macroeconomic developments.\nFor its retrocessional counterparties that are unrated, the Company may hold collateral in the form of funds withheld,\ntrust accounts, or irrevocable letters of credit. In evaluating credit risk associated with reinsurance balances receivable, the\nCompany considers its right to offset loss obligations against premiums receivable. The Company regularly evaluates its net\ncredit exposure to assess the ability of cedents and retrocessionaires to honor their respective obligations.\nDeposit Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company applies deposit accounting to reinsurance contracts that do not transfer sufficient insurance risk to merit\nreinsurance accounting. Under deposit accounting, the Company recognizes an asset or liability based on its paid or received\nconsideration. The deposit asset or liability balance is subsequently adjusted using the interest method with the corresponding\nincome and expense recorded in the Company’s statements of operations under “Other income (expense)” and “Deposit interest\nexpense”, respectively. The Company records deposit assets and liabilities in its balance sheets in “Reinsurance balances\nreceivable” and “Reinsurance balances payable,” respectively. At December 31, 2023, deposit assets and liabilities were nil and\n$5.2 million, respectively (December 31, 2022: nil and $10.7 million, respectively).\nNet investment income (loss)\nThe Company records interest income and interest expense on an accrual basis.\nAny realized and unrealized gains or losses from other investments are determined on the basis of the specific\nidentification method (by reference to cost or amortized cost, as appropriate). Additionally, net investment income (loss)\nincludes realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nIn connection with the Company’s participation interest in Lloyd’s syndicates, the Lloyd’s syndicates invest a portion of\nthe premiums withheld in investment funds and fixed-maturity securities. The Company records its share of income (or\nexpense) from these assets as other income (expense) as reported by the syndicates on a quarterly lag basis due to the timing of\nthe availability of these quarterly financial reports.\n15\nForeign Exchange\nThe reporting and functional currency of the Company and all its significant subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The\nCompany records foreign currency transactions at the exchange rates in effect on the transaction date. Monetary assets and\nliabilities in foreign currencies are converted at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies are carried at their historical exchange rates.\nOther Assets\nThe Company’s other assets consist primarily of prepaid expenses and right-of-use lease assets.\nOther Liabilities\nThe Company’s other liabilities consist primarily of accruals for legal and other professional fees, employee bonuses and\nseverances, and lease liabilities.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe Company has no comprehensive income or loss other than the net income or loss disclosed in the statements of\noperations.\nTaxation\nUnder current Cayman Islands law, no corporate entity, including the Company, is obligated to pay taxes in the Cayman\nIslands on either income or capital gains. The Company has an undertaking from the Governor-in-Cabinet of the Cayman\nIslands, pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Concessions Act, as amended, that, in the event that the Cayman Islands enacts\nany legislation that imposes a tax on profits, income, gains or appreciations, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance\ntax, such tax will not be applicable to the Company before February 1, 2025.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nThere are none that would be relevant and material to the Company.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Adopted\nThere are none that would be relevant and material to the Company.\n3. INVESTMENT IN RELATED PARTY INVESTMENT FUND\nThe Company has entered into the Second Amended and Restated Exempted Limited Partnership Agreement (the “SILP\nLPA”) of Solasglas Investments, LP (“SILP”), with DME Advisors II, LLC (“DME II”), as General Partner, Greenlight Re, and\nGreenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company (“GRIL”), (together, the “GLRE Limited Partners”). SILP has\nentered into a SILP investment advisory agreement (“IAA”) with DME Advisors. LP (“DME Advisors”), pursuant to which\nDME Advisors is the investment manager for SILP. DME II and DME Advisors are related to the Company, and each is an\naffiliate of David Einhorn, Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Chairman”).\nAt December 31, 2023, the SILP LPA included the following proviso: “The Investment Portfolio of each Partner will not\nexceed the product of (a) such Partner’s surplus (Greenlight Re Surplus or GRIL Surplus, as the case may be) multiplied by (b)\nthe Investment Cap (60%), and the General Partner will designate any portion of a Partner’s Investment Portfolio as Designated\nSecurities to effectuate such limit.”\nThe Company has concluded that SILP qualifies as a variable interest entity (“VIE”) under U.S. GAAP. In assessing its\ninterest in SILP, the Company noted the following:\n16\n• DME II serves as SILP’s general partner and has the power to appoint the investment manager. The Company does not\nhave the power to appoint, change or replace the investment manager or the general partner except “for cause.” Neither\nof the GLRE Limited Partners can participate in the investment decisions of SILP as long as SILP adheres to the\ninvestment guidelines provided within the SILP LPA. For these reasons, the GLRE Limited Partners are not\nconsidered to have substantive participating rights or kick-out rights.\n• DME II holds an interest in excess of 10% of SILP’s net assets, which the Company considers to represent an\nobligation to absorb losses and a right to receive benefits of SILP that are significant to SILP.\nConsequently, the Company has concluded that DME II’s interests, not the Company’s, meet both the “power” and\n“benefits” criteria associated with VIE accounting guidance. Therefore DME II is SILP’s primary beneficiary. The Company\npresents its investment in SILP in its balance sheets in the caption “Investment in related party investment fund.”\nThe Company’s maximum exposure to loss relating to SILP is limited to the net asset value of the Company’s\ninvestment in SILP. At December 31, 2023, the net asset value of the Company’s investment in SILP was $233.5 million\n(December 31, 2022: $149.7 million), representing 65.6% (December 31, 2022: 58.2%) of SILP’s total net assets. DME II and\nGRIL held the remaining 34.4% (December 31, 2022: 41.8%) of SILP’s total net assets. The investment in SILP is recorded at\nthe Company’s share of the net asset value of SILP as reported by SILP’s third-party administrator. The Company can redeem\nits assets from SILP for operational purposes by providing three business days’ notice to DME II. At December 31, 2023, the\nmajority of SILP’s long investments were composed of cash and publicly-traded equity securities, which could be\nreadily liquidated to meet the Company’s redemption requests.\nThe Company’s share of the change in the net asset value of SILP for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and\n2021 was $26.8 million, $48.2 million, and $16.8 million, respectively, and shown in the caption “Income (loss) from\ninvestment in related party investment fund” in the Company’s statements of operations.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company’s investment in SILP exceeded 10% of the Company’s total shareholder’s equity,\nwith a fair value of $233.5 million (December 31, 2022: $149.7 million) representing 40.9% (December 31, 2022: 31.3%) of\ntotal shareholder’s equity.\n17\nThe summarized financial statements of SILP are presented below.\nSummarized Statements of Financial Condition of Solasglas Investments, LP\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAssets\nInvestments, at fair value $ 453,358 $ 304,806\nDerivative contracts, at fair value 11,167 17,547\nDue from brokers 121,754 109,169\nInterest and dividends receivable 1,143 527\nTotal assets 587,422 432,049\nLiabilities and partners’ capital\nLiabilities\nInvestments sold short, at fair value (197,571) (159,382)\nDerivative contracts, at fair value (12,917) (12,443)\nCapital withdrawals payable (1,000) (75)\nDue to brokers (17,398) (2,050)\nInterest and dividends payable (2,315) (760)\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities (247) (159)\nTotal liabilities (231,448) (174,869)\nPartners' capital $ 355,974 $ 257,180\nThe Company’s share of Partners’ Capital $ 233,494 $ 149,704\n18\nSummarized Statements of Operations of Solasglas Investments, LP\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022 2021\nInvestment income\nDividend income (net of withholding taxes) $ 1,869 $ 1,586 $ 641\nInterest income 9,211 2,390 228\nTotal Investment income 11,080 3,976 869\nExpenses\nManagement fee (4,766) (3,580) (3,492)\nInterest (6,969) (1,950) (1,055)\nDividends (2,802) (1,374) (1,147)\nProfessional fees and other (1,750) (988) (1,221)\nTotal expenses (16,287) (7,892) (6,915)\nNet investment income (loss) (5,207) (3,916) (6,046)\nRealized and change in unrealized gains (losses)\nNet realized gain (loss) (1,394) 75,172 (3,420)\nNet change in unrealized appreciation 55,279 11,886 35,482\nNet gain (loss) on investment transactions 53,885 87,058 32,062\nNet increase in Partners' capital (1) $ 48,678 $ 83,142 $ 26,016\nThe Company’s share of the increase in\nPartners’ capital $ 26,793 $ 48,227 $ 16,789\n1 The net increase in Partners’ capital is net of management fees and performance allocation presented below:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022 2021\nManagement fees $ 4,766 $ 3,580 $ 3,492\nPerformance allocation 3,188 6,094 2,010\nTotal $ 7,954 $ 9,674 $ 5,502\nSee Note 13 for further details on management fees and performance allocation.\n4.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received in an asset sale or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between unaffiliated market participants. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized\nbased on the extent to which the inputs are observable in the market. The categorization of financial instruments within the\nvaluation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is\nprioritized into three levels (with Level 3 being the lowest) defined as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access.\n• Level 2: Observable inputs other than prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated with observable market data.\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the fair value of the assets\nand liabilities. The term “unobservable inputs” includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies, and similar techniques.\nThere have been no material change in the Company’s valuation techniques, nor have there been any transfers between\nLevel 1 and Level 2, or Level 2 and Level 3 for the years presented in these financial statements.\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company held $60.7 million (2022: $53.6 million), of private investments and unlisted\nequities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. At December 31, 2023, the Company held $8.3 million (2022: $6.9\nmillion) of private investments and unlisted equities measured at cost. The Company classifies these investments as Level 3\nwithin the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table summarizes the periods between the most recent fair value measurement dates and December 31,\n2023, for the private and unlisted equities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:\nLess than 6\nmonths 6 to 12 months Over 1 year Total\nFair values measured on a nonrecurring basis $ 25,838 $ 1,361 $ 33,490 $ 60,689\n21\nFinancial Instruments Disclosed, But Not Carried, at Fair Value\nThe carrying value of debt and convertible debt securities within “Other Investments” (see “Private investments and\nunlisted equity securities without readily determinable fair values” above) and certificates of deposit with original maturities of\none year or less approximates their fair values. The Company classifies these assets as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\n7. LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES\nThe Company’s loss and LAE reserves were composed of the following:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCase reserves $ 178,305 $ 176,248\nIBNR 419,105 333,729\nTotal $ 597,410 $ 509,977\nReserve Roll-forward\nThe following provides a summary of changes in outstanding loss and LAE reserves for all lines of business:\nConsolidated 2023 2022 2021\nGross balance at January 1 $ 509,977 $ 491,030 $ 466,868\nLess: Losses recoverable (12,614) (11,990) (19,135)\nNet balance at January 1 497,363 479,040 447,733\nIncurred losses related to:\nCurrent year 314,222 287,431 343,418\nPrior years 17,528 (2,911) (7,473)\nTotal incurred 331,750 284,520 335,945\nPaid losses related to:\nCurrent year (70,551) (72,885) (127,155)\nPrior years (185,225) (184,187) (176,475)\nTotal paid (255,776) (257,072) (303,630)\nForeign currency revaluation 6,317 (9,125) (1,008)\nNet balance at December 31 579,654 497,363 479,040\nAdd: Losses recoverable (see Note 8) 17,756 12,614 11,990\nGross balance at December 31 $ 597,410 $ 509,977 $ 491,030\nPrior Year Reserve Development\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company experienced $17.5 million in net adverse development on prior\nyear loss and LAE reserves. This was comprised of $38.1 million of reserve strengthening on casualty, workers’ compensation\nand auto classes of business due to current economic and social inflation trends (various underwriting years); homeowners\nbusiness due to the deterioration in the CAT loss estimate relating to Winter Storm Elliott (2022 underwriting year), coupled\nwith a final claim settlement on a professional liability contract (2008 underwriting year). This was partially offset by\n$20.6 million favorable loss development from property catastrophe events and better than expected loss emergence for\nmortgage, marine and energy, and specialty contracts from underwriting years 2020-2022.\nSee the loss development tables by lines of business below under “Disclosure about Short-Duration Contracts” for more\ninformation on prior year loss reserve development.\n22\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company experienced $2.9 million in net favorable development on prior\nyear loss and LAE reserves. This was driven by favorable loss development primarily due to $17.0 million from various\npre-2021 underwriting years property catastrophe events, including COVID-19, and better-than-expected loss emergence for\nmortgage business (from 2017-2020 underwriting years). This was partially offset by $13.6 million of reserve strengthening on\nmotor, health, casualty, professional liability, and workers’ compensation contracts from underwriting years 2014-2021,\ncoupled with higher claim settlements on certain general liability contracts fro 2015-2016 underwriting years.\nYear ended December 31, 2021\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company experienced $7.5 million in net favorable development on prior\nyear loss and LAE reserves. This was driven by favorable loss development primarily from $24.0 million better-than-expected\nloss emergence for motor, mortgage, and various specialty contracts (including crop, space, and marine and energy) from\nunderwriting years 32-15-2018, coupled with a multi-line contract that incepted in 2019. This was partially offset by $18.5\nmillion adverse loss development primarily due to reserve strengthening on multi-line casualty, general liability, and\nworkers’compensation contracts from underwriting years 2014-2019.\nDisclosures about Short-Duration Contracts\nThe Company’s loss development tables presented below have been disaggregated by lines of business for the years\nended from December 31, 2014, through 2023.\nFor purposes of the loss development tables, the property business has been further disaggregated into \"Property\" and\n\"Motor - Physical Damage.\" The casualty category has been disaggregated into \"General Liability,\" \"Motor Liability,\"\n\"Professional Liability,\" and \"Workers' Compensation.\" Contracts that cover more than one line of business, including Lloyd’s\nbusiness, are grouped as \"Multi-line.\" Other specialty business, including aviation, crop, cyber, and energy, which are\nindividually insignificant to the Company’s overall business, have been grouped as \"Other.\" As the Company’s accident and\nhealth business has become immaterial in recent years, the Company has grouped accident and health business with “Other”\nduring 2023. Additionally, the Company has elected to present the loss development table for “Marine” separately from\n“Other” due to its growth in 2023. As a result, the historical incurred and paid claims development presented in the tables below\ndiffer from those disclosed in previously issued financial statements. Conforming changes were also made to the table above\npresenting the changes in the outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for health claims as part of the\n“Consolidated” table for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. The amounts shown in “Net loss and loss adjustment\nexpenses incurred” in the statements of operations and the allocation between “Current year” and “Prior years” are unaffected\nby these revisions.\nFor each category, the following tables present the incurred and paid claims development at December 31, 2023, net of\nretrocession, and the total of incurred but not reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims included within\nthe net incurred claims amount.\nThe tables below present incurred and paid claims development for the years ended December 31, 2014 to 2022.

As a result, all prior year information has been restated to reflect\nDecember 31, 2023, foreign exchange rates. This treatment prevents changes in foreign currency exchange rates from distorting\nthe claims development between the years presented.\nFor assumed contracts the Company does not generally receive claims information by accident year from the ceding\ninsurers, but instead receives claims information by the treaty year of the contract. Claims reported by the ceding insurer to the\n33\nCompany may have the covered losses occurring in an accident year other than the treaty year. Some incurred and paid claims\nhave been allocated to the accident years for the loss development tables based on the proportion of premiums earned for each\ncontract during such accident year.\nFor example, a one-year quota-share reinsurance treaty incepting on October 1, 2020 (with underlying policies each\nhaving a one-year duration), would have a 24-month period over which the premiums would be earned. Therefore, claims\nwould be allocated to accident years 2020, 2021 and 2022 based on the proportion of the premiums earned during each accident\nyear. For illustration of this contract, any claims reported during 2020 would be allocated to the 2020 accident year. For losses\nreported during 2021, the claims would be allocated between 2020 and 2021 based on the percentage of premiums earned\nduring 2020 and 2021. Similarly, for losses reported during 2022 and thereafter, the losses would be allocated to the 2020, 2021\nand 2022 accident years based on the proportion of premiums earned during each of those years. However, natural catastrophes\nand certain other large losses are addressed separately and are assigned to the accident year in which they occurred.\nThe reconciliation of the net incurred and paid claims development tables to the liability for claims and claim\nadjustment expenses in the balance sheet is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023\nNet outstanding liabilities\nMultiline $ 236,975\nGeneral Liability 82,698\nMotor Casualty 21,093\nMotor Property 2,658\nProperty 55,555\nProfessional Liability 24,052\nWorkers' Compensation 55,643\nFinancial Lines 66,015\nMarine 5,779\nOther 24,623\nLiabilities for claims and claims adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance 575,091\nAdd: Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid claims 17,756\nAdd: Unallocated claims adjustment expenses 4,076\nAdd: Allowance for credit losses 487\nTotal gross liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expense $ 597,410\nThe average historical annual percentage payout of net incurred claims (excluding health) at December 31, 2023, is as\nfollows:\nYears 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n(Unaudited - Supplementary Information)\nMultiline 11.9 % 18.4 % 15.6 % 11.3 % 9.8 % 9.7 % 8.7 % 7.9 % 4.7 % 2.0 %\nGeneral Liability 4.7 % 13.6 % 13.0 % 12.5 % 18.3 % 27.5 % 6.9 % 3.0 % 0.4 % 0.1 %\nMotor Casualty 46.4 % 37.4 % 8.2 % 3.9 % 1.8 % 1.0 % 0.8 % 0.5 % — % — %\nMotor Property 50.2 % 43.5 % 5.2 % 1.0 % 0.1 % — % — % — % — % — %\nProperty 49.3 % 34.3 % 8.1 % 3.1 % 2.7 % 0.8 % 1.0 % 0.5 % 0.1 % 0.1 %\nProfessional Liability 4.1 % 14.1 % 21.3 % 18.7 % 12.9 % 11.1 % 8.8 % 3.9 % 4.1 % 1.0 %\nWorkers' Compensation 30.9 % 35.2 % 20.4 % 9.2 % 3.0 % 0.9 % 0.2 % 0.2 % — % — %\nFinancial Lines 18.6 % 33.8 % 23.5 % 12.0 % 4.1 % 3.7 % 1.7 % 1.5 % 1.1 % — %\nMarine 3.5 % 14.1 % 17.6 % 2.1 % 23.6 % 5.0 % 34.1 % — % — % — %\nOther 22.7 % 29.1 % 2.7 % 9.3 % 7.7 % 7.1 % 7.1 % 6.9 % 7.4 % — %\n34\nThe historical annual percentage payout pattern for health claims is excluded from the table above because health\nclaims have short settlement periods and including it would skew the results presented.\nAs a reinsurance entity, the Company generally does not receive detailed claims frequency information or claims\ncounts from ceding insurers and third-party claim handlers. Due to the nature of the reinsurance contracts, the underlying\ninsured reports claims to the insurer who cedes losses to the Company. The Company is contractually obligated to reimburse\nthe ceding insurer for its share of the losses. While the Company has the right to conduct audits of the ceding insurer’s claims\nfiles, the insurer is generally not obligated to provide a detailed listing of claims counts or other claims frequency information.\nTherefore it is impracticable for the Company to present the cumulative number of reported claims by accident year.\n8. RETROCESSION\nFrom time to time, the Company purchases retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to manage\nits overall exposure, reduce its net liability on individual risks, obtain additional underwriting capacity and balance its\nunderwriting portfolio. The Company records loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable from retrocessionaires as assets.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of ceded reinsurance:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022 2021\nGross ceded premiums $ 28,594 $ 23,618 $ 64\nEarned ceded premiums $ 31,505 $ 11,573 $ 23\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses ceded $ (18,007) $ (4,246) $ 12\nRetrocession contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to its cedents. Failure of retrocessionaires to\nhonor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The following table shows a breakdown of losses recoverable on\na gross and net of collateral basis:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNet of Net of\nGross Collateral(1) Gross Collateral(1)\nA- or better by A.M.

This excludes any excess collateral in order to disclose the aggregate net\nexposure for each retrocessionaire.\nAt December 31, 2023, we had 2 reinsurers (2022: 2) that accounted for 10% or more each of the total loss and loss\nadjustment expenses recoverable, net, for an aggregate gross amount of $12.5 million (2022: $6.1 million).\n9. CREDIT FACILITIES\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had the following letter of credit (“LOC”) facilities:\nCapacity LOCs issued Termination Date\nCitibank Europe plc (\"Citi LOC\")1 289,000 276,756 August 20, 2024\nCIBC Bank USA (\"CIBC LOC\") 200,000 13,903 December 21, 2024\n$ 489,000 $ 290,659\n1) Includes $14.0 million of uncommitted capacity.\n35\nThe above LOCs issued are cash collateralized (see Note 5). The LOC facilities are subject to various customary\naffirmative, negative and financial covenants. At December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all LOC facilities\ncovenants.\nCiti LOC\nThe Citi LOC Facility automatically renews each year unless terminated by either party subject to a 120 days notice prior\nto termination date.\nCIBC LOC\nOn December 21, 2023, through a subsidiary, the Company entered into a credit agreement with CIBC Bank USA for\na $200.0 million committed LOC facility (the “CIBC LOC Facility”), with a $30.0 million sublimit for unsecured LOCs (the\n“CIBC Revolving Credit Facility”). Loans made under the CIBC Revolving Credit Facility, solely for supporting unsecured\nLOCs, will accrue interest at a rate of base rate plus 2.5% per annum in the event that the beneficiary draws down on an\nunsecured LOC and the Company does not provide cash collateral within the stipulated period. The CIBC LOC Facility is\nsubject to an automatic extension of one year without prior written notice by the Company. The CIBC Revolving Credit Facility\nexpires after one year.\n10. SHARE CAPITAL\nThe holders of all ordinary shares are entitled to share equally in dividends declared by the Board of Directors. In the\nevent of a winding-up or dissolution of the Company, the ordinary shareholders share equally and ratably in the Company’s\nassets after payment of all debts and liabilities and after the liquidation of any issued and outstanding preferred shares. The\nBoard of Directors is authorized to establish the rights and restrictions for preferred shares as they deem appropriate.\nThe Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that the holders of ordinary shares\ngenerally are entitled to one vote per share.\nAdditional paid-in capital includes the premium per share paid by the subscribing shareholder for ordinary shares which\nhave a par value of $0.10 each.\n11. NET INVESTMENT INCOME\nThe following table provides a breakdown of net investment income:\nYear ended December 31\n2023 2022 2021\nInterest and dividend income, net of withholding taxes and other expenses $ 32,203 $ 3,757 $ (1,725)\nNet realized and unrealized gains on other investments (see Note 4) 1,723 9,666 19,521\nNet investment-related income 33,926 13,423 17,796\nShare of SILP's net income (see Note 3) 26,793 48,227 16,789\nTotal investment income $ 60,719 $ 61,650 $ 34,585\n12. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company intends to conduct all of its operations in a manner that will not cause it to be treated as engaging in a\ntrade or business within the United States and will not cause it to be subject to current U.S. federal income taxation on its net\nincome. However, because there are no definitive standards provided by the Internal Revenue Code, regulations or court\ndecisions as to the specific activities that constitute \"engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States”, and\nas any such determination is essentially factual in nature, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not successfully assert that\nthe Company is engaged in a trade or business within the U.S.\n36\n13. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nInvestment Advisory Agreement\nEach of DME, DME II, and DME Advisors is an affiliate of the Company’s Chairman (David Einhorn) and, therefore, is\na related party to the Company.\nThe Company has entered into the SILP LPA (as described in Note 3 of the financial statements). DME II receives a\nperformance allocation equal to (with capitalized terms having the meaning provided under the SILP LPA) (a) 10% of the\nportion of the Positive Performance Change for each limited partner’s capital account that is less than or equal to the positive\nbalance in such limited partner’s Carryforward Account, plus (b) 20% of the portion of the Positive Performance Change for\neach limited partner’s capital account that exceeds the positive balance in such limited partner’s Carryforward Account. The\nCarryforward Account for the Company includes the amount of investment losses to be recouped including any loss generated\non the assets invested in SILP, subject to adjustments for redemptions. The loss carry forward provision in the SILP LPA\nallows DME II to earn a reduced performance allocation of 10% of profits in years subsequent to any year in which SILP has\nincurred a loss, until all losses are recouped and an additional amount equal to 150% of the loss is earned.\nIn accordance with the SILP LPA, DME Advisors constructs a levered investment portfolio as agreed by the Company\n(the “Investment Portfolio” as defined in the SILP LPA). On September 1, 2018, SILP entered into the IAA with DME\nAdvisors, which entitles DME Advisors to a monthly management fee equal to 0.125% (1.5% on an annual basis) of each\nlimited partner’s Investment Portfolio. The IAA has an initial term ending on August 31, 2023, subject to an automatic\nextension for successive three-year terms.\nFor a detailed breakdown of management fees and performance compensation for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, refer to Note 3.\nPursuant to the SILP LPA and the IAA, the Company has agreed to indemnify DME, DME II, and DME Advisors for\nany expense, loss, liability, or damage arising out of any claim asserted or threatened in connection with DME Advisors serving\nas the Company’s or SILP’s investment advisor. The Company will reimburse DME, DME II, and DME Advisors for\nreasonable costs and expenses of investigating and defending such claims, provided such claims were not caused due to gross\nnegligence, breach of contract, or misrepresentation by DME, DME II or DME Advisors. The Company incurred no\nindemnification amounts during the periods presented.\nGreen Brick Partners, Inc.\nDavid Einhorn also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Green Brick Partners, Inc. (“GRBK”), a\npublicly-traded company. At December 31, 2023, SILP, along with certain affiliates of DME Advisors, collectively owned\n27.1% of the issued and outstanding common shares of GRBK. Under applicable securities laws, DME Advisors may\nsometimes be limited in its ability to trade GRBK shares held in SILP. At December 31, 2023, SILP held 2.7 million shares of\nGRBK.\nCollateral Assets Investment Management Agreement\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company (and its affiliates) entered into a collateral assets investment management\nagreement (the “CMA”) with DME Advisors, pursuant to which DME Advisors manages certain assets of the Company that are\nnot subject to the SILP LPA and are held by the Company to provide collateral required by the cedents in the form of trust\naccounts and letters of credit. In accordance with the CMA, DME Advisors receives no fees and is required to comply with the\ncollateral investment guidelines. The CMA can be terminated by any of the parties upon 30 days’ prior written notice to the\nother parties.\nSeparation Agreement with CEO\nOn November 3, 2023, the Company entered into a Deed of Settlement and Release (“Separation Agreement”) with the\nCEO (Mr. Simon Burton) pursuant to which Mr. Burton’s employment with the Company would terminate by mutual consent,\nincluding resignation from the Board of Directors, effective as of December 31, 2023. The following is a summary of the\nmaterial financial terms of the Separation Agreement:\n• $2.4 million cash severance payable over 18 months and $0.3 million salary continuance to April 30, 2024 (these have\nbeen accrued and included in “Other liabilities” in the balance sheets at December 31, 2023);\n37\n• Accelerated vesting for Mr. Burton’s remaining 235,936 service restricted shares and modified vesting condition for\nMr. Burton’s remaining 532,035 performance restricted shares in which the service condition is no longer a\nrequirement for vesting (the related share-based compensation charge is recorded at the Parent level); and\n• $1.6 million grant date fair value of performance restricted shares to be granted by the Parent in March 2024.\nAs a result of the above Separation Agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a total\ncharge of $2.8 million, excluding share-based compensation at the Parent level, which is included in “General and\nadministrative expenses” in the statements of operations.\nTransactions with Affiliated Companies\nThe amounts due from (to) affiliated companies as reported in the consolidated balance sheets include amount due from\n(to) the Parent and affiliates.\nAmount due from (to) Parent\nAt December 31, 2023 the Company had $0.2 million due from Parent. At December 31, 2022, the Company owed\n$28.4 million to the Parent for the return of additional paid-in capital declared but unpaid and was non-interest bearing,\nunsecured and is repayable on demand.\nAmount due from (to) affiliates\nAt December 31, 2023, and 2022, the amounts due (to) affiliated companies were non-interest bearing, unsecured and\nrepayable on demand.\nRetrocession agreements with affiliates\nThe Company has entered into quota share retrocession agreements with GRIL and GCM whereby the Company\nassumes a quota share portion of certain specified reinsurance contracts written by GRIL and GCM. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company assumed $66.0 million (2022: $190.4 million, 2021: $144.6 million) of written premiums\nfrom GRIL and $154.2 million (2022: nil, 2021: nil) of written premiums from GCM.\nThe Company also provides an aggregate stop loss reinsurance protection to GRIL. For the year ended December 31,\n2023, GRIL ceded $0.7 million (2022: $0.9 million, 2021: $1.2 million) of written premiums relating to this aggregate stop loss\ncontract to the Company.

In other matters, the Company may resist attempts by\nothers to collect funds or enforce alleged rights.
