Such forward-looking\nstatements are based on expectations, estimates and projections as at the date of this MD&A or the dates of the\ndocuments incorporated herein, as applicable.

However, by their nature, forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and involve\nknown and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance, or\nachievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied\nby the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and\nother factors that could cause actual events or results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking\nstatements, including, without limitation, those risks outlined under the heading Risk and Uncertainties in this\nMD&A.\nThe list of risk factors set out in this MD&A is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any forward-looking\nstatements of the Company. Forward-looking statements are statements about the future and are inherently uncertain.\nActual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of the matters\nset out or incorporated by reference in this MD&A generally and certain economic and business factors, some of\nwhich may be beyond the control of the Company, including, among other things, potential direct or indirect\noperational impacts resulting from infectious diseases or pandemics, from international or domestic conflicts or\npolitical crises, and other factors not currently viewed as material that could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those described in the forward-looking statements. In addition, recent events in the world economy and global\nfinancial and credit markets have resulted in high market and commodity volatility and a contraction in debt and\nequity markets, which could have a particularly significant, detrimental, and unpredictable effect on forward-looking\nstatements. The Company does not intend and does not assume any obligation, to update any forward-looking\nstatements, other than as required by applicable law. For all these reasons, the Company’s securityholders should not\nplace undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nCompany Overview and Discussion of Operations\nThe Company was incorporated in Ontario, Canada as 1774119 Ontario Limited on July 29, 2008. Pursuant to Articles\nof Amendment dated November 24, 2009, the Company changed its name to “Zenyatta Ventures Ltd.” On January 1,\n2019, the Company filed Articles of Amendment changing its name from “Zenyatta Ventures Ltd.” to “ZEN Graphene\nSolutions Ltd.” On October 27, 2021 (effective October 28, 2021), the Company filed Articles of Amendment\nchanging its name from “ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.” to “Zentek Ltd.” The common shares of the Company trade\non the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”) under the symbol “ZEN” and in the United States on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “ZTEK”.\nThe Company commenced operations as a junior mineral exploration company focused primarily on mineral deposits\nin Northern Ontario, Canada. The Company was actively engaged in exploring mining projects and held an interest\nin exploration licenses on properties located north of Lake Superior and west of James Bay in Northern Ontario,\nCanada in the “Arc of Fire” area. The properties, located north of Lake Superior and southwest of James Bay in\nnortheastern Ontario, Canada, were unpatented, non-contiguous, and consisted of nine claim blocks, including 234\nclaims comprised of 3,549 claim units over a total of 56,784 ha.\nWithin such claim blocks, the Company continued to hold a 100% undivided interest in Claim Block 4F, comprised\nof 521 mining claims (461 single-cell claims and 60 boundary-cell claims), which hosts an igneous-hosted, fluid-\nderived graphite deposit (the “Albany Graphite Project”). The Company did extensive work to determine potential\nuses for the graphite materials to be extracted from the Albany Graphite Project, including engaging in testing the\nproperties of the graphite material and studies on graphene materials.\nIn May 2018, the Company began to focus resources on the research and development of graphene and related\napplications, which was supported by shareholders of the Company who voted in favour of a new Board of Directors\nwith an interdisciplinary team to augment key management personnel with expertise in business, science, marketing,\nand government relations.\nP age 3 | 39\nIn February of 2020, the Company opened a research facility in Guelph, Ontario, to support its university and\nindustrial partners’ ongoing research and to scale-up production of graphene products. Subsequently, the COVID-\n19 pandemic halted research at the Company’s collaborators’ laboratories. The Company pivoted to focus its\nresources to develop graphene-based solutions for the fight against COVID-19.\nOn September 22, 2020, the Company announced, based on the results from a report to the Company dated\nSeptember 18, 2020, from the ImPaKT Centre at the University of Western Ontario entitled “Zen Graphene – Lab\nTest Report No. Z03-092020”, the development and successful testing of a now patented GO/silver compound that\nshowed to be 99% effective against COVID-19 virus a minimum of 35 days after application of the coating to N95\nmask material. On December 22, 2020, the Company announced the successful testing at the Department of\nMicrobiology at Mount Sinai Hospital/University Health Network of the GO/silver compound that showed to be\n99.9% effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic bacteria as well as against fungus/yeast, based\non a report to the Company dated December 18, 2020, entitled “Evaluation of Graphene Oxide with Silver Cations\n(GO-Ag+) as an Antibacterial Agent against Respiratory Pathogens”, which stated that if the compound could be\nshown to be safe and effective, it could provide a breakthrough alternative therapy for the practices of family\nmedicine, Otolaryngology, Ophthalmology and intensive care units.\nThe Company filed patent applications relating to its antimicrobial coating, and on April 13, 2021, announced the\nbrand name ZenGUARD (“ZenGUARD™”) for such coating.

Additionally, the ZenGUARD™-coated\nmask fabric demonstrated 86.7% antiviral effectiveness after 1 hour against H1N1 and 99.7% after 8 hours.\nP age 5 | 39\nOn March 30, 2023, the Company announced that it had signed an agreement with Arka BRENStech Pvt Ltd\n(“BRENStech”), a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of India (India), pursuant to which\nBRENStech will act as a local partner to the Company as it seeks to develop business opportunities in India.\nBRENStech’s primary focus will be to establish sales and distribution opportunities for the Company’s masks and\nHVAC filters and potentially other products as they become available. The Company also expects that BRENStech\nwill connect the Company with university research facilities, assist with the navigation of applicable regulatory\nregimes, and source potential manufacturing partners for the Company’s business opportunities in India and globally.\nOn August 24, 2023, the Company announced that it had signed a supply agreement with Henry Schein, Inc., for a\nthree-year term in respect to the distribution of ZenGUARD™-coated masks to dental practices in Canada and,\nsubject to regulatory approval, potentially in the United States. In September 2023, Henry Schein placed their first\norder of masks.\nOn April 3, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive distribution agreement with Dallas,\nTexas-based Medwell Solutions LLC for its ZenGUARD™-enhanced surgical masks in the United States. The\nagreement was signed on March 13, 2024 and is for a period of two years from the date of facility establishment\nregistration and issuance of market clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration, at which point\nsales of ZenGUARD™-enhanced surgical masks can commence.\nThe Company continues to market its ZenGUARD™ product to be applied to various materials, and has targeted\nmanufacturers, including PPE manufacturers and HVAC filter material companies. Additionally in April 2024, the\nCompany filed a 510(k) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration for ZenGUARD™ Surgical\nMasks. The Company was required to complete additional safety and performance testing for the application to the\nFood and Drug Administration.\nAs at June 30, 2024, the Company had an inventory of approximately 301,000 masks available for sale and had\nprovided ZenGUARD™ coated material to VMedCare for the manufacture of approximately an additional 5.5\nmillion masks.\nZenGUARD™ Industrial Scale Production and Coating Facility\nThe Company has installed industrial-scale production equipment to produce the ZenGUARD™ coating\nformulation at its York Rd., Guelph, Ontario location, which location is permitted for industrial use. The Company\nhas also purchased coating equipment so the process of applying the ZenGUARD™ coating formulation to\nspunbond polypropylene for use in surgical masks, HVAC filter materials, other PPE equipment, and potentially\nother uses, can be completed by the Company on-site. The Company spent cumulatively approximately $2.8M on\nthis objective with no further additional expenditures required.\nThe effective construction completion date for the coating line was November 30, 2022. Following completion of\ninstallation, a period of training and certification began. The coating line became commercially operational in August\n2023. The Company has spent approximately $2.0M as of June 30, 2024, related to the coating line with no further\nadditional expenditures required.\nOn May 18, 2023, the Company announced that it had been granted the ISO 13485:2016 Quality Management\nSystem certification standard by the British Standards Institution. The Company also received Medical Device Single\nAudit Program (“MDSAP”) certificate No. 777967. The ISO and MDSAP are required for Zentek’s Quality\nManagement System that is specific to medical devices (i.e. a ZenGUARD™ Surgical Masks) and does not include\nthe York Road production facility.\nProposed Construction of Graphene Oxide Production Facility\nIn addition to the construction of the ZenGUARD™ industrial scale production and coating equipment, as discussed\nabove, the Company intends to construct a plant to produce GO. The Company believes that the ability to produce\nP age 6 | 39\nGO itself, which is the precursor for the ZenGUARD™ compound, rather than relying on third-party suppliers of\nGO, will be economically favourable to the Company over the long term, as well as reducing supply and shipping\nrisk. The Company believes that there are three primary reasons it would benefit from an ability to produce GO\ninternally: (i) it should eliminate or significantly reduce supply chain risk; (ii) GO is not a homogeneous substance\nand by producing its own GO the Company could ensure product consistency; and (iii) the Company believes that\nthe demand for GO is increasing and that a domestic production facility could have the potential to generate product\nfor third-party users of the material\nThe Company engaged Bantrel Co. to begin engineering work on the proposed GO production plant in January 2021.\nPotential sites have been investigated. A site has not yet been selected and the permitting process has not yet begun.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company has spent $35,000 in preliminary investigations relating to this project and expects\nthat approximately $7,500,000 will be required to complete construction of a GO production facility.\nThe Company estimates that fifteen to eighteen months will be required to complete the construction of a GO\nproduction plant from the time of commencement, which is a management estimate based on the expectation of\nsecuring an agreement for the purchase of technology from an existing GO producer.\nRisks include, but are not limited to, the inability to reach an acceptable agreement for the purchase of such technology,\nthe inability to adapt existing technology to Canadian regulatory requirements, scaling-up from known existing\nproduction capacities could become a requirement, and delays as a result of ongoing material and equipment supply\nshortages.\nBusiness in Development\nZenGUARD™and OtherResearch and Development\nThe Company continues to seek the most effective, cost-efficient, and scalable process to produce high-quality GO.\nThe production of GO requires a consistent source (or precursor) material for conversion to graphene, which is then\napplied to various products for enhancement. The Company believes that it has a potential competitive advantage\nwith its interest in AGC and the large and high-quality supply of source material from the Albany Graphite Project,\nif and when the Company determines it is cost effective to use such material.\nAdvanced testing on potential new processes for commercial GO production is underway. The Company also\ncontinues to work with universities on different processes that could potentially lead to a more efficient and/or lower-\ncost process for GO production.\nP age 7 | 39\nThe following table sets out some of the specific research and development projects that the Company is undertaking:\nInitiative R&D Major Research Site Estimated Update for the period from\nTiming and Components to Cost as at January 1, 2022, to June 30,\nStage(1) be Funded December 2024\n24, 2021(2)\nZenGUARD™- Advanced Coating of Internal Continued Approximately $170,000 has\nCoated Masks stage of ZenGUARD™ research and been spent as at June 30, 2024.\ndevelopment antimicrobial development\n(currently in compound on PPE at an\nthe market). masks estimated\n(polypropylene cost of\nfabric) for reduced $200,000.\nmicrobial\ntransmission\nthrough aerosols.\nContinued work of\noptimizing\nmaterial and\ncharacterization of\ncompound.\nZenGUARD™- Intermediate Coating of Internal Continued Approximately $Nil has been\nCoated Gloves stage of ZenGUARD™ research and spent as at June 30, 2024.\ndevelopment antimicrobial development\n. compound on PPE at an This research project is currently\ngloves (Latex, estimated designated as a lower priority\nnitrile, etc.) for cost of project by the Company, and it\nreduced microbial $150,000. does not intend to spend\ntransmission significant funds on this project in\nthrough touch to the near future.\ndevelop\nantimicrobial\ngloves.\nZenGUARD™ Advanced Coating of Internal Continued Approximately $466,400 has\nHVAC stage of ZenGUARD™ research and been spent as at June 30, 2024.\ndevelopment antimicrobial development\n. compound on at an\nHVAC filter estimated\nsystems in cost of\nbuildings, $200,000.\ntransportation,\netc., for\ndeactivation of\naerosolized viral\nparticles in\nenclosed spaces to\ndevelop pathogen\nde-activating\nHVAC filters.\nAptamer-based Intermediate McMaster Continued Approximately $2,132,700 has\nValidation of\nrapid test stage of University research and been spent as at June 30, 2024.

The Company also applied for this patent with the\nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office and is pending examination. The patent claims the novel GO-Ag+\ncompound, that is the active ingredient for ZenGUARD™, as an effective agent against both regular and resistant\nbacteria, fungi and viruses. The patent claims liquid, powder and ointments that use GO-Ag+ as the active\ningredient.\nAptamer-Based Technology\nPursuant to a license agreement dated June 11, 2021, as amended June 23, 2023, McMaster University has granted\nto the Company, for a twenty-year term, a worldwide exclusive royalty-bearing license to use and practice all aptamer\nand DNAzyme uses, including, but not limited to, diagnostics, therapeutics, and as neutralization agents, including,\nbut not limited to SARS-CoV-2. On October 5, 2023, the Company announced the launch of a wholly owned\nsubsidiary that owns the exclusive, global licensing rights for all aptamer-based technology from the collaboration\nwith McMaster University. The technology was developed by a team of researchers under the guidance of Drs.\nYingfu Li, John Brennan and Leyla Soleymani, who have expertise in biosensing technologies and applications as\npoint of care diagnostics. This patent-pending technology was validated with clinical samples from patients recruited\nunder the supervision of two clinicians, Drs. Deborah Yamamura and Bruno Salena, who also work at McMaster\nUniversity. The project was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. This technology has shown to be\naccurate (similar to current PCR tests), is saliva-based, affordable and scalable, and provides results in under 10\nminutes. A license fee of $100,000, comprised of $50,000 cash and $50,000 in common shares of the Company\n(19,157 common shares at $2.61 per share) was paid to McMaster University as consideration. Although this\ntechnology was initially being developed specifically for COVID-19, this technology platform is designed to be able\nto detect other diseases by changing the aptamer to match new diseases.\nOn May 19, 2022, the Company announced that McMaster received two Natural Sciences and Engineering Research\nCouncil (“NSERC”) grants related to the aptamer-based rapid detection technology; the Alliance Missions Grant in\nthe amount of $1,000,000, and an Idea to Innovation (I2I) Grant in the amount of $350,000, of which the Company\nwill make a $140,000 contribution. The Company intends to continue working with Dr. Yingfu Li and the research\nteam at McMaster through in-kind contributions, using these grants towards commercializing the rapid diagnostic\nplatform. The grants will be used to advance commercialization efforts by improving the performance of aptamers,\noptimizing chip synthesis, and initiating tests for additional pathogens that can be incorporated into its pathogen\ndetection platform. The Company currently expects the cost to reach commercialization to be approximately\n$2,500,000, which includes enhancements and further development of the technology. StarFish Product Engineering\nInc. is to conduct product strategy alignment, usability analysis, device and architecture development, proof of\nconcept and prototyping, and program development.\nOn June 1, 2022, the Company announced that it had retained Halteres Associates (“Halteres”), a consultancy\nfocused on global health, diagnostics, and point-of-care testing, to assist with the commercialization of the aptamer-\nbased rapid detection technology. Market research from the Halteres group will be used to identify the most\ncommercially important pathogens for detection, which will guide the aptamer development program. Halteres\nevaluated several commercialization opportunities for the aptamer technology, including human diagnostics,\nP age 11 | 39\nagriculture, wastewater, veterinary, and other potential uses in healthcare and the Company is continuing to review\nthose opportunities.\nTo bring the product to market, the Company will be required to obtain authorization from Health Canada under an\ninterim order, or to obtain a Class IV Medical Device Active License (“MDAL”). The process for obtaining an\nMDAL involves completing certain testing requirements and demonstrating that the product is (i) safe, (ii) effective,\nand (iii) fit for purpose. Assuming that process is completed, the Company would then start preparing a product\ntechnical file, and then seek to complete a Health Canada Class IV application.\nOn July 20, 2023, the Company announced that the aptamer technology platform was successfully tested as a potential\nprophylactic or therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2 in pre-clinical animal models. In repeat trials, the aptamers developed by\nDr. Yingfu Li demonstrated similar efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 when benchmarked against a commercial\nmonoclonal antibody. The Company further announced the amendment of its license agreement with McMaster\nUniversity dated June 11, 2021, to broaden the scope of the worldwide exclusive license to apply to all aptamer and\nDNAzyme uses, including, but not limited to, diagnostics, therapeutics, and as neutralization agents, and not limited to\nSARS-CoV-2.\nOn July 27, 2023, the Company announced a new aptamer technology platform with McMaster University that\nsignificantly increases the binding affinity of aptamers. The increased binding affinity enhances the limits of\ndetection for aptamer-based diagnostics and could lead to the successful adaptation of these same aptamers for new\ntherapeutic and prophylactic treatments. Provisional patent applications were filed with the United States Patent and\nTrademark Office which have since resulted in the filing of two international patent applications filed with the World\nIntellectual Property Office as of September 30, 2023.\nOn October 10, 2023, the Company announced further pre-clinical testing results of the aptamer-based platform\ntechnology by the Dr. Matthew Miller Lab. Further preclinical testing was completed supporting the aptamer as a\nlead therapeutic target. An in vivo preclinical longevity of protection study was conducted to assess the safety and\nefficacy of the aptamer-based treatment over a period of 24 hours and demonstrated that the aptamer provided 24\nhours of neutralizing protection against SARS-CoV-2. A subsequent study was conducted to determine the minimal\neffective dose of the aptamer required to protect against a lethal challenge of SARS-CoV-2.\nOn November 15, 2023, the Company announced the development of a significant upgrade to its aptamer platform\nimproving the binding affinity of the universal COVID-19 aptamer from 300 to over 500 times, compared to the base\naptamer. The improved platform also solved key challenges for manufacturing and these High-Binding Affinity\n(“HBA”) aptamers are now produced with approximately a 95% yield. The Company estimates that an additional\n$1,000,000 will be required to complete the pre-clinical program for the SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic and enter clinical\ntrials.\nOn November 29, 2023, the Company announced the successful testing of its COVID-19 HBA aptamer against the\nOmicron XBB 1.5 variant (Omicron) by the Miller Lab at McMaster University in the latest pre-clinical study. The\nperformance of the COVID-19 HBA aptamer was comparable to the performance of monoclonal antibodies,\naccording to the Miller Lab, as it provided clinical protection against infection with the Omicron XBB 1.5 variant.\nThe Company will now begin to explore partnership opportunities in the pharmaceutical space as its aptamer platform\nmay offer a fast, economical, and novel approach to the development of new therapeutics for clinically relevant\nbiological markers.\nOn December 13, 2023, the Company announced the launch of Triera Biosciences Ltd. (“Triera”) as a wholly owned\nsubsidiary for its aptamer platform technology. Triera now owns the exclusive, global licensing rights for all aptamer-\nbased technologies from the collaboration with McMaster University.\nOn January 30, 2024, the Company announced the positive therapeutic results achieved by Triera Biosciences for\nC19HBA aptamer as a potential therapeutic. In the most recent trial completed in January 2024 by the Miller lab at\nMcMaster University, C19HBA was tested for its therapeutic potential. The treatment that featured C19HBA\nP age 12 | 39\ndemonstrated improved therapeutic benefit over no treatment of the LMA therapeutic. The full results of this\npreclinical investigation are pending publication in a peer reviewed journal.\nOn March 25, 2024, the Company announced that Triera completed testing demonstrating that its C19HBA SARS-\nCoV-2 universal aptamer built on the proprietary high-binding affinity aptamer platform has shown a promising\nsafety and toxicity profile in preclinical testing.\nOn May 6, 2024, the Company announced that Triera has prioritized the development of a prophylaxis and\ntherapeutic for highly pathogenic avian influenza. The mechanism of neutralizing the H5N1 virus is comparable to\nthe mechanism used by C19HBA against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. More specifically, the aptamer is believed to bind\nto and neutralize multiple subtypes of the HA surface protein (e.g., H1, H2, H5, etc.), preventing the virus from\nentering healthy cells and spreading infection.\nDiesel Fuel Additive\nThe Company is working to develop a stable graphene-based diesel fuel additive to improve combustion, increase\nburn rate, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to improve fuel economy of diesel fuels. Initial testing has shown an\nincrease in the performance of diesel fuel. The Company is working to improve on these early results through\noptimization work. The Company has filed a provisional patent application for its graphene-based fuel additive\ntechnology.\nPrimarily overseen by Dr. van der Kuur, the Company’s Chief Science Officer, the Company is developing a process\nto functionalize GO to produce a stable dispersion in diesel fuel. The fuel additive was tested by Conestoga College\nin a Gunt 159 single-cylinder test engine, which yielded an improvement in fuel economy of over 10% under certain\nrpm.\nThe Company continues to work with Dr. Sina Kheirkah at the University of British Columbia-Okanagan Campus\n(“UBCO”) to test GO-doped fuel as part of an NSERC alliance project for $110,500 cash contribution and a total\nbudget of $311,500 over two years to continue doped fuel research. The project will focus on measuring the\ncombustion of doped fuel in both droplet and spray combustion. The Company has spent approximately $98,900 on\nthis research and development project.\nThe Company intends to continue spray combustion testing at UBCO to optimize the concentration of the additive\nand to assess the performance of the burn rate, fuel economy and emission of doped Jet-A and diesel fuels.\nIcephobic Coating\nThe Company is also working to develop a new, patent-pending, carbon-based, nanotechnology-enhanced coating\ndesigned to prevent or reduce ice accretion for aviation (including drone) and wind energy applications.\nDr. van der Kuur, the Company’s Chief Scientific Officer, is the primary overseer of the project, which has involved\nthe use of dispersion technology to homogeneously mix graphene-based materials in an elastomer. The Company\nhas also conducted testing at the National Research Council of Canada's (“NRC”) Altitude Icing Wind Tunnel in\nOttawa and prepared graphene-enhanced elastomer material and coated coupons for testing.\nThe Company disclosed on February 28, 2022, that the icephobic coatings were undergoing full flight trials on a\nspecially equipped research aircraft under real-world ice-forming weather conditions. On March 14, 2022, the\nCompany announced the results of three rounds of testing of its icephobic coating, including laboratory tests, real-\nworld flights and applications related to drone operations in adverse weather. In real-world testing, the Company\nreported that video footage of its icephobic coating on test pieces attached to a research aircraft undergoing flight\ntrials targeting adverse weather environments has shown positive results and demonstrated that, under significant\nicing conditions, the coatings provide an effective de-icing and anti-icing solution. Drone testing showed that\npropellers coated with the icephobic material can maintain higher thrust, when compared to a non-coated propeller,\nP age 13 | 39\ndue to the shedding of ice that forms on the blades that would otherwise degrade the drone’s ability to maintain stable\nflight. Accelerated ageing testing has been completed by exposing samples coated with icephobic elastomer to UV\nweathering for 1,000 hours, which approximates two years’ worth of sun damage in typical Canadian weather. These\nsamples were then tested in an icing wind tunnel under dynamic conditions and demonstrated significant retention\nof their icephobicity.\nOn August 2, 2022, the Company filed a full patent application with the World Intellectual Property Office for\nNanomaterial-Enhanced Elastomer for Passive Ice Accretion Prevention. The Company disclosed this on September\n19, 2022. The patent application has since been filed by the Company in Canada and Europe.\nOn September 19, 2022, the Company announced the successful completion of sand erosion testing at the NRC and\nrain erosion testing at the Anti-icing Materials International Laboratory in Quebec which demonstrated the icephobic\nmaterial’s durability in adverse conditions for both wind turbine and drone industries.\nOn May 4, 2023, the Company announced successful drone testing, where thrust was maintained under calibrated\nicing conditions of freezing drizzle and freezing rain in an outdoor, real-world environment. The drone with the\nCompany’s icephobic coating applied to the propeller blades hovered under the outdoor icing rig and, on all tests\nconducted, maintained flight until the end of the battery life of the drone. The same drone with uncoated propeller\nblades rapidly lost the ability to maintain flight. These tests are expected to satisfy the Transport Canada requirement\nfor anti-icing equipment. The current regulations for civilian drone operations in Canada as per Transport Canada\nregulations state that no pilot shall operate a remotely piloted aircraft system when icing conditions are observed, are\nreported to exist or are likely to be encountered along the route of flight unless the aircraft is equipped with de-icing\nor anti-icing equipment and equipment designed to detect icing.\nThe Company is currently consulting with Transport Canada to propose the Company’s passive ice accretion\ntechnology as a potential means of compliance to satisfy the requirements as well as working to find a collaborator\nthat could provide equipment designed to detect icing.\nOn May 30, 2023, the Company announced a collaboration with Pattern Energy Group LP to optimize, test and\nvalidate the Company’s icephobic coating for the wind turbine industry. The partnership is being supported\nfinancially by both the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and PRIMA Quebec –\nAdvanced Materials Moving Forward.\nThe Company continues to consider and seek partners to commercialize this technology, including drone companies\nand companies specializing in elastomer production. Because the NRC has been testing a variety of coatings, the\nCompany has been able to participate in the NRC testing process thus far at no cost to the Company. However, the\nCompany anticipates additional testing and development to cost approximately $150,000.\nFire-Retardant Additive\nThe Company announced on March 28, 2022, that it had filed a provisional patent with the United States Patent and\nTrademark Office for an innovative Graphene Oxide-Metal-Organic Framework (“GO-MOF”) compound for use in fire\nretardant products. The provisional patent application has since been filed as an international (PCT) patent application\nwith the World Intellectual Property Office on March 27, 2023. Management of the Company considers the\nmanufacturing of the GO-MOF compound as relatively easily scalable and efficient, due to the patent-pending facile\nsynthesis process. The Company believes the fire-retardant GO-MOF additive could potentially be placed in a variety of\ncoating products, such as latex, epoxies or included in polymers. When integrated into a polymer, it could potentially\ncreate a fire-resistant plastic that could be used in electric vehicles, providing a fire-resistant non-metal casing for the\nbatteries. Management currently expects that GO-MOF production could be achieved on the existing ZenGUARD™\nindustrial scale production facility with minimal additional capital expense.\nDr. van der Kuur, the Company’s Chief Scientific Officer, is the primary overseer of the project. The Company has\nspent approximately $94,400 on this research and development project, and intends to conduct further testing, which\nP age 14 | 39\nit currently estimates will cost approximately $45,000. In the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, optimizations\nto the formulations were performed at the Company’s lab prior to a testing program with a commercial partner.\nTesting and optimization work remains ongoing as of June 30, 2024.\nBattery Technology\nThe Company has been collaborating with Dr. Michael Pope at the University of Waterloo since 2017, developing\nbattery technology to improve anode performance. One highly studied area for lithium-ion battery development is to\nimprove the anode material. Currently, electric vehicle anodes are composed of graphite, which has a limited\ntheoretical specific capacity of ~372 mAhg-1. Silicon has attracted significant attention as a replacement material,\nmainly due to its high specific capacity of 4,200 mAhg-1, but also due to its low working potential, low price and\navailability. However, silicon has an enormous volumetric fluctuation (greater than 300% in all dimensions) when\ncharging and discharging. This feature is the root cause behind the issues of poor cycle lifetime, irreversible capacity\nloss, and destruction and reformation of the solid electrolyte interface.\nUsing silicon in the anode material, Dr. Pope has attempted to address these issues and has created a patent-pending\ngraphene-wrapped silicon anode material. On February 18, 2022, the Company announced the filing of a provisional\npatent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office relating to a graphene-wrapped silicon anode material.\nSince April, Dr. Pope’s team has optimized the anode material, which now has a specific capacity of over 1,000\nmAh/g and retains over 80% of its capacity over 320 charge-discharge cycles. The specific capacity of this material\nis a significant improvement over common graphite anodes; however, the cycle life still requires improvement\ncompared to typical electric vehicle batteries, which lose about 4% capacity over 1,000 charge-discharge cycles. The\nCompany intends to continue to work with Dr. Pope’s team to develop this technology with the goal of improving\nperformance to meet industry requirements. The Company filed a patent application under the Patent Cooperation\nTreaty on May 17, 2022.\nOn October 28, 2022, the Company announced the commencement of a four-year, $1,600,000 research project in\ncollaboration with Professors Mohini Sain and Ning Yan from the University of Toronto and Ford Powertrain\nEngineering Research and Development Centre. Funding for the project includes $1,200,000 from the Mitacs\nAccelerate program. The project seeks to assess novel concepts for the purpose of inventing multifunctional materials\nto be used in automotive battery components including anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separator. The Company will\nbe working in tandem with University of Toronto researchers providing and testing advanced graphene materials\nincluding the Company’s patent-pending anode material developed by Dr. Michael Pope. There are no material\nupdates as at June 30, 2024, on the Company’s work with the University of Toronto.\nCorrosion Protection\nOn February 8, 2023, the Company announced the development of ZenARMOR™, a novel corrosion protection\ntechnology based on functionalized GO, for potential use in naval and marine infrastructure, bridges, buildings,\npipelines, and other industries. ZenARMOR™ could be produced in the ZenGUARD™ facility. Third-party testing\non ZenARMOR™ yielded excellent corrosion resistance with no blisters or other signs of corrosion after 1,500 hours\nof ASTM B-117 Salt Spray Test with ZenARMOR™, and ZenARMOR™ qualified for the Innovative Solutions\nCanada (“ISC”) Testing Stream – Military Call for Prototypes. The Company has filed an International (PCT) Patent\nApplication on this corrosion protection technology, as well as a trademark for ZenARMOR™.\nOn October 4, 2023, the Company announced that it had prepared and shipped the first corrosion paint samples to\nthe NRC for the first round of testing as part of the ISC - Testing Stream – Military Call for Proposals. NRC’s\nAerospace Research Centre’s Aerospace Manufacturing Technologies Centre will be testing the Company’s nano\npigment in military-grade chromate-free paints for evaluation in its first of three rounds of testing.\nOther Use-Cases for ZenGUARD™\nHVAC Filtration\nP age 15 | 39\nZenGUARD™ is the Company’s patented anti-microbial coating technology platform. The Company intends to\ncontinue exploring other applications and uses for its ZenGUARD™ compound, including, but not limited to, use in\nHVAC filters. On September 30, 2020, the Company first announced testing on ZenGUARD™ use for HVAC\nsystems. On January 13, 2021, the Company announced that testing by a major Canadian certification company had\nconfirmed that there was very little effect on air flow and pressure drop with a ZenGUARD™ treated filter compared\nto an untreated filter. The Company spent approximately $60,000 on testing, including preliminary testing of\nZenGUARD™-coated HVAC filter media for pressure drop, and increased challenge bacterial filtration efficiency on\nuncoated and coated MERV 8 and MERV 13 HVAC filters, overseen primarily by Dr. van der Kuur, the Company’s\nChief Scientific Officer.\nFurther to the press release dated November 30, 2021, the Company announced that it has been awarded a research\nand development test contract through the ISC Testing Stream Call for Proposals to test ZenGUARD™-coated HVAC\nfilters with interest from three different units within the NRC. The goal of the testing, conducted by CREMCo\nLaboratories with assistance from the Aerospace Research Centre, a department of the NRC was to demonstrate: (i) a\nnet reduction in the airborne viral and bacterial load with ZenGUARD™ coating applied to standard filters; (ii) no\nmodifications required to existing HVAC systems to achieve (i) above; (iii) no reduction in air flow rates, which\nmeans air exchange rates in the space will be unchanged; and (iv) no reduction in the air quality as the ZenGUARD™\ncoating was tested to ensure it does not contribute particles into the air stream.\nPhase 1 testing commenced in December 2021 after an extensive design process, calibration, and assessment of the\ntesting rig, and involved the test rig being installed inside an aerobiology chamber to push air through HVAC filter\nmaterial with test organisms to study how these live airborne organisms were reduced by the ZenGUARD™ coating.\nTesting used multiple samples with repeated tests so that each filter’s performance could be compared. It was\ndetermined that all Phase 1 targets were met including sufficient reduction in live airborne test organisms, no\nsignificant shedding of the ZenGUARD™ coating, and air flow rates that were not impacted by the coating. On April\n11, 2022, the Company announced that, after successful completion of Phase 1 testing, it will proceed to Phase 2\ntesting.\nOn December 15, 2022, the Company announced the successful completion of Phase 2 HVAC filter testing and that\nthe preliminary report from Phase 2 testing had been received. The final report was received in January 2023 and\nannounced on February 6, 2023. The report notes a significant reduction in live airborne test organisms with\nZenGUARD™ coating applied to standard HVAC filters without modification to existing HVAC systems, with no\nreduction in air flow rates or increasing energy use.\nThe testing demonstrated a reduction in live airborne bacteriophage surrogate contamination within a modular\nclassroom environment, simulating a real-world environment. The testing was performed at the NRC’s purpose-built\nbioaerosol testing facility, designed, and built specifically for testing wet aerosolized droplets, which is the primary\nmechanism for the spread of disease in an indoor setting.\nThe Company has also consulted and tested with LMS Technologies (“LMS”), a United States-based air media and\nfilter testing company providing testing services and product certification for filter manufacturers. LMS’ independent\ntesting of ZenGUARD™ coated MERV 8 filters demonstrated a significant increase in both bacterial and viral\nfiltration efficiency in line with or better than the results from the NRC. The Company currently intends to continue\nto work to optimize configurations of HVAC filter materials coated with ZenGUARD™ technology at LMS to\noptimize its product and complete all testing and documentation required for regulatory submissions in Canada and\nthe United States. The Company has engaged Intertek Group plc to conduct a review of regulatory requirements in\nother geographies of interest.\nOn September 6, 2023, the Company announced the results of a study comparing the viral filtration efficiency (“VFE”)\nof ZenGUARD™-enhanced MERV 9 filters with an uncoated MERV 9 filter. The testing was performed by LMS,\nwhich specializes in the testing and certification of filter manufacturers across the world, referring to the new American\nSociety of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (“ASHRAE”) standards for aerosolized particles\nand determining the impact of dust loading on VFE and particle filtration efficiency (“PFE”) as per ASHRAE 52.2\nP age 16 | 39\ntesting standards. Key findings of the study included: (i) the VFE of ZenGUARD™-enhanced filters started with a\nsignificant advantage over equivalent non-coated filters, from 23.7% to 37.7%, a 59% enhancement or a 14% net gain\noverall, and, the VFE performance consistently increased faster for the ZenGUARD™-enhanced filters compared to\nthe uncoated filters (at six months equivalent dust loading, the VFE of the ZenGUARD™-enhanced filter was 85.6%\ncompared to 55.2% for the uncoated filter, a 28.4% net gain); (ii) the pressure drop remained consistent between\nZenGUARD™-enhanced and uncoated filters as dust loading increased, indicating that ZenGUARD™ does not\nadversely affect airflow or energy efficiency of the HVAC system; and (iii) ZenGUARD™-enhanced filters operated\nsimilarly to regular MERV 9 filters when tested for PFE, effectively removing particles across all size ranges.\nOn September 11, 2023, the Company announced the results of a study conducted by ParticleOne Inc., an RWDI\nVentures company. The study evaluated the performance of ZenGUARD™-enhanced filter technology in comparison\nto a standard MERV 9 filter. The study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of filters in removing infectious\nparticles from the air and to determine the potential return on investment (“ROI”) of enhanced viral filtration from\nusing ZenGUARD™ technology. The ParticleOne model ROI analysis indicated that the ZenGUARD™- enhanced\nMERV 9 filter resulted in a substantial reduction in annual absenteeism costs ($15,016.95) compared to a regular\nMERV 9 filter in an office space of 10,000 square feet with 75 occupants.\nOn December 8, 2023, the Company announced a distribution agreement with 1Click Heating and Cooling Inc.\n(“1Click”), a private HVAC company focused on the heat pump market, for ZenGUARD™ MERV 9 filters in various\nsizes and is expected to include other ZenGUARD™-enhanced MERV-rated filters in the future. This agreement will\nsee 1Click utilize ZenGUARD™ filters for its regular customer service maintenance programs, along with making\nZenGUARD™ filters available to customers from inventory held in various provinces. The Company’s agreement\nwith 1Click has an initial term of 2 years from the date of approval from the Pesticide Management Regulatory Agency\nand may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.\nOn January 22, 2024, the Company announced the completion of a new study highlighting the potential energy,\nemission and cost savings for commercial buildings adopting ZenGUARD™-enhanced air filters. By using\nZenGUARD™-enhanced air filters to control infectious aerosols instead of increasing the percentage of outside air to\nachieve a similar risk reduction, the Company estimates that a typical office space of 10,000 square feet with 75\noccupants can reduce HVAC energy consumption by approximately 62%.\nOn May 7, 2024, the Company announced that it completed a case study based on the City of Toronto highlighting\nthe economic and environmental benefits related to using MERV 9A filters compared to using MERV 13 filters. The\nstudy quantifies cost savings and reductions in carbon emission and waste assuming the City of Toronto is currently\nusing MERV 13 filters in all its buildings and switches to MERV 9A filters. The study found potential savings of\nover $40 million stemming from significantly reduced labour costs due to filters being changed every six months\nrather than every three months, reduced expenditures on air filters from replacing filters every six months rather than\nevery three months, reduced energy requirements and costs due to improved air flow and lower waste disposal costs\nfrom fewer filters being used.\nOn May 23, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a distribution agreement, effective March 19,\n2024, with DCL Supply Ltd., a private HVAC master product distributor. The initial term of the agreement is for\none year, and it automatically renews for subsequent one-year terms unless 90 days’ notice is given by either party\nprior to renewal. The initial product to be distributed will be ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters for the HVAC\nmarket, subject to the assessment by the Health Canada Pesticide Management Regulatory Agency for registration\nunder the Pest Control Products Act, which remains ongoing. Subject to receipt of such registration, this agreement\nwould allow DCL Supply Ltd. to distribute ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters through its distributor network\nserving numerous industrial, commercial and institutional clients within and across Canada.\nZenGUARD™-Enhanced Air Filters are currently being assessed by the Health Canada Pest Management Regulatory\nAgency for registration under the Pest Control Products Act. The Company will provide an update as soon as\navailable. The Company is also currently working with consultants to file an application for ZenGUARD™-Enhanced\nAir Filters with the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\nP age 17 | 39\nThe Company has spent approximately $466,400 on this project during the period January 1, 2022, to June 30, 2024.\nTherapeutic and Pharmaceutical Applications\nThe Company was exploring the potential to use the ZenGUARD™ compound in therapeutic or pharmaceutical\napplications. In testing by Dr. Tony Mazzulli from Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, the active ingredient in\nZenGUARD™ showed low minimum inhibitory concentrations against several bacteria. On February 4, 2021, and\nMarch 2, 2021, the Company announced results of the Phase 2 cytotoxicity testing by Nucro-Technics testing laboratory\nand included cytotoxicity testing that noted no adverse effects after seven days of repeated dosing. MRSA-related skin\ninfection testing was performed on animals with inconclusive results. Cytotoxicity studies with Nucro-Technics and\npositive anecdotal results of various human skin infections including acne, warts and toenail fungal infections showed\nno adverse effects recorded during these anecdotal trials. These human anecdotal cases form part of the Company’s\npatent application filed on December 21, 2021, under the Patent Cooperation Treaty entitled “Graphene-Silver\nNanocomposites and Uses for Same as a Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial” which was published on June 30, 2022.\nThe patent has been issued in Canada.\nThe Company has spent approximately $93,500 on this project during the period January 1, 2022, to June 30, 2024.\nOther\nThe Company is also working with a number of research institutions developing processes to synthesize graphene,\nGO and graphene quantum dots, along with other possible applications for graphene-based materials. Potential\nmarkets for graphene-based materials include composites (e.g., concrete, rubber, plastic polymers, and ceramics),\nsensors, water purification and filtration, coatings and solid-state lubricants, silicon-graphene and graphene aerogel\nanode material for next-generation batteries along with aerospace applications.\nThe Company has other research projects commenced or contemplated including applications in aluminum alloys,\ncorrosion protection, battery technology, conductive polymers, and others. The Company will report on these if and\nwhen it is appropriate to do so.\nAlbany Graphite Project\nThe Company owns 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of AGC which owns the Albany Graphite Project in\nNorthern Ontario, Canada. The unusual nature of the formation of graphite in the Albany Graphite Project and its\npotential chemical and economic significance motivated additional exploration drilling from 2011 to 2013. The\ncurrent claims require a total of $195,600 worth of assessment work per year to keep them in good standing and the\nCompany has a total credit of approximately $7.1M in available exploration reserves. On October 18, 2021, the\nTSXV changed the Company’s classification from a “mining issuer” to an “industrial, technology, or life sciences\nissuer.” The change of classification was approved by the shareholders of the Company on September 27, 2021, in\naccordance with the rules and policies of the TSXV.\nOn May 19, 2023, the Company transferred to AGC the ownership of the Albany Graphite Project, including the\nmining claims and all related chattel, drill core, and applicable contracts, in consideration for the issuance by AGC\nto the Company of 59,999,900 common shares of AGC.\nOn July 26, 2023, the Company published an updated mineral resource estimate for the Albany Graphite Project,\nprepared by SLR Consulting (Canada) Ltd. (“SLR”). The updated mineral resource estimate is set out in the report\nentitled “Technical Report on the Albany Graphite Project, Ontario, Canada – Report for NI 43-101” dated July 31,\n2023 (effective date of April 30, 2023), prepared by SLR, and filed on SEDAR+ on September 1, 2023.\nMore recently, AGC is investigating if Albany graphite has the required characteristics and performance to develop\nan ideal anode material for the electric vehicle market. Test work has initially focused on the purification of Albany\nflotation concentrate to produce a consistent high-purity (>99.95%) material and ongoing. On July 17, 2024, the\nP age 18 | 39\nCompany announced that AGC has achieved a five nines purity of 99.99915% for a graphite sample from the Albany\nGraphite Project. A sample of the homogenized bulk flotation concentrate produced by SGS Canada Inc. in the 2017\nflotation pilot plant campaign was upgraded from approximately 85% to >99% using a simple hydrometallurgical\nprocess. A 100g sample of the >99% feed was subsequently thermally purified in a fixed-bed furnace at a\ntemperature of 2,700C for five minutes in an argon atmosphere. A 10g sample of the purified material was then\nshipped to Eurofins EAG Laboratories for a full 72 element GDMS analysis. The concentrations of all elements\nabove the detection limits (22 of the 72 total) were summed to yield the total concentration of the detectable impurity\nelements that remained in the purified sample at 8.48 ppm wt. or 0.00085% wt. The boron concentration in the\nsample was 0.42 ppm wt.\nDuring the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, approximately $33,000 (2023 - $135,000) was spent by AGC\non the Albany Graphite Project including professional fees and geologist wages. The same period of the prior year\nincluded consulting fees paid on the NI 43-101 report of $83,000 in addition. These costs have been capitalized in\naccordance with the Company’s accounting policy on Exploration and Evaluation Assets.\nOverall Performance\nDuring the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, the Company was mainly involved in scaling the production\nprocess of the ZenGUARD™ antimicrobial coating formulation along with completing the engineering work for the\nindustrial production facility. The Company also continued its graphene R&D activities which led to two Patent\nCooperation Treaty patent filings and one licensed-in provisional patent application during this year. Overall, during\nthe three-month period ended June 30, 2024, the Company had cash expenditures of approximately $1,588,000\nconsisting mainly of mortgage payments, research and development costs, professional and consulting fees and\ngeneral operating expenses.\nResults of Operations\nNet loss\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $2,553,189 with basic and diluted net loss per share of $0.03 for the three-month\nperiod ended June 30, 2024 (2023 – loss of $3,156,040 and $0.03).\nRevenue\nRevenue generated from operations for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, was $5,489 (2023 - $Nil).\nRevenue recognized in the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, was for the sale of ZenGUARD™ coated masks.\nExpenses\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $152,863 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 (2023 -\n$139,815) Amortization is taken on the capitalized cost of the Company’s building, computers, equipment, leasehold\nimprovements, and right-of-use assets.\nConsulting fees were $41,912 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 (2023 - $79,438).

Q1 2024 included a prepaid adjustment\nthat flowed through supplies of approximately $80K, creating a credit balance.\nTravel expense was $19,432 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 (2023 - $23,072). This decrease reflects\nless travel by staff compared to the same period a year prior.\nOther expenses excluding office and travel expenses were $51,078 for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024\n(2023 - $181,635). The following table details the material components of the Company’s other expenses for the\nthree-month periods ended June 30, 2024, and 2023.\nP age 20 | 39\nThree-Month Period Three-Month Period\nEnded Ended\nJune 30, 2024 June 30, 2023\nAutomotive 6,396 6,170\nBank fees 1,198 1,317\nDues and subscriptions 11,147 11,254\nFreight and delivery 504 88,760\nMeals and entertainment 9,107 14,159\nOther expenses 7,434 20,320\nProperty taxes 8,360 7,955\nRepairs and maintenance 7,982 25,209\nTelephone 5,319 6,010\nUtilities (6,369) 481\nTotal 51,078 181,635\nFreight and delivery decreased as freight during the period ended June 30, 2023, was a result of repositioning and\nconsolidating of inventory of GO in storage to a more economical leased facility. These additional costs were\nrecouped with reduced rental savings. Additional freight and delivery costs were incurred for the movement of\ninternational masks from Turkey to India.\nRepairs and maintenance in Q1 2025 decreased. Repairs and maintenance during the period ended June 30, 2023,\nwere required repairs at the Corporate Crt. Location.\nUtilities are in a credit position during the period ended June 30, 2024, as a result of a security deposit for utilities\nwith the City of Guelph being applied to the utility account and no longer being held as collateral.\nInterest income for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, was $40,613 (2023 - $143,402). Interest expense\nfor the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, was $26,381 (2023 - $24,744).\nThe Company continues to earn interest on cashable guaranteed investment certificates. Interest rates have increased\nsince fiscal 2023; however, $1,000,000 was held in cashable guaranteed investment certificates at June 30, 2024\ncompared to $3,000,000 held at March 31, 2024 resulting in less interest income during the quarter ended June 30,\n2024.\nThe Company recognized $Nil in government grants for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024 (2023-\n$88,822). The Company was successful in securing funding in the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, of\n$Nil (2023 - $46,322) with the National Research council for the Industrial Research Assistance Program for an\nHVAC project which included funding to offset both labour and third-party testing costs. Lastly the Company\nsecured funding from Downsview Aerospace Innovation & Research Centre (“DAIR”) Green Fund for passive\nicephobic coating testing in the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, of $Nil (2023 - $42,500).\nCash Flows\nDuring the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, cash decreased overall by $1,588,328 (2023 - cash increased\noverall by $368,753). Operating activities resulted in a decrease in cash of $1,418,204 (2023 –$1,725,278) due to\ncontinued spending on consulting and professional fees, research and development, salaries and benefits and other\nexpenses. Investing activities resulted in a decrease in cash of $21,305 (2023 – increase of $2,160,728) with the\npartial repayment of $2.5M received against the loan receivable in June 2023. Financing activities resulted in a\ndecrease in cash of $148,819 (2023 –$66,697) due to repayments of long-term debt, the lease liability and shares\nrepurchased for cancellation, partially offset by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.\nP age 21 | 39\nMineral Exploration and Development\nAlbany Graphite Project\nThe claims comprising the Albany Graphite Project are presently held in good standing by AGC and there are\nsufficient assessment credits available to keep all the 4F claims in good standing for approximately 30 years. There\nare no environmental liability issues related to any previous exploration work on the claims. Neither the Company\nnor AGC have received from any government authority any communication or notice concerning any actual or\nalleged breach of any environmental laws, regulations, policies or permits. The claims are located in the traditional\nterritory of the CLFN. In July 2011, the Company and CLFN signed an exploration agreement (assigned to AGC as\npart of the property transfer of the Albany Graphite Project) for a mutually beneficial and co-operative relationship\nregarding exploration and pre-feasibility activities on the Albany Graphite Project. Under this agreement, the\nCompany committed to establishing a joint implementation committee and conveying preferential opportunities for\nemployment and contracting as well as contributing to a social fund for the benefit of CLFN children, youth and\nelders. In 2018, the parties signed a new Memorandum of Understanding under which a project partnership structure\nwill be created in support of the development of the Albany Graphite Project. Subsequent to 2015, most of the Albany\nGraphite Project work has been focused on metallurgical process development, environmental baseline studies,\nmarket studies, and research and development to determine the most attractive market opportunities for the Albany\nGraphite Project.\nAs described above under “Company Overview and Discussion of Operations – Albany Graphite Project”, the\nCompany transferred the Albany Graphite Project to AGC with the purpose of moving the Albany Graphite Project\nforward with a separate corporate entity and management team dedicated exclusively to its development. The Company\nis not dependent on materials extracted from the Albany Graphite Project for its current business plans.\nAdministration and Capitalization\nEffective May 1, 2024, Dr. Dube resigned as Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Dr. Dube continues to serve\nas a director of the Company.\nOn May 3, 2024, Brian Bosse resigned as a director of the Company and was appointed to the Company’s advisory\nboard. The Company granted Mr. Bosse stock options to purchase 40,000 common shares of the Company at a price\nof $1.42 per common share for a term of three years.\nOn May 3, 2024, a consultant was granted stock options to purchase 25,000 common shares of the Company at a\nprice of $1.42 per common share for a term of three years. In addition, this same consultant was granted stock\noptions to purchase 5,000 common shares of Triera Biosciences Ltd. at an exercise price of $1.00.\nOn May 21, 2024, a total of 250,000 stock options were exercised at $0.40 per option resulting in proceeds of\n$100,000 to the Company.\nOn June 14, 2024, 300,000 stock options were exercised using a “cashless” exercise method whereby 80,000 fewer\nshares were issued than options exercised as compensation for the $120,000 in cash that traditionally would have\nbeen received by the Company upon exercise.\nOn June 20, 2024, 1,935,000 stock options were issued to a number of directors, officers and employees of the\nCompany. The stock options have an exercise price of $1.52 per common share. The options granted to the\ndirectors and officers, will vest one third on the date of grant, one third on the first anniversary of the grant, and\none third on the second anniversary of the grant. For employees, the options will vest one quarter on the date of\ngrant, and one quarter on each anniversary thereafter.\nP age 22 | 39\nSubsequent Event\nOn July 17, 2024, 650,000 stock options were exercised using a “cashless” exercise method whereby 193,597\nfewer shares were issued than options exercised as compensation for the $260,000 in cash that traditionally would\nhave been received by the Company upon exercise.\nOn July 23, 2024, the Company announced a non-brokered private placement of up to $3 million through the\nissuance of up to 2,307,692 units in the capital of the Company at a price of $1.30 per unit. Gross proceeds of the\noffering will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Each unit consists of one common share\nand one-half of one common share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one\ncommon share at a price of $3.00 for a period of 24 months from the closing date of the offering.\nSummary of Quarterly Results\nThe following table sets out selected quarterly information for the eight most recently completed quarters, for which\nconsolidated financial statements are prepared.\nDec. 31, Sep. 30,\nJun. 30, Mar. 31, Dec. 31, Sep. 30, Jun. 30, Mar. 31,\n2022 2022\n2024 ($) 2024 ($) 2023 2023 2023 2023\nrestated restated\n($) ($) ($) ($)\n($) ($)\nRevenue 5,489 5,757 12,418 11,641 -nil nil 15,200 nil\nOther income 306,156 288,509 242,077 351,486 170,678 97,878\n40,776 124,601\nLoss from\ndiscontinued - - - - - -\n- -\noperations\nNet Loss 2,685,060 3,405,251 3,156,040 2,731,107 3,238,902 3,410,055\n2,553,189 2,457,639\nNet Loss per\nShare\n0.03 0.03 0.03 0.02 0.03 0.04\n(basic and 0.03 0.03\ndiluted)\nDiscussion of Interim Period Results\nThe Company continued to generate limited revenue during the eight most recently completed quarters.\nThe quarterly net loss figures have been trending lower since the quarter ended September 30, 2022, mainly as a\nresult of reduced share-based compensation expense. Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable\nassurance that the Company will comply with the terms and conditions associated with the grants and the grants will\nbe received. The Company continues to apply for different grant programs, but no revenue was recognized during\nthe quarter ended June 30, 2024, increasing the loss for the quarter. The quarter ended September 30, 2023, included\nsome one time costs as additional freight was incurred to reposition and consolidate inventory of GO in storage to a\nmore economical leased facility (costing approximately $100,000) and a decision to not move forward with some\nresearch and development programs, resulting in payments to consultants of approximately $300,000.\nP age 23 | 39\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs at June 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of $2,554,641 (March 31, 2024 - $4,429,949) and cash and\ncash equivalents of $1,933,092 (2023 - $3,521,420). As at June 30, 2024, the Company had not yet achieved\nprofitable operations and had an accumulated deficit of $78,378,252 and expects to incur further losses in the\ndevelopment of its business. These events or conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that casts\nsubstantial doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern\nis dependent on obtaining continued financial support, obtaining financing, or generating profitable operations in the\nfuture. Management is committed to raising additional capital to meet its obligations; however, additional debt and/or\nequity financing is subject to the global financial markets and economic conditions. Additional financing may not\nbe available on terms favourable to the Company or at all. If the Company does not receive future financing, it may\nnot be possible for the Company to advance its business plans.\nOn January 4, 2022, the Company completed a financing for aggregate gross proceeds of $33,014,082 but may\nrequire additional financing in the future. The availability of equity capital, and the price at which additional equity\ncould be issued, is dependent upon the success of the Company's activities, and upon the state of the capital markets\ngenerally.\nTransactions with Related Parties\nThe remuneration of key management personnel during the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 were\nas follows:\na) Directors’ fees - $63,125 (2023 - $30,000)\nb) Salaries and benefits – $273,125 (2023 - $276,250)\nc) Share-based compensation - $607,900 (2023 - $599,525)\nKey management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and\ncontrolling the activities of the Company directly or indirectly, including any directors (executive and non-executive)\nof the Company.\nCurrent and Future Changes in Accounting Policy\nStatement of Compliance\nThe consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, including comparatives for\nthe period ended June 30, 2023, have been prepared, using accounting policies in compliance with IFRS as issued\nby IASB.\nNew Standards, Interpretations and Amendments Adopted from April 1, 2023\nCertain IFRS pronouncements were issued that were mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after April\n1, 2023, or later periods. Many have been excluded as management does not expect them to have a material effect,\nhowever, management is still in the process of evaluating any potential impacts. The following amendments are\neffective for the year beginning April 1, 2023:\nIAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements (“IAS 1”) and IFRS Practice Statement 2. In February 2021, the IASB\nissued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, providing guidance to\nhelp entities meet the accounting policy disclosure requirements. The amendments aim to make accounting policy\ndisclosures more informative by replacing the requirement to disclose ‘significant accounting policies’ with ‘material\naccounting policy information’. The amendments also provide guidance under what circumstance, the accounting\npolicy information is likely to be considered material and therefore requiring disclosure. These amendments have no\neffect on the measurement or presentation of any items in the consolidated financial statements of the Company but\neffect the disclosure of accounting policies of the Company.\nP age 24 | 39\nIAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (IAS 8). The amendment to IAS 8, which\nadded the definition of accounting estimates, clarifies that the effects of a change in an input or measurement\ntechnique are changes in accounting estimates, unless resulting from the correction of prior period errors. These\namendments clarify how entities make the distinction between changes in accounting estimate, changes in accounting\npolicy and prior period errors. These amendments clarify how entities make the distinction between changes in\naccounting estimate, changes in accounting policy and prior period errors. These amendments had no effect on the\nconsolidated financial statements of the Company.\nIAS 12 - Income Taxes (\"IAS 12\"). In May 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12, which clarify whether the\ninitial recognition exemption applies to certain transactions that result in both an asset and a liability being recognised\nsimultaneously (e.g., a lease in the scope of IFRS 16). The amendments introduce an additional criterion for the\ninitial recognition exemption, whereby the exemption does not apply to the initial recognition of an asset or liability\nwhich at the time of the transaction, gives rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. These\namendments had no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nNew Standards, Interpretations and Amendments not yet Effective\nThere are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued by the\nIASB that are effective in future accounting periods that the Company has decided not to adopt early.\nThe following amendments are effective for the year beginning April 1, 2024:\nLiability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases);\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of\nFinancial Statements);\nNon-Current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial\nStatements); and\nSupplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7\nFinancial Instruments: Disclosures).\nThe following amendments are effective for the year beginning April 1, 2025:\nLack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates)\nThe Company is currently assessing the impact of these new accounting standards and amendments. The\nCompany does not expect any of the standards issued by the IASB, but are yet to be effective, to have a material\nimpact on the Company.\nCritical Judgments and estimation uncertainties\nThe areas which require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining\ncarrying values include, but are not limited to:\nInventory\nJudgement is required in determining whether net realizable value should be evaluated on a product-by-product basis\nor if products cannot be evaluated separately from other products in inventory and should be grouped with similar\nproducts.\nExpected credit loss allowance and provision\nThe Company determines an expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on the estimated expected\nlifetime credit loss, considering the actual credit loss in prior years and forward-looking estimates of expected\ncollections. This estimate varies depending on the nature of the trade receivables, the majority of which are associated\nwith the health sciences business; however, also includes receivables from government agencies. The loss allowance\nP age 25 | 39\nis reviewed on a quarterly basis and any change in estimate is accounted for prospectively. The Company also\nassesses the expected credit loss of non-trade financial assets, such as the loan receivable, which is secured by\nproperty mortgages, to determine if an allowance is required.\nImpairment (impairment reversal) of exploration and evaluation assets\nWhile assessing whether any indications of impairment or impairment reversal exist for exploration and evaluation\nassets, consideration is given to both external and internal sources of information. Information the Company\nconsiders includes changes in the market, economic and legal environment in which the Company operates that are\nnot within its control that could affect the recoverable amount of exploration and evaluation assets. Internal sources\nof information include the manner in which exploration and evaluation assets are being used or are expected to be\nused and indications of expected economic performance of the assets. Estimates include but are not limited to\nestimates of the discounted future pre-tax cash flows expected to be derived from the Company’s mineral exploration\nproperties, costs to sell the properties and the appropriate discount rate. Reductions in metal price forecasts, increases\nin estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount of\nrecoverable mineral reserves and mineral resources and/or adverse current economics can result in a write-down of\nthe carrying amounts of the Company’s exploration and evaluation assets.\nImpairment (impairment reversal) of property and equipment\nJudgements are required to assess when internal or external indicators of impairment or impairment reversal exist,\nand impairment testing is required. Management considers internal and external sources of information including\nforecasted sales, cashflows and expected production volumes. Judgement is required to assess these internal and\nexternal factors when determining if the carrying amount of an asset is impaired, or in the case of a previously\nimpaired asset, whether the carrying amount of the asset has been restored.\nShare-based payments\nManagement determines costs for share-based payments using market-based valuation techniques. The fair value of\nthe market-based and performance-based share awards are determined at the date of grant using generally accepted\nvaluation techniques. Assumptions are made and judgment used in applying valuation techniques. These assumptions\nand judgments include estimating the future volatility of the stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee\nturnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviours and corporate performance. Such judgments\nand assumptions are inherently uncertain. Changes in these assumptions affect the fair value estimates.\nContingencies\nBy their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events transpire. The assessment of\ncontingencies inherently involves estimating the outcomes of future events. The Company has disclosed its disputes\nand was required to exercise judgement in assessing the recorded amounts.\nFinancial Instruments and Other Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other receivables, loan\nreceivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, lease liability and long-term debt. Unless otherwise noted, the\nCompany does not expect to be exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial\ninstruments. The Company estimates that the fair value of these financial instruments approximates carrying values.\nAs at June 30, 2024, the Company does not have any financial instruments recorded at fair value and that require\nclassification within the fair value hierarchy.\nFair value estimates are made at the balance sheet date based on relevant market information and information about\nthe financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties in significant matters of\nP age 26 | 39\njudgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these\nestimates.\nDisclosure of Outstanding Share Data\nThe Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares, of which 101,229,977 (March 31,2024 –\n100,819,577) shares were issued and outstanding as fully paid and non-assessable as at June 30, 2024.\nRefer to Note 11(c) to the condensed interim consolidated financial statements for details regarding stock options\nissued and exercisable as at June 30, 2024.\nAs at the date hereof, the Company had 101,686,380 common shares issued and outstanding as fully paid and non-\nassessable, and stock options exercisable for an aggregate of 7,748,334 common shares outstanding.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe operations of the Company are speculative due to the high-risk nature of its business, which includes the\ndevelopment of certain intellectual property and the manufacturing of graphene related products, and which may include\nthe future acquisition, financing, and development of the Albany Graphite Project. These risk factors could materially\naffect the Company’s future operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those described in\nforward–looking information relating to the Company. Accordingly, any investment in securities of the Company is\nspeculative and investors should not invest in securities of the Company unless they can afford to lose their entire\ninvestment.\nThe Company assesses and attempts to minimize the effects of these risks through careful management and planning of\nits operations and hiring qualified personnel but is subject to a number of limitations in managing risk resulting from its\nearly stage of development. Below is a non-exhaustive summary of the principal risks and related uncertainties that may\nimpact the Company. Such risk factors, as well as additional risks and uncertainties set out elsewhere in the Company’s\npublicly filed documents, and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Company or that the Company\ncurrently deems immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and\nresults of operations or the trading price of the common shares.\nNegative Operating Cash Flow\nDuring the three-month period ended June 30, 2024, the Company had negative operating cash flow because its\nrevenues did not exceed its operating expenses. In addition, as a result of the Company’s business plans for the\ndevelopment of its products, the Company expects cash flow from operations to be negative until revenues improve\nto offset its operating expenditures. The Company’s cash flow from operations may be affected in the future by\nexpenditures incurred by the Company to continue to develop its products. To the extent the Company has negative\ncash flow in any future period, the Company may be required to allocate funds to fund such negative cash flow from\noperating activities. In order to stay in business, in the absence of cash flow from operations, the Company will have\nto raise funding through financing activities. However, there is no certainty the Company will be able to raise funds\nat all or on terms acceptable to the Company in the event it needs to do so. Furthermore, additional funds raised by\nthe Company through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities would cause the Company’s current\nshareholders to experience dilution. Such securities also may grant rights, preferences or privileges senior to those\nof the Company’s shareholders. The Company does not have any contractual restrictions on its ability to incur debt\nand, accordingly, the Company could incur significant amounts of indebtedness to finance its operations. Any such\nindebtedness could contain restrictive covenants, which likely would restrict the Company’s operations.\nUncertainties Relating to the Company’s Business Plans\nThere is no assurance that broad successful commercial applications may be feasible for the Company. The Company\nis continuing to explore, develop, and test its current products and new products, and there can be no assurance that\nP age 27 | 39\nnew uses of existing products or new products will be fully developed for commercial application, that test results will\nbe successful, if completed at all, that any necessary permits or approvals required in order to market such products will\nbe obtained by the Company, or that existing technology or products will become profitable. Furthermore, there is no\nassurance that the Company will complete any acquisitions or acquire any know-how or trade secrets to carry out certain\nof its future objectives. Should the Company fail to achieve any of the foregoing, this could have a material adverse\nimpact on the business and planned business of the Company.\nThe Company’s business is in part dependent on patents, trade secret and other intellectual property laws of Canada,\nand potentially foreign jurisdictions. The Company may be unable to prevent third parties from using its intellectual\nproperty without its authorization. Some of the Company’s current or future technologies and trade secrets may not\nbe covered by any patent or patent application, and the Company’s issued and pending patents may not provide the\nCompany with any competitive advantage and could be challenged by third parties. The Company’s inability to\nsecure issuance of pending patent applications may limit its ability to protect the intellectual property rights these\npending patent applications were intended to cover. The Company’s competitors may attempt to design around its\npatents to avoid liability for infringement and, if successful, could adversely affect the Company’s market share.\nFurthermore, the expiration of the Company’s patents may lead to increased competition.\nAdditionally, the Company plans to construct facilities for some of its operations and business activities. There can\nbe no assurance that locations will be secured on terms favourable to the Company or at all, that engineering plans\nwill be completed or will be satisfactory for the intended business activities of the Company, that any required\npermitting will be obtained, that construction of such facilities will be completed, or that such facilities will ever\nbecome operational. If such facilities are not constructed, or do not become operational, or do not operate at the\ncapacity required or anticipated, there could be a material adverse effect of the Company’s planned business and\noperations.\nEconomic and Political Conditions\nWorldwide financial and economic cycles or conditions are uncertain, and recovery from a business downturn or\nrecession could be very slow and have a significant impact on the Company’s business. The Company’s business is\nsensitive to changes in economic and political conditions, including interest rates, currency issues, energy prices,\ntrade issues, international or domestic conflicts or political crises, and epidemics or pandemics.\nThe credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions due to the current conflicts in\nthe Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia. The conflicts are expected to have further global economic\nconsequences, including but not limited to the possibility of severely diminished liquidity and credit availability,\ndeclines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in inflation rates and uncertainty about\neconomic and political stability. In addition, the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia\nwhich increases the risk that Russia, as a retaliatory action, may launch cyberattacks against the United States, its\ngovernment, infrastructure and businesses. Any of the foregoing consequences, including those we cannot yet\npredict, may cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our ordinary shares to be\nadversely affected.\nRevenue from Graphene-related Products Sales; Long and Complex Sales Cycle\nTo date, the Company has recorded minimal revenue from its graphene enhanced products sales. There can be no\nassurance that significant losses will not occur in the near future or that the Company will be profitable in the future.\nThe Company’s operating expenses, and capital expenditures may increase in subsequent years. The Company\nexpects to continue to incur losses unless and until such time as it enters into long-term and large-volume supply\nagreements and generates sufficient revenues to fund its continuing operations.\nP age 28 | 39\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company relies on the patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws of Canada, and foreign\njurisdictions. The Company may be unable to prevent third parties from using its intellectual property without its\nauthorization. The unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property could reduce any competitive advantage\nthat it has developed, reduce its market share or otherwise harm its business. In the event of unauthorized use of the\nCompany’s intellectual property, litigation to protect and enforce the Company’s rights could be costly, and the\nCompany may not prevail.\nSome of the Company’s current or future technologies and trade secrets may not be covered by any patent or patent\napplication, and the Company’s issued and pending patents may not provide the Company with any competitive\nadvantage and could be challenged by third parties. The Company’s inability to secure issuance of pending patent\napplications may limit its ability to protect the intellectual property rights these pending patent applications were\nintended to cover.\nThe Company’s competitors may attempt to design around its patents to avoid liability for infringement and, if\nsuccessful, could adversely affect the Company’s market share. Furthermore, the expiration of the Company’s\npatents may lead to increased competition.\nIn addition, effective patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in\nsome foreign countries. In some countries, the Company may not apply for patent or other intellectual property\nprotection. The Company also relies on unpatented technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and\nmaintain its competitive position. Although the Company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its\nemployees and third parties to protect its intellectual property, these confidentiality agreements are limited in duration,\ncould be breached and may not provide meaningful protection of its trade secrets. Adequate remedies may not be\navailable if there is an unauthorized use or disclosure of the Company’s trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. In\naddition, others may obtain knowledge about the Company’s trade secrets through independent development or by legal\nmeans. The failure to protect the Company’s processes, technology, trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing\nexpertise, methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on its business by jeopardizing critical\nintellectual property.\nWhere a product formulation or process is kept as a trade secret, third parties may independently develop or invent\nand patent products or processes identical to such trade secret products or processes. This could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s ability to make and sell products or use such processes and could potentially result\nin costly litigation in which the Company might not prevail. The Company could face intellectual property\ninfringement claims that could result in significant legal costs and damages and impede its ability to produce key\nproducts, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProduct Development and Technological Change\nThere is no assurance that broad successful commercial applications for the Company’s products may be feasible.\nMost, if not all, of the scientific and engineering data related to the Company’s products has been generated by the\nCompany’s own laboratories or laboratory environments of the Company’s partners, such as universities. There can\nbe no assurance that laboratory data translates to or is representative in commercial applications.\nAdditionally, the industries in which the Company seeks to operate are characterized by rapid technological change\nand frequent new product introductions. Part of the Company’s business strategy is to monitor such changes and take\nsteps to remain technologically current, but there is no assurance that such a strategy will be successful. If the\nCompany is not able to adapt to new advances in materials sciences, or if unforeseen technologies or materials\nemerge that are not compatible with the Company’s or that could replace its products, the Company’s revenues and\nbusiness would likely be adversely affected.\nP age 29 | 39\nMarket Development and Growth\nFailure to further develop the Company’s key markets and existing geographic markets or to successfully expand its\nbusiness in the future into new markets could have an adverse impact on sales growth and operating results. The\nCompany’s ability to further penetrate its key markets and the existing geographic markets in which it competes\nand/or aims to compete, and to successfully expand its business into other countries, is subject to numerous factors,\nmany of which are beyond its control. There can be no assurance that efforts to increase market penetration in the\nCompany’s key markets and existing geographic markets will be successful. Failure to achieve these goals may have\na material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results.\nUnpredictable Sales Cycles\nThe sales cycle for graphene products may range considerably from one to multiple years from the time a customer\nbegins testing the Company’s product until the time that they could be used in a commercial product. Timing of\nproduct introduction could vary significantly based on the target market.\nAdditionally, any demand for the Company’s products based in whole or in part on the coronavirus (COVID-19)\npandemic could materially change in the event the pandemic ends or decreases in severity. The Company has\ndemonstrated little track record of success in completing customer development projects, which makes it difficult to\nevaluate the likelihood of future success. The sales and development cycles for the Company’s products are subject\nto customer budgetary constraints, internal acceptance procedures, competitive product assessments, scientific and\ndevelopment resource allocations, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. If the Company is not able to\nsuccessfully accommodate these factors to achieve commercial success, the Company may be unable to achieve\nsufficient sales to reach profitability.\nGovernment Regulation and Import/Export Controls\nThe Company’s future operations, including development, and commencement and continuation of commercial\nproduction, require licenses, permits or other approvals from various federal, provincial, local and potentially foreign\ngovernmental authorities, and such operations are or will be governed by laws and regulations relating to production,\nexports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, waste disposal, toxic substances, prospecting,\ndevelopment, mining, land use, water use, environmental protection, land claims of indigenous people and other\nmatters. Furthermore, in certain foreign jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those\nin Canada. Certain export control laws or economic sanctions laws may include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale\nor supply of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology, including import and export permitting and\nlicensing requirements, and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit the Company’s ability to distribute its\nproducts. Changes in the Company’s products, or future changes in export and import regulations may prevent any\npotential international customers from utilizing the Company’s products globally or, in some cases, prevent the export\nor import of the Company’s products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether.\nAny change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation, or change in the countries,\ngovernments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of the Company’s\nproducts in the future by, or in the Company’s decreased ability to export or sell its products to, potential international\ncustomers. Any limitation on the Company’s ability to export or sell its products would likely adversely affect the\nCompany’s future business, results of operations, and financial results.\nLarge volume production of graphene requires permits and approvals from various government authorities, and is\nsubject to extensive federal, provincial, state, and local laws and regulations governing development, production,\nexports, taxes, labour standards, occupational health and safety, environment, and other matters. As graphene is a\nnew chemical substance, production and sale of graphene may be subject to specific occupational health and safety\nand environment regulatory approvals in different jurisdictions including, without limitations, under the Canadian\nEnvironmental Protection Act (Canada), the Food and Drug Act (Canada), the Toxic Substances Control Act (USA),\nP age 30 | 39\nthe Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (USA) and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of\nChemicals (Europe).\nHealth Canada also regulates certain markets into which the Company intends to supply products or license its\nintellectual property. There is no assurance that Health Canada or any other body will grant license for sales into markets\nit regulates. Each foreign jurisdiction for the Company’s products is regulated and no assurance exists that sales of\ngraphene-related products will be permitted. Any inability by the Company to obtain approval from Health Canada\nand/or international bodies could have a material adverse impact of the business of the Company.\nThe Company is also subject to consumer protection laws that may impact its sales and marketing efforts. These laws,\nas well as any changes in these laws, could make it more difficult for the Company to sell and market its products.\nThese laws and regulations are subject to change over time and thus the Company must continue to monitor and dedicate\nresources to ensure continued compliance. Non-compliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject\nthe Company to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and\ncriminal penalties, or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if the Company does not prevail in\nany possible civil or criminal litigation, its business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially\nadversely affected.\nAdditionally, in order for the Company to carry out its activities, any required licenses and permits must be obtained\nand kept current. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will obtain on reasonable terms or at all the\npermits and approvals, and the renewals thereof, which it may require for the conduct of its future operations or that\ncompliance with applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals will not have an adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business plans. Possible future environmental and mineral tax legislation, regulations and actions could\ncause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delay on the Company’s planned exploration and\noperations, the extent of which cannot be predicted.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions\nthereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed,\nand may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial\nactions. Parties engaged in mining operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by\nreason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable\nlaws or regulations.\nIndustry Competition\nThe Company seeks to compete with other graphene and manufacturing companies, in highly competitive markets.\nSome of the Company’s competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources and higher\nmarket share than the Company has in certain products or geographic areas. As the markets for the Company’s products\nexpand, additional competition may emerge, and competitors may commit more resources to products which directly\ncompete with the Company’s products. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete\nsuccessfully with existing competitors or be able to develop any market for its products, or that its business will not be\nadversely affected by increased competition or by new competitors.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to compete successfully with its competitors in\nacquiring such properties or prospects and any such inability could have a material adverse effect on the Company's\nbusiness and financial condition.\nLack of Trading Market for Graphene\nUnlike commodity minerals such as copper, gold or silver, industrial minerals such as graphene precursor graphene\nmaterials and graphite do not have a metals exchange or an open market upon which to trade and therefore prices are\nnot set in an open market or publicly traded market, and there can be no assurance that certain items can be sold or\npurchased at any time. As prices are set with private suppliers and private customers, it is difficult to predict what\nP age 31 | 39\nmarket prices may be at the time of any transaction. There can be no guarantees that the Company will be able to\nsell its graphene products in a profitable manner, or at all.\nShortages\nThe Company will be dependent on various supplies, equipment, parts and labour, and the services of contractors to carry\nout its business objectives. The availability and cost of such supplies, equipment, parts or labour or the services of\ncontractors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to successfully carry out its exploration and\ndevelopment activities.\nLiquidity Concerns and Future Financing\nThe Company's approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities\nwhen due. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $1,933,092 (2024 - $3,521,420) to settle current\nliabilities of $2,121,253 (2024 - $1,819,004). On July 23, 2024, the Company announced a Non-Brokered Private\nPlacement of Units for up to $3M. Gross proceeds of the Offering will be used for working capital and general corporate\npurposes. However, the Company is ultimately dependent on the commercial sales of its products. Any delay in the\nsales of such products could require additional financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful\nin obtaining the required financing as and when needed. Volatile markets may make it difficult or impossible for the\nCompany to obtain debt financing or equity financing on favourable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain additional\nfinancing on a timely basis may cause the Company to postpone or slow down its development plans or reduce or\nterminate some or all of its activities.\nReliance on Key Personnel\nThe Company’s development to date has depended, and in the future, will depend largely on the efforts of key\nmanagement and other key personnel. Loss of any of these people, particularly to competitors, could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business. Further, with respect to the future development of the Company’s projects,\nit may become necessary to attract both international and local personnel for such development. The marketplace for\nkey skilled personnel is becoming more competitive, which means the cost of hiring, training, and retaining such\npersonnel may increase. Factors outside the Company’s control, including competition for human capital and the high-\nlevel of technical expertise and experience required to execute this development will affect the Company’s ability to\nemploy the specific personnel required. The failure to retain or attract a sufficient number of key skilled personnel\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. The\nCompany has not taken out and does not intend to take out “key man insurance” in respect of any directors, officer,\nor other employees.\nQualified Employees\nRecruiting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to the Company’s success. Especially if it relates to its graphene\noperations, finding skilled scientists and a sales team familiar with the subject matter is difficult. As the Company\ngrows further, the need for skilled labour will increase. The number of persons skilled in the high-tech manufacturing\nbusiness is limited and competition for this workforce is intense. This may adversely affect the business of the\nCompany if it is unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel as and when required.\nCybersecurity Threats\nThe reliability and security of the Company’s information technology (“IT”) systems are important to the Company’s\nbusiness and operations. Although the Company has established and continues to enhance security controls intended to\nprotect the Company’s IT systems and infrastructure, there is no guarantee that such security measures will be effective\nin preventing unauthorized physical access or cyberattacks. A significant breach of the Company’s IT systems could,\namong other things, cause disruptions in the Company’s manufacturing operations (such as operational delays from\nproduction downtime, inability to manage the supply chain or produce products for customers, disruptions in inventory\nP age 32 | 39\nmanagement), lead to the loss, destruction, corruption or inappropriate use of sensitive data, including employee\ninformation or intellectual property, result in lost revenues due to theft of funds or due to a disruption of activities,\nincluding remediation costs, or from litigation, fines and liability or higher insurance premiums, the costs of\nmaintaining security and effective IT systems, which could negatively affect results of operations and the potential\nadverse impact of changing laws and regulations related to cybersecurity or result in theft of the Company’s, its\ncustomers’ or suppliers’ intellectual property or confidential information. If any of the foregoing events (or other\nevents related to cybersecurity) occurs, the Company may be subject to a number of consequences, including\nreputational damage, a diminished competitive advantage and negative impacts on future opportunities which could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company.\nShare Price Fluctuations\nThe market price of securities of many companies, particularly development stage companies, experience wide\nfluctuations in price that are not necessarily related to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects\nof such companies. There can be no assurance that fluctuations in the Company’s share price will not occur. In\nparticular, the fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of the Company’s common shares is low.\nCost Absorption and Purchase Orders\nEspecially as it relates to its activities in the transportation industry, and given the current trends in that industry, the\nCompany is under continuing pressure to absorb costs related to product design and development, engineering,\nprogram management, prototypes and validation. In particular, OEMs are requesting that suppliers pay for the above\ncosts and recover these costs through the piece price of the applicable component. Contract volumes for customer\nprograms not yet in production are based on the Company’s customers’ estimates of their own future production\nlevels. However, actual production volumes may vary significantly from these estimates due to a reduction in\nconsumer demand or new product launch delays, often without any compensation to the supplier by its OEM\ncustomer. Typical purchase orders issued by customers do not require that they purchase a minimum number of the\nCompany’s products. For programs currently under production, the Company is generally unable to request price\nchanges when volumes differ significantly from production estimates used during the quotation stage. If estimated\nproduction volumes are not achieved, the product development, design, engineering, prototype and validation costs\nincurred by the Company may not be fully recovered. Similarly, future pricing pressure or volume reductions by the\nCompany’s customers may also reduce the amount of amortized costs otherwise recoverable in the piece price of the\nCompany’s products. Either of these factors could have an adverse effect on the Company’s profitability. While it is\ngenerally the case that once the Company receives a purchase order for products of a particular vehicle program it\nwould continue to supply those products until the end of such program, customers could cease to source their\nproduction requirements from the Company for a variety of reasons, including the Company’s refusal to accept\ndemands for price reductions or other concessions.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company could seek to acquire complementary businesses, assets, technologies, services or products, at\ncompetitive prices. The Company could pursue acquisitions in those product areas which were identified as key to the\nCompany’s long-term business strategy. However, as a result of intense competition in these strategic areas, the\nCompany may not be able to acquire the targets needed to achieve its strategic objectives. The completion of such\ntransactions poses additional risks to the Company’s business.\nAcquisitions are subject to a range of inherent risks, including the assumption of incremental regulatory/compliance,\npricing, supply chain, commodities, labor relations, litigation, environmental, pensions, warranty, recall, IT, tax or\nother risks. Although the Company seeks to conduct appropriate levels of due diligence on acquisition targets, these\nefforts may not always prove to be sufficient in identifying all risks and liabilities related to the acquisition, including\nas a result of limited access to information; time constraints for conducting due diligence; inability to access target\ncompany facilities and/or personnel; or other limitations in the due diligence process. Additionally, the Company may\nidentify risks and liabilities that cannot be sufficiently mitigated through appropriate contractual or other protections.\nP age 33 | 39\nThe realization of any such risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or profitability.\nThe benefit to the Company of previous and future acquisitions is highly dependent on the Company’s ability to\nintegrate the acquired businesses and their technologies, employees and products into the Company, and the Company\nmay incur costs associated with integrating and rationalizing the facilities (some of which may need to be closed in\nthe future).\nThe Company cannot be certain that it will successfully integrate acquired businesses or that acquisitions will\nultimately benefit the Company. Any failure to successfully integrate businesses or failure of the businesses to benefit\nthe Company could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. Such transactions may\nalso result in additional dilution to the Company’s shareholders or increased debt. Such transactions may involve\npartners, and the formula for determining contractual sale provisions may be subject to a variety of factors that may\nnot be easily quantified or estimated until the time of sale (such as market conditions and determining fair market\nvalue).\nLaunch and Operational Costs\nThe launch of new business, in an existing or new facility, is a complex process, the success of which depends on a\nwide range of factors, including the production readiness of the Company and its suppliers, as well as factors related\nto tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. A failure to successfully launch material\nnew or takeover business could have an adverse effect on profitability. The Company’s manufacturing processes are\nvulnerable to operational problems that can impair its ability to manufacture its products in a timely manner, or which\nmay not be performing at expected levels of profitability. The Company’s facilities and proposed facilities contain\ncomplex and sophisticated equipment that is used in its manufacturing processes. The Company could experience\nequipment failure in the future due to wear and tear, design error or operator error, among other things, which could\nhave an adverse effect on profitability. From time to time, the Company may have some operating divisions which\nare not performing at expected levels of profitability. Significant underperformance of one or more operating\ndivisions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s profitability and operations.\nMaterial and Commodity Prices\nPrices for key raw materials and commodities used in the production of graphene-based products, as well as energy\nprices, have proven to be volatile at certain times. To the extent that the Company is unable to fully mitigate its\nexposure to price change of key raw materials and commodities, particularly through engineering products with\nreduced content, by passing price increases to customers, or otherwise, such additional costs could have a material\nadverse effect on profitability. Increased energy prices could also have an impact on production or transportation\ncosts which in turn could affect competitiveness.\nUninsured Risks\nThe Company maintains insurance to cover normal business risks. In the course of its manufacturing businesses,\ncertain risks and, in particular, unexpected or unusual catastrophic events including explosions and fire may occur.\nIt is not always possible to fully insure against such risks as a result of high premiums or other reasons. Should such\nliabilities arise, they could reduce or eliminate any future profitability and result in increasing costs and a decline in\nthe value of the common shares of the Company.\nLitigation\nThe Company has entered into legally binding agreements with various third parties, including supply, license,\ndistribution, non-disclosure, consulting and partnership agreements. The interpretation of the rights and obligations\nthat arise from such agreements is open to interpretation and the Company may disagree with the position taken by\nthe various other parties resulting in a dispute that could potentially initiate litigation and cause the Company to incur\nlegal costs in the future. Given the speculative and unpredictable nature of litigation, the outcome of any such disputes\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.\nP age 34 | 39\nCredit Risk\nAs at June 30, 2024, the Company's credit risk was primarily attributable to cash, accounts and other receivables and\nloan receivable. The Company issued a loan receivable during the year ended March 31, 2022, further increasing its\nexposure to credit risk. In June 2023, a partial payment of $2.5M was received against the loan receivable, decreasing\ncredit risk. The remaining $0.5M was due September 29, 2023, but has been subsequently extended to October 31,\n2024. The Company performed an analysis of collectivity and based on the collateral against the loan, determined\nthat no provision was required. Financial instruments included in accounts and other receivables consisted of trade\nreceivables generated through sales as well as recoverable Harmonized Sale Tax. The Company’s cash is held with\nreputable financial institutions. Management believes that the credit risk with respect to financial instruments\nincluded in accounts and other receivables is remote.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company has cash and cash equivalent balances at federally regulated Canadian banks. The Company\nperiodically monitors the investments it makes, the security of such investments and is satisfied with the credit ratings\nof its banks. The Company closely monitors interest rates to determine the appropriate course of action to be taken\nby the Company.\nPrice Risk\nThe Company is exposed to price risk with respect to commodity prices. The Company closely monitors commodity\nprices to determine the appropriate course of action to be taken by the Company.\nFinancial Capability and Additional Financing\nThe Company has limited financial resources and there is no assurance that sufficient additional funding will be\navailable to enable it to fulfill its business objectives or obligations, on acceptable terms or at all. Unanticipated expenses\nand other developments could cause existing funds to be depleted sooner than expected. In the event that its existing\ncash resources are inadequate to fund operational expenses, and in order to fund the planned business objectives of the\nCompany, the Company will be required to raise additional financing from external sources, such as debt financing,\nequity financing or joint ventures. The Company's ability to raise additional equity financing may be affected by\nnumerous factors beyond the Company's control, including, but not limited to, adverse market conditions, commodity\nprice changes and an economic downturn. Failure to obtain additional funding on a timely basis could result in delay\nor indefinite postponement of the development of the Company’s business and could cause the Company to reduce or\nterminate its operations. Additional funds raised by the Company from treasury share issuances may result in significant\ndilution to existing shareholders, a depressive effect on the price of the common shares and/or a change of control.\nPermits and Government Regulation\nAlthough the Company believes it has all of the necessary permits to carry out the proposed business programs, the\noperations of the Company may require licenses and permits from time to time from various governmental authorities\nto carry out exploration and development at its projects or locations. Obtaining permits can be a complex, time-\nconsuming process. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the necessary licenses and\npermits on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. The costs and delays associated with obtaining permits and\ncomplying with these permits and applicable laws and regulations could stop or materially delay or restrict the\nCompany from continuing or proceeding with existing or future operations or projects. Any failure to comply with\npermits and applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in the interruption or closure of\noperations or material fines, penalties or other liabilities. In addition, the requirements applicable to sustain existing\npermits and licenses may change or become more stringent over time and there is no assurance that the Company\nwill have the resources or expertise to meet its obligations under such licenses and permits.\nP age 35 | 39\nFluctuating Prices\nThe profitability of the Company’s operations will be dependent upon the market price of the ZenGUARD™ masks\nand other products, their global acceptance and demand along with their regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions.\nThe level of interest rates, rate of inflation, production costs, healthcare and consumer demand, and stability of\nexchange rates can all cause significant fluctuations in revenue. Such external economic factors are in turn influenced\nby changes in international purchasing patterns, COVID-19 pandemic situation, monetary systems and political\ndevelopments.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nAGC’s Albany Graphite Project is subject to environmental laws and regulations which may materially and adversely\naffect its future operations. These laws and regulations control the exploration and development of the Albany\nGraphite Project and their effects on the environment, including air and water quality, waste handling and disposal,\nthe protection of different species of plant and animal life, and the preservation of lands. These laws and regulations\nwill require AGC to acquire permits and other authorizations for certain activities. There can be no assurance that\nAGC will be able to acquire such necessary permits or authorizations on a timely basis, if at all.\nFurther, environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement,\nincreased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects\nand a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. There is no\nassurance that future changes in environmental regulation, if any, will not adversely affect AGC’s operations.\nAGC is not currently insured against most environmental risks. Without such insurance, and if AGC becomes subject to\nenvironmental liabilities, the payment of such liabilities would reduce or eliminate its available funds or could exceed\nthe funds AGC has to pay such liabilities and result in bankruptcy.\nEconomic Dependence on Supply Agreements\nCurrently, the Company has entered into a limited number of supply or sales agreements for the sale of its products.\nUntil additional supply agreements are executed by the Company, the Company’s revenues will be completely\ndependent on such agreements. If such agreements are terminated, or if less of the Company’s product than\nanticipated is purchased pursuant to such agreements, this could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s\nbusiness, operations and results.\nLegal proceedings and regulatory actions\nOther than as set out below, the Company was not subject to any material legal proceedings during its most recently\ncompleted financial year, nor is the Company or any of its properties a party to or the subject of any such proceedings,\nand no such proceedings are known to be contemplated. The Company may be involved in routine, non-material\nlitigation arising in the ordinary course of business, from time to time.\nThere were no penalties or sanctions imposed against the Company by a court relating to provincial and territorial\nsecurities legislation or by a securities regulatory authority during its most recently completed financial year, nor\nhave there been any other penalties or sanctions imposed by a court or regulatory body against the Company, and\nthe Company has not entered into any settlement agreements before a court relating to provincial and territorial\nsecurities legislation or with a securities regulatory authority.\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings relating to claims involving a former director and officer of the\nCompany. The claim was commenced in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on September 26, 2018, by Aubrey\nEveleigh and Eveleigh Geological Consulting. Mr. Eveleigh seeks damages in excess of $5,000,000 in connection\nwith an employment dispute. The Company is defending the claim and the proceedings remain ongoing, though the\nCompany believes that the risk of significant loss in respect of the litigation is remote.\nP age 36 | 39\nThe Company subsequently commenced a claim against Mr. Eveleigh and Eveleigh Geological Consulting on March\n24, 2020, in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List), in connection with past breaches of Mr.\nEveleigh’s fiduciary duties. Mr. Eveleigh has defended the claim and the Company submits that it continues to defend\nthe action and maintains that the allegations as set out in the claim are frivolous and without merit.\nOn November 28, 2022, following the discovery process, the Company amongst other things, amended its claim to:\n(i) seek an order that Mr. Eveleigh disgorge any benefits obtained as a result of his misconduct; (ii) seek an order\ncancelling certain common shares of the Company held by Mr. Eveleigh; (iii) seek an order declaring that Mr.\nEveleigh has no entitlement to any royalty payments or success fees in connection with the Albany Graphite Project;\nand (iv) seek an order that declares a constructive trust in favour of the Company over any and all monies received,\ndirectly or indirectly. A trial date has been set now to commence on October 21, 2024.\nOn January 29, 2021, the Company was served with a statement claim issued by Graphene Composites Ltd. and is\nin the process of defending the action, which it considers frivolous and without merit.\nThe Company has considered the allegations as set out in the claim and, in light of the facts, the lack of clarity in the\nclaim, and, based on discussions with the Company’s litigation counsel, the assessment of the merits of the claim\nand the defenses available to the Company, and the Company’s conclusion is that the risk of the Company suffering\nloss in respect of the claim is remote, and therefore the Company determined the claim not to be material or\nconstituting ”significant litigation” pursuant to the policies of the TSXV. The Company continues to view this claim\nas frivolous and will continue to vigorously defend itself against these allegations.\nProposed Transactions\nAs is typical of rapidly growing companies, the Company is continually reviewing partnerships, potential merger,\nacquisition, investment and joint venture transactions and opportunities.\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company has an employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer. During the period ended June 30,\n2024, the salary level for the individual pursuant to the employment agreement is $325,000 annually.\nThe Company had an employment agreement with its former Executive Chairman and Chief Operating Officer,\nwhich was terminated effective May 1, 2024, upon resignation of the officer. During the period ended June 30, 2024,\nthe salary level for the individual pursuant to the employment agreement was $300,000 annually.\nThe Company has an employment agreement with its Chief Financial Officer. During the period ended June 30,\n2024, the salary level for the individual pursuant to the employment agreement is $240,000 annually.\nContingent Liabilities\nIn September 2018, the Company received a statement of claim from a former employee, Aubrey Eveleigh and\nEveleigh Geological Consulting. The Company is in the process of defending the claim but views the claim as\nunmeritorious. On March 24, 2020, the Company commenced an action claim against the former employee for relief\nrelating to contracts and transactions between that employee and the Company, seeking to set aside those agreements\nand, where applicable, seeking disgorgement of unspecified amounts relating to benefits obtained under those\nagreements. Although there can be no assurance that any particular claim will be resolved in the Company’s favour,\nmanagement does not believe that the outcome of any claim or potential claims of which it is currently aware will\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company.\nP age 37 | 39\nThe Company is currently undergoing a Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) audit of approximately $4 million flow-\nthrough share (“FTS”) expenditures made and renounced during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, through\nMarch 31, 2022. The CRA audit may result in amendments to the FTS expenditures renounced during the foregoing\nperiod. Such CRA amendments could result in a Company obligation to indemnify certain of the flow through\nshareholders as a result of reductions in previously flowed through expenditures. The CRA audit may also result in\na Company obligation for penalties and interest related to reductions in prior-year FTS eligible expenditures and\nflow through.\nAs the resolution of the CRA audit is subject to many uncertainties, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome\nor to estimate the Company’s potential obligation to indemnify flow through shareholders for amended flow through\nexpenditures or for related penalties and interest, if any, which may result.\nNo provision has been made for this contingent liability and the amount of any future payment, if any, will be\nrecorded in the period in which such a payment is measurable.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nA detailed summary of all of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the March 31,\n2024, audited annual consolidated financial statements.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over financial\nreporting as such term is defined in the rules of the National Instrument 52-109 in Canada and under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, in the United States. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nis designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting for external\npurposes in accordance with IFRS. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes:\n• Maintaining records, that is reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions\nof the assets of the Company;\n• Providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the\nconsolidated financial statement in accordance with IFRS;\n• Providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with authorizations\nof management and the directors of the Company; and\n• Providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Company assets that\ncould have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements would be prevented or\ndetected on a timely basis.\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements because of\ninherent limitations. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of\ncompliance with the Company’s policies and procedures.\nChanges to Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes to the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the\nthree-month period ended June 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is\ngathered and reported to senior management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer, on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding public disclosure. The Company’s\nP age 38 | 39\nsystem of disclosure controls and procedures includes but is not limited to, the effective functioning of the\nCompany’s Disclosure Committee in accordance with the Company’s Disclosure Policy, adherence to the\nCompany’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and its Confidentiality and Securities Trading Policy, the effective\nfunctioning of the Company’s Audit Committee, and procedures in place to systematically identify matters\nwarranting consideration of disclosure. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have\nconcluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2024.\nP age 39 | 39"

Box 11101\nVancouver, British Columbia\nV6E 3P3\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nZentek Ltd.\nThunder Bay, Ontario\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Zentek Ltd. (the\n“Company”) as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of loss and\ncomprehensive loss, changes in equity and cash flows, for each of the years then ended, and the related\nnotes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the\nCompany at March 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the each of\nthe years then ended in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board.\nSubstantial Doubt About the Company's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company\nwill continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the\nCompany has suffered recurring losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raise\nsubstantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these\nmatters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any\nadjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that\nwe plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not\nrequired to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial\nreporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nBDO Canada LLP, a Canadian limited liability partnership, is a member of BDO International Limited, a UK company limited by guarantee, and forms part of the international\nBDO network of independent member firms.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nChartered Professional Accountants\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2022.\nVancouver, Canada\nJune 26, 2024\n1\nZENTEK LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAs at As at\nMarch 31, March 31,\n2024 2023\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars) $ $\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents [note 13] 3,521,420 10,357,317\nAccounts and other receivables -

NATURE OF BUSINESS AND GOING CONCERN\nZentek Ltd. (the \"Company\") was incorporated on July 29, 2008 under the laws of the province of Ontario, Canada. The\nprincipal business of the Company is to develop opportunities in the graphene and related nano-materials industry based\non its intellectual property, patents and Albany graphite. The address of the Company's executive office is 24 Corporate\nCourt, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 5G5, Canada.\nOn June 12, 2023, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary named Triera Biosciences Ltd. that owns the exclusive,\nglobal licensing rights for all aptamer-based technology from the collaboration with McMaster University. The Company and\nMcMaster University entered into a standard license agreement dated June 11, 2021 pursuant to which McMaster agreed to\nlicense certain intellectual property. All rights and obligations under this licensing agreement were assigned to this subsidiary\nsubsequent to incorporation.\nThe Company is an emerging high-tech nano-graphite and graphene materials company based in Thunder Bay, Ontario,\nCanada. The current focus is to bring to market innovative products including surgical masks and HVAC filters with the\nCompany's ZenGUARDTM coating, Rapid Detection Point of Care diagnostics tests and continue to develop potential\npharmaceutical products based on its patent-pending graphene-based compound.\nThese consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2024 were approved and\nauthorised for issue by the Board of Directors on June 26, 2024.\nThe technology industry presents a high degree of risk and there can be no assurance that the Company’s research and\ndevelopment will result in profitable operations. The Company’s ability to meet its obligations arising from normal business\noperations, continue its research and development, and generate future profits is dependent upon its ability to obtain\nnecessary financing. While the Company has been successful at raising funds in the past, there can be no assurance that it\nwill be able to do so in the future.\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations and had an accumulated deficit of $76,621,563\nand expects to incur further losses in the development of its business. These events and conditions indicate that a material\nuncertainty exists that cast substantial doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as\na going concern is dependent on obtaining continued financial support, obtaining financing, or generating profitable operations\nin the future. Management is committed to raising additional capital to meet its obligations; however, additional debt and/or\nequity financing is subject to the global financial markets and economic conditions.\nThese consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities, the\nreported revenues and expenses, and the statement of financial position classifications that would be necessary if the\ngoing concern assumption was not appropriate. Any adjustments necessary to the consolidated financial statements if the\nCompany ceases to be a going concern could be material.\n6\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION\nStatement of Compliance\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards\nand Interpretations (\"IFRS\") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (\"IASB\").\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the measurement bases specified by IFRS for each type\nof asset, liability, income and expense. The measurement bases are more fully described in the accounting policies below.\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis. In addition, these consolidated financial\nstatements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting, except for cash flow information.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements,\nestimates, and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year.\nThe consolidated financial statements consolidate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. The Company\nhas the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Triera Biosciences Ltd., 1000114904 Ontario Inc., Zentek USA Inc. and Albany\nGraphite Corp.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company\nand its subsidiaries. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the entity's\nfunctional currency are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each\nreporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.\nNon-monetary items that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when\nthe fair value was determined. Gains/losses on translation are recorded in profit or loss.\nFinancial Instruments\nFinancial assets\nInitial recognition and measurement\nNon-derivative financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 are classified and measured as “financial assets at fair value”, as\neither Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (\"FVPL\") or Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (\"FVOCI\"), and\n“financial assets at amortised costs”, as appropriate. The Company determines the classification of financial assets at the\ntime of initial recognition based on the Company’s business model and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\nAll financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not at FVPL, directly attributable\ntransaction costs on the trade date at which the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining their classification at FVPL or at\namortised cost. Cash and amounts receivable held for collection of contractual cash flows are measured at amortised cost.\n7\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nSubsequent measurement – financial assets at amortised cost\nAfter initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortised cost are subsequently measured at the end of each reporting\nperiod at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (“EIR”) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account\nany discount or premium on acquisition and any fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The Company's financial assets\nmeasured at amortised cost correspond to cash, accounts and other receivables and loan receivable and their nominal value is\nsimilar to their amortised cost.\nSubsequent measurement – financial assets at FVPL\nFinancial assets measured at FVPL include financial assets management intends to sell in the short term and any derivative\nfinancial instrument that is not designated as a hedging instrument in a hedge relationship. Financial assets measured at FVPL\nare carried at fair value in the statements of financial position with changes in fair value recognised in other income or expense\nin the statements of loss. The Company does not measure any financial assets at FVPL.\nSubsequent measurement – financial assets at FVOCI\nFinancial assets measured at FVOCI are non-derivative financial assets that are not held for trading and the Company has\nmade an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to measure the assets at FVOCI. The Company does not\nmeasure any financial assets at FVOCI.\nAfter initial measurement, investments measured at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with unrealised gains\nor losses recognised in other comprehensive income or loss in the statements of comprehensive loss. When the\ninvestment is sold, the cumulative gain or loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and is not\nreclassified to profit or loss.\nDividends from such investments are recognised in other income in the statements of loss when the right to receive\npayments is established.\nDerecognition\nA financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or the Company no longer\nretains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\nImpairment of financial assets\nThe Company’s only financial assets subject to impairment are accounts and other receivables and loan receivable, which are\nmeasured at amortised cost. The Company has elected to apply the simplified approach to impairment as permitted by IFRS 9,\nwhich requires the expected lifetime loss to be recognised at the time of initial recognition of the receivable. To measure\nestimated credit losses, accounts receivable have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics, including the number\nof days past due. An impairment loss is reversed in subsequent periods if the amount of the expected loss decreases and the\ndecrease can be objectively related to an event occurring after the initial impairment was recognised.\nFinancial liabilities\nInitial recognition and measurement\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, unless they are required to be measured at FVPL as is the case for held\nfor trading or derivative instruments, or the Company has opted to measure the financial liability at FVPL. The Company’s\nfinancial liabilities include accounts payable and accrued liabilities and long-term debt which are measured at amortised cost.\nAll financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of long-term debt, net of directly attributable\ntransaction costs.\n8\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nSubsequent measurement – financial liabilities at amortised cost\nAfter initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at amortised cost are subsequently measured at the end of each\nreporting period at amortised cost using the EIR. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium\non acquisition and any fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The Company's financial liabilities measured at\namortised cost correspond to accounts payable, lease liability and long-term debt and their nominal value is similar to their\namortised cost.\nDerecognition\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires with any\nassociated gain or loss recognised in other income or expense in the statements of loss.\nExploration and Evaluation Assets\nExploration and evaluation assets include the costs of acquiring licenses, costs associated with exploration and evaluation\nactivity (e.g. geological, geophysical studies, exploratory drilling and sampling), and the fair value (at acquisition date) of\nexploration and evaluation assets acquired in a business combination or asset purchase. The Company follows the practice of\ncapitalizing all costs related to the acquisition of, exploration for and evaluation of mineral claims and crediting all revenue,\nincluding government assistance, received against the cost of related claims. Costs incurred before the Company has obtained\nthe legal rights to explore an area are recognised as expenses of the Company.\nCapitalised costs are only allocated to the extent that these costs can be related directly to operational activities in the\nrelevant area of interest where it is considered likely to be recoverable by future exploitation or sale or where the activities\nhave not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of reserves.\nExploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment at each financial reporting date or when facts and circumstances\nsuggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The aggregate costs related to abandoned mineral claims are\ncharged to operations at the time of any abandonment or when it has been determined that there is evidence of a permanent\nimpairment.\nOnce the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest are\ndemonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first tested for impairment and\nthen reclassified to mining property and development assets within property, plant and equipment.\nRecoverability of the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on successful development\nand commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective areas of interest.\n9\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nProperty and Equipment\nEquipment is carried at acquisition cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is recognised on a\ndeclining balance basis over the estimated useful lives of the equipment less estimated residual value. The rates applicable are:\nBuildings 4%\nEquipment 20%\nEquipment - Manufacturing Straight-line over 20 years\nSignage 20%\nComputers 20%\nComputer software 100%\nLeasehold improvements Straight-line over lower of term of lease or economic life\nRight of Use Assets Straight-line over lower of term of lease or economic life\nMaterial residual value estimates and estimates of useful life are updated as required, but at least annually.\nGains or losses arising on the disposal of equipment are determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and\nthe carrying amount of the assets and are recognised in profit or loss.\nImpairment of Non-Financial Assets\nAt each financial reporting date, the carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets are reviewed to determine\nwhether there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the\nasset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment, if any. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair\nvalues less costs to sell, and value in use.\nFair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm's length transaction\nbetween knowledgeable and willing parties. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to\ntheir present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and\nthe risks specific to the asset. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the\ncarrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised in the profit or\nloss for the period.\nFor the purposes of impairment testing, exploration and evaluation assets are allocated to cash-generating units to which the\nexploration activity relates. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is\ndetermined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the\ncarrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that\nthe increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss\nbeen recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately\nin profit or loss.\nTangible assets that have been impaired in prior periods are tested for possible reversal of impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the impairment has reversed. If the impairment has reversed, the carrying amount of the\nasset is increased to its recoverable amount but not beyond the carrying amount that would have been determined had no\nimpairment loss been recognized for the asset in the prior periods. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized into earnings\nimmediately.\n10\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nShare Capital\nShare capital represents the fair value of consideration received, less related costs.\nWarrants\nWarrants are recorded at their fair value on the date of issue, net of issue costs. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option\npricing model to estimate the fair value of warrants issued. On the exercise of warrants, consideration received and the\naccumulated warrant value attributed to the portion exercised is credited to share capital. For those warrants that expire after\nvesting, the recorded value is transferred to deficit. The Company has no warrants outstanding as of March 31, 2024\nShare-Based Payments\nEquity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of\nthe equity instruments at the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-\nbased transactions are set out in the share-based payment note. See note 12(c).\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed over the period during\nwhich the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to equity instruments, based on the Company’s estimate of equity\ninstruments that will eventually vest. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number\nof equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit\nor loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-\nsettled employee benefits reserve.\nEquity-settled share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees are measured at the fair value of the\ngoods or services received, except where that fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at\nthe fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty\nrenders the service.\nCharges for options that are forfeited before vesting are reversed from share-based payment reserve. For those options\nthat expire after vesting, the recorded value is transferred to deficit.\nOn the exercise of options, consideration received and the accumulated option value attributed to the portion exercised\nis credited to share capital.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company's policy is to disclose cash, bank account balances, cashable investment-grade deposit certificates and non-\ncashable investment-grade deposit certificates that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and be subject to\nan insignificant risk of changes in value as cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are held in Canadian\nchartered banks or financial institutions controlled by a Canadian chartered bank.\n11\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nLoss per Share\nBasic loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding. In order to determine diluted loss\nper share, any proceeds from the exercise of dilutive stock options and warrants would be used to repurchase common shares\nat the average market price during the period, with the incremental number of shares being included in the denominator of\nthe diluted loss per share calculation. The diluted loss per share calculation excludes any potential conversion of warrants and\noptions that would increase earnings per share or decrease loss per share. The outstanding stock options and warrants to\npurchase common shares disclosed in note 12 were not included in the computation of the diluted loss per share for the periods\npresented because the effect would be anti-dilutive.\nIncome Taxes\nTax expense recognised in profit or loss comprises the sum of deferred tax and current tax not recognised in other comprehensive\nincome or directly in equity. Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, fiscal\nauthorities relating to the current or prior reporting periods, that are unpaid at the reporting date. Current tax is payable on\ntaxable profit, which differs from profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. Calculation of current tax is based on tax\nrates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period, adjusted for amendments\nto tax payable with regards to previous years.\nDeferred income taxes are calculated using the liability method on temporary differences between the carrying amounts\nof assets and liabilities and their tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial recognition of goodwill, or\non the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related transaction is a business combination or affects tax or\naccounting profit.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their\nrespective period of realization, provided they are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\nDeferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable\nthat they will be able to be utilised against future taxable income. The Company has not recognised deferred tax assets to\nthe extent that the Company does not consider it probable that a deferred tax asset will be recovered.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the Company has a right and intention to offset current tax assets\nand liabilities from the same taxation authority.\nChanges in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of taxable income or expense in profit or loss,\nexcept where they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case\nthe related deferred tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or equity, respectively.\n12\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nRestoration, Rehabilitation, and Environmental Obligations\nAn obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when the Company has a present legal or\nconstructive obligation caused by the exploration, development or ongoing production of a mineral property interest. Such\ncosts arising from the decommissioning of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to their net present value, are\nprovided for and capitalised at the start of each project to the carrying amount of the asset, as soon as the obligation to incur\nsuch costs arises. Discount rates using a pre-tax rate that reflect the time value of money are used to calculate the net present\nvalue. These costs are charged against profit or loss over the economic life of the related asset, through amortization using\neither the units-of-production or the straight-line method. The related liability is adjusted for each period for the unwinding of\nthe discount rate and for changes to the current market-based discount rate, amount or timing of the underlying cash flows\nneeded to settle the obligation. Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is created on an ongoing basis during\nproduction are provided for at their net present values and charged against profits as extraction progresses. The Company had\nno material restoration, rehabilitation and environmental obligations as at March 31, 2024 or 2023 as the disturbance to date\nis minimal.\nInterest\nInterest income and expenses are reported on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.\nLeases\nThe Company assesses at inception of a contract, whether the contract is, or contains a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease\nif the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To\nassess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time, the Company assesses\nwhether the customer has the following through the period of use:\n• The right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset; and\n• The right to direct the use of the identified asset.\nAt the lease commencement date, the Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is\ninitially measured at cost. The cost of the right-of-use asset is comprised of the initial amount of the lease liability, any lease\npayments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, initial direct costs incurred by the\nCompany, and an estimate of the costs to be incurred by the Company in dismantling and removing the underlying asset and\nrestoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions\nof the lease.\nAfter the commencement date, the Company measures right-of-use assets related to property and equipment by applying the\ncost model, whereby the right-of-use asset is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and\nadjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from\nthe commencement date to the end of the lease term or the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset. The estimated useful\nlife of the right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. The determination\nof the depreciation period is dependent on whether the Company expects that the ownership of the underlying asset will transfer\nto the Company by the end of the lease term or if the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Company will exercise a\npurchase option.\n13\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nLeases (continued)\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments not paid at the lease commencement date,\ndiscounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, if the interest rate implicit\nin the lease cannot be readily determined. The lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise of\nfixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend\non an index or rate, amounts expected to be payable by the Company under a residual value guarantee, the exercise price of a\npurchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, and payment of penalties for terminating the lease if the\nlease term reflects the Company exercising an option to terminate the lease. After the commencement date, the Company\nmeasures the lease liability at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nThe Company remeasures the lease liability when there is a change in the lease term, a change in the Company’s assessment of\nan option to purchase the underlying asset, a change in the Company’s estimate of amounts expected to be payable under a\nresidual value guarantee, or a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine\nthose payments. On remeasurement of the lease liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-\nof-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\nThe Company has elected to not recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of property and\nequipment and low value leases of property and equipment. Short-term leases are leases with a term of twelve months or less.\nThe Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on either a straight-line basis over the\nlease term or another systematic basis if that basis is more representative of the pattern of the lessee’s benefit.\nInventories\nInventories are comprised of raw materials. Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is\ndetermined on a standard cost basis, and includes the purchase price and other costs, such as import duties, taxes and\ntransportation costs. Inventory cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis and any trade discounts and rebates are\ndeducted from the purchase price. Raw material costs include the purchase cost of the materials and freight-in.\nWhere inventory is not expected to be sold within a year of the date of statement of financial position, it is presented as\na noncurrent asset.\nGovernment grants\nGovernment grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognises\nexpenses as related costs for which funded expenditures are incurred. Government grants are recognised when there is\nreasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the terms and conditions associated with the grants and the grants will\nbe received. An unconditional government grant is recognised in profit or loss when the Company is entitled to receive the grant\nfunding.\n14\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s accounting policy for revenue recognition under IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, follows a\nfive-step model to determine the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized:\n1. Identifying the contract with a customer;\n2. Identifying the performance obligations within the contract;\n3. Determining the transaction price;\n4. Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations; and\n5. Recognizing revenue when/as performance obligation(s) are satisfied.\nThe Company enters into sales contracts with its customers that outline the payment, shipping and return policies under these\ncommercial arrangements. The performance obligation within the sales contracts is primarily the delivery of the Company’s\nproprietary graphene oxide solution (“Solution”) and / or masks. These products are sold for contractually determined prices\nthat include consideration for the products delivered and variable consideration consisting of royalties for masks sold by the\nCompany’s customers that have been coated with the Solution. The transaction price is allocated to the Solution and the masks\nbased on their standalone selling price and is recognized when the control of these products is obtained by the Company’s\ncustomers which is generally upon delivery. Royalty revenue is recognized when the Company is entitled to these royalties\nwhich is when the coated masks are sold by the Company’s customers.\nWhere the consideration payable by the Company’s customers includes volume rebates and merchandise discounts, they\nare considered in determining the transaction price and are estimated and recognised at the time of the sale as a deduction\nagainst recognized revenue. To date, these rebates and discounts have been immaterial.\nNew Standards, Interpretations and Amendments Adopted from April 1, 2023\nCertain IFRS pronouncements were issued that were mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after April 1, 2023.\nMany have been excluded as management does not expect them to have a material effect. The following amendments\nare effective for the year beginning April 1, 2023:\nIAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements (“IAS 1”) and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Material Judgements. In February\n2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2. The amendments aim to make accounting policy\ndisclosures more informative by replacing the requirement to disclose ‘significant accounting policies’ with ‘material accounting\npolicy information’. The amendments also provide guidance under what circumstance, the accounting policy information is\nlikely to be considered material and therefore requiring disclosure. These amendments have no effect on the measurement or\npresentation of any items in the consolidated financial statements of the Company but effect the disclosure of accounting\npolicies of the Company.\nIAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (IAS 8). The amendments to IAS 8, which added\nthe definition of accounting estimates, clarify that the effects of a change in an input or measurement technique are\nchanges in accounting estimates, unless resulting from the correction of prior period errors. These amendments clarify\nhow entities make the distinction between changes in accounting estimate, changes in accounting policy and prior period\nerrors. These amendments had no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nIAS 12 - Income Taxes (\"IAS 12\"). In May 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12, which clarify whether the initial\nrecognition exemption applies to certain transactions that result in both an asset and a liability being recognised\nsimultaneously (e.g. a lease in the scope of IFRS 16). The amendments introduce an additional criterion for the initial\nrecognition exemption, whereby the exemption does not apply to the initial recognition of an asset or liability which at\nthe time of the transaction, gives rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. These amendments had no\neffect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\n15\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (continued)\nNew Standards, Interpretations and Amendments not yet Effective\nThere are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued by the IASB that\nare effective in future accounting periods that the Company has decided not to adopt early.\nThe following amendments are effective for the year beginning April 1, 2024:\nLiability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases);\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements);\nNon-Current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements); and Supplier\nFinance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments:\nDisclosures)\nThe following amendments are effective for the year beginning April 1, 2025:\nLack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates)\nThe Company is currently assessing the impact of these new accounting standards and amendments. The Company does not\nexpect any of the standards issued by the IASB, but are yet to be effective, to have a material impact on the Company.\n3. CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTIES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the Company’s management to\nmake judgements, estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and related notes. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the\namount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates and these differences could be material.\nThe areas which require management to make significant judgements, estimates and assumptions in determining carrying\nvalues include, but are not limited to:\nInventory\njudgement is required in determining whether net realizable value should be evaluated on a product by product basis or if\nproducts cannot be evaluated separately from other products in inventory and should be grouped with similar products.\nExpected credit loss allowance and provision\nThe Company determines an expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on the estimated expected lifetime\ncredit loss, considering the actual credit loss in prior years and forward-looking estimates of expected collections. This\nestimate varies depending on the nature of the trade receivables, the majority of which are associated with the health\nsciences business; however, also includes receivables from government agencies. The loss allowance is reviewed on a\nquarterly basis and any change in estimate is accounted for prospectively. Collectivity of customer balances classified as\ntrade receivables may vary from the Company’s estimation. The Company also assesses the expected credit loss of non-\ntrade financial assets, such as the loan receivable which is secured by property mortgages, to determine if an allowance is\nrequired.\n16\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n3. CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTIES (continued)\nImpairment (impairment reversal) of exploration and evaluation assets\nWhile assessing whether any indications of impairment or impairment reversal exist for exploration and evaluation assets,\nconsideration is given to both external and internal sources of information. Information the Company considers includes\nchanges in the market, economic and legal environment in which the Company operates that are not within its control that\ncould affect the recoverable amount of exploration and evaluation assets. Internal sources of information include the\nmanner in which exploration and evaluation assets are being used or are expected to be used and indications of expected\neconomic performance of the assets. Estimates include but are not limited to estimates of the discounted future pre-tax\ncash flows expected to be derived from the Company’s mineral exploration properties, costs to sell the properties and the\nappropriate discount rate. Reductions in metal price forecasts, increases in estimated future costs of production, increases\nin estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount of recoverable mineral reserves and mineral resources and/or\nadverse current economics can result in a write-down of the carrying amounts of the Company’s exploration and evaluation\nassets.\nImpairment (impairment reversal) of property and equipment\njudgements are required to assess when internal or external indicators of impairment or impairment reversal exist, and\nimpairment testing is required. Management considers internal and external sources of information including forecasted\nsales, cashflows and expected production volumes. judgement is required to assess these internal and external factors when\ndetermining if the carrying amount of an asset is impaired, or in the case of a previously impaired asset, whether the carrying\namount of the asset has been restored.\nShare-based payments\nManagement determines costs for share-based payments using market-based valuation techniques. The fair value of the\nmarket-based and performance-based share awards are determined at the date of grant using generally accepted\nvaluation techniques. Assumptions are made and judgement used in applying valuation techniques. These assumptions\nand judgements include estimating the future volatility of the stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee\nturnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors and corporate performance. Such judgements and\nassumptions are inherently uncertain. Changes in these assumptions affect the fair value estimates.\nContingencies\nBy their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events transpire. The assessment of\ncontingencies inherently involves estimating the outcomes of future events. The Company has disclosed its disputes\nand was required to exercise judgement in assessing the recorded amounts.\n17\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n4.

LOAN RECEIVABLE\nIn March 2022, a loan was advanced to a third party, who is an insignificant shareholder of the Company and not an insider nor\nan employee of the Company, earning 6% interest per annum, calculated and payable monthly. The loan was originally secured\nby mortgages against two properties held by the borrower. The original maturity date was July 1, 2022 and an amended and\nrestated promissory note was completed in 2023 with a revised maturity date of September 29, 2023. As a result of the sale of\none property held as security in June 2023, a partial payment of $2,500,000 was applied against the loan receivable. The security\nagainst this property was released accordingly.\nOn November 9, 2023, an amended and restated promissory note for the remaining balance was completed with a new\nmaturity date of March 29, 2024.\nSubsequent to year end, the Company entered into an amended and restated promissory note with a revised maturity\ndate of October 31, 2024.\nThe Company performed an analysis of collectivity and based on the collateral against the loan, determined that no\nprovision was required.

The mortgage\nwas assumed in a vendor-take-back agreement with the seller of the property who is an insignificant shareholder and not an\ninsider of the Company. There are no financial covenants associated with this agreement. On April 1, 2023, the repayment terms\nwere renegotiated to extend the amortisation period by an additional 12 months to March 1, 2025 and reduce the monthly\ninstallment from $85,504 to $43,764, including interest at 5% per annum. On October 1, 2023, the repayment terms were\namended with payments moving to interest only for the next six months ending March 1, 2024. As a result, the loan repayment\nwas further extended by four months with a new maturity date of October 1, 2025.

SHARE CAPITAL\n(a) Share Capital\nThe Company is authorised to issue an unlimited number of common shares, with no par value.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued 1,527,696 common shares in connection with the exercise of\n2,000,000 options (2023: 285,924 common shares on exercise of 348,333 options). The carrying value of the options, being\n$645,000 (2023: $214,133), was removed from share-based payment reserve and added to share capital. Of the 2,000,000 (2023:\n348,333) options exercised, 1,900,000 (2023: 233,333) were exercised using a \"cashless\" exercise method whereby 472,304\n(2023: 62,409) fewer shares were issued than exercised as compensation for the $958,000 (2023: $153,666) that would have\notherwise been received by the Company upon exercise.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company also purchased, and subsequently cancelled, 245,100 (2023: nil) of\nits own common shares at a cost of $408,853 (2023: nil).\n(b) Share Purchase Warrants\nThe Company had no share purchase warrants outstanding as of March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.\n(c) Stock Options and Share-Based Payment Reserve\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company issued 1,250,000 stock options to a number of employees and directors\nat exercise prices ranging from $1.75 to $2.24. The grant date fair value of these stock options was $1,545,175. The vesting\nperiod for the stock options issued was as follows: 416,667 at the date of issuance; 350,000 after 6 months from the date of\nissuance; 416,667 after 12 months from the date of issuance; and 66,667 after 24 months from the date of issuance.\nIn addition, on December 14, 2023, the Company's subsidiary, Triera Biosciences Ltd. (\"Triera\"), issued 195,000 stock options\nto a number of directors and officers at an exercise price of $5.00. The grant date fair value of these stock options was\ndetermined to be trivial and no stock-based compensation was recorded in relation to these options. The vesting period for\nthe Triera stock options issued was as follows: 65,000 at the date of issuance; 65,000 after 6 months from the date of issuance;\nand 65,000 after 12 months from the date of issuance. In February 2024, the Company repriced the Triera stock options,\nreducing the exercise price from $5.00 per share to $1.00 per share. All other terms and conditions of these options remained\nunchanged. The change in the fair value of the Triera stock option grant was trivial and as such, no amount was recorded\nupon modification.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2023, the Company issued 600,000 stock options to a number of consultants, employees and\ndirectors at exercise prices ranging from $1.93 to $2.59. The grant date fair value of these stock options was $913,000. The vesting\nperiod for the stock options issued was as follows: 200,000 at the date of issuance; 83,333 after 6 months from the date of issuance;\n200,000 after 12 months from the date of issuance; and 116,667 after 24 months from the date of issuance.\nThe grant date fair value of the stock options was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. A summary of\nthe inputs used to value the options issued during the years ended March 31 is presented below:\nTriera The Company\nMar 31, 2024 Mar 31, 2023 Mar 31, 2024 Mar 31, 2023\nExpected dividend yield 0% N/A 0% 0%\nExpected volatility 98% to 120% N/A 70% to 90% 88% to 95%\nExpected forfeiture rate 0% N/A 5% 0%\nRisk-free interest rate 3.90% N/A 3.6% to 4.5% 2.5% to 3.9%\nExpected life 3 to 5 years N/A 3 to 5 years 3 to 5 years\nThe Company's computation of expected volatility for the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 is based on the Company's\nmarket close price over a prior period equal to the expected life of the options.\n24\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n12.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED RISKS\nThe Company's operations include the acquisition and commercialization of intellectual property in Canada and foreign\njurisdictions. The Company examines the various financial risks to which it is exposed and assesses the impact and likelihood of\noccurrence. These risks may include credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and other risks. Where material,\nthese risks are reviewed and monitored by the Board of Directors. The Company's counterparty credit risk increased from the\nprior year as a result of the trade receivables and loan receivable in existence at year end.\na) Credit Risk\nCounterparty credit risk is the risk that the financial benefits of contracts with a specific counterparty will be lost if a counterparty\ndefaults on its obligations under the contract. This includes any cash amounts owed to the Company by those counterparties, less\nany amounts owed to the counterparty by the Company where a legal right of set-off exists and also includes the fair values of\ncontracts with individual counterparties which are recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\ni) Accounts receivable, other receivables and loan receivable\nAs the Company has commenced production and sales, it is exposed to credit risk with respect to its accounts\nreceivable. The Company also issued a loan receivable during the prior year further increasing its exposure to credit\nrisk. The Company manages its credit risk by reviewing and assessing credit exposure prior to facilities being\ncommitted to customers. Overall the Company's credit risk has not changed from the prior period. The Company's\naccounts and other receivables and loan receivable total $839,793 (2023: $3,552,649), representing the maximum\nexposure to credit risk from those financial assets. The loan receivable is secured by mortgages against properties\nheld by the borrower which lowers the maximum exposure to credit risk.\nii) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nIn order to manage credit and liquidity risk, the Company's cash is held through a large Canadian Financial\nInstitution and the Company invests only in highly rated investment grade instruments that are cashable or have\nmaturities of three months or less. The investments are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are\nsubject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\nb) Liquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company\nmanages liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are due\nwithin the current operating period.\nThe following are the undiscounted amounts and contractual maturities of the Company's long-term debt and anticipated\ntiming of settlements of its other financial liabilities as at March 31, 2024 and 2023:\nBalance, as at March 31, 2024 < 1 year 1-2 years > 2 years\n$ $ $\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 1,169,262 - -\nLease liability 151,129 171,990 161,737\nDebt 498,613 259,114 -\nBalance, as at March 31, 2023 < 1 year 1-2 years > 2 years\n$ $ $\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 1,292,474 - -\nLease liability 129,264 151,129 333,727\nLong-term debt 998,080 - -\n29\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED RISKS (continued)\nc) Interest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in\nmarket interest rates. The risk that the Company will realise a significant loss as a result of a decline in the fair market value of\ninvestments or items held within cash and cash equivalents is limited given that the majority have a relatively short maturity. The\nCompany manages its interest rate risk with investments by investing the majority of funds in short-term investments and\ntherefore is not exposed to significant fluctuations in interest rates. The Company believes that its interest rate risk is minimal.\nd) Currency Risk\nThe Company is exposed to the financial risk related to the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates. The functional and reporting\ncurrency of the Company is the Canadian dollar. The Company is involved with a number of foreign vendors in the United States\nof America. Changes in the currency exchange rates between the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar could have an effect\non the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows. As a result, the Company is exposed to currency risk\non these transactions. A 1% strengthening of the US dollar would affect net loss by approximately $5,000. The Company has\nnot hedged its exposure to currency fluctuations as the exposure has been deemed to be minimal.\ne) Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nIFRS 13 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the input to valuation techniques used to measure fair value as follows:\nLevel 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly\n(i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); and\nLevel 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Company does not have any financial instruments recorded at fair value and that require\nclassification within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe fair values of all of the Company's financial instruments approximate their carrying values.\nf) Sensitivity Analysis\nBased on management's knowledge and experience in the financial markets, the Company believes the following movements\nare \"reasonably possible\" over a twelve month period:\nTemporary investments are invested in guaranteed investment certificates. Sensitivity to a plus or minus 1% change in\nrates, based on the current balance of temporary investments, would affect the net loss by approximately plus or minus\n$30,000 during a twelve-month period.\n30\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n17. MANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL\nThe Company’s objective when managing capital is to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. In the\nmanagement of capital, the Company monitors its adjusted capital which comprises all components of shareholders’\nequity. The Company’s capital management objectives, policies and processes have remained unchanged during the years\nended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The Company manages the capital structure and makes\nadjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In\norder to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue common shares through private placements.\n18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\na) Environmental Contingencies\nThe Company’s activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These\nlaws and regulations are continually changing and generally becoming more restrictive. The Company believes its\noperations are materially in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\nb) Research Agreements\nThe Company has entered various agreements with arms' length parties pertaining to ongoing science efforts in pursuit of\nresearch and/or development and intellectual property with the objective of profitably bringing products to market. Many of\nthe counterparties to these agreements are Canadian universities and affiliated individuals. These agreements can be\ngeneralized as having ‘no fault’ termination clauses regarding ongoing commitments and future liability when the Company\ndetermines that the pursuit becomes ineffective or unlikely to result in a profitable or commercially-viable product.\nUnder certain of these technology license agreements with Canadian universities, the Company has an obligation to pay\nroyalties on revenues from any subject technologies. No such revenues have been earned to date.\nc) Contingent liabilities\nIn September 2018, the Company received a statement of claim from a former employee. The Company is in the process of\ndefending the claim, but views the claim as unmeritorious. On March 24, 2020, the Company commenced an action claim against\nthe former employee for relief relating to contracts and transactions between that employee and the Company, seeking to set\naside those agreements and, where applicable, seeking disgorgement of unspecified amounts relating to benefits obtained under\nthose agreements. Although there can be no assurance that any particular claim will be resolved in the Company's favour,\nmanagement does not believe that the outcome of any claim or potential claims of which it is currently aware will have a material\nadverse effect on the Company. A trial date has been set to commence on October 21, 2024.\nThe Company is currently undergoing a Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) audit of approximately $4 million flow-through share\n(“FTS”) expenditures made and renounced during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 through March 31, 2022. The CRA audit\nmay result in amendments to the FTS expenditures renounced during the foregoing period. Such CRA amendments could result\nin a Company obligation to indemnify certain of the flow through shareholders as a result of reductions in previously flowed\nthrough expenditures. The CRA audit may also result in a Company obligation for penalties and interest related to reductions in\nprior-year FTS eligible expenditures and flow through.\nAs the resolution of the CRA audit is subject to many uncertainties, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome or to\nestimate the Company’s potential obligation to indemnify flow through shareholders for amended flow through\nexpenditures or for related penalties and interest, if any, which may result.\nNo provision has been made for this contingent liability and the amount of any future payment, if any, will be recorded in\nthe period in which such a payment is measurable.\n31\nZENTEK LTD.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Stated in Canadian Dollars)\nAS AT AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 AND 2023\n19. NET LOSS PER SHARE\nBasic net loss per share figures are calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The\nweighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding for the year ended March 31, 2024 is 100,503,442\n(2023: 99,436,264). Diluted net loss per share figures are calculated after taking into account all warrants and stock options\ngranted. For the years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, all stock options and warrants were excluded from the\ndiluted per share amounts as their effect is anti-dilutive in loss periods.\n20. GOVERNMENT GRANTS\nThe Company has entered into agreements with various government agencies under which the Company is entitled to receive\nassistance and cost recoveries for specific research and development activities. The Company was successful in securing\nfunding with the National Research Council for the Industrial Research Assistance Program for an HVAC project which included\nfunding to offset both labour and third-party testing costs.

For all of these reasons, the Company’s securityholders should\nnot place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nCompany Overview and Discussion of Operations\nThe Company was incorporated in Ontario, Canada as 1774119 Ontario Limited on July 29, 2008. Pursuant to Articles\nof Amendment dated November 24, 2009, the Company changed its name to “Zenyatta Ventures Ltd.” On January 1,\n2019, the Company filed Articles of Amendment changing its name from “Zenyatta Ventures Ltd.” to “ZEN Graphene\nSolutions Ltd.” On October 27, 2021 (effective October 28, 2021), the Company filed Articles of Amendment\nchanging its name from “ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.” to “Zentek Ltd.” The common shares of the Company trade\non the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”) under the symbol “ZEN” and in the United States on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “ZTEK”.\nThe Company commenced operations as a junior mineral exploration company focused primarily on mineral deposits\nin Northern Ontario, Canada. The Company was actively engaged in exploring mining projects and held an interest\nin exploration licenses on properties located north of Lake Superior and west of James Bay in Northern Ontario,\nCanada in the “Arc of Fire” area. The properties, located north of Lake Superior and southwest of James Bay in\nnortheastern Ontario, Canada, were unpatented, non-contiguous, and consisted of nine claim blocks, including 234\nclaims comprised of 3,549 claim units over a total of 56,784 ha.\nWithin such claim blocks, the Company continued to hold a 100% undivided interest in Claim Block 4F, comprised\nof 521 mining claims (461 single-cell claims and 60 boundary-cell claims), which hosts an igneous-hosted, fluid-\nderived graphite deposit (the “Albany Graphite Project”). The Company did extensive work to determine potential\nuses for the graphite materials to be extracted from the Albany Graphite Project, including engaging in testing the\nproperties of the graphite material and studies on graphene materials.\nIn May 2018, the Company began to focus resources on the research and development of graphene and related\napplications, which was supported by shareholders of the Company who voted in favour of a new Board of Directors\nwith an interdisciplinary team to augment key management personnel with expertise in business, science, marketing,\nand government relations.\nP age 3 | 42\nIn February of 2020, the Company opened a research facility in Guelph, Ontario, to support its university and\nindustrial partners’ ongoing research and to scale-up production of graphene products. Subsequently, the COVID-\n19 pandemic halted research at the Company’s collaborators’ laboratories. The Company pivoted to focus its\nresources to develop graphene-based solutions for the fight against COVID-19.\nOn September 22, 2020, the Company announced, based on the results from a report to the Company dated\nSeptember 18, 2020, from the ImPaKT Centre at the University of Western Ontario entitled “Zen Graphene – Lab\nTest Report No. Z03-092020”, the development and successful testing of a now patented GO/silver compound that\nshowed to be 99% effective against COVID-19 virus a minimum of 35 days after application of the coating to N95\nmask material. On December 22, 2020, the Company announced the successful testing at the Department of\nMicrobiology at Mount Sinai Hospital/University Health Network of the GO/silver compound that showed to be\n99.9% effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic bacteria as well as against fungus/yeast, based\non a report to the Company dated December 18, 2020, entitled “Evaluation of Graphene Oxide with Silver Cations\n(GO-Ag+) as an Antibacterial Agent against Respiratory Pathogens”, which stated that if the compound could be\nshown to be safe and effective, it could provide a breakthrough alternative therapy for the practices of family\nmedicine, Otolaryngology, Ophthalmology and intensive care units.\nThe Company filed patent applications relating to its antimicrobial coating, and on April 13, 2021, announced the\nbrand name ZenGUARD (“ZenGUARD™”) for such coating. On September 27, 2022, the Company announced that\nits patent application directed to the ZenGUARD™ technology for use on personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and\nheating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”) had been allowed in Canada including all 54 claims made in the\napplication, and on December 6, 2022, the patent was granted with a term until September 20, 2041.\nPursuant to a License Agreement dated September 22, 2020, between the Company and the University of Guelph,\nthe Company holds the exclusive global rights to intellectual property regarding an electrochemical exfoliation\n(“ECE”) process to produce graphene oxide (“GO”).\nOn October 18, 2021, the TSXV changed the Company’s classification from a “mining issuer” to an “industrial,\ntechnology, or life sciences issuer”, which was approved by the shareholders of the Company on September 27,\n2021, in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSXV.\nOn November 29, 2021, the Company announced that it had been issued a Medical Device Establishment License\n(“MDEL”) from Health Canada (license number 18823) for the manufacture and distribution of any Class I medical\ndevices, including any such devices with or without the ZenGUARD™ coating.\nThe Company is now an intellectual property development and commercialization company focused primarily on\ncommercializing ZenGUARD™, as well as on the development of certain aptamer technologies and other\nnanomaterials-based technologies.\nOn May 23, 2023, the Company completed the transfer of the ownership of the Albany Graphite Project to a wholly\nowned subsidiary of the Company, Albany Graphite Corp. (“AGC”) pursuant to a property purchase agreement dated\nApril 24, 2023, as described in more detail under the heading “Albany Graphite Project” below. The Company does\nnot require materials extracted from the Albany Graphite Project for its current business plans, although such materials\ncould hold significant value to the Company in the future.\nOn June 12, 2023, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary named Triera Biosciences Ltd. that now owns\nthe exclusive, global licensing rights for all aptamer-based technology from the collaboration with McMaster\nUniversity. The Company and McMaster University entered into a standard license agreement dated June 11, 2021\npursuant to which McMaster agreed to license certain intellectual property. All rights and obligations under this\nlicensing agreement were assigned to this subsidiary subsequent to incorporation.\nP age 4 | 42\nCurrent Business\nZenGUARD™ Antimicrobial Compound – Personal Protective Equipment\nDuring the reporting period, the Company continued to advance toward commercial production of its ZenGUARD™\nantimicrobial coating at industrial scale for application to non-woven, spunbond polypropylene material to be used\nin surgical mask manufacturing and potentially on other materials and products including HVAC filters. Based on\nreports from GAP EnviroMicrobial Services Ltd. (“GAP Labs”) dated May 3, 2021, the addition of ZenGUARD™\ncoating to surgical masks has been shown to increase the bacterial and viral filtration efficiency of masks and acts as\nan antimicrobial agent, providing increased protection when compared to similar uncoated masks.\nOn November 29, 2021, the Company announced that it had been issued a MDEL from Health Canada for the\nmanufacture and distribution of any Class I medical devices, allowing the Company to work with any manufacturers\nand distributors inside and outside of Canada to bring ZenGUARD™ surgical masks and, potentially, other PPE to\nthe Canadian market. The MDEL also allows the Company to produce and sell its own Class I medical device PPE\nproducts.\nOn April 12, 2022, the Company announced that it entered into a Reciprocal Supply Agreement dated March 31,\n2022, with EkoMed Global Inc. (“EkoMed”), a globally integrated manufacturer and distributor of PPE, pursuant to\nwhich (i) the Company will sell quantities of ZenGUARD™ coating to EkoMed for use initially on EkoMed’s\nsurgical masks, and potentially other PPE in the future, including N95 and KN95 type masks; and (ii) the Company\nwill purchase surgical masks manufactured by EkoMed, to be treated with ZenGUARD™ coating and resold by the\nCompany. The Company has provided ZenGUARD™ coated material to EkoMed for the manufacture of\napproximately 2,200,000 masks. These masks were later transferred to Arka BRENSStech Pvt Ltd. in India. At\nMarch 31, 2024, these masks had expired and were no longer available for sale but are being used as samples.\nOn May 13, 2022, the Company announced that Mark’s Work Wearhouse (“Mark’s”) had placed an initial sales\norder for ZenGUARD™-coated masks to be sold at select stores across Canada, and online. During August 2023,\nMark’s submitted an additional sales order for ZenGUARD™-coated masks. In October 2023, the Company\ninformed Mark’s that it will no longer be accepting orders through the required customer portal as the cost to maintain\nthe portal has exceeded purchases made by Mark’s since inception.\nOn September 7, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement\nwith Viva Healthcare Packaging (Canada) Ltd. (“VMedCare”) to manufacture and sell surgical masks enhanced with\nZenGUARD™ antimicrobial coating, pursuant to which the Company would provide ZenGUARD™-coated\nspunbond material to VMedCare, which will be responsible for manufacturing and packaging ZenGUARD™\nbranded surgical masks. As at the date hereof, the Company has provided ZenGUARD™-coated material to\nVMedCare for the manufacture of approximately 6,000,000 masks. Approximately 500,000 masks were\nmanufactured in September 2023 and as at March, 2024, approximately 395,000 masks are in storage at VMedCare.\nOn January 19, 2023, the Company announced that it had signed a Distribution Agreement with Southmedic Inc.\n(“Southmedic”) for the distribution of the Company’s patented ZenGUARD™ surgical masks. Pursuant to the\nagreement, the parties agreed that Southmedic will be the distributor of ZenGUARD™-enhanced surgical masks to\nCanadian hospitals, general practitioners, private surgery, long-term care and nursing home markets.\nOn March 22, 2023, the Company announced that further testing had been completed by SGS Standard Technical\nServices Co. to determine the extent of the antimicrobial properties and the time required to achieve deactivation of\nbacteria and virus on ZenGUARD™-coated mask material. Testing showed that ZenGUARD™-coated mask fabric\ndemonstrated over 99.99% antibacterial effectiveness after 1 hour. In the study, 260,000 Escherichia coli (E. coli)\nColony Forming Units (“CFU”) were reduced to under 100 CFU, while untreated control mask samples saw 120,000\nE. coli CFU grow to 2.5 million CFU in 1 hour and 1.1 billion in 8 hours. Additionally, the ZenGUARD™-coated\nmask fabric demonstrated 86.7% antiviral effectiveness after 1 hour against H1N1 and 99.7% after 8 hours.\nP age 5 | 42\nOn March 30, 2023, the Company announced that it had signed an agreement with Arka BRENStech Pvt Ltd\n(“BRENStech”), a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of India (India), pursuant to which\nBRENStech will act as a local partner to the Company as it seeks to develop business opportunities in India.\nBRENStech’s primary focus will be to establish sales and distribution opportunities for the Company’s masks and\nHVAC filters and potentially other products as they become available. The Company also expects that BRENStech\nwill connect the Company with university research facilities, assist with the navigation of applicable regulatory\nregimes, and source potential manufacturing partners for the Company’s business opportunities in India and globally.\nOn August 24, 2023, the Company announced that it had signed a supply agreement with Henry Schein, Inc., for a\nthree-year term in respect to the distribution of ZenGUARD™-coated masks to dental practices in Canada and,\nsubject to regulatory approval, potentially in the United States. In September 2023, Henry Schein placed their first\norder of masks.\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Company had an inventory of approximately 419,000 masks available for sale and had\nprovided ZenGUARD™-coated material to VMedCare for the manufacture of approximately an additional 5.5\nmillion masks.\nOn April 3, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive distribution agreement with Dallas,\nTexas-based Medwell Solutions LLC for its ZenGUARD™-enhanced surgical masks in the United States. The\nagreement was signed on March 18th 2024 and is for a period of two years from the date of facility establishment\nregistration and issuance of market clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration, at which point\nsales of ZenGUARD™-enhanced surgical masks can commence.\nThe Company continues to market its ZenGUARD™ product to be applied to various materials, and has targeted\nmanufacturers, including PPE manufacturers and HVAC filter material companies. Additionally in April 2024, the\nCompany filed a 510(k) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration for ZenGUARD™ Surgical\nMasks. The Company was required to complete additional safety and performance testing for the application to the\nFood and Drug Administration.\nZenGUARD™ Industrial Scale Production and Coating Facility\nThe Company has installed industrial-scale production equipment to produce the ZenGUARD™ coating formulation\nat its York Rd., Guelph, Ontario location, which location is permitted for industrial use. The Company has also\npurchased coating equipment so the process of applying the ZenGUARD™ coating formulation to spunbond\npolypropylene for use in surgical masks, HVAC filter materials, other PPE equipment, and potentially other uses,\ncan be completed by the Company on-site. The Company spent cumulatively approximately $2.8M on this objective\nwith no further additional expenditures required.\nThe effective construction completion date for the coating line was November 30, 2022. Following completion of\ninstallation, a period of training and certification began. The coating line became commercially operational in August\n2023. The Company has spent approximately $2.0M as of March 31, 2024, related to the coating line with no further\nadditional expenditures required.\nOn May 18, 2023, the Company announced that it had been granted the ISO 13485:2016 Quality Management\nSystem certification standard by the British Standards Institution. The Company also received Medical Device Single\nAudit Program (“MDSAP”) certificate No. 777967. The ISO and MDSAP are for our Quality Management System\nand do not include our production facility.\nProposed Construction of Graphene Oxide Production Facility\nIn addition to the construction of the ZenGUARD™ industrial scale production and coating equipment, as discussed\nabove, the Company intends to construct a plant to produce GO. The Company believes that the ability to produce\nP age 6 | 42\nGO itself, which is the precursor for the ZenGUARD™ compound, rather than relying on third-party suppliers of\nGO, will be economically favourable to the Company over the long term, as well as reducing supply and shipping\nrisk. The Company believes that there are three primary reasons it would benefit from an ability to produce GO\ninternally: (i) it should eliminate or significantly reduce supply chain risk; (ii) GO is not a homogeneous substance\nand by producing its own GO the Company could ensure product consistency; and (iii) the Company believes that\nthe demand for GO is increasing and that a domestic production facility could have the potential to generate product\nfor third-party users of the material\nThe Company engaged Bantrel Co. to begin engineering work on the proposed GO production plant in January 2021.\nPotential sites have been investigated. A site has not yet been selected and the permitting process has not yet begun.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company has spent $35,000 in preliminary investigations relating to this project and\nexpects that approximately $7,500,000 will be required to complete construction of a GO production facility.\nThe Company estimates that fifteen to eighteen months will be required to complete the construction of a GO\nproduction plant from the time of commencement, which is a management estimate based on the expectation of\nsecuring an agreement for the purchase of technology from an existing GO producer.\nRisks include, but are not limited to, the inability to reach an acceptable agreement for the purchase of such technology,\nthe inability to adapt existing technology to Canadian regulatory requirements, scaling-up from known existing\nproduction capacities could become a requirement, and delays as a result of ongoing material and equipment supply\nshortages.\nBusiness in Development\nZenGUARD™and OtherResearch and Development\nThe Company continues to seek the most effective, cost-efficient, and scalable process to produce high-quality GO.\nThe production of GO requires a consistent source (or precursor) material for conversion to graphene, which is then\napplied to various products for enhancement. The Company believes that it has a potential competitive advantage\nwith its interest in AGC and the large and high-quality supply of source material from the Albany Graphite Project,\nif and when the Company determines it is cost effective to use such material.\nAdvanced testing on potential new processes for commercial GO production is underway. The Company also\ncontinues to work with universities on different processes that could potentially lead to a more efficient and/or lower-\ncost process for GO production.\nP age 7 | 42\nThe following table sets out some of the specific research and development projects that the Company is undertaking:\nInitiative R&D Major Research Site Estimated Update for the period from\nTiming and Components

The patent was issued by the\nCanadian Intellectual Property Office on May 21, 2024.\nAptamer-Based Technology\nPursuant to a license agreement dated June 11, 2021, as amended June 23, 2023, McMaster University has granted\nto the Company, for a twenty-year term, a worldwide exclusive royalty-bearing license to use and practice all aptamer\nand DNAzyme uses, including, but not limited to, diagnostics, therapeutics, and as neutralization agents, including,\nbut not limited to SARS-CoV-2. On October 5, 2023, the Company announced the launch of a wholly owned\nsubsidiary that owns the exclusive, global licensing rights for all aptamer-based technology from the collaboration\nwith McMaster University. The technology was developed by a team of researchers under the guidance of Drs.\nYingfu Li, John Brennan and Leyla Soleymani, who have expertise in biosensing technologies and applications as\npoint of care diagnostics. This patent-pending technology was validated with clinical samples from patients recruited\nunder the supervision of two clinicians, Drs. Deborah Yamamura and Bruno Salena, who also work at McMaster\nUniversity. The project was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. This technology has shown to be\naccurate (similar to current PCR tests), is saliva-based, affordable and scalable, and provides results in under 10\nminutes. A license fee of $100,000, comprised of $50,000 cash and $50,000 in common shares of the Company\n(19,157 common shares at $2.61 per share) was paid to McMaster University as consideration. Although this\ntechnology was initially being developed specifically for COVID-19, this technology platform is designed to be able\nto detect other diseases by changing the aptamer to match new diseases.\nOn May 19, 2022, the Company announced that McMaster received two Natural Sciences and Engineering Research\nCouncil (“NSERC”) grants related to the aptamer-based rapid detection technology; the Alliance Missions Grant in\nthe amount of $1,000,000, and an Idea to Innovation (I2I) Grant in the amount of $350,000, of which the Company\nwill make a $140,000 contribution. The Company intends to continue working with Dr. Yingfu Li and the research\nteam at McMaster through in-kind contributions, using these grants towards commercializing the rapid diagnostic\nplatform. The grants will be used to advance commercialization efforts by improving the performance of aptamers,\noptimizing chip synthesis, and initiating tests for additional pathogens that can be incorporated into its pathogen\ndetection platform. The Company currently expects the cost to reach commercialization to be approximately\n$2,500,000, which includes enhancements and further development of the technology. StarFish Product Engineering\nInc. is to conduct product strategy alignment, usability analysis, device and architecture development, proof of\nconcept and prototyping, and program development.\nOn June 1, 2022, the Company announced that it had retained Halteres Associates (“Halteres”), a consultancy\nfocused on global health, diagnostics, and point-of-care testing, to assist with the commercialization of the aptamer-\nbased rapid detection technology. Market research from the Halteres group will be used to identify the most\ncommercially important pathogens for detection, which will guide the aptamer development program. Halteres\nevaluated several commercialization opportunities for the aptamer technology, including human diagnostics,\nagriculture, wastewater, veterinary, and other potential uses in healthcare and the Company is continuing to review\nthose opportunities.\nP age 11 | 42\nTo bring the product to market, the Company will be required to obtain authorization from Health Canada under an\ninterim order, or to obtain a Class IV Medical Device Active License (“MDAL”). The process for obtaining an\nMDAL involves completing certain testing requirements and demonstrating that the product is (i) safe, (ii) effective,\nand (iii) fit for purpose. Assuming that process is completed, the Company would then start preparing a product\ntechnical file, and then seek to complete a Health Canada Class IV application.\nOn July 20, 2023, the Company announced that the aptamer technology platform was successfully tested as a potential\nprophylactic or therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2 in pre-clinical animal models. In repeat trials, the aptamers developed by\nDr. Yingfu Li demonstrated similar efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 when benchmarked against a commercial\nmonoclonal antibody. The Company further announced the amendment of its license agreement with McMaster\nUniversity dated June 11, 2021, to broaden the scope of the worldwide exclusive license to apply to all aptamer and\nDNAzyme uses, including, but not limited to, diagnostics, therapeutics, and as neutralization agents, and not limited to\nSARS-CoV-2.\nOn July 27, 2023, the Company announced a new aptamer technology platform with McMaster University that\nsignificantly increases the binding affinity of aptamers. The increased binding affinity enhances the limits of\ndetection for aptamer-based diagnostics and could lead to the successful adaptation of these same aptamers for new\ntherapeutic and prophylactic treatments. Provisional patent applications were filed with the United States Patent and\nTrademark Office which have since resulted in the filing of two international patent applications filed with the World\nIntellectual Property Office as of September 30, 2023.\nOn October 10, 2023, the Company announced further pre-clinical testing results of the aptamer-based platform\ntechnology by the Dr. Matthew Miller Lab. Further preclinical testing was completed supporting the aptamer as a\nlead therapeutic target. An in vivo preclinical longevity of protection study was conducted to assess the safety and\nefficacy of the aptamer-based treatment over a period of 24 hours and demonstrated that the aptamer provided 24\nhours of neutralizing protection against SARS-CoV-2. A subsequent study was conducted to determine the minimal\neffective dose of the aptamer required to protect against a lethal challenge of SARS-CoV-2.\nOn November 15, 2023, the Company announced the development of a significant upgrade to its aptamer platform\nimproving the binding affinity of the universal COVID-19 aptamer from 300 to over 500 times, compared to the base\naptamer. The improved platform also solved key challenges for manufacturing and these High-Binding Affinity\n(“HBA”) aptamers are now produced with approximately a 95% yield. The Company estimates that an additional\n$1,000,000 will be required to complete the pre-clinical program for the SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic and enter clinical\ntrials.\nOn November 29, 2023, the Company announced the successful testing of its COVID-19 HBA aptamer against the\nOmicron XBB 1.5 variant (Omicron) by the Miller Lab at McMaster University in the latest pre-clinical study. The\nperformance of the COVID-19 HBA aptamer was comparable to the performance of monoclonal antibodies,\naccording to the Miller Lab, as it provided clinical protection against infection with the Omicron XBB 1.5 variant.\nThe Company will now begin to explore partnership opportunities in the pharmaceutical space as its aptamer platform\nmay offer a fast, economical, and novel approach to the development of new therapeutics for clinically relevant\nbiological markers.\nOn December 13, 2023, the Company announced the launch of Triera Biosciences Ltd. (“Triera”) as a wholly owned\nsubsidiary for its aptamer platform technology. Triera now owns the exclusive, global licensing rights for all aptamer-\nbased technologies from the collaboration with McMaster University.\nOn January 30, 2024, the Company announced the positive therapeutic results achieved by Triera Biosciences for\nC19HBA aptamer as a potential therapeutic. In the most recent trial completed in January 2024 by the Miller lab at\nMcMaster University, C19HBA was tested for its therapeutic potential. The treatment that featured C19HBA\ndemonstrated improved therapeutic benefit over no treatment of the LMA therapeutic. The full results of this\npreclinical investigation are pending publication in a peer reviewed journal.\nP age 12 | 42\nOn March 25, 2024, the Company announced that Triera completed testing demonstrating that its C19HBA SARS-\nCoV-2 universal aptamer built on the proprietary high-binding affinity aptamer platform has shown a promising\nsafety and toxicity profile in preclinical testing.\nOn May 6, 2024, the Company announced that Triera has prioritized the development of a prophylaxis and\ntherapeutic for highly pathogenic avian influenza. The mechanism of neutralizing the H5N1 virus is comparable to\nthe mechanism used by C19HBA against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. More specifically, the aptamer is believed to bind\nto and neutralize multiple subtypes of the HA surface protein (e.g., H1, H2, H5, etc.), preventing the virus from\nentering healthy cells and spreading infection.\nDiesel Fuel Additive\nThe Company is working to develop a stable graphene-based diesel fuel additive to improve combustion, increase\nburn rate, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to improve fuel economy of diesel fuels. Initial testing has shown an\nincrease in the performance of diesel fuel. The Company is working to improve on these early results through\noptimization work. The Company has filed a provisional patent application for its graphene-based fuel additive\ntechnology.\nPrimarily overseen by Dr. van der Kuur, the Company’s Chief Science Officer, the Company is developing a process\nto functionalize GO to produce a stable dispersion in diesel fuel. The fuel additive was tested by Conestoga College\nin a Gunt 159 single-cylinder test engine, which yielded an improvement in fuel economy of over 10% under certain\nrpm.\nThe Company continues to work with Dr. Sina Kheirkah at the University of British Columbia-Okanagan Campus\n(“UBCO”) to test GO-doped fuel as part of an NSERC alliance project for $110,500 cash contribution and a total\nbudget of $311,500 over two years to continue doped fuel research. The project will focus on measuring the\ncombustion of doped fuel in both droplet and spray combustion. The Company has spent approximately $98,900 on\nthis research and development project.\nThe Company intends to continue spray combustion testing at UBCO to optimize the concentration of the additive\nand to assess the performance of the burn rate, fuel economy and emission of doped Jet-A and diesel fuels.\nIcephobic Coating\nThe Company is also working to develop a new, patent-pending, carbon-based, nanotechnology-enhanced coating\ndesigned to prevent or reduce ice accretion for aviation (including drone) and wind energy applications.\nDr. van der Kuur, the Company’s Chief Scientific Officer, is the primary overseer of the project, which has involved\nthe use of dispersion technology to homogeneously mix graphene-based materials in an elastomer. The Company\nhas also conducted testing at the National Research Council of Canada's (“NRC”) Altitude Icing Wind Tunnel in\nOttawa and prepared graphene-enhanced elastomer material and coated coupons for testing.\nThe Company disclosed on February 28, 2022, that the icephobic coatings were undergoing full flight trials on a\nspecially equipped research aircraft under real-world ice-forming weather conditions. On March 14, 2022, the\nCompany announced the results of three rounds of testing of its icephobic coating, including laboratory tests, real-\nworld flights and applications related to drone operations in adverse weather. In real-world testing, the Company\nreported that video footage of its icephobic coating on test pieces attached to a research aircraft undergoing flight\ntrials targeting adverse weather environments has shown positive results and demonstrated that, under significant\nicing conditions, the coatings provide an effective de-icing and anti-icing solution. Drone testing showed that\npropellers coated with the icephobic material can maintain higher thrust, when compared to a non-coated propeller,\ndue to the shedding of ice that forms on the blades that would otherwise degrade the drone’s ability to maintain stable\nflight. Accelerated ageing testing has been completed by exposing samples coated with icephobic elastomer to UV\nweathering for 1,000 hours, which approximates two years’ worth of sun damage in typical Canadian weather. These\nP age 13 | 42\nsamples were then tested in an icing wind tunnel under dynamic conditions and demonstrated significant retention\nof their icephobicity.\nOn August 2, 2022, the Company filed a full patent application with the World Intellectual Property Office for\nNanomaterial-Enhanced Elastomer for Passive Ice Accretion Prevention. The Company disclosed this on September\n19, 2022. The patent application has since been filed by the Company in Canada and Europe.\nOn September 19, 2022, the Company announced the successful completion of sand erosion testing at the NRC and\nrain erosion testing at the Anti-icing Materials International Laboratory in Quebec which demonstrated the icephobic\nmaterial’s durability in adverse conditions for both wind turbine and drone industries.\nOn May 4, 2023, the Company announced successful drone testing, where thrust was maintained under calibrated\nicing conditions of freezing drizzle and freezing rain in an outdoor, real-world environment. The drone with the\nCompany’s icephobic coating applied to the propeller blades hovered under the outdoor icing rig and, on all tests\nconducted, maintained flight until the end of the battery life of the drone. The same drone with uncoated propeller\nblades rapidly lost the ability to maintain flight. These tests are expected to satisfy the Transport Canada requirement\nfor anti-icing equipment. The current regulations for civilian drone operations in Canada as per Transport Canada\nregulations state that no pilot shall operate a remotely piloted aircraft system when icing conditions are observed, are\nreported to exist or are likely to be encountered along the route of flight unless the aircraft is equipped with de-icing\nor anti-icing equipment and equipment designed to detect icing.\nThe Company is currently consulting with Transport Canada to propose the Company’s passive ice accretion\ntechnology as a potential means of compliance to satisfy the requirements as well as working to find a collaborator\nthat could provide equipment designed to detect icing.\nOn May 30, 2023, the Company announced a collaboration with Pattern Energy Group LP to optimize, test and\nvalidate the Company’s icephobic coating for the wind turbine industry. The partnership is being supported\nfinancially by both the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and PRIMA Quebec –\nAdvanced Materials Moving Forward.\nThe Company continues to consider and seek partners to commercialize this technology, including drone companies\nand companies specializing in elastomer production. Because the NRC has been testing a variety of coatings, the\nCompany has been able to participate in the NRC testing process thus far at no cost to the Company. However, the\nCompany anticipates additional testing and development to cost approximately $150,000.\nFire-Retardant Additive\nThe Company announced on March 28, 2022, that it had filed a provisional patent with the United States Patent and\nTrademark Office for an innovative Graphene Oxide-Metal-Organic Framework (“GO-MOF”) compound for use in fire\nretardant products. The provisional patent application has since been filed as an international (PCT) patent application\nwith the World Intellectual Property Office on March 27, 2023. Management of the Company considers the\nmanufacturing of the GO-MOF compound as relatively easily scalable and efficient, due to the patent-pending facile\nsynthesis process. The Company believes the fire-retardant GO-MOF additive could potentially be placed in a variety of\ncoating products, such as latex, epoxies or included in polymers. When integrated into a polymer, it could potentially\ncreate a fire-resistant plastic that could be used in electric vehicles, providing a fire-resistant non-metal casing for the\nbatteries. Management currently expects that GO-MOF production could be achieved on the existing ZenGUARD™\nindustrial scale production facility with minimal additional capital expense.\nDr. van der Kuur, the Company’s Chief Scientific Officer, is the primary overseer of the project. The Company has\nspent approximately $82,800 on this research and development project, and intends to conduct further testing, which\nit currently estimates will cost approximately $55,000. In the year ended March 31, 2024, optimizations to the\nformulations were performed at the Company’s lab prior to a testing program with a commercial partner. Testing\nand optimization work remains ongoing as of March 31, 2024.\nP age 14 | 42\nBattery Technology\nThe Company has been collaborating with Dr. Michael Pope at the University of Waterloo since 2017, developing\nbattery technology to improve anode performance. One highly studied area for lithium-ion battery development is to\nimprove the anode material. Currently, electric vehicle anodes are composed of graphite, which has a limited\ntheoretical specific capacity of ~372 mAhg-1. Silicon has attracted significant attention as a replacement material,\nmainly due to its high specific capacity of 4,200 mAhg-1, but also due to its low working potential, low price and\navailability. However, silicon has an enormous volumetric fluctuation (greater than 300% in all dimensions) when\ncharging and discharging. This feature is the root cause behind the issues of poor cycle lifetime, irreversible capacity\nloss, and destruction and reformation of the solid electrolyte interface.\nUsing silicon in the anode material, Dr. Pope has attempted to address these issues and has created a patent-pending\ngraphene-wrapped silicon anode material. On February 18, 2022, the Company announced the filing of a provisional\npatent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office relating to a graphene-wrapped silicon anode material.\nSince April, Dr. Pope’s team has optimized the anode material, which now has a specific capacity of over 1,000\nmAh/g and retains over 80% of its capacity over 320 charge-discharge cycles. The specific capacity of this material\nis a significant improvement over common graphite anodes; however, the cycle life still requires improvement\ncompared to typical electric vehicle batteries, which lose about 4% capacity over 1,000 charge-discharge cycles. The\nCompany intends to continue to work with Dr. Pope’s team to develop this technology with the goal of improving\nperformance to meet industry requirements. The Company filed a patent application under the Patent Cooperation\nTreaty on May 17, 2022.\nOn October 28, 2022, the Company announced the commencement of a four-year, $1,600,000 research project in\ncollaboration with Professors Mohini Sain and Ning Yan from the University of Toronto and Ford Powertrain\nEngineering Research and Development Centre. Funding for the project includes $1,200,000 from the Mitacs\nAccelerate program. The project seeks to assess novel concepts for the purpose of inventing multifunctional materials\nto be used in automotive battery components including anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separator. The Company will\nbe working in tandem with University of Toronto researchers providing and testing advanced graphene materials\nincluding the Company’s patent-pending anode material developed by Dr. Michael Pope. There are no material\nupdates as at March 31, 2024, on our work with the University of Toronto.\nCorrosion Protection\nOn February 8, 2023, the Company announced the development of ZenARMOR™, a novel corrosion protection\ntechnology based on functionalized GO, for potential use in naval and marine infrastructure, bridges, buildings,\npipelines, and other industries. ZenARMOR™ could be produced in the ZenGUARD™ facility. Third-party testing\non ZenARMOR™ yielded excellent corrosion resistance with no blisters or other signs of corrosion after 1,500 hours\nof ASTM B-117 Salt Spray Test with ZenARMOR™, and ZenARMOR™ qualified for the Innovative Solutions\nCanada (“ISC”) Testing Stream – Military Call for Prototypes. The Company has filed an International (PCT) Patent\nApplication on this corrosion protection technology, as well as a trademark for ZenARMOR™.\nOn October 4, 2023, the Company announced that it had prepared and shipped the first corrosion paint samples to\nthe NRC for the first round of testing as part of the ISC - Testing Stream – Military Call for Proposals. NRC’s\nAerospace Research Centre’s Aerospace Manufacturing Technologies Centre will be testing the Company’s nano\npigment in military-grade chromate-free paints for evaluation in its first of three rounds of testing.\nOther Use-Cases for ZenGUARD™\nHVAC Filtration\nZenGUARD™ is the Company’s patented anti-microbial coating technology platform. The Company intends to\ncontinue exploring other applications and uses for its ZenGUARD™ compound, including, but not limited to, use in\nHVAC filters. On September 30, 2020, the Company first announced testing on ZenGUARD™ use for HVAC\nP age 15 | 42\nsystems. On January 13, 2021, the Company announced that testing by a major Canadian certification company had\nconfirmed that there was very little effect on air flow and pressure drop with a ZenGUARD™ treated filter compared\nto an untreated filter. The Company spent approximately $60,000 on testing, including preliminary testing of\nZenGUARD™-coated HVAC filter media for pressure drop, and increased challenge bacterial filtration efficiency on\nuncoated and coated MERV 8 and MERV 13 HVAC filters, overseen primarily by Dr. van der Kuur, the Company’s\nChief Scientific Officer.\nFurther to the press release dated November 30, 2021, the Company announced that it has been awarded a research\nand development test contract through the ISC Testing Stream Call for Proposals to test ZenGUARD™-coated HVAC\nfilters with interest from three different units within the NRC. The goal of the testing, conducted by CremCo\nLaboratories with assistance from the Aerospace Research Centre, a department of the NRC was to demonstrate: (i) a\nnet reduction in the airborne viral and bacterial load with ZenGUARD™ coating applied to standard filters; (ii) no\nmodifications required to existing HVAC systems to achieve (i) above; (iii) no reduction in air flow rates, which\nmeans air exchange rates in the space will be unchanged; and (iv) no reduction in the air quality as the ZenGUARD™\ncoating was tested to ensure it does not contribute particles into the air stream.\nPhase 1 testing commenced in December 2021 after an extensive design process, calibration, and assessment of the\ntesting rig, and involved the test rig being installed inside an aerobiology chamber to push air through HVAC filter\nmaterial with test organisms to study how these live airborne organisms were reduced by the ZenGUARD™ coating.\nTesting used multiple samples with repeated tests so that each filter’s performance could be compared. It was\ndetermined that all Phase 1 targets were met including sufficient reduction in live airborne test organisms, no\nsignificant shedding of the ZenGUARD™ coating, and air flow rates that were not impacted by the coating. On April\n11, 2022, the Company announced that, after successful completion of Phase 1 testing, it will proceed to Phase 2\ntesting.\nOn December 15, 2022, the Company announced the successful completion of Phase 2 HVAC filter testing and that\nthe preliminary report from Phase 2 testing had been received. The final report was received in January 2023, and\nannounced on February 6, 2023. The report notes a significant reduction in live airborne test organisms with\nZenGUARD™ coating applied to standard HVAC filters without modification to existing HVAC systems, with no\nreduction in air flow rates or increasing energy use.\nThe testing demonstrated a reduction in live airborne bacteriophage surrogate contamination within a modular\nclassroom environment, simulating a real-world environment. The testing was performed at the NRC’s purpose-built\nbioaerosol testing facility, designed, and built specifically for testing wet aerosolized droplets, which is the primary\nmechanism for the spread of disease in an indoor setting.\nThe Company has also consulted and tested with LMS Technologies (“LMS”), a United States-based air media and\nfilter testing company providing testing services and product certification for filter manufacturers. LMS’ independent\ntesting of ZenGUARD™ coated MERV 8 filters demonstrated a significant increase in both bacterial and viral\nfiltration efficiency in line with or better than the results from the NRC. The Company currently intends to continue\nto work to optimize configurations of HVAC filter materials coated with ZenGUARD™ technology at LMS to\noptimize its product and complete all testing and documentation required for regulatory submissions in Canada and\nthe United States. The Company has engaged Intertek Group plc to conduct a review of regulatory requirements in\nother geographies of interest.\nOn September 6, 2023, the Company announced the results of a study comparing the viral filtration efficiency (“VFE”)\nof ZenGUARD™-enhanced MERV 9 filters with an uncoated MERV 9 filter. The testing was performed by LMS,\nwhich specializes in the testing and certification of filter manufacturers across the world, referring to the new American\nSociety of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (“ASHRAE”) standards for aerosolized particles\nand determining the impact of dust loading on VFE and particle filtration efficiency (“PFE”) as per ASHRAE 52.2\ntesting standards. Key findings of the study included: (i) the VFE of ZenGUARD™-enhanced filters started with a\nsignificant advantage over equivalent non-coated filters, from 23.7% to 37.7%, a 59% enhancement or a 14% net gain\noverall, and, the VFE performance consistently increased faster for the ZenGUARD™-enhanced filters compared to\nP age 16 | 42\nthe uncoated filters (at six months equivalent dust loading, the VFE of the ZenGUARD™-enhanced filter was 85.6%\ncompared to 55.2% for the uncoated filter, a 28.4% net gain); (ii) the pressure drop remained consistent between\nZenGUARD™-enhanced and uncoated filters as dust loading increased, indicating that ZenGUARD™ does not\nadversely affect airflow or energy efficiency of the HVAC system; and (iii) ZenGUARD™-enhanced filters operated\nsimilarly to regular MERV 9 filters when tested for PFE, effectively removing particles across all size ranges.\nOn September 11, 2023, the Company announced the results of a study conducted by ParticleOne Inc., an RWDI\nVentures company. The study evaluated the performance of ZenGUARD™-enhanced filter technology in comparison\nto a standard MERV 9 filter. The study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of filters in removing infectious\nparticles from the air and to determine the potential return on investment (“ROI”) of enhanced viral filtration from\nusing ZenGUARD™ technology. The ParticleOne model ROI analysis indicated that the ZenGUARD™- enhanced\nMERV 9 filter resulted in a substantial reduction in annual absenteeism costs ($15,016.95) compared to a regular\nMERV 9 filter in an office space of 10,000 square feet with 75 occupants.\nOn December 8, 2023, the Company announced a distribution agreement with 1Click Heating and Cooling Inc.\n(“1Click”), a private HVAC company focused on the heat pump market, for ZenGUARD™ MERV 9 filters in various\nsizes and is expected to include other ZenGUARD™-enhanced MERV-rated filters in the future. This agreement will\nsee 1Click utilize ZenGUARD™ filters for its regular customer service maintenance programs, along with making\nZenGUARD™ filters available to customers from inventory held in various provinces. The Company’s agreement\nwith 1Click has an initial term of 2 years from the date of approval from the Pesticide Management Regulatory Agency\nand may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.\nOn January 22, 2024, the Company announced the completion of a new study highlighting the potential energy,\nemission and cost savings for commercial buildings adopting ZenGUARD™-enhanced air filters. By using\nZenGUARD™-enhanced air filters to control infectious aerosols instead of increasing the percentage of outside air to\nachieve a similar risk reduction, the Company estimates that a typical office space of 10,000 square feet with 75\noccupants can reduce HVAC energy consumption by approximately 62%.\nOn May 7, 2024, the Company announced that it completed a case study based on the City of Toronto highlighting\nthe economic and environmental benefits related to using MERV 9A filters compared to using MERV 13 filters. The\nstudy quantifies cost savings and reductions in carbon emission and waste assuming the City of Toronto is currently\nusing MERV 13 filters in all its buildings and switches to MERV 9A filters. The study found potential savings of\nover $40 million stemming from significantly reduced labour costs due to filters being changed every six months\nrather than every three months, reduced expenditures on air filters from replacing filters every six months rather than\nevery three months, reduced energy requirements and costs due to improved air flow and lower waste disposal costs\nfrom fewer filters being used.\nZenGUARD™-enhanced air filters are currently being assessed by the Health Canada Pest Management Regulatory\nAgency for registration under the Pest Control Products Act. The Company will provide an update as soon as\navailable. The Company is also currently working with consultants to file an application for ZenGUARD™-enhanced\nair filters with the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe Company has spent approximately $466,400 on this project during the period January 1, 2022, to March 31, 2024.\nTherapeutic and Pharmaceutical Applications\nThe Company was exploring the potential to use the ZenGUARD™ compound in therapeutic or pharmaceutical\napplications. In testing by Dr. Tony Mazzulli from Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, the active ingredient in\nZenGUARD™ showed low minimum inhibitory concentrations against several bacteria. On February 4, 2021, and\nP age 17 | 42\nMarch 2, 2021, the Company announced results of the Phase 2 cytotoxicity testing by Nucro Technics testing laboratory\nand included cytotoxicity testing that noted no adverse effects after seven days of repeated dosing. MRSA-related skin\ninfection testing was performed on animals with inconclusive results. Cytotoxicity studies with Nucro-Technics and\npositive anecdotal results of various human skin infections including acne, warts and toenail fungal infections showed\nno adverse effects recorded during these anecdotal trials. These human anecdotal cases form part of the Company’s\npatent application filed on December 21, 2021, under the Patent Cooperation Treaty entitled “Graphene-Silver\nNanocomposites and Uses for Same as a Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial” which was published on June 30, 2022.\nThe patent has been issued in Canada.\nThe Company has spent approximately $93,500 on this project during the period January 1, 2022, to March 31, 2024.\nOther\nThe Company is also working with a number of research institutions developing processes to synthesize graphene,\nGO and graphene quantum dots, along with other possible applications for graphene-based materials. Potential\nmarkets for graphene-based materials include composites (e.g., concrete, rubber, plastic polymers, and ceramics),\nsensors, water purification and filtration, coatings and solid-state lubricants, silicon-graphene and graphene aerogel\nanode material for next-generation batteries along with aerospace applications.\nThe Company has other research projects commenced or contemplated including applications in aluminum alloys,\ncorrosion protection, battery technology, conductive polymers, and others. The Company will report on these if and\nwhen it is appropriate to do so.\nAlbany Graphite Project\nThe Company owns 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of AGC which owns the Albany Graphite Project in\nNorthern Ontario, Canada. The unusual nature of the formation of graphite in the Albany Graphite Project and its\npotential chemical and economic significance motivated additional exploration drilling from 2011 to 2013. The\ncurrent claims require a total of $195,600 worth of assessment work per year to keep them in good standing and the\nCompany has a total credit of approximately $7.1M in available exploration reserves. On October 18, 2021, the\nTSXV changed the Company’s classification from a “mining issuer” to an “industrial, technology, or life sciences\nissuer.” The change of classification was approved by the shareholders of the Company on September 27, 2021, in\naccordance with the rules and policies of the TSXV.\nOn February 16, 2023, the Company and 1329307 BC Ltd. announced a non-binding letter of intent dated February 13,\n2023, pursuant to which the parties agreed to negotiate a transaction involving the transfer of the Albany Graphite\nProject in Northern Ontario to an entity to be listed on a recognized Canadian stock exchange. AGC was incorporated\nfor this purpose as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company on February 23, 2023.\nOn May 19, 2023, the Company transferred to AGC the ownership of the Albany Graphite Project, including the\nmining claims and all related chattel, drill core, and applicable contracts, in consideration for the issuance by AGC\nto the Company of 59,999,900 common shares of AGC. The Company announced the appointments of Greg Fenton\nas Chair of the board of AGC, Brian Bosse as Chief Executive Officer of AGC, and Peter Wood as Vice-President,\nDevelopment of AGC.\nDuring the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, approximately $33,000 (2023 - $Nil) and approximately\n$272,000 during the financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $Nil) was spent by AGC on the Albany Graphite\nProject including professional fees on updating the NI 43-101 report and geologist wages. These costs have been\ncapitalized in accordance with the Company’s accounting policy on Exploration and Evaluation Assets.\nOn July 26, 2023, the Company published an updated mineral resource estimate for the Albany Graphite Project,\nprepared by SLR Consulting (Canada) Ltd. (“SLR”). The updated mineral resource estimate is set out in the report\nP age 18 | 42\nentitled “Technical Report on the Albany Graphite Project, Ontario, Canada – Report for NI 43-101” dated July 31,\n2023 (effective date of April 30, 2023), prepared by SLR, and filed on SEDAR+ on September 1, 2023.\nThe Company had previously announced a non-brokered private placement financing, through the issuance of\nsubscription receipts of AGC at a price of $1.00 per subscription receipt (the “AGC Financing”) in connection with\na proposed listing on a recognized Canadian stock exchange of the common shares of AGC. On November 21, 2023,\nthe Company announced that due to the deterioration of the public market for battery metals and graphite,\nmanagement of the Company and AGC determined to await improved market conditions before proceeding with the\nAGC Financing and AGC’s listing on a recognized Canadian stock exchange. Any and all funds that were received\nfrom prospective investors and were held in trust pending closing of the AGC Financing were returned to such\nprospective investors.\nFurthermore, the Company announced that Brian Bosse ceased to act as Chief Executive Officer of AGC and Greg\nFenton was appointed as the interim Chief Executive Officer in his stead.\nMore recently, AGC is investigating if Albany graphite has the required characteristics and performance to develop\nan ideal anode material for the electric vehicle market. Test work has initially focused on the purification of Albany\nflotation concentrate to produce a consistent high-purity (>99.95%) material and ongoing. Future test work will\ninvolve the production of an anode material that will be used in lithium-ion batteries for subsequent cycle testing to\ncharacterize their performance.\nBusiness Objectives and Milestones\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Company had working capital of $4,429,949 (2023-$15,533,191) defined as current assets\nless current liabilities.\nOn January 4, 2022, the Company completed a bought-deal prospectus offering raising gross proceeds of $23,005,060\nand a concurrent non-brokered private placement raising additional gross proceeds of $10,009,022, for total gross\nproceeds of $33,014,082. The Company disclosed in its final prospectus dated December 23, 2021 (the “Prospectus”)\nthat it expected the net proceeds of the financing to be (excluding any exercise of the overallotment option) $28,813,158\nafter deducting the payment of the commission to the underwriters.\nThe following table sets out the uses that the Company planned for such proceeds over the twenty-four-month period\nfollowing the financing, as disclosed in the Prospectus, and an update on the actual expenditures using such funds:\nUse of Available Funds Expected Amount as at Approximate Actual\ndate of Prospectus Amount spent as at March\n($) 31, 2024 ($)\nGeneral and administrative costs 4,000,000 11,128,000\nAcquisition of GO supply(1) 1,300,000 2,117,000\nConstruction of ZenGUARD™ production facility(2) 1,500,000 2,791,000\nPurchase of coating equipment(2) 1,900,000 2,000,000\nConstruction of GO production plant(3) 7,500,000 Nil\nPotential strategic acquisition 1,500,000 Nil\nDevelopment of rapid detection technology(4) 2,500,000 2,248,000\nBuilding inventory of rapid detection tests 3,000,000 Nil\nResearch and development(5) 2,000,000 3,609,000\nPurchase of research and development facility(5) 2,000,000 2,065,000\nEstimated offering costs 300,000 292,000\nUnallocated funds added to working capital 1,313,158 2,563,158\nP age 19 | 42\nTotal 28,813,158 28,813,158\nNotes:\n(1) See “Current Business – ZenGUARD™ Anti-Microbial Compound”.\n(2) See “Current Business – Construction of ZenGUARD™ Industrial Scale Production and Coating Facility”.\n(3) See “Current Business – Proposed Construction of Graphene Oxide Production Facility”.\n(4) See “Business in Development – Aptamer-Based Rapid Detection Technology”.\n(5) See “Current Business – ZenGUARD™ Research and Development”.\nFrom January 4, 2022, to March 31, 2024, the Company spent approximately $26,250,000 of the $28,813,158 that\nwas expected to be available. General and administrative costs have been proportionally higher in the approximately\ntwenty-one months since the Prospectus, as the Company hired additional staff including regulatory staff, marketing\nstaff and additional management personnel. Recent general and administrative costs include certain non-recurring\nexpenses such as costs related to the Trebor receivership, costs relating to obtaining a Nasdaq listing and severance\npayments. The Company expended more than expected for the acquisition of GO, as its supplier experienced delays\nas a result of global shipping issues, and the Company decided to mitigate the supply chain risk and ordered more\nthan originally planned of GO. Under the purchase terms of physical receipt and quality control, the Company\nrecognizes inventory for the GO acquisition when inventory is shipped, and title passes and/or when credit has been\npulled from the Company’s prepaid account.\nOverall Performance\nDuring the financial year ended March 31, 2024, the Company was mainly involved in scaling the production process\nof the ZenGUARD™ antimicrobial coating formulation along with completing the engineering work for the\nindustrial production facility. The Company also continued its graphene R&D activities which led to two Patent\nCooperation Treaty patent filings and one licensed-in provisional patent application during this year. Overall, during\nthe financial year ended March 31, 2024, the Company had cash expenditures of approximately $6,836,000\nconsisting mainly of mortgage payments, research and development costs, professional and consulting fees and\ngeneral operating expenses.\nResults of Operations\nNet loss\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $2,457,639 with basic and diluted net loss per share of $0.03 for the three-month\nperiod ended March 31, 2024 (2023 – loss of $2,731,107 and $0.02). The loss for the financial year ended March 31,\n2024, was $11,703,990 with basic and diluted loss per share of $0.12 (2023 – loss of $14,414,266 and $0.14).\nRevenue\nRevenue generated from operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, was $5,757 (2023 - $9,550).\nRevenue recognized in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, was for the sale of ZenGUARD™ coated\nmasks.

In September and December 2022, the collectability of trade\nreceivables was questionable, and an allowance was provided for.\nConsulting fees were $199,142 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $124,451) and $629,655 for\nthe financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $1,036,268). The most significant component of the consulting costs\nincurred was for consultants working on regulatory and government matters.\nDirectors’ fees expense was $63,125 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $37,500) and\n$173,125 for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $140,625). This expense relates to compensation paid\nto the Company’s independent Directors.\nInsurance expense was $100,185 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $99,589) and $396,657\nfor the financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $358,415). These expenses relate to the costs required to\nadequately insure the Company’s assets, operations and directors and officers. Insurance expense increased year-\nover-year as enhanced policies were taken for additional coverages including enhanced director and officers’\ncoverage and product liability policies.\nInvestor relations and promotion expenses were $50,293 for the three-month period ended March 31,2024 (2023 -\n$73,165) and $199,131 for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $307,921). These expenses consist\nprimarily of the costs of consultants, marketing trips and other costs such as attending industry conferences. Year-\nover-year the Company reduced their spend on consultants and performed the required work internally.\nListing and filing fees were $23,534 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2032 - $50) and $180,495\nfor the financial year March 31, 2024 (2023 - $147,248). These expenses consist primarily of the costs of maintaining\nregistered status on various stock listing exchanges.\nOffice expenses were $33,584 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $58,968) and $142,822 for\nthe financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $182,039). Expenses have levelled off as the hiring of new staff has\ndeclined during fiscal 2023.\nProfessional fees were $204,250 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $559,157) and $1,380,611\nfor the financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $1,904,672). These fees consist primarily of the amounts charged\nfor services provided by the Company’s lawyers, auditors, and accountants.\nRent expense was $72,916 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $136,601) and $359,651 for\nthe financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $362,371). Additional storage was required in October 2022 to store\nthe newly acquired GO shipments and manufactured masks at an additional quarterly cost of approximately $80,000.\nDuring May 2023, the GO storage was consolidated and moved to a more economical storage facility resulting in\nsavings of approximately $40,000 per quarter.\nResearch and development expenses were $367,477 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2023 -\n$456,272) and $1,775,495 for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $1,646,066). These expenses mainly\nrelated to continued research and development activities regarding graphene use and development. Additional costs\nwere incurred year-to-date on testing for the PMRA submission for ZenGUARD™-coated HVAC filter media and\nwork towards the FDA submission for ZenGUARD™-coated masks.\nSalaries and benefits expense was $814,566 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $1,010,747)\nand $3,819,843 for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $3,598,241). These expenses relate to staffing\ncosts required to operate the business. Currently, there are 25 employees on payroll versus 29 during the same period\nof the prior year. Existing staff, not including key-management personnel, were given cost of living increases in\nAugust 2023 of approximately 3%. In November 2023 the Company dismissed 6 employees as part of the\nP age 21 | 42\nrestructuring of the Quality and Regulatory and Sales teams. This resulted in severance payments of approximately\n$159,000 with an annual savings of approximately $644,000.\nShare-based compensation costs were $200,977 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $219,525)\nand $1,786,453 for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $3,203,407). Share-based compensation was\nbased on the fair value of the options described in Note 11(c) of the audited consolidated financial statements as\ncalculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Share-based compensation is recognized over the vesting\nperiod of the underlying options. In November 2023, 400,000 options were issued to a Director and an Officer\nresulting in additional share-based compensation expense in Q3 2024. 1,100,000 options were issued to Directors\nand Officers in Q4 2022 which resulted in additional share-based compensation expense in Q1 and Q2 2023. These\noptions were fully vested by March 31, 2023, and therefore, no related expense in fiscal 2024.\nSupplies and materials expense was $130,884 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2023 – $26,235)\nand $331,080 for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $853,336). These expenses mainly related to\nsupplies and materials purchased to continue graphene development and include the cost of inventories recognized\nas an expense of $44,474 (2023 - $50,067). Operations were ramping up and various supplies were being acquired\nto assist with the R&D activities and operations in fiscal 2023, incurring more costs.\nTravel expense was $35,008 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $57,047) and $137,833 for\nthe financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $213,540). This decrease reflects less travel by staff compared to\nthe same period a year prior.\nLoss on disposal of equipment was $7,189 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 (2023 $Nil) and for the\nfinancial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023- $9,624) was $156,531. During September 2023 a piece of lab equipment\nwas deemed obsolete, and a provision was recorded to write the asset down to its recoverable value of $10,000.\nSubsequently the equipment was sold in October 2023 for $10,000.\nOther expenses excluding office and travel expenses were $77,587 for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024\n(2023 - $83,331) and $504,680 for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 (2023 - $416,289). The following table\ndetails the material components of the Company’s other expenses for the financial years ended March 31, 2024 and\n2023.\nFinancial Year Ended Financial Year Ended\nMarch 31, 2024 March 31, 2023\nAutomotive 22,540 30,339\nBank fees 4,698 4,833\nDues and subscriptions 49,590 55,799\nFreight and delivery 176,423 60,446\nMeals and entertainment 49,591 60,683\nOther expenses 41,826 41,096\nProperty taxes 31,862 31,666\nRepairs and maintenance 83,795 76,529\nTelephone 23,507 19,679\nUtilities 20,848 35,039\nTotal 504,680 416,289\nThe increase in freight and delivery was a result of repositioning and consolidating of inventory of GO in storage to\na more economical leased facility. These additional costs will be recouped with reduced rental savings. Additional\nfreight and delivery costs were incurred for the movement of international masks from Turkey to India.\nP age 22 | 42\nThe increase in repairs and maintenance is consistent with the acquisition in March 2022 of the Corporate Crt.\nLocation and the completion of the York Rd. manufacturing facility in June 2022.\nInterest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, was $59,675 (2023 - $204,185). Interest for the\nfinancial year ended March 31, 2024, was $405,483 (2023 - $510,257).\nThe Company continues to earn interest on cashable guaranteed investment certificates.

Government grants for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 was $418,213 (2023-$179,498). The\nCompany was successful in securing funding in the financial year ended March 31, 2024, of $46,322 (2023 -\n$151,440) with the National Research council for the Industrial Research Assistance Program for an HVAC project\nwhich included funding to offset both labour and third-party testing costs. The Company has also secured funding\nfor ZENArmor Pigment Synthesis, Substrate Preparation and Coating from Public Works and Government\nServices Canada in the financial year ended March 31, 2024, of $304,391(2023 - $Nil). Lastly the Company\nsecured funding from Downsview Aerospace Innovation & Research Centre (“DAIR”) Green Fund for passive\nicephobic coating testing in the financial year ended March 31, 2024 of $67,500 (2023 - $20,558).\nCash Flows\nDuring the financial year ended March 31, 2024, cash decreased overall by $6,835,897 (2023 –$16,317,683).\nOperating activities resulted in a decrease in cash of $8,051,589 (2023 –$12,956,870) due to continued spending on\nconsulting and professional fees, research and development, salaries and benefits and other expenses. Investing\nactivities resulted in an increase in cash of $1,881,162 (2023 – decrease of $2,306,576) with the partial repayment\nof $2.5M received against the loan receivable in June 2023. Prior period saw a use of cash of approximately $2.3M\nmainly for property and equipment purchases. Financing activities resulted in a decrease in cash of $665,470 (2023\n–$1,054,237) due to repayments of long-term debt, the lease liability and shares repurchased for cancellation,\npartially offset by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options.\nOn October 1, 2023, the long-term debit, as disclosed in Note 11 to the Company’s notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024, was amended with payments moving to interest only for the\nnext six months ending March 1, 2024. As a result, the loan repayment was extended by four months with a new\nmaturity date of October 1, 2025.\nMineral Exploration and Development\nAlbany Graphite Project\nThe claims comprising the Albany Graphite Project are presently held in good standing by AGC and there are\nsufficient assessment credits available to keep all the 4F claims in good standing for approximately 30 years. There\nare no environmental liability issues related to any previous exploration work on the claims. Neither the Company\nnor AGC have received from any government authority any communication or notice concerning any actual or\nalleged breach of any environmental laws, regulations, policies or permits. The claims are located in the traditional\nterritory of the CLFN. In July 2011, the Company and CLFN signed an exploration agreement (assigned to AGC as\npart of the property transfer of the Albany Graphite Project) for a mutually beneficial and co-operative relationship\nP age 23 | 42\nregarding exploration and pre-feasibility activities on the Albany Graphite Project. Under this agreement, the\nCompany committed to establishing a joint implementation committee and conveying preferential opportunities for\nemployment and contracting as well as contributing to a social fund for the benefit of CLFN children, youth and\nelders. In 2018, the parties signed a new Memorandum of Understanding under which a project partnership structure\nwill be created in support of the development of the Albany Graphite Project. Subsequent to 2015, most of the Albany\nGraphite Project work has been focused on metallurgical process development, environmental baseline studies,\nmarket studies, and research and development to determine the most attractive market opportunities for the Albany\nGraphite Project.\nAs described above under “Company Overview and Discussion of Operations – Albany Graphite Project”, the\nCompany transferred the Albany Graphite Project to AGC with the purpose of moving the Albany Graphite Project\nforward with a separate corporate entity and management team dedicated exclusively to its development. The Company\nis not dependent on materials extracted from the Albany Graphite Project for its current business plans.\nAdministration and Capitalization\nOn April 13, 2023, a total of 50,000 stock options were exercised at $1.76 per option resulting in proceeds of $88,000\nto the Company.\nOn April 14, 2023, the Company announced the grant to directors, officers, and employees of the Company of stock\noptions exercisable for an aggregate of 600,000 common shares of the Company.

In connection with Mr. Bosse’s appointment to the\nCompany’s advisory committee, the Company granted Mr. Bosse stock options to purchase 40,000 common shares\nof the Company at a price of $1.42 per common share, which shall vest on May 3, 2025, and expire on May 3,\n2027.\nOn May 21, 2024, a total of 250,000 stock options were exercised at $0.40 per option resulting in proceeds of\n$100,000 to the Company.\nOn June 14, 2024, 300,000 stock options were exercised using a “cashless” exercise method whereby 80,000 fewer\nshares were issued than options exercised as compensation for the $120,000 in cash that traditionally would have\nbeen received by the Company upon exercise.\nOn June 20, 2024, 1,935,000 stock options were issued to a number of directors, officers and employees of the\nCompany. The stock options have an exercise price of $1.52 per common share. The options granted to the\ndirectors and officers, will vest one third on the date of grant, one third on the first anniversary of the grant, and\none third on the second anniversary of the grant. For employees, the options will vest one quarter on the date of\ngrant, and one quarter on each anniversary thereafter.\nSelected Annual Information\nThe following table sets forth selected financial information with respect to the Company as at and for the end of\nthe three most recently completed financial years of the Company. The selected financial information has been\nderived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the financial years indicated.

However, the quarter ended September 30, 2023, included some one\ntime costs as additional freight was incurred to reposition and consolidate inventory of GO in storage to a more\neconomical leased facility (costing approximately $100,000) and a decision to not move forward with some research\nand development programs, resulting in payments to consultants of approximately $300,000.\nP age 26 | 42\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Company had working capital of $4,429,949 (March 31, 2023 - $15,533,191) and cash\nand cash equivalents of $3,521,420 (2023 - $10,357,317). As at March 31, 2024, the Company had not yet achieved\nprofitable operations and had an accumulated deficit of $76,621,563 and expects to incur further losses in the\ndevelopment of its business. These events or conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that casts\nsubstantial doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern\nis dependent on obtaining continued financial support, obtaining financing, or generating profitable operations in the\nfuture. Management is committed to raising additional capital to meet its obligations; however, additional debt and/or\nequity financing is subject to the global financial markets and economic conditions. Additional financing may not\nbe available on terms favourable to the Company or at all. If the Company does not receive future financing, it may\nnot be possible for the Company to advance its business plans.\nOn January 4, 2022, the Company completed a financing for aggregate gross proceeds of $33,014,082 but may\nrequire additional financing in the future. The availability of equity capital, and the price at which additional equity\ncould be issued, is dependent upon the success of the Company's activities, and upon the state of the capital markets\ngenerally.\nTransactions with Related Parties\nThe remuneration of key management personnel during the financial year ended March 31, 2024, and 2023 were as\nfollows:\na) Salaries and benefits – $1,441,458* (2023 - $1,215,625)\nb) Share-based compensation - $1,408,778 (2023 - $1,694,284)\n* Includes one-time severance payment of $120,000.\nKey management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and\ncontrolling the activities of the Company directly or indirectly, including any directors (executive and non-executive)\nof the Company.\nCurrent and Future Changes in Accounting Policy\nStatement of Compliance\nThe audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2024, including comparatives for the\nfinancial year ended March 31, 2023, have been prepared, using accounting policies in compliance with IFRS as\nissued by IASB.\nNew Standards, Interpretations and Amendments Adopted from April 1, 2023\nCertain IFRS pronouncements were issued that were mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after April\n1, 2023, or later periods. Many have been excluded as management does not expect them to have a material effect,\nhowever, management is still in the process of evaluating any potential impacts. The following amendments are\neffective for the year beginning April 1, 2023:\nIAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements (“IAS 1”) and IFRS Practice Statement 2. In February 2021, the IASB\nissued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, providing guidance to\nhelp entities meet the accounting policy disclosure requirements. The amendments aim to make accounting policy\ndisclosures more informative by replacing the requirement to disclose ‘significant accounting policies’ with ‘material\naccounting policy information’. The amendments also provide guidance under what circumstance, the accounting\npolicy information is likely to be considered material and therefore requiring disclosure. These amendments have no\nP age 27 | 42\neffect on the measurement or presentation of any items in the consolidated financial statements of the Company but\neffect the disclosure of accounting policies of the Company.\nIAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (IAS 8). The amendment to IAS 8, which\nadded the definition of accounting estimates, clarifies that the effects of a change in an input or measurement\ntechnique are changes in accounting estimates, unless resulting from the correction of prior period errors. These\namendments clarify how entities make the distinction between changes in accounting estimate, changes in accounting\npolicy and prior period errors. These amendments clarify how entities make the distinction between changes in\naccounting estimate, changes in accounting policy and prior period errors. These amendments had no effect on the\nconsolidated financial statements of the Company.\nIAS 12 - Income Taxes (\"IAS 12\"). In May 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12, which clarify whether the\ninitial recognition exemption applies to certain transactions that result in both an asset and a liability being recognised\nsimultaneously (e.g., a lease in the scope of IFRS 16). The amendments introduce an additional criterion for the\ninitial recognition exemption, whereby the exemption does not apply to the initial recognition of an asset or liability\nwhich at the time of the transaction, gives rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. These\namendments had no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nNew Standards, Interpretations and Amendments not yet Effective\nThere are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued by the\nIASB that are effective in future accounting periods that the Company has decided not to adopt early.\nThe following amendments are effective for the year beginning April 1, 2023:\nLiability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases);\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of\nFinancial Statements);\nNon-Current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial\nStatements); and\nSupplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7\nFinancial Instruments: Disclosures)\nThe following amendments are effective for the year beginning April 1, 2025:\nLack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates)\nThe Company is currently assessing the impact of these new accounting standards and amendments. The\nCompany does not expect any of the standards issued by the IASB, but are yet to be effective, to have a material\nimpact on the Company.\nCritical Judgments and estimation uncertainties\nThe areas which require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining\ncarrying values include, but are not limited to:\nInventory\nJudgement is required in determining whether net realizable value should be evaluated on a product-by-product basis\nor if products cannot be evaluated separately from other products in inventory and should be grouped with similar\nproducts.\nP age 28 | 42\nExpected credit loss allowance and provision\nThe Company determines an expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on the estimated expected\nlifetime credit loss, considering the actual credit loss in prior years and forward-looking estimates of expected\ncollections. This estimate varies depending on the nature of the trade receivables, the majority of which are associated\nwith the health sciences business; however, also includes receivables from government agencies. The loss allowance\nis reviewed on a quarterly basis and any change in estimate is accounted for prospectively. The Company also\nassesses the expected credit loss of non-trade financial assets, such as the loan receivable which is secured by property\nmortgages, to determine if an allowance is required.\nImpairment (impairment reversal) of exploration and evaluation assets\nWhile assessing whether any indications of impairment or impairment reversal exist for exploration and evaluation\nassets, consideration is given to both external and internal sources of information. Information the Company\nconsiders includes changes in the market, economic and legal environment in which the Company operates that are\nnot within its control that could affect the recoverable amount of exploration and evaluation assets. Internal sources\nof information include the manner in which exploration and evaluation assets are being used or are expected to be\nused and indications of expected economic performance of the assets. Estimates include but are not limited to\nestimates of the discounted future pre-tax cash flows expected to be derived from the Company’s mineral exploration\nproperties, costs to sell the properties and the appropriate discount rate. Reductions in metal price forecasts, increases\nin estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount of\nrecoverable mineral reserves and mineral resources and/or adverse current economics can result in a write-down of\nthe carrying amounts of the Company’s exploration and evaluation assets.\nImpairment (impairment reversal) of property and equipment\nJudgements are required to assess when internal or external indicators of impairment or impairment reversal exist,\nand impairment testing is required. Management considers internal and external sources of information including\nforecasted sales, cashflows and expected production volumes. Judgement is required to assess these internal and\nexternal factors when determining if the carrying amount of an asset is impaired, or in the case of a previously\nimpaired asset, whether the carrying amount of the asset has been restored.\nShare-based payments\nManagement determines costs for share-based payments using market-based valuation techniques. The fair value of\nthe market-based and performance-based share awards are determined at the date of grant using generally accepted\nvaluation techniques. Assumptions are made and judgment used in applying valuation techniques. These assumptions\nand judgments include estimating the future volatility of the stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee\nturnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviours and corporate performance. Such judgments\nand assumptions are inherently uncertain. Changes in these assumptions affect the fair value estimates.\nContingencies\nBy their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events transpire. The assessment of\ncontingencies inherently involves estimating the outcomes of future events. The Company has disclosed its disputes\nand was required to exercise judgement in assessing the recorded amounts.\nFinancial Instruments and Other Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other receivables, loan\nreceivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, lease liability and long-term debt. Unless otherwise noted, the\nCompany does not expect to be exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial\ninstruments. The Company estimates that the fair value of these financial instruments approximates carrying values.\nP age 29 | 42\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Company does not have any financial instruments recorded at fair value and that require\nclassification within the fair value hierarchy.\nFair value estimates are made at the balance sheet date based on relevant market information and information about\nthe financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties in significant matters of\njudgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these\nestimates.\nDisclosure of Outstanding Share Data\nThe Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares, of which 100,819,577 (2023 – 99,533,982) shares\nwere issued and outstanding as fully paid and non-assessable as at March 31, 2024.\nRefer to Note 12(c) to the consolidated financial statements for details regarding stock options issued and exercisable\nas at March 31, 2024.\nAs at the date hereof, the Company had 101,229,977 common shares issued and outstanding as fully paid and non-\nassessable, and stock options exercisable for an aggregate of 8,548,334 common shares outstanding.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe operations of the Company are speculative due to the high-risk nature of its business, which includes the\ndevelopment of certain intellectual property and the manufacturing of graphene related products, and which may include\nthe future acquisition, financing, and development of the Albany Graphite Project. These risk factors could materially\naffect the Company’s future operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those described in\nforward–looking information relating to the Company. Accordingly, any investment in securities of the Company is\nspeculative and investors should not invest in securities of the Company unless they can afford to lose their entire\ninvestment.\nThe Company assesses and attempts to minimize the effects of these risks through careful management and planning of\nits operations and hiring qualified personnel but is subject to a number of limitations in managing risk resulting from its\nearly stage of development. Below is a non-exhaustive summary of the principal risks and related uncertainties that may\nimpact the Company. Such risk factors, as well as additional risks and uncertainties set out elsewhere in the Company’s\npublicly filed documents, and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Company or that the Company\ncurrently deems immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and\nresults of operations or the trading price of the common shares.\nDuring June 2023, there was a decrease in credit risk as a result of the partial payment of $2.5M received in respect\nof the loan receivable.\nNegative Operating Cash Flow\nDuring the financial year ended March 31, 2024, the Company had negative operating cash flow because its revenues\ndid not exceed its operating expenses. In addition, as a result of the Company’s business plans for the development\nof its products, the Company expects cash flow from operations to be negative until revenues improve to offset its\noperating expenditures. The Company’s cash flow from operations may be affected in the future by expenditures\nincurred by the Company to continue to develop its products. To the extent the Company has negative cash flow in\nany future period, the Company may be required to allocate funds to fund such negative cash flow from operating\nactivities. In order to stay in business, in the absence of cash flow from operations, the Company will have to raise\nfunding through financing activities. However, there is no certainty the Company will be able to raise funds at all or\non terms acceptable to the Company in the event it needs to do so. Furthermore, additional funds raised by the\nCompany through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities would cause the Company’s current\nshareholders to experience dilution. Such securities also may grant rights, preferences or privileges senior to those\nP age 30 | 42\nof the Company’s shareholders. The Company does not have any contractual restrictions on its ability to incur debt\nand, accordingly, the Company could incur significant amounts of indebtedness to finance its operations. Any such\nindebtedness could contain restrictive covenants, which likely would restrict the Company’s operations.\nUncertainties Relating to the Company’s Business Plans\nThere is no assurance that broad successful commercial applications may be feasible for the Company. The Company\nis continuing to explore, develop, and test its current products and new products, and there can be no assurance that\nnew uses of existing products or new products will be fully developed for commercial application, that test results will\nbe successful, if completed at all, that any necessary permits or approvals required in order to market such products will\nbe obtained by the Company, or that existing technology or products will become profitable. Furthermore, there is no\nassurance that the Company will complete any acquisitions or acquire any know-how or trade secrets to carry out certain\nof its future objectives. Should the Company fail to achieve any of the foregoing, this could have a material adverse\nimpact on the business and planned business of the Company.\nThe Company’s business is in part dependent on patents, trade secret and other intellectual property laws of Canada,\nand potentially foreign jurisdictions. The Company may be unable to prevent third parties from using its intellectual\nproperty without its authorization. Some of the Company’s current or future technologies and trade secrets may not\nbe covered by any patent or patent application, and the Company’s issued and pending patents may not provide the\nCompany with any competitive advantage and could be challenged by third parties. The Company’s inability to\nsecure issuance of pending patent applications may limit its ability to protect the intellectual property rights these\npending patent applications were intended to cover. The Company’s competitors may attempt to design around its\npatents to avoid liability for infringement and, if successful, could adversely affect the Company’s market share.\nFurthermore, the expiration of the Company’s patents may lead to increased competition.\nAdditionally, the Company plans to construct facilities for some of its operations and business activities. There can\nbe no assurance that locations will be secured on terms favourable to the Company or at all, that engineering plans\nwill be completed or will be satisfactory for the intended business activities of the Company, that any required\npermitting will be obtained, that construction of such facilities will be completed, or that such facilities will ever\nbecome operational. If such facilities are not constructed, or do not become operational, or do not operate at the\ncapacity required or anticipated, there could be a material adverse effect of the Company’s planned business and\noperations.\nEconomic and Political Conditions\nWorldwide financial and economic cycles or conditions are uncertain, and recovery from a business downturn or\nrecession could be very slow and have a significant impact on the Company’s business. The Company’s business is\nsensitive to changes in economic and political conditions, including interest rates, currency issues, energy prices,\ntrade issues, international or domestic conflicts or political crises, and epidemics or pandemics.\nThe credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions due to the current conflicts in\nthe Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia. The conflicts are expected to have further global economic\nconsequences, including but not limited to the possibility of severely diminished liquidity and credit availability,\ndeclines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in inflation rates and uncertainty about\neconomic and political stability. In addition, the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia\nwhich increases the risk that Russia, as a retaliatory action, may launch cyberattacks against the United States, its\ngovernment, infrastructure and businesses. Any of the foregoing consequences, including those we cannot yet\npredict, may cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our ordinary shares to be\nadversely affected.\nP age 31 | 42\nRevenue from Graphene-related Products Sales; Long and Complex Sales Cycle\nTo date, the Company has recorded minimal revenue from its graphene enhanced products sales. There can be no\nassurance that significant losses will not occur in the near future or that the Company will be profitable in the future.\nThe Company’s operating expenses, and capital expenditures may increase in subsequent years. The Company\nexpects to continue to incur losses unless and until such time as it enters into long-term and large-volume supply\nagreements and generates sufficient revenues to fund its continuing operations.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company relies on the patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws of Canada, and foreign\njurisdictions. The Company may be unable to prevent third parties from using its intellectual property without its\nauthorization. The unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property could reduce any competitive advantage\nthat it has developed, reduce its market share or otherwise harm its business. In the event of unauthorized use of the\nCompany’s intellectual property, litigation to protect and enforce the Company’s rights could be costly, and the\nCompany may not prevail.\nSome of the Company’s current or future technologies and trade secrets may not be covered by any patent or patent\napplication, and the Company’s issued and pending patents may not provide the Company with any competitive\nadvantage and could be challenged by third parties. The Company’s inability to secure issuance of pending patent\napplications may limit its ability to protect the intellectual property rights these pending patent applications were\nintended to cover.\nThe Company’s competitors may attempt to design around its patents to avoid liability for infringement and, if\nsuccessful, could adversely affect the Company’s market share. Furthermore, the expiration of the Company’s\npatents may lead to increased competition.\nIn addition, effective patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in\nsome foreign countries. In some countries, the Company may not apply for patent or other intellectual property\nprotection. The Company also relies on unpatented technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and\nmaintain its competitive position. Although the Company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its\nemployees and third parties to protect its intellectual property, these confidentiality agreements are limited in duration,\ncould be breached and may not provide meaningful protection of its trade secrets. Adequate remedies may not be\navailable if there is an unauthorized use or disclosure of the Company’s trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. In\naddition, others may obtain knowledge about the Company’s trade secrets through independent development or by legal\nmeans. The failure to protect the Company’s processes, technology, trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing\nexpertise, methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on its business by jeopardizing critical\nintellectual property.\nWhere a product formulation or process is kept as a trade secret, third parties may independently develop or invent\nand patent products or processes identical to such trade secret products or processes. This could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s ability to make and sell products or use such processes and could potentially result\nin costly litigation in which the Company might not prevail. The Company could face intellectual property\ninfringement claims that could result in significant legal costs and damages and impede its ability to produce key\nproducts, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProduct Development and Technological Change\nThere is no assurance that broad successful commercial applications for the Company’s products may be feasible.\nMost, if not all, of the scientific and engineering data related to the Company’s products has been generated by the\nCompany’s own laboratories or laboratory environments of the Company’s partners, such as universities. There can\nbe no assurance that laboratory data translates to or is representative in commercial applications.\nP age 32 | 42\nAdditionally, the industries in which the Company seeks to operate are characterized by rapid technological change\nand frequent new product introductions. Part of the Company’s business strategy is to monitor such changes and take\nsteps to remain technologically current, but there is no assurance that such a strategy will be successful. If the\nCompany is not able to adapt to new advances in materials sciences, or if unforeseen technologies or materials\nemerge that are not compatible with the Company’s or that could replace its products, the Company’s revenues and\nbusiness would likely be adversely affected.\nMarket Development and Growth\nFailure to further develop the Company’s key markets and existing geographic markets or to successfully expand its\nbusiness in the future into new markets could have an adverse impact on sales growth and operating results. The\nCompany’s ability to further penetrate its key markets and the existing geographic markets in which it competes\nand/or aims to compete, and to successfully expand its business into other countries, is subject to numerous factors,\nmany of which are beyond its control. There can be no assurance that efforts to increase market penetration in the\nCompany’s key markets and existing geographic markets will be successful. Failure to achieve these goals may have\na material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results.\nUnpredictable Sales Cycles\nThe sales cycle for graphene products may range considerably from one to multiple years from the time a customer\nbegins testing the Company’s product until the time that they could be used in a commercial product. Timing of\nproduct introduction could vary significantly based on the target market.\nAdditionally, any demand for the Company’s products based in whole or in part on the coronavirus (COVID-19)\npandemic could materially change in the event the pandemic ends or decreases in severity. The Company has\ndemonstrated little track record of success in completing customer development projects, which makes it difficult to\nevaluate the likelihood of future success. The sales and development cycles for the Company’s products are subject\nto customer budgetary constraints, internal acceptance procedures, competitive product assessments, scientific and\ndevelopment resource allocations, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. If the Company is not able to\nsuccessfully accommodate these factors to achieve commercial success, the Company may be unable to achieve\nsufficient sales to reach profitability.\nGovernment Regulation and Import/Export Controls\nThe Company’s future operations, including development, and commencement and continuation of commercial\nproduction, require licenses, permits or other approvals from various federal, provincial, local and potentially foreign\ngovernmental authorities, and such operations are or will be governed by laws and regulations relating to production,\nexports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, waste disposal, toxic substances, prospecting,\ndevelopment, mining, land use, water use, environmental protection, land claims of indigenous people and other\nmatters. Furthermore, in certain foreign jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those\nin Canada. Certain export control laws or economic sanctions laws may include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale\nor supply of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology, including import and export permitting and\nlicensing requirements, and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit the Company’s ability to distribute its\nproducts. Changes in the Company’s products, or future changes in export and import regulations may prevent any\npotential international customers from utilizing the Company’s products globally or, in some cases, prevent the export\nor import of the Company’s products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether.\nAny change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation, or change in the countries,\ngovernments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of the Company’s\nproducts in the future by, or in the Company’s decreased ability to export or sell its products to, potential international\ncustomers. Any limitation on the Company’s ability to export or sell its products would likely adversely affect the\nCompany’s future business, results of operations, and financial results.\nP age 33 | 42\nLarge volume production of graphene requires permits and approvals from various government authorities, and is\nsubject to extensive federal, provincial, state, and local laws and regulations governing development, production,\nexports, taxes, labour standards, occupational health and safety, environment, and other matters. As graphene is a\nnew chemical substance, production and sale of graphene may be subject to specific occupational health and safety\nand environment regulatory approvals in different jurisdictions including, without limitations, under the Canadian\nEnvironmental Protection Act (Canada), the Food and Drug Act (Canada), the Toxic Substances Control Act (USA),\nthe Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (USA) and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of\nChemicals (Europe).\nHealth Canada also regulates certain markets into which the Company intends to supply products or license its\nintellectual property. There is no assurance that Health Canada or any other body will grant license for sales into markets\nit regulates. Each foreign jurisdiction for the Company’s products is regulated and no assurance exists that sales of\ngraphene-related products will be permitted. Any inability by the Company to obtain approval from Health Canada\nand/or international bodies could have a material adverse impact of the business of the Company.\nThe Company is also subject to consumer protection laws that may impact its sales and marketing efforts. These laws,\nas well as any changes in these laws, could make it more difficult for the Company to sell and market its products.\nThese laws and regulations are subject to change over time and thus the Company must continue to monitor and dedicate\nresources to ensure continued compliance. Non-compliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject\nthe Company to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and\ncriminal penalties, or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if the Company does not prevail in\nany possible civil or criminal litigation, its business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially\nadversely affected.\nAdditionally, in order for the Company to carry out its activities, any required licenses and permits must be obtained\nand kept current. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will obtain on reasonable terms or at all the\npermits and approvals, and the renewals thereof, which it may require for the conduct of its future operations or that\ncompliance with applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals will not have an adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business plans. Possible future environmental and mineral tax legislation, regulations and actions could\ncause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delay on the Company’s planned exploration and\noperations, the extent of which cannot be predicted.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions\nthereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed,\nand may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial\nactions. Parties engaged in mining operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by\nreason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable\nlaws or regulations.\nIndustry Competition\nThe Company seeks to compete with other graphene and manufacturing companies, in highly competitive markets.\nSome of the Company’s competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources and higher\nmarket share than the Company has in certain products or geographic areas. As the markets for the Company’s products\nexpand, additional competition may emerge, and competitors may commit more resources to products which directly\ncompete with the Company’s products. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete\nsuccessfully with existing competitors or be able to develop any market for its products, or that its business will not be\nadversely affected by increased competition or by new competitors.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to compete successfully with its competitors in\nacquiring such properties or prospects and any such inability could have a material adverse effect on the Company's\nbusiness and financial condition.\nP age 34 | 42\nLack of Trading Market for Graphene\nUnlike commodity minerals such as copper, gold or silver, industrial minerals such as graphene precursor graphene\nmaterials and graphite do not have a metals exchange or an open market upon which to trade and therefore prices are\nnot set in an open market or publicly traded market, and there can be no assurance that certain items can be sold or\npurchased at any time. As prices are set with private suppliers and private customers, it is difficult to predict what\nmarket prices may be at the time of any transaction. There can be no guarantees that the Company will be able to\nsell its graphene products in a profitable manner, or at all.\nShortages\nThe Company will be dependent on various supplies, equipment, parts and labour, and the services of contractors to carry\nout its business objectives. The availability and cost of such supplies, equipment, parts or labour or the services of\ncontractors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to successfully carry out its exploration and\ndevelopment activities.\nLiquidity Concerns and Future Financing\nThe Company's approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities\nwhen due. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $3,521,420 (2023 - $10,357,317) to settle current\nliabilities of $1,819,004 (2023 - $2,419,818). The Company is ultimately dependent on the commercial sales of its\nproducts. Any delay in the sales of such products could require additional financing. There can be no assurance that the\nCompany will be successful in obtaining the required financing as and when needed. Volatile markets may make it\ndifficult or impossible for the Company to obtain debt financing or equity financing on favourable terms, if at all.\nFailure to obtain additional financing on a timely basis may cause the Company to postpone or slow down its\ndevelopment plans or reduce or terminate some or all of its activities.\nReliance on Key Personnel\nThe Company’s development to date has depended, and in the future, will depend largely on the efforts of key\nmanagement and other key personnel. Loss of any of these people, particularly to competitors, could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business. Further, with respect to the future development of the Company’s projects,\nit may become necessary to attract both international and local personnel for such development. The marketplace for\nkey skilled personnel is becoming more competitive, which means the cost of hiring, training, and retaining such\npersonnel may increase. Factors outside the Company’s control, including competition for human capital and the high-\nlevel of technical expertise and experience required to execute this development will affect the Company’s ability to\nemploy the specific personnel required. The failure to retain or attract a sufficient number of key skilled personnel\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. The\nCompany has not taken out and does not intend to take out “key man insurance” in respect of any directors, officer,\nor other employees.\nQualified Employees\nRecruiting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to the Company’s success. Especially if it relates to its graphene\noperations, finding skilled scientists and a sales team familiar with the subject matter is difficult. As the Company\ngrows further, the need for skilled labour will increase. The number of persons skilled in the high-tech manufacturing\nbusiness is limited and competition for this workforce is intense. This may adversely affect the business of the\nCompany if it is unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel as and when required.\nP age 35 | 42\nCybersecurity Threats\nThe reliability and security of the Company’s information technology (“IT”) systems are important to the Company’s\nbusiness and operations. Although the Company has established and continues to enhance security controls intended to\nprotect the Company’s IT systems and infrastructure, there is no guarantee that such security measures will be effective\nin preventing unauthorized physical access or cyberattacks. A significant breach of the Company’s IT systems could,\namong other things, cause disruptions in the Company’s manufacturing operations (such as operational delays from\nproduction downtime, inability to manage the supply chain or produce products for customers, disruptions in inventory\nmanagement), lead to the loss, destruction, corruption or inappropriate use of sensitive data, including employee\ninformation or intellectual property, result in lost revenues due to theft of funds or due to a disruption of activities,\nincluding remediation costs, or from litigation, fines and liability or higher insurance premiums, the costs of\nmaintaining security and effective IT systems, which could negatively affect results of operations and the potential\nadverse impact of changing laws and regulations related to cybersecurity or result in theft of the Company’s, its\ncustomers’ or suppliers’ intellectual property or confidential information. If any of the foregoing events (or other\nevents related to cybersecurity) occurs, the Company may be subject to a number of consequences, including\nreputational damage, a diminished competitive advantage and negative impacts on future opportunities which could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company.\nShare Price Fluctuations\nThe market price of securities of many companies, particularly development stage companies, experience wide\nfluctuations in price that are not necessarily related to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects\nof such companies. There can be no assurance that fluctuations in the Company’s share price will not occur. In\nparticular, the fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of the Company’s common shares is low.\nCost Absorption and Purchase Orders\nEspecially as it relates to its activities in the transportation industry, and given the current trends in that industry, the\nCompany is under continuing pressure to absorb costs related to product design and development, engineering,\nprogram management, prototypes and validation. In particular, OEMs are requesting that suppliers pay for the above\ncosts and recover these costs through the piece price of the applicable component. Contract volumes for customer\nprograms not yet in production are based on the Company’s customers’ estimates of their own future production\nlevels. However, actual production volumes may vary significantly from these estimates due to a reduction in\nconsumer demand or new product launch delays, often without any compensation to the supplier by its OEM\ncustomer. Typical purchase orders issued by customers do not require that they purchase a minimum number of the\nCompany’s products. For programs currently under production, the Company is generally unable to request price\nchanges when volumes differ significantly from production estimates used during the quotation stage. If estimated\nproduction volumes are not achieved, the product development, design, engineering, prototype and validation costs\nincurred by the Company may not be fully recovered. Similarly, future pricing pressure or volume reductions by the\nCompany’s customers may also reduce the amount of amortized costs otherwise recoverable in the piece price of the\nCompany’s products. Either of these factors could have an adverse effect on the Company’s profitability. While it is\ngenerally the case that once the Company receives a purchase order for products of a particular vehicle program it\nwould continue to supply those products until the end of such program, customers could cease to source their\nproduction requirements from the Company for a variety of reasons, including the Company’s refusal to accept\ndemands for price reductions or other concessions.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company could seek to acquire complementary businesses, assets, technologies, services or products, at\ncompetitive prices. The Company could pursue acquisitions in those product areas which were identified as key to the\nCompany’s long-term business strategy. However, as a result of intense competition in these strategic areas, the\nCompany may not be able to acquire the targets needed to achieve its strategic objectives. The completion of such\ntransactions poses additional risks to the Company’s business.\nP age 36 | 42\nAcquisitions are subject to a range of inherent risks, including the assumption of incremental regulatory/compliance,\npricing, supply chain, commodities, labor relations, litigation, environmental, pensions, warranty, recall, IT, tax or\nother risks. Although the Company seeks to conduct appropriate levels of due diligence on acquisition targets, these\nefforts may not always prove to be sufficient in identifying all risks and liabilities related to the acquisition, including\nas a result of limited access to information; time constraints for conducting due diligence; inability to access target\ncompany facilities and/or personnel; or other limitations in the due diligence process. Additionally, the Company may\nidentify risks and liabilities that cannot be sufficiently mitigated through appropriate contractual or other protections.\nThe realization of any such risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or profitability.\nThe benefit to the Company of previous and future acquisitions is highly dependent on the Company’s ability to\nintegrate the acquired businesses and their technologies, employees and products into the Company, and the Company\nmay incur costs associated with integrating and rationalizing the facilities (some of which may need to be closed in\nthe future).\nThe Company cannot be certain that it will successfully integrate acquired businesses or that acquisitions will\nultimately benefit the Company. Any failure to successfully integrate businesses or failure of the businesses to benefit\nthe Company could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. Such transactions may\nalso result in additional dilution to the Company’s shareholders or increased debt. Such transactions may involve\npartners, and the formula for determining contractual sale provisions may be subject to a variety of factors that may\nnot be easily quantified or estimated until the time of sale (such as market conditions and determining fair market\nvalue).\nLaunch and Operational Costs\nThe launch of new business, in an existing or new facility, is a complex process, the success of which depends on a\nwide range of factors, including the production readiness of the Company and its suppliers, as well as factors related\nto tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. A failure to successfully launch material\nnew or takeover business could have an adverse effect on profitability. The Company’s manufacturing processes are\nvulnerable to operational problems that can impair its ability to manufacture its products in a timely manner, or which\nmay not be performing at expected levels of profitability. The Company’s facilities and proposed facilities contain\ncomplex and sophisticated equipment that is used in its manufacturing processes. The Company could experience\nequipment failure in the future due to wear and tear, design error or operator error, among other things, which could\nhave an adverse effect on profitability. From time to time, the Company may have some operating divisions which\nare not performing at expected levels of profitability. Significant underperformance of one or more operating\ndivisions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s profitability and operations.\nMaterial and Commodity Prices\nPrices for key raw materials and commodities used in the production of graphene-based products, as well as energy\nprices, have proven to be volatile at certain times. To the extent that the Company is unable to fully mitigate its\nexposure to price change of key raw materials and commodities, particularly through engineering products with\nreduced content, by passing price increases to customers, or otherwise, such additional costs could have a material\nadverse effect on profitability. Increased energy prices could also have an impact on production or transportation\ncosts which in turn could affect competitiveness.\nUninsured Risks\nThe Company maintains insurance to cover normal business risks. In the course of its manufacturing businesses,\ncertain risks and, in particular, unexpected or unusual catastrophic events including explosions and fire may occur.\nIt is not always possible to fully insure against such risks as a result of high premiums or other reasons. Should such\nliabilities arise, they could reduce or eliminate any future profitability and result in increasing costs and a decline in\nthe value of the common shares of the Company.\nP age 37 | 42\nLitigation\nThe Company has entered into legally binding agreements with various third parties, including supply, license,\ndistribution, non-disclosure, consulting and partnership agreements. The interpretation of the rights and obligations\nthat arise from such agreements is open to interpretation and the Company may disagree with the position taken by\nthe various other parties resulting in a dispute that could potentially initiate litigation and cause the Company to incur\nlegal costs in the future. Given the speculative and unpredictable nature of litigation, the outcome of any such disputes\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.\nCredit Risk\nAs at March 31, 2024, the Company's credit risk was primarily attributable to cash, accounts and other receivables\nand loan receivable. The Company issued a loan receivable during the year ended March 31, 2022, further increasing\nits exposure to credit risk. In June 2023, a partial payment of $2.5M was received against the loan receivable,\ndecreasing credit risk. The remaining $0.5M was due September 29, 2023, but has been subsequently extended to\nOctober 31, 2024. The Company performed an analysis of collectivity and based on the collateral against the loan,\ndetermined that no provision was required. Financial instruments included in accounts and other receivables\nconsisted of trade receivables generated through sales as well as recoverable Harmonized Sale Tax. The Company’s\ncash is held with reputable financial institutions. Management believes that the credit risk with respect to financial\ninstruments included in accounts and other receivables is remote.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company has cash and cash equivalent balances at federally regulated Canadian banks. The Company\nperiodically monitors the investments it makes, the security of such investments and is satisfied with the credit ratings\nof its banks. The Company closely monitors interest rates to determine the appropriate course of action to be taken\nby the Company.\nPrice Risk\nThe Company is exposed to price risk with respect to commodity prices. The Company closely monitors commodity\nprices to determine the appropriate course of action to be taken by the Company.\nFinancial Capability and Additional Financing\nThe Company has limited financial resources and there is no assurance that sufficient additional funding will be\navailable to enable it to fulfill its business objectives or obligations, on acceptable terms or at all. Unanticipated expenses\nand other developments could cause existing funds to be depleted sooner than expected. In the event that its existing\ncash resources are inadequate to fund operational expenses, and in order to fund the planned business objectives of the\nCompany, the Company will be required to raise additional financing from external sources, such as debt financing,\nequity financing or joint ventures. The Company's ability to raise additional equity financing may be affected by\nnumerous factors beyond the Company's control, including, but not limited to, adverse market conditions, commodity\nprice changes and an economic downturn. Failure to obtain additional funding on a timely basis could result in delay\nor indefinite postponement of the development of the Company’s business and could cause the Company to reduce or\nterminate its operations. Additional funds raised by the Company from treasury share issuances may result in significant\ndilution to existing shareholders, a depressive effect on the price of the common shares and/or a change of control.\nPermits and Government Regulation\nAlthough the Company believes it has all of the necessary permits to carry out the proposed business programs, the\noperations of the Company may require licenses and permits from time to time from various governmental authorities\nto carry out exploration and development at its projects or locations. Obtaining permits can be a complex, time-\nconsuming process. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the necessary licenses and\nP age 38 | 42\npermits on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. The costs and delays associated with obtaining permits and\ncomplying with these permits and applicable laws and regulations could stop or materially delay or restrict the\nCompany from continuing or proceeding with existing or future operations or projects. Any failure to comply with\npermits and applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in the interruption or closure of\noperations or material fines, penalties or other liabilities. In addition, the requirements applicable to sustain existing\npermits and licenses may change or become more stringent over time and there is no assurance that the Company\nwill have the resources or expertise to meet its obligations under such licenses and permits.\nFluctuating Prices\nThe profitability of the Company’s operations will be dependent upon the market price of the ZenGUARD™ masks\nand other products, their global acceptance and demand along with their regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions.\nThe level of interest rates, rate of inflation, production costs, healthcare and consumer demand, and stability of\nexchange rates can all cause significant fluctuations in revenue. Such external economic factors are in turn influenced\nby changes in international purchasing patterns, COVID-19 pandemic situation, monetary systems and political\ndevelopments.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nAGC’s Albany Graphite Project is subject to environmental laws and regulations which may materially and adversely\naffect its future operations. These laws and regulations control the exploration and development of the Albany\nGraphite Project and their effects on the environment, including air and water quality, waste handling and disposal,\nthe protection of different species of plant and animal life, and the preservation of lands. These laws and regulations\nwill require AGC to acquire permits and other authorizations for certain activities. There can be no assurance that\nAGC will be able to acquire such necessary permits or authorizations on a timely basis, if at all.\nFurther, environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement,\nincreased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects\nand a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. There is no\nassurance that future changes in environmental regulation, if any, will not adversely affect AGC’s operations.\nAGC is not currently insured against most environmental risks. Without such insurance, and if AGC becomes subject to\nenvironmental liabilities, the payment of such liabilities would reduce or eliminate its available funds or could exceed\nthe funds AGC has to pay such liabilities and result in bankruptcy.\nEconomic Dependence on Supply Agreements\nCurrently, the Company has entered into a limited number of supply or sales agreements for the sale of its products.\nUntil additional supply agreements are executed by the Company, the Company’s revenues will be completely\ndependent on such agreements. If such agreements are terminated, or if less of the Company’s product than\nanticipated is purchased pursuant to such agreements, this could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s\nbusiness, operations and results.\nLegal proceedings and regulatory actions\nOther than as set out below, the Company was not subject to any material legal proceedings during its most recently\ncompleted financial year, nor is the Company or any of its properties a party to or the subject of any such proceedings,\nand no such proceedings are known to be contemplated. The Company may be involved in routine, non-material\nlitigation arising in the ordinary course of business, from time to time.\nThere were no penalties or sanctions imposed against the Company by a court relating to provincial and territorial\nsecurities legislation or by a securities regulatory authority during its most recently completed financial year, nor\nhave there been any other penalties or sanctions imposed by a court or regulatory body against the Company, and\nP age 39 | 42\nthe Company has not entered into any settlement agreements before a court relating to provincial and territorial\nsecurities legislation or with a securities regulatory authority.\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings relating to claims involving a former director and officer of the\nCompany. The claim was commenced in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on September 26, 2018, by Aubrey\nEveleigh and Eveleigh Geological Consulting. Mr. Eveleigh seeks damages in excess of $5,000,000 in connection\nwith an employment dispute. The Company is defending the claim and the proceedings remain ongoing, though the\nCompany believes that the risk of significant loss in respect of the litigation is remote.\nThe Company subsequently commenced a claim against Mr. Eveleigh and Eveleigh Geological Consulting on March\n24, 2020, in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List), in connection with past breaches of Mr.\nEveleigh’s fiduciary duties. Mr. Eveleigh has defended the claim and the Company submits that it continues to defend\nthe action and maintains that the allegations as set out in the claim are frivolous and without merit.\nOn November 28, 2022, following the discovery process, the Company amongst other things, amended its claim to:\n(i) seek an order that Mr. Eveleigh disgorge any benefits obtained as a result of his misconduct; (ii) seek an order\ncancelling certain common shares of the Company held by Mr. Eveleigh; (iii) seek an order declaring that Mr.\nEveleigh has no entitlement to any royalty payments or success fees in connection with the Albany Graphite Project;\nand (iv) seek an order that declares a constructive trust in favour of the Company over any and all monies received,\ndirectly or indirectly. A trial date has been set now to commence on October 21, 2024.\nOn January 29, 2021, the Company was served with a statement claim issued by Graphene Composites Ltd. and is\nin the process of defending the action, which it considers frivolous and without merit.\nThe Company has considered the allegations as set out in the claim and, in light of the facts, the lack of clarity in the\nclaim, and, based on discussions with the Company’s litigation counsel, the assessment of the merits of the claim\nand the defenses available to the Company, and the Company’s conclusion is that the risk of the Company suffering\nloss in respect of the claim is remote, and therefore the Company determined the claim not to be material or\nconstituting ”significant litigation” pursuant to the policies of the TSXV. The Company continues to view this claim\nas frivolous and will continue to vigorously defend itself against these allegations.\nProposed Transactions\nAs is typical of rapidly growing companies, the Company is continually reviewing partnerships, potential merger,\nacquisition, investment and joint venture transactions and opportunities, which includes opportunities with respect\nto the Albany Graphite Project.\nAs described under “Albany Graphite Project”, the Company transferred to AGC the ownership of the Albany\nGraphite Project on May 23, 2023. The Company and AGC determined to await improved market conditions before\nproceeding with the AGC Financing and a proposed listing of AGC’s common shares on a recognized Canadian\nstock exchange.\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company has an employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer. During the financial year March 31,\n2024, the salary level for the individual pursuant to the employment agreement is $325,000 annually.\nThe Company had an employment agreement with its former Executive Chairman and Chief Operating Officer,\nwhich was terminated effective May 1, 2024, upon resignation of the officer. During the financial year March 31,\n2024, the salary level for the individual pursuant to the employment agreement is $300,000 annually.\nThe Company has an employment agreement with its Chief Financial Officer. During the financial year ended March\n31, 2024, the salary level for the individual pursuant to the employment agreement is $240,000 annually.\nP age 40 | 42\nContingent Liabilities\nIn September 2018, the Company received a statement of claim from a former employee, Aubrey Eveleigh and\nEveleigh Geological Consulting. The Company is in the process of defending the claim but views the claim as\nunmeritorious. On March 24, 2020, the Company commenced an action claim against the former employee for relief\nrelating to contracts and transactions between that employee and the Company, seeking to set aside those agreements\nand, where applicable, seeking disgorgement of unspecified amounts relating to benefits obtained under those\nagreements. Although there can be no assurance that any particular claim will be resolved in the Company’s favour,\nmanagement does not believe that the outcome of any claim or potential claims of which it is currently aware will\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company is currently undergoing a Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) audit of approximately $4 million flow-\nthrough share (“FTS”) expenditures made and renounced during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 through\nMarch 31, 2022. The CRA audit may result in amendments to the FTS expenditures renounced during the foregoing\nperiod. Such CRA amendments could result in a Company obligation to indemnify certain of the flow through\nshareholders as a result of reductions in previously flowed through expenditures. The CRA audit may also result in\na Company obligation for penalties and interest related to reductions in prior-year FTS eligible expenditures and\nflow through.\nAs the resolution of the CRA audit is subject to many uncertainties, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome\nor to estimate the Company’s potential obligation to indemnify flow through shareholders for amended flow through\nexpenditures or for related penalties and interest, if any, which may result.\nNo provision has been made for this contingent liability and the amount of any future payment, if any, will be\nrecorded in the period in which such a payment is measurable.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nA detailed summary of all of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the March 31,\n2024, audited annual consolidated financial statements.\nInternal Controls over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for the design of internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements\nin accordance with IFRS. Based on regular reviews of its internal control procedures an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was conducted as of March 31, 2024, based\non the criteria described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that\nits internal controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that financial information is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner.\nChanges to Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company is required to disclose herein any change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nthat occurred during the quarter and year ended March 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely\nto materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. During the period commencing January\n1, 2024 and ended March 31, 2024 the Company completed their remediation efforts over the purchase, ownership,\nshipment and recording of inventory by adopting and implementing a new inventory software solution including\ntraining of production and accounting staff.\nP age 41 | 42\nDisclosure Controls\nManagement is also responsible for the design and effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures to provide\nreasonable assurance that material information related to the Company is made known to the Company’s certifying\nofficers. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2024.\nP age 42 | 42"

Such forward-looking\nstatements are based on expectations, estimates and projections as at the date of this MD&A or the dates of the\ndocuments incorporated herein, as applicable. Any statements that involve discussions with respect to predictions,\nexpectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often but not\nalways using phrases such as “expects” or “does not expect”, “is expected”, “anticipates” or “does not anticipate”,\n“plans”, “budget”, “scheduled”, “forecasts”, “estimates”, “believes” or “intends”, or variations of such words and\nphrases, or stating that certain actions, events or results “may” or “could”, “would”, “should”, “might” or “will” be\ntaken, occur or be achieved) are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking statements and are\nintended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,\nstatements and information concerning: the intentions, plans and future actions of the Company; statements relating\nto the business and future activities of the Company after the date of this MD&A; market position, ability to compete\nand future financial or operating performance of the Company after the date of this MD&A; statements based on the\naudited and unaudited financial statements of the Company; anticipated developments in operations; the timing and\namount of funding required to execute the Company’s development and business plans; intellectual property\nexpenditures; capital and exploration and development expenditures; the effect on the Company of any changes to\nexisting legislation or policy; government regulation of patent law or mining operations; the length of time required\nto obtain permits, certifications and approvals; markets for the Company’s graphene related products and the ability\nto supply those markets; the success of exploration, development and mining activities; the geology of mineral\nproperties; environmental risks; the availability of labour; demand and market outlook for precious metals and the\nprices thereof; progress in development of mineral properties; estimated budgets; currency fluctuations; requirements\nfor additional capital; government regulation; limitations on insurance coverage; the timing and possible outcome of\nlitigation in future periods; the timing and possible outcome of regulatory and permitting matters; goals; strategies;\nfuture growth; planned business activities and planned future acquisitions; the adequacy of financial resources; and\nother events or conditions that may occur in the future.\nPa ge 2 | 41\nForward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of the Company’s management, as well as on assumptions,\nwhich such management believes to be reasonable based on information currently available at the time such\nstatements were made. However, by their nature, forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and involve\nknown and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance, or\nachievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied\nby the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and\nother factors that could cause actual events or results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking\nstatements, including, without limitation, those risks outlined under the heading Risk and Uncertainties in this\nMD&A.\nThe list of risk factors set out in this MD&A is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any forward-looking\nstatements of the Company. Forward-looking statements are statements about the future and are inherently uncertain.\nActual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of the matters\nset out or incorporated by reference in this MD&A generally and certain economic and business factors, some of\nwhich may be beyond the control of the Company, including, among other things, potential direct or indirect\noperational impacts resulting from infectious diseases or pandemics, from international or domestic conflicts or\npolitical crises, and other factors not currently viewed as material that could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those described in the forward-looking statements. In addition, recent events in the world economy and global\nfinancial and credit markets have resulted in high market and commodity volatility and a contraction in debt and\nequity markets, which could have a particularly significant, detrimental, and unpredictable effect on forward-looking\nstatements. The Company does not intend and does not assume any obligation, to update any forward-looking\nstatements, other than as required by applicable law. For all these reasons, the Company’s securityholders should not\nplace undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nCompany Overview and Discussion of Operations\nThe Company was incorporated in Ontario, Canada as 1774119 Ontario Limited on July 29, 2008. Pursuant to Articles\nof Amendment dated November 24, 2009, the Company changed its name to “Zenyatta Ventures Ltd.” On January 1,\n2019, the Company filed Articles of Amendment changing its name from “Zenyatta Ventures Ltd.” to “ZEN Graphene\nSolutions Ltd.” On October 27, 2021 (effective October 28, 2021), the Company filed Articles of Amendment\nchanging its name from “ZEN Graphene Solutions Ltd.” to “Zentek Ltd.” The common shares of the Company trade\non the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”) under the symbol “ZEN” and in the United States on the Nasdaq Capital\nMarket (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “ZTEK”.\nThe Company commenced operations as a junior mineral exploration company focused primarily on mineral deposits\nin Northern Ontario, Canada. The Company was actively engaged in exploring mining projects and held an interest\nin exploration licenses on properties located north of Lake Superior and west of James Bay in Northern Ontario,\nCanada in the “Arc of Fire” area. The properties, located north of Lake Superior and southwest of James Bay in\nnortheastern Ontario, Canada, were unpatented, non-contiguous, and consisted of nine claim blocks, including 234\nclaims comprised of 3,549 claim units over a total of 56,784 ha.\nWithin such claim blocks, the Company continued to hold a 100% undivided interest in Claim Block 4F, comprised\nof 521 mining claims (461 single-cell claims and 60 boundary-cell claims), which hosts an igneous-hosted, fluid-\nderived graphite deposit (the “Albany Graphite Project”). The Company did extensive work to determine potential\nuses for the graphite materials to be extracted from the Albany Graphite Project, including engaging in testing the\nproperties of the graphite material and studies on graphene materials.\nIn May 2018, the Company began to focus resources on the research and development of graphene and related\napplications, which was supported by shareholders of the Company who voted in favour of a new Board of Directors\nwith an interdisciplinary team to augment key management personnel with expertise in business, science, marketing,\nand government relations.\nPa ge 3 | 41\nIn February of 2020, the Company opened a research facility in Guelph, Ontario, to support its university and\nindustrial partners’ ongoing research and to scale-up production of graphene products. Subsequently, the COVID-\n19 pandemic halted research at the Company’s collaborators’ laboratories. The Company pivoted to focus its\nresources to develop graphene-based solutions for the fight against COVID-19.\nOn September 22, 2020, the Company announced, based on the results from a report to the Company dated\nSeptember 18, 2020, from the ImPaKT Centre at the University of Western Ontario entitled “Zen Graphene – Lab\nTest Report No. Z03-092020”, the development and successful testing of a now patented GO/silver compound that\nshowed to be 99% effective against COVID-19 virus a minimum of 35 days after application of the coating to N95\nmask material. On December 22, 2020, the Company announced the successful testing at the Department of\nMicrobiology at Mount Sinai Hospital/University Health Network of the GO/silver compound that showed to be\n99.9% effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic bacteria as well as against fungus/yeast, based\non a report to the Company dated December 18, 2020, entitled “Evaluation of Graphene Oxide with Silver Cations\n(GO-Ag+) as an Antibacterial Agent against Respiratory Pathogens”, which stated that if the compound could be\nshown to be safe and effective, it could provide a breakthrough alternative therapy for the practices of family\nmedicine, Otolaryngology, Ophthalmology and intensive care units.\nThe Company filed patent applications relating to its antimicrobial coating, and on April 13, 2021, announced the\nbrand name ZenGUARD (“ZenGUARD™”) for such coating. On September 27, 2022, the Company announced that\nits patent application directed to the ZenGUARD™ technology for use on personal protective equipment (“PPE”) and\nheating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”) had been allowed in Canada including all 54 claims made in the\napplication, and on December 6, 2022, the patent was granted with a term until September 20, 2041.\nPursuant to a License Agreement dated September 22, 2020, between the Company and the University of Guelph,\nthe Company holds the exclusive global rights to intellectual property regarding an electrochemical exfoliation\n(“ECE”) process to produce graphene oxide (“GO”).\nOn October 18, 2021, the TSXV changed the Company’s classification from a “mining issuer” to an “industrial,\ntechnology, or life sciences issuer”, which was approved by the shareholders of the Company on September 27,\n2021, in accordance with the rules and policies of the TSXV.\nOn November 29, 2021, the Company announced that it had been issued a Medical Device Establishment License\n(“MDEL”) from Health Canada (license number 18823) for the manufacture and distribution of any Class I medical\ndevices, including any such devices with or without the ZenGUARD™ coating.\nThe Company is now an intellectual property development and commercialization company focused primarily on\ncommercializing ZenGUARD™, as well as on the development of certain aptamer technologies and other\nnanomaterials-based technologies.\nOn May 23, 2023, the Company completed the transfer of the ownership of the Albany Graphite Project to a wholly\nowned subsidiary of the Company, Albany Graphite Corp. (“AGC”) pursuant to a property purchase agreement dated\nApril 24, 2023, as described in more detail under the heading “Albany Graphite Project” below. The Company does\nnot require materials extracted from the Albany Graphite Project for its current business plans, although such materials\ncould hold significant value to the Company in the future.\nOn June 12, 2023, the Company incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary named Triera Biosciences Ltd. that now owns\nthe exclusive, global licensing rights for all aptamer-based technology from the collaboration with McMaster\nUniversity. The Company and McMaster University entered into a standard license agreement dated June 11, 2021,\npursuant to which McMaster agreed to license certain intellectual property. All rights and obligations under this\nlicensing agreement were assigned to this subsidiary subsequent to incorporation.\nPa ge 4 | 41\nCurrent Business\nZenGUARD™ Antimicrobial Compound – Personal Protective Equipment\nDuring the reporting period, the Company continued to advance toward commercial production of its ZenGUARD™\nantimicrobial coating at industrial scale for application to non-woven, spunbond polypropylene material to be used\nin surgical mask manufacturing and potentially on other materials and products including HVAC filters. Based on\nreports from GAP EnviroMicrobial Services Ltd. (“GAP Labs”) dated May 3, 2021, the addition of ZenGUARD™\ncoating to surgical masks has been shown to increase the bacterial and viral filtration efficiency of masks and acts as\nan antimicrobial agent, providing increased protection when compared to similar uncoated masks.\nOn November 29, 2021, the Company announced that it had been issued a MDEL from Health Canada for the\nmanufacture and distribution of any Class I medical devices, allowing the Company to work with any manufacturers\nand distributors inside and outside of Canada to bring ZenGUARD™ surgical masks and, potentially, other PPE to\nthe Canadian market. The MDEL also allows the Company to produce and sell its own Class I medical device PPE\nproducts.\nOn April 12, 2022, the Company announced that it entered into a Reciprocal Supply Agreement dated March 31,\n2022, with EkoMed Global Inc. (“EkoMed”), a globally integrated manufacturer and distributor of PPE, pursuant to\nwhich (i) the Company will sell quantities of ZenGUARD™ coating to EkoMed for use initially on EkoMed’s\nsurgical masks, and potentially other PPE in the future, including N95 and KN95 type masks; and (ii) the Company\nwill purchase surgical masks manufactured by EkoMed, to be treated with ZenGUARD™ coating and resold by the\nCompany. The Company has provided ZenGUARD™ coated material to EkoMed for the manufacture of\napproximately 2,200,000 masks. These masks were later transferred to Arka BRENStech Pvt Ltd. in India. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, these masks had expired and were no longer available for sale but are being used as samples.\nOn October 22, 2024, the Company gave notice of termination of the Reciprocal Supply Agreement pursuant to\nSection 7.1. The Termination will be effective as of the end of this renewal term being March 31, 2025 (the\n“Termination Date”).\nOn September 7, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into a Manufacturing and Supply Agreement\nwith Viva Healthcare Packaging (Canada) Ltd. (“VMedCare”) to manufacture and sell surgical masks enhanced with\nZenGUARD™ antimicrobial coating, pursuant to which the Company would provide ZenGUARD™-coated\nspunbond material to VMedCare, which will be responsible for manufacturing and packaging ZenGUARD™\nbranded surgical masks. As at the date hereof, the Company has provided ZenGUARD™-coated material to\nVMedCare for the manufacture of approximately 6,000,000 masks. Approximately 500,000 masks were\nmanufactured in September 2023 and as at September 2024, approximately 220,000 masks are in storage at\nVMedCare.\nOn January 19, 2023, the Company announced that it had signed a Distribution Agreement with Southmedic Inc.\n(“Southmedic”) for the distribution of the Company’s patented ZenGUARD™ surgical masks. Pursuant to the\nagreement, the parties agreed that Southmedic will be the distributor of ZenGUARD™- Surgical Masks to Canadian\nhospitals, general practitioners, private surgery, long-term care and nursing home markets.\nOn March 22, 2023, the Company announced that further testing had been completed by SGS Standard Technical\nServices Co. to determine the extent of the antimicrobial properties and the time required to achieve deactivation of\nbacteria and virus on ZenGUARD™-coated mask material. Testing showed that ZenGUARD™-coated mask fabric\ndemonstrated over 99.99% antibacterial effectiveness after 1 hour. In the study, 260,000 Escherichia coli (E. coli)\nColony Forming Units (“CFU”) were reduced to under 100 CFU, while untreated control mask samples saw 120,000\nE. coli CFU grow to 2.5 million CFU in 1 hour and 1.1 billion in 8 hours. Additionally, the ZenGUARD™-coated\nmask fabric demonstrated 86.7% antiviral effectiveness after 1 hour against H1N1 and 99.7% after 8 hours.\nPa ge 5 | 41\nOn March 30, 2023, the Company announced that it had signed an agreement with Arka BRENStech Pvt Ltd\n(“BRENStech”), a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of India (India), pursuant to which\nBRENStech will act as a local partner to the Company as it seeks to develop business opportunities in India.\nBRENStech’s primary focus will be to establish sales and distribution opportunities for the Company’s masks and\nHVAC filters and potentially other products as they become available. The Company also expects that BRENStech\nwill connect the Company with university research facilities, assist with the navigation of applicable regulatory\nregimes, and source potential manufacturing partners for the Company’s business opportunities in India and globally.\nOn August 24, 2023, the Company announced that it had signed a supply agreement with Henry Schein, Inc. (“Henry\nSchein”), for a three-year term in respect to the distribution of ZenGUARD™-coated masks to dental practices in\nCanada and, subject to regulatory approval, potentially in the United States. In September 2023, Henry Schein placed\ntheir first order of masks.\nOn April 3, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive distribution agreement with Dallas,\nTexas-based Medwell Solutions LLC for its ZenGUARD™-enhanced surgical masks in the United States. The\nagreement was signed on March 13, 2024 and is for a period of two years from the date of facility establishment\nregistration and issuance of market clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration, at which point\nsales of ZenGUARD™-enhanced surgical masks can commence.\nThe Company continues to market its ZenGUARD™ product to be applied to various materials, and has targeted\nmanufacturers, including PPE manufacturers and HVAC filter material companies. Additionally in April 2024, the\nCompany filed a 510(k) application with the United States Food and Drug Administration for ZenGUARD™ Surgical\nMasks. The Company was required to complete additional safety and performance testing for the application to the\nFood and Drug Administration.\nOn July 24, 2024, the Company announced a Canada-wide sampling program for dental professionals facilitated by\nHenry Schein that will see ZenGUARD™ Antimicrobial Surgical Masks included in product shipments to Henry\nSchein customers.\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company had an inventory of approximately 220,000 masks available for sale and had\nprovided ZenGUARD™ coated material to VMedCare for the manufacture of approximately an additional 5.5\nmillion masks.\nZenGUARD™ Industrial Scale Production and Coating Facility\nThe Company has installed industrial-scale production equipment to produce the ZenGUARD™ coating\nformulation at its York Rd., Guelph, Ontario location, which location is permitted for industrial use. The Company\nhas also purchased coating equipment so the process of applying the ZenGUARD™ coating formulation to\nspunbond polypropylene for use in surgical masks, HVAC filter materials, other PPE equipment, and potentially\nother uses, can be completed by the Company on-site. The Company spent cumulatively approximately $2.8M on\nthis objective with no further additional expenditures required.\nThe effective construction completion date for the coating line was November 30, 2022. Following completion of\ninstallation, a period of training and certification began. The coating line became commercially operational in August\n2023. The Company has spent approximately $2.0M as of September 30, 2024, related to the coating line with no\nfurther additional expenditures required.\nOn May 18, 2023, the Company announced that it had been granted the ISO 13485:2016 Quality Management\nSystem certification standard by the British Standards Institution. The Company also received Medical Device Single\nAudit Program (“MDSAP”) certificate No. 777967. The ISO and MDSAP are required for Zentek’s Quality\nManagement System that is specific to medical devices (i.e. a ZenGUARD™ Surgical Masks) and does not include\nthe York Road production facility.\nPa ge 6 | 41\nProposed Construction of Graphene Oxide Production Facility\nIn addition to the construction of the ZenGUARD™ industrial scale production and coating equipment, as discussed\nabove, the Company intends to construct a plant to produce GO. The Company believes that the ability to produce\nGO itself, which is the precursor for the ZenGUARD™ compound, rather than relying on third-party suppliers of\nGO, will be economically favourable to the Company over the long term, as well as reducing supply and shipping\nrisk. The Company believes that there are three primary reasons it would benefit from an ability to produce GO\ninternally: (i) it should eliminate or significantly reduce supply chain risk; (ii) GO is not a homogeneous substance\nand by producing its own GO the Company could ensure product consistency; and (iii) the Company believes that\nthe demand for GO is increasing and that a domestic production facility could have the potential to generate product\nfor third-party users of the material\nThe Company engaged Bantrel Co. to begin engineering work on the proposed GO production plant in January 2021.\nPotential sites have been investigated. A site has not yet been selected and the permitting process has not yet begun.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has spent $35,000 in preliminary investigations relating to this project and\nexpects that approximately $7,500,000 will be required to complete construction of a GO production facility.\nThe Company estimates that fifteen to eighteen months will be required to complete the construction of a GO\nproduction plant from the time of commencement, which is a management estimate based on the expectation of\nsecuring an agreement for the purchase of technology from an existing GO producer.\nRisks include, but are not limited to, the inability to reach an acceptable agreement for the purchase of such technology,\nthe inability to adapt existing technology to Canadian regulatory requirements, scaling-up from known existing\nproduction capacities could become a requirement, and delays as a result of ongoing material and equipment supply\nshortages.\nBusiness in Development\nZenGUARD™and OtherResearch and Development\nThe Company continues to seek the most effective, cost-efficient, and scalable process to produce high-quality GO.\nThe production of GO requires a consistent source (or precursor) material for conversion to graphene, which is then\napplied to various products for enhancement. The Company believes that it has a potential competitive advantage\nwith its interest in AGC and the large and high-quality supply of source material from the Albany Graphite Project,\nif and when the Company determines it is cost effective to use such material.\nAdvanced testing on potential new processes for commercial GO production is underway. The Company also\ncontinues to work with universities on different processes that could potentially lead to a more efficient and/or lower-\ncost process for GO production.\nPa ge 7 | 41\nThe following table sets out some of the specific research and development projects that the Company is undertaking:\nInitiative R&D Major Research Site Estimated Update for the period from\nTiming and Components to Cost as at January 1, 2022, to September\nStage(1) be Funded December 30, 2024\n24, 2021(2)\nZenGUARD™- Advanced Coating of Internal Continued Approximately $170,000 has\nCoated Masks stage of ZenGUARD™ research and been spent as at September 30,\ndevelopment antimicrobial development 2024.\n(currently in compound on PPE at an\nthe market) masks estimated\n(polypropylene cost of\nfabric) for reduced $200,000.\nmicrobial\ntransmission\nthrough aerosols.\nContinued work of\noptimizing\nmaterial and\ncharacterization of\ncompound.\nZenGUARD™- Intermediate Coating of Internal Continued Approximately $Nil has been\nCoated Gloves stage of ZenGUARD™ research and spent as at September 30, 2024.\ndevelopment antimicrobial development\ncompound on PPE at an This research project is currently\ngloves (Latex, estimated designated as a lower priority\nnitrile, etc.) for cost of project by the Company, and it\nreduced microbial $150,000. does not intend to spend\ntransmission significant funds on this project in\nthrough touch to the near future.\ndevelop\nantimicrobial\ngloves.\nZenGUARD™ Advanced Coating of Internal Continued Approximately $474,800 has\nHVAC stage of ZenGUARD™ research and been spent as at September 30,\ndevelopment antimicrobial development 2024.\ncompound on at an\nHVAC filter estimated\nsystems in cost of\nbuildings, $200,000.\ntransportation,\netc., for\ndeactivation of\naerosolized viral\nparticles in\nenclosed spaces to\ndevelop pathogen\nde-activating\nHVAC filters.\nAptamer-based Intermediate McMaster Continued Approximately $2,291,000 has\nValidation of\nrapid test stage of University research and been spent as at September 30,\nefficacy of disease\ndevelopment development 2024.

The Company also applied for this patent with the\nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office and is pending examination. The patent claims the novel GO-Ag+\ncompound, that is the active ingredient for ZenGUARD™, as an effective agent against both regular and resistant\nbacteria, fungi and viruses. The patent claims liquid, powder and ointments that use GO-Ag+ as the active\ningredient.\nAptamer-Based Technology\nPursuant to a license agreement dated June 11, 2021, as amended June 23, 2023, McMaster University has granted\nto the Company, for a twenty-year term, a worldwide exclusive royalty-bearing license to use and practice all aptamer\nand DNAzyme uses, including, but not limited to, diagnostics, therapeutics, and as neutralization agents, including,\nbut not limited to SARS-CoV-2. On October 5, 2023, the Company announced the launch of a wholly owned\nsubsidiary that owns the exclusive, global licensing rights for all aptamer-based technology from the collaboration\nwith McMaster University. The technology was developed by a team of researchers under the guidance of Drs.\nYingfu Li, John Brennan and Leyla Soleymani, who have expertise in biosensing technologies and applications as\npoint of care diagnostics. This patent-pending technology was validated with clinical samples from patients recruited\nunder the supervision of two clinicians, Drs. Deborah Yamamura and Bruno Salena, who also work at McMaster\nUniversity. The project was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. This technology has shown to be\naccurate (similar to current PCR tests), is saliva-based, affordable and scalable, and provides results in under 10\nminutes. A license fee of $100,000, comprised of $50,000 cash and $50,000 in common shares of the Company\n(19,157 common shares at $2.61 per share) was paid to McMaster University as consideration. Although this\ntechnology was initially being developed specifically for COVID-19, this technology platform is designed to be able\nto detect other diseases by changing the aptamer to match new diseases.\nOn May 19, 2022, the Company announced that McMaster received two Natural Sciences and Engineering Research\nCouncil (“NSERC”) grants related to the aptamer-based rapid detection technology; the Alliance Missions Grant in\nthe amount of $1,000,000, and an Idea to Innovation (I2I) Grant in the amount of $350,000, of which the Company\nwill make a $140,000 contribution. The Company intends to continue working with Dr. Yingfu Li and the research\nteam at McMaster through in-kind contributions, using these grants towards commercializing the rapid diagnostic\nplatform. The grants will be used to advance commercialization efforts by improving the performance of aptamers,\noptimizing chip synthesis, and initiating tests for additional pathogens that can be incorporated into its pathogen\ndetection platform. The Company currently expects the cost to reach commercialization to be approximately\n$2,500,000, which includes enhancements and further development of the technology. StarFish Product Engineering\nInc. is to conduct product strategy alignment, usability analysis, device and architecture development, proof of\nconcept and prototyping, and program development.\nOn June 1, 2022, the Company announced that it had retained Halteres Associates (“Halteres”), a consultancy\nfocused on global health, diagnostics, and point-of-care testing, to assist with the commercialization of the aptamer-\nbased rapid detection technology. Market research from the Halteres group will be used to identify the most\ncommercially important pathogens for detection, which will guide the aptamer development program. Halteres\nevaluated several commercialization opportunities for the aptamer technology, including human diagnostics,\nPa ge 11 | 41\nagriculture, wastewater, veterinary, and other potential uses in healthcare and the Company is continuing to review\nthose opportunities.\nTo bring the product to market, the Company will be required to obtain authorization from Health Canada under an\ninterim order, or to obtain a Class IV Medical Device Active License (“MDAL”). The process for obtaining an\nMDAL involves completing certain testing requirements and demonstrating that the product is (i) safe, (ii) effective,\nand (iii) fit for purpose. Assuming that process is completed, the Company would then start preparing a product\ntechnical file, and then seek to complete a Health Canada Class IV application.\nOn July 20, 2023, the Company announced that the aptamer technology platform was successfully tested as a potential\nprophylactic or therapeutic for SARS-CoV-2 in pre-clinical animal models. In repeat trials, the aptamers developed by\nDr. Yingfu Li demonstrated similar efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 when benchmarked against a commercial\nmonoclonal antibody. The Company further announced the amendment of its license agreement with McMaster\nUniversity dated June 11, 2021, to broaden the scope of the worldwide exclusive license to apply to all aptamer and\nDNAzyme uses, including, but not limited to, diagnostics, therapeutics, and as neutralization agents, and not limited to\nSARS-CoV-2.\nOn July 27, 2023, the Company announced a new aptamer technology platform with McMaster University that\nsignificantly increases the binding affinity of aptamers. The increased binding affinity enhances the limits of\ndetection for aptamer-based diagnostics and could lead to the successful adaptation of these same aptamers for new\ntherapeutic and prophylactic treatments. Provisional patent applications were filed with the United States Patent and\nTrademark Office which have since resulted in the filing of two international patent applications filed with the World\nIntellectual Property Office as of September 30, 2023.\nOn October 10, 2023, the Company announced further pre-clinical testing results of the aptamer-based platform\ntechnology by the Dr. Matthew Miller Lab. Further preclinical testing was completed supporting the aptamer as a\nlead therapeutic target. An in vivo preclinical longevity of protection study was conducted to assess the safety and\nefficacy of the aptamer-based treatment over a period of 24 hours and demonstrated that the aptamer provided 24\nhours of neutralizing protection against SARS-CoV-2. A subsequent study was conducted to determine the minimal\neffective dose of the aptamer required to protect against a lethal challenge of SARS-CoV-2.\nOn November 15, 2023, the Company announced the development of a significant upgrade to its aptamer platform\nimproving the binding affinity of the universal COVID-19 aptamer from 300 to over 500 times, compared to the base\naptamer. The improved platform also solved key challenges for manufacturing and these High-Binding Affinity\n(“HBA”) aptamers are now produced with approximately a 95% yield. The Company estimates that an additional\n$1,000,000 will be required to complete the pre-clinical program for the SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic and enter clinical\ntrials.\nOn November 29, 2023, the Company announced the successful testing of its COVID-19 HBA aptamer against the\nOmicron XBB 1.5 variant (Omicron) by the Miller Lab at McMaster University in the latest pre-clinical study. The\nperformance of the COVID-19 HBA aptamer was comparable to the performance of monoclonal antibodies,\naccording to the Miller Lab, as it provided clinical protection against infection with the Omicron XBB 1.5 variant.\nThe Company will now begin to explore partnership opportunities in the pharmaceutical space as its aptamer platform\nmay offer a fast, economical, and novel approach to the development of new therapeutics for clinically relevant\nbiological markers.\nOn December 13, 2023, the Company announced the launch of Triera Biosciences Ltd. (“Triera”) as a wholly owned\nsubsidiary for its aptamer platform technology. Triera now owns the exclusive, global licensing rights for all aptamer-\nbased technologies from the collaboration with McMaster University.\nOn January 30, 2024, the Company announced the positive therapeutic results achieved by Triera Biosciences for\nC19HBA aptamer as a potential therapeutic. In the most recent trial completed in January 2024 by the Miller lab at\nMcMaster University, C19HBA was tested for its therapeutic potential. The treatment that featured C19HBA\nPa ge 12 | 41\ndemonstrated improved therapeutic benefit over no treatment of the LMA therapeutic. The full results of this\npreclinical investigation are pending publication in a peer reviewed journal.\nOn March 25, 2024, the Company announced that Triera completed testing demonstrating that its C19HBA SARS-\nCoV-2 universal aptamer built on the proprietary high-binding affinity aptamer platform has shown a promising\nsafety and toxicity profile in preclinical testing.\nOn May 6, 2024, the Company announced that Triera has prioritized the development of a prophylaxis and\ntherapeutic for highly pathogenic avian influenza. The mechanism of neutralizing the H5N1 virus is comparable to\nthe mechanism used by C19HBA against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. More specifically, the aptamer is believed to bind\nto and neutralize multiple subtypes of the HA surface protein (e.g., H1, H2, H5, etc.), preventing the virus from\nentering healthy cells and spreading infection.\nOn November 6, 2024, the Company announced that Triera had been awarded a $1.1 million Government of Canada\ncontract to test multivalent aptamer technology for the rapid drug discovery of therapeutics or prophylactics of highly\npathogenic avian influenza (“HPAI”) A(H5N1). The contract will allow Triera to prove the capability for developing\na lead candidate for HPAI A(H5N1).\nDiesel Fuel Additive\nThe Company is working to develop a stable graphene-based diesel fuel additive to improve combustion, increase\nburn rate, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to improve fuel economy of diesel fuels. Initial testing has shown an\nincrease in the performance of diesel fuel. The Company is working to improve on these early results through\noptimization work. The Company has filed a provisional patent application for its graphene-based fuel additive\ntechnology.\nPrimarily overseen by Dr. van der Kuur, the Company’s Chief Science Officer, the Company is developing a process\nto functionalize GO to produce a stable dispersion in diesel fuel. The fuel additive was tested by Conestoga College\nin a Gunt 159 single-cylinder test engine, which yielded an improvement in fuel economy of over 10% under certain\nrpm.\nThe Company completed its work with Dr. Sina Kheirkah at the University of British Columbia-Okanagan Campus\n(“UBCO”) to test GO-doped fuel as part of an NSERC alliance project for $110,500 cash contribution and a total\nbudget of $311,500 over two years to continue doped fuel research. The project focused on measuring the combustion\nof doped fuel in both droplet and spray combustion. The Company has spent approximately $98,900 on this research\nand development project.\nThe Company intends to continue to develop fuel additives internally to optimize the concentration of the additive\nand to assess the performance of the burn rate, fuel economy and emission of doped diesel fuels.\nIcephobic Coating\nThe Company is also working to develop a new, patent-pending, carbon-based, nanotechnology-enhanced coating\ndesigned to prevent or reduce ice accretion for aviation (including drone) and wind energy applications.\nDr. van der Kuur, the Company’s Chief Scientific Officer, is the primary overseer of the project, which has involved\nthe use of dispersion technology to homogeneously mix graphene-based materials in an elastomer. The Company\nhas also conducted testing at the National Research Council of Canada's (“NRC”) Altitude Icing Wind Tunnel in\nOttawa and prepared graphene-enhanced elastomer material and coated coupons for testing.\nThe Company disclosed on February 28, 2022, that the icephobic coatings were undergoing full flight trials on a\nspecially equipped research aircraft under real-world ice-forming weather conditions. On March 14, 2022, the\nCompany announced the results of three rounds of testing of its icephobic coating, including laboratory tests, real-\nPa ge 13 | 41\nworld flights and applications related to drone operations in adverse weather. In real-world testing, the Company\nreported that video footage of its icephobic coating on test pieces attached to a research aircraft undergoing flight\ntrials targeting adverse weather environments has shown positive results and demonstrated that, under significant\nicing conditions, the coatings provide an effective de-icing and anti-icing solution. Drone testing showed that\npropellers coated with the icephobic material can maintain higher thrust, when compared to a non-coated propeller,\ndue to the shedding of ice that forms on the blades that would otherwise degrade the drone’s ability to maintain stable\nflight. Accelerated ageing testing has been completed by exposing samples coated with icephobic elastomer to UV\nweathering for 1,000 hours, which approximates two years’ worth of sun damage in typical Canadian weather. These\nsamples were then tested in an icing wind tunnel under dynamic conditions and demonstrated significant retention\nof their icephobicity.\nOn August 2, 2022, the Company filed a full patent application with the World Intellectual Property Office for\nNanomaterial-Enhanced Elastomer for Passive Ice Accretion Prevention. The Company disclosed this on September\n19, 2022. The patent application has since been filed by the Company in Canada and Europe.\nOn September 19, 2022, the Company announced the successful completion of sand erosion testing at the NRC and\nrain erosion testing at the Anti-icing Materials International Laboratory in Quebec which demonstrated the icephobic\nmaterial’s durability in adverse conditions for both wind turbine and drone industries.\nOn May 4, 2023, the Company announced successful drone testing, where thrust was maintained under calibrated\nicing conditions of freezing drizzle and freezing rain in an outdoor, real-world environment. The drone with the\nCompany’s icephobic coating applied to the propeller blades hovered under the outdoor icing rig and, on all tests\nconducted, maintained flight until the end of the battery life of the drone. The same drone with uncoated propeller\nblades rapidly lost the ability to maintain flight. These tests are expected to satisfy the Transport Canada requirement\nfor anti-icing equipment. The current regulations for civilian drone operations in Canada as per Transport Canada\nregulations state that no pilot shall operate a remotely piloted aircraft system when icing conditions are observed, are\nreported to exist or are likely to be encountered along the route of flight unless the aircraft is equipped with de-icing\nor anti-icing equipment and equipment designed to detect icing.\nThe Company is currently consulting with Transport Canada to propose the Company’s passive ice accretion\ntechnology as a potential means of compliance to satisfy the requirements as well as working to find a collaborator\nthat could provide equipment designed to detect icing.\nOn May 30, 2023, the Company announced a collaboration with Pattern Energy Group LP to optimize, test and\nvalidate the Company’s icephobic coating for the wind turbine industry. The partnership is being supported\nfinancially by both the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and PRIMA Quebec –\nAdvanced Materials Moving Forward.\nThe Company continues to consider and seek partners to commercialize this technology, including drone companies\nand companies specializing in elastomer production. Because the NRC has been testing a variety of coatings, the\nCompany has been able to participate in the NRC testing process thus far at no cost to the Company. However, the\nCompany anticipates additional testing and development to cost approximately $150,000.\nFire-Retardant Additive\nThe Company announced on March 28, 2022, that it had filed a provisional patent with the United States Patent and\nTrademark Office for an innovative Graphene Oxide-Metal-Organic Framework (“GO-MOF”) compound for use in fire\nretardant products. The provisional patent application has since been filed as an international (PCT) patent application\nwith the World Intellectual Property Office on March 27, 2023. Management of the Company considers the\nmanufacturing of the GO-MOF compound as relatively easily scalable and efficient, due to the patent-pending facile\nsynthesis process. The Company believes the fire-retardant GO-MOF additive could potentially be placed in a variety of\ncoating products, such as latex, epoxies or included in polymers. When integrated into a polymer, it could potentially\ncreate a fire-resistant plastic that could be used in electric vehicles, providing a fire-resistant non-metal casing for the\nPa ge 14 | 41\nbatteries. Management currently expects that GO-MOF production could be achieved on the existing ZenGUARD™\nindustrial scale production facility with minimal additional capital expense.\nDr. van der Kuur, the Company’s Chief Scientific Officer, is the primary overseer of the project. The Company has\nspent approximately $94,400 on this research and development project, and intends to conduct further testing, which\nit currently estimates will cost approximately $45,000. In the six-month period ended September 30, 2024,\noptimizations to the formulations were performed at the Company’s lab prior to a testing program with a commercial\npartner. Testing and optimization work remains ongoing as of September 30, 2024.\nBattery Technology\nThe Company has been collaborating with Dr. Michael Pope at the University of Waterloo since 2017, developing\nbattery technology to improve anode performance. One highly studied area for lithium-ion battery development is to\nimprove the anode material. Currently, electric vehicle anodes are composed of graphite, which has a limited\ntheoretical specific capacity of ~372 mAhg-1. Silicon has attracted significant attention as a replacement material,\nmainly due to its high specific capacity of 4,200 mAhg-1, but also due to its low working potential, low price and\navailability. However, silicon has an enormous volumetric fluctuation (greater than 300% in all dimensions) when\ncharging and discharging. This feature is the root cause behind the issues of poor cycle lifetime, irreversible capacity\nloss, and destruction and reformation of the solid electrolyte interface.\nUsing silicon in the anode material, Dr. Pope has attempted to address these issues and has created a patent-pending\ngraphene-wrapped silicon anode material. On February 18, 2022, the Company announced the filing of a provisional\npatent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office relating to a graphene-wrapped silicon anode material.\nSince April, Dr. Pope’s team has optimized the anode material, which now has a specific capacity of over 1,000\nmAh/g and retains over 80% of its capacity over 320 charge-discharge cycles. The specific capacity of this material\nis a significant improvement over common graphite anodes; however, the cycle life still requires improvement\ncompared to typical electric vehicle batteries, which lose about 4% capacity over 1,000 charge-discharge cycles. The\nCompany intends to continue to work with Dr. Pope’s team to develop this technology with the goal of improving\nperformance to meet industry requirements. The Company filed a patent application under the Patent Cooperation\nTreaty on May 17, 2022.\nOn October 28, 2022, the Company announced the commencement of a four-year, $1,600,000 research project in\ncollaboration with Professors Mohini Sain and Ning Yan from the University of Toronto and Ford Powertrain\nEngineering Research and Development Centre. Funding for the project includes $1,200,000 from the Mitacs\nAccelerate program. The project seeks to assess novel concepts for the purpose of inventing multifunctional materials\nto be used in automotive battery components including anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separator. The Company will\nbe working in tandem with University of Toronto researchers providing and testing advanced graphene materials\nincluding the Company’s patent-pending anode material developed by Dr. Michael Pope. There are no material\nupdates as at September 30, 2024, on the Company’s work with the University of Toronto.\nOn August 8, 2024, the Company announced preliminary battery testing results and the commencement of a three-\nyear $441,000 project in collaboration with Professors Mohini Sain and Ning Yan from the University of Toronto.\nFunding for the project is provided by a NSERC Mission Alliance Grant. The Company announced that promising\npreliminary results have already been achieved from this research with pouch cell batteries featuring engineered\nAlbany graphite by the University of Toronto with a minimum 17% increase in capacity over batteries using\ncommercial grade anode material. The project seeks to characterize and optimize the Albany graphite by exploring\nvarious pathways to purify, increase capacity, enhance cycle life, and engineer the graphite to meet or exceed\ncommercial standards for anode material in the EV market. The results achieved are preliminary and will be verified\nthrough further testing or at an independent third-party facility.\nPa ge 15 | 41\nCorrosion Protection\nOn February 8, 2023, the Company announced the development of ZenARMOR™, a novel corrosion protection\ntechnology based on functionalized GO, for potential use in naval and marine infrastructure, bridges, buildings,\npipelines, and other industries. ZenARMOR™ could be produced in the ZenGUARD™ facility. Third-party testing\non ZenARMOR™ yielded excellent corrosion resistance with no blisters or other signs of corrosion after 1,500 hours\nof ASTM B-117 Salt Spray Test with ZenARMOR™, and ZenARMOR™ qualified for the Innovative Solutions\nCanada (“ISC”) Testing Stream – Military Call for Prototypes. The Company has filed an International (PCT) Patent\nApplication on this corrosion protection technology, as well as a trademark for ZenARMOR™.\nOn October 4, 2023, the Company announced that it had prepared and shipped the first corrosion paint samples to\nthe NRC for the first round of testing as part of the ISC - Testing Stream – Military Call for Proposals. NRC’s\nAerospace Research Centre’s Aerospace Manufacturing Technologies Centre will be testing the Company’s nano\npigment in military-grade chromate-free paints for evaluation in its first of three rounds of testing.\nOther Use-Cases for ZenGUARD™\nHVAC Filtration\nZenGUARD™ is the Company’s patented anti-microbial coating technology platform. The Company intends to\ncontinue exploring other applications and uses for its ZenGUARD™ compound, including, but not limited to, use in\nHVAC filters. On September 30, 2020, the Company first announced testing on ZenGUARD™ use for HVAC\nsystems. On January 13, 2021, the Company announced that testing by a major Canadian certification company had\nconfirmed that there was very little effect on air flow and pressure drop with a ZenGUARD™ treated filter compared\nto an untreated filter. The Company spent approximately $60,000 on testing, including preliminary testing of\nZenGUARD™-coated HVAC filter media for pressure drop, and increased challenge bacterial filtration efficiency on\nuncoated and coated MERV 8 and MERV 13 HVAC filters, overseen primarily by Dr. van der Kuur, the Company’s\nChief Scientific Officer.\nFurther to the press release dated November 30, 2021, the Company announced that it has been awarded a research\nand development test contract through the ISC Testing Stream Call for Proposals to test ZenGUARD™-coated HVAC\nfilters with interest from three different units within the NRC. The goal of the testing, conducted by CREM Co\nLaboratories with assistance from the Aerospace Research Centre, a department of the NRC was to demonstrate: (i) a\nnet reduction in the airborne viral and bacterial load with ZenGUARD™ coating applied to standard filters; (ii) no\nmodifications required to existing HVAC systems to achieve (i) above; (iii) no reduction in air flow rates, which\nmeans air exchange rates in the space will be unchanged; and (iv) no reduction in the air quality as the ZenGUARD™\ncoating was tested to ensure it does not contribute particles into the air stream.\nPhase 1 testing commenced in December 2021 after an extensive design process, calibration, and assessment of the\ntesting rig, and involved the test rig being installed inside an aerobiology chamber to push air through HVAC filter\nmaterial with test organisms to study how these live airborne organisms were reduced by the ZenGUARD™ coating.\nTesting used multiple samples with repeated tests so that each filter’s performance could be compared. It was\ndetermined that all Phase 1 targets were met including sufficient reduction in live airborne test organisms, no\nsignificant shedding of the ZenGUARD™ coating, and air flow rates that were not impacted by the coating. On April\n11, 2022, the Company announced that, after successful completion of Phase 1 testing, it will proceed to Phase 2\ntesting.\nOn December 15, 2022, the Company announced the successful completion of Phase 2 HVAC filter testing and that\nthe preliminary report from Phase 2 testing had been received. The final report was received in January 2023 and\nannounced on February 6, 2023. The report notes a significant reduction in live airborne test organisms with\nZenGUARD™ coating applied to standard HVAC filters without modification to existing HVAC systems, with no\nreduction in air flow rates or increasing energy use.\nPa ge 16 | 41\nThe testing demonstrated a reduction in live airborne bacteriophage surrogate contamination within a modular\nclassroom environment, simulating a real-world environment. The testing was performed at the NRC’s purpose-built\nbioaerosol testing facility, designed, and built specifically for testing wet aerosolized droplets, which is the primary\nmechanism for the spread of disease in an indoor setting.\nThe Company has also consulted and tested with LMS Technologies (“LMS”), a United States-based air media and\nfilter testing company providing testing services and product certification for filter manufacturers. LMS’ independent\ntesting of ZenGUARD™ coated MERV 8 filters demonstrated a significant increase in both bacterial and viral\nfiltration efficiency in line with or better than the results from the NRC. The Company currently intends to continue\nto work to optimize configurations of HVAC filter materials coated with ZenGUARD™ technology at LMS to\noptimize its product and complete all testing and documentation required for regulatory submissions in Canada and\nthe United States. The Company has engaged Intertek Group plc to conduct a review of regulatory requirements in\nother geographies of interest.\nOn September 6, 2023, the Company announced the results of a study comparing the viral filtration efficiency (“VFE”)\nof ZenGUARD™-enhanced MERV 9 filters with an uncoated MERV 9 filter. The testing was performed by LMS,\nwhich specializes in the testing and certification of filter manufacturers across the world, referring to the new American\nSociety of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (“ASHRAE”) standards for aerosolized particles\nand determining the impact of dust loading on VFE and particle filtration efficiency (“PFE”) as per ASHRAE 52.2\ntesting standards. Key findings of the study included: (i) the VFE of ZenGUARD™-enhanced filters started with a\nsignificant advantage over equivalent non-coated filters, from 23.7% to 37.7%, a 59% enhancement or a 14% net gain\noverall, and, the VFE performance consistently increased faster for the ZenGUARD™-enhanced filters compared to\nthe uncoated filters (at six months equivalent dust loading, the VFE of the ZenGUARD™-enhanced filter was 85.6%\ncompared to 55.2% for the uncoated filter, a 28.4% net gain); (ii) the pressure drop remained consistent between\nZenGUARD™-enhanced and uncoated filters as dust loading increased, indicating that ZenGUARD™ does not\nadversely affect airflow or energy efficiency of the HVAC system; and (iii) ZenGUARD™-enhanced filters operated\nsimilarly to regular MERV 9 filters when tested for PFE, effectively removing particles across all size ranges.\nOn September 11, 2023, the Company announced the results of a study conducted by ParticleOne Inc., an RWDI\nVentures company. The study evaluated the performance of ZenGUARD™-enhanced filter technology in comparison\nto a standard MERV 9 filter. The study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of filters in removing infectious\nparticles from the air and to determine the potential return on investment (“ROI”) of enhanced viral filtration from\nusing ZenGUARD™ technology. The ParticleOne model ROI analysis indicated that the ZenGUARD™- enhanced\nMERV 9 filter resulted in a substantial reduction in annual absenteeism costs ($15,016.95) compared to a regular\nMERV 9 filter in an office space of 10,000 square feet with 75 occupants.\nOn December 8, 2023, the Company announced a distribution agreement with 1Click Heating and Cooling Inc.\n(“1Click”), a private HVAC company focused on the heat pump market, for ZenGUARD™ MERV 9 filters in various\nsizes and is expected to include other ZenGUARD™-enhanced MERV-rated filters in the future. This agreement will\nsee 1Click utilize ZenGUARD™ filters for its regular customer service maintenance programs, along with making\nZenGUARD™ filters available to customers from inventory held in various provinces. The Company’s agreement\nwith 1Click has an initial term of 2 years from the date of approval from the Pesticide Management Regulatory Agency\nand may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.\nOn January 22, 2024, the Company announced the completion of a new study highlighting the potential energy,\nemission and cost savings for commercial buildings adopting ZenGUARD™-enhanced air filters. By using\nZenGUARD™-enhanced air filters to control infectious aerosols instead of increasing the percentage of outside air to\nachieve a similar risk reduction, the Company estimates that a typical office space of 10,000 square feet with 75\noccupants can reduce HVAC energy consumption by approximately 62%.\nOn May 7, 2024, the Company announced that it completed a case study based on the City of Toronto highlighting\nthe economic and environmental benefits related to using MERV 9A filters compared to using MERV 13 filters. The\nstudy quantifies cost savings and reductions in carbon emission and waste assuming the City of Toronto is currently\nPa ge 17 | 41\nusing MERV 13 filters in all its buildings and switches to MERV 9A filters. The study found potential savings of\nover $40 million stemming from significantly reduced labour costs due to filters being changed every six months\nrather than every three months, reduced expenditures on air filters from replacing filters every six months rather than\nevery three months, reduced energy requirements and costs due to improved air flow and lower waste disposal costs\nfrom fewer filters being used.\nOn May 23, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a distribution agreement, effective March 19,\n2024, with DCL Supply Ltd., a private HVAC master product distributor. The initial term of the agreement is for\none year, and it automatically renews for subsequent one-year terms unless 90 days’ notice is given by either party\nprior to renewal. The initial product to be distributed will be ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters for the HVAC\nmarket, subject to the assessment by the Health Canada Pesticide Management Regulatory Agency for registration\nunder the Pest Control Products Act, which remains ongoing. Subject to receipt of such registration, this agreement\nwould allow DCL Supply Ltd. to distribute ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters through its distributor network\nserving numerous industrial, commercial and institutional clients within and across Canada.\nZenGUARD™-Enhanced Air Filters were being assessed by the Health Canada Pest Management Regulatory Agency\n(“PMRA”) for registration under the Pest Control Products Act. On October 31, 2024, the Company announced that\nit had withdrawn its submission to PMRA for its ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters. Based on feedback received\nfrom PMRA, and continued analysis of the Canadian regulatory environment, the Company believes there are other,\nmore cost-effective, and timely pathways, to bring ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters to market in Canada. The\nCompany has been evaluating and planning for these potential alternative options in parallel with the PMRA\nassessment process over the last several months and will now shift its focus to these other pathways. The Company is\nalso currently working with consultants to file an application for ZenGUARD™-Enhanced Air Filters with the United\nStates Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe Company has spent approximately $474,800 on this project during the period January 1, 2022, to September 30,\n2024.\nTherapeutic and Pharmaceutical Applications\nThe Company was exploring the potential to use the ZenGUARD™ compound in therapeutic or pharmaceutical\napplications. In testing by Dr. Tony Mazzulli from Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, the active ingredient in\nZenGUARD™ showed low minimum inhibitory concentrations against several bacteria. On February 4, 2021, and\nMarch 2, 2021, the Company announced results of the Phase 2 cytotoxicity testing by Nucro-Technics testing laboratory\nand included cytotoxicity testing that noted no adverse effects after seven days of repeated dosing. MRSA-related skin\ninfection testing was performed on animals with inconclusive results. Cytotoxicity studies with Nucro-Technics and\npositive anecdotal results of various human skin infections including acne, warts and toenail fungal infections showed\nno adverse effects recorded during these anecdotal trials. These human anecdotal cases form part of the Company’s\npatent application filed on December 21, 2021, under the Patent Cooperation Treaty entitled “Graphene-Silver\nNanocomposites and Uses for Same as a Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial” which was published on June 30, 2022.\nThe patent has been issued in Canada.\nThe Company has spent approximately $93,500 on this project during the period January 1, 2022, to September 30,\n2024.\nOther\nThe Company is also working with a number of research institutions developing processes to synthesize graphene,\nGO and graphene quantum dots, along with other possible applications for graphene-based materials. Potential\nmarkets for graphene-based materials include composites (e.g., concrete, rubber, plastic polymers, and ceramics),\nsensors, water purification and filtration, coatings and solid-state lubricants, silicon-graphene and graphene aerogel\nanode material for next-generation batteries along with aerospace applications.\nPa ge 18 | 41\nThe Company has other research projects commenced or contemplated including applications in aluminum alloys,\ncorrosion protection, battery technology, conductive polymers, and others. The Company will report on these if and\nwhen it is appropriate to do so.\nAlbany Graphite Project\nThe Company owns 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of AGC which owns the Albany Graphite Project in\nNorthern Ontario, Canada. The unusual nature of the formation of graphite in the Albany Graphite Project and its\npotential chemical and economic significance motivated additional exploration drilling from 2011 to 2013. The\ncurrent claims require a total of $195,600 worth of assessment work per year to keep them in good standing and the\nCompany has a total of approximately $7.1M in available assessment work credits in reserve. On October 18, 2021,\nthe TSXV changed the Company’s classification from a “mining issuer” to an “industrial, technology, or life sciences\nissuer.” The change of classification was approved by the shareholders of the Company on September 27, 2021, in\naccordance with the rules and policies of the TSXV.\nOn May 19, 2023, the Company transferred to AGC the ownership of the Albany Graphite Project, including the\nmining claims and all related chattel, drill core, and applicable contracts, in consideration for the issuance by AGC\nto the Company of 59,999,900 common shares of AGC.\nOn July 26, 2023, the Company published an updated mineral resource estimate for the Albany Graphite Project,\nprepared by SLR Consulting (Canada) Ltd. (“SLR”). The updated mineral resource estimate is set out in the report\nentitled “Technical Report on the Albany Graphite Project, Ontario, Canada – Report for NI 43-101” dated July 31,\n2023 (effective date of April 30, 2023), prepared by SLR, and filed on SEDAR+ on September 1, 2023.\nMore recently, AGC is investigating if Albany graphite has the required characteristics and performance to develop\nan ideal anode material for the electric vehicle market. Test work has initially focused on the purification of Albany\nflotation concentrate to produce a consistent high-purity (>99.95%) material. On July 17, 2024, the Company\nannounced that AGC has achieved a five nines purity of 99.99915% for a graphite sample from the Albany Graphite\nProject. A sample of the homogenized bulk flotation concentrate produced by SGS Canada Inc. in the 2017 flotation\npilot plant campaign was upgraded from approximately 85% to >99% using a simple hydrometallurgical process. A\n100g sample of the >99% feed was subsequently thermally purified in a fixed-bed furnace at a temperature of 2,700C\nfor five minutes in an argon atmosphere. A 10g sample of the purified material was then shipped to Eurofins EAG\nLaboratories for a full 72 element GDMS analysis. The concentrations of all elements above the detection limits (22\nof the 72 total) were summed to yield the total concentration of the detectable impurity elements that remained in\nthe purified sample at 8.48 ppm wt. or 0.00085% wt. The boron concentration in the sample was 0.42 ppm wt.\nDuring the six-month period ended September 30, 2024, approximately $63,000 (2023 - $196,000) was spent by\nAGC on the Albany Graphite Project including professional fees and geologist wages. The same period of the prior\nyear included consulting fees paid on the NI 43-101 report of $83,000 in addition. These costs have been capitalized\nin accordance with the Company’s accounting policy on Exploration and Evaluation Assets.\nOverall Performance\nDuring the six-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company was mainly involved in scaling the production\nprocess of the ZenGUARD™ antimicrobial coating formulation along with completing the engineering work for the\nindustrial production facility. The Company also continued its graphene R&D activities which led to two Patent\nCooperation Treaty patent filings and one licensed-in provisional patent application during this year. Overall, during\nthe six-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company had cash expenditures consisting mainly of mortgage\npayments, research and development costs, professional and consulting fees and general operating expenses offset\nby the private placement funds raised of $3,069,950 netting approximately $586,000.\nPa ge 19 | 41\nResults of Operations\nNet loss\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $3,045,029 with basic and diluted net loss per share of $0.03 for the three-month\nperiod ended September 30, 2024 (2023 – loss of $3,405,251 and $0.03). The loss for the six-month period ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, was $5,598,218 with basic and diluted loss per share of $0.05 (2023 – loss of $6,561,291 and\n$0.07).\nRevenue\nRevenue generated from operations for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, was $15,692 (2023 -\n$11,641).

These expenses\nmainly related to continued research and development activities regarding graphene use and development. A request\nfor a refund of a deposit of $225,000 made in December 2021 for a research project that was cancelled in December\n2022, was recorded as a reduction in research and development expenses in Q1 2025. 2023 included additional costs\nthat were incurred on testing for the PMRA submission for ZenGUARD™-coated HVAC filter media and work\ntowards the FDA submission for ZenGUARD™-coated masks.\nSalaries and benefits expense was $768,141 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 (2023 -\n$1,105,423) and $1,624,778 for the six-month period ended September 30, 2024 (2023 - $2,019,941).

These additional costs were\nrecouped with reduced rental savings. Additional freight and delivery costs were incurred for the movement of\ninternational masks from Turkey to India during Q1 and Q2 24 as well.\nRepairs and maintenance in Q2 2025 decreased. Repairs and maintenance during the period ended June 30, 2023,\nwere required repairs at the Corporate Crt.

Such potential CRA amendments could create additional obligations for\nthe Company to indemnify certain flow-through shareholders due to reductions in previously flowed through\nexpenditures. The CRA audit may also result in additional Company obligations for penalties and interest related to\nreductions in prior-year FTS eligible expenditures.\nPa ge 22 | 41\nThe Company recognized $Nil in government grants for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 (2023-\n$154,391) and $Nil for the six-month period ended September 30, 2024 (2023 - $243,213).

Investing\nactivities resulted in a decrease in cash of $51,326 (2023 – increase of $1,985,592) with the partial repayment of\n$2.5M received against the loan receivable in June 2023. Financing activities resulted in an increase in cash of\n$2,686,588 (2023 – cash decrease 390,044) with gross proceeds from the non-brokered private placement of\n$3,069,950 offset by repayments of long-term debt, the lease liability and shares repurchased for cancellation.\nMineral Exploration and Development\nAlbany Graphite Project\nThe claims comprising the Albany Graphite Project are presently held in good standing by AGC and there are\nsufficient assessment credits available to keep all the 4F claims in good standing for approximately 30 years. There\nare no environmental liability issues related to any previous exploration work on the claims. Neither the Company\nnor AGC have received from any government authority any communication or notice concerning any actual or\nalleged breach of any environmental laws, regulations, policies or permits. The claims are located in the traditional\nterritory of the CLFN. In July 2011, the Company and CLFN signed an exploration agreement (assigned to AGC as\npart of the property transfer of the Albany Graphite Project) for a mutually beneficial and co-operative relationship\nregarding exploration and pre-feasibility activities on the Albany Graphite Project. Under this agreement, the\nCompany committed to establishing a joint implementation committee and conveying preferential opportunities for\nemployment and contracting as well as contributing to a social fund for the benefit of CLFN children, youth and\nelders. In 2018, the parties signed a new Memorandum of Understanding under which a project partnership structure\nwill be created in support of the development of the Albany Graphite Project. Subsequent to 2015, most of the Albany\nGraphite Project work has been focused on metallurgical process development, environmental baseline studies,\nmarket studies, and research and development to determine the most attractive market opportunities for the Albany\nGraphite Project.\nAs described above under “Company Overview and Discussion of Operations – Albany Graphite Project”, the\nCompany transferred the Albany Graphite Project to AGC with the purpose of moving the Albany Graphite Project\nforward with a separate corporate entity and management team dedicated exclusively to its development. The Company\nis not dependent on materials extracted from the Albany Graphite Project for its current business plans.\nAdministration and Capitalization\nEffective May 1, 2024, Dr. Dube resigned as Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and ceased to be a director\nof the Company as of September 26, 2024.\nPa ge 23 | 41\nOn May 3, 2024, Brian Bosse resigned as a director of the Company and was appointed to the Company’s advisory\nboard.

The Company continues to apply for\ndifferent grant programs, but no revenue was recognized during the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30,\n2024, increasing the loss for these quarters. The quarter ended September 30, 2024, included some one-time costs\nfor the contingent liability as a result of the Canada Revenue Agency flow-through share audit of $720,000. The\nquarter ended September 30, 2023, included some one-time costs as additional freight was incurred to reposition and\nconsolidate inventory of GO in storage to a more economical leased facility (costing approximately $100,000) and a\ndecision to not move forward with some research and development programs, resulting in payments to consultants\nof approximately $300,000.\nPa ge 25 | 41\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of $2,588,036 (March 31, 2024 - $4,429,949) and cash\nand cash equivalents of $2,935,172 (2023 - $3,521,420). As at September 30, 2024, the Company had not yet\nachieved profitable operations and had an accumulated deficit of $80,996,331 and expects to incur further losses in\nthe development of its business. These events or conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that casts\nsubstantial doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern\nis dependent on obtaining continued financial support, obtaining financing, or generating profitable operations in the\nfuture. Management is committed to raising additional capital to meet its obligations; however, additional debt and/or\nequity financing is subject to the global financial markets and economic conditions. Additional financing may not\nbe available on terms favourable to the Company or at all. If the Company does not receive future financing, it may\nnot be possible for the Company to advance its business plans.\nOn August 19, 2024, the Company completed a non-brokered private placement of units (the “Units”) through the\nissuance of 2,361,500 Units at a price of $1.30 per Unit (the “Offering”) for gross proceeds of $3,069,950. Net\nproceeds of the Offering will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes but may require additional\nfinancing in the future. The availability of equity capital, and the price at which additional equity could be issued, is\ndependent upon the success of the Company's activities, and upon the state of the capital markets generally.\nTransactions with Related Parties\nThe remuneration of key management personnel during the six-month period ended September 30, 2024, and 2023\nwere as follows:\na) Directors’ fees - $126,250 (2023 - $66,250)\nb) Salaries and benefits – $536,875 (2023 - $552,500)\nc) Share-based compensation - $826,082 (2023 - $845,324)\nKey management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and\ncontrolling the activities of the Company directly or indirectly, including any directors (executive and non-executive)\nof the Company.\nCurrent and Future Changes in Accounting Policy\nStatement of Compliance\nThe unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three-month and six-month periods ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, including comparatives for the period ended September 30, 2023, have been prepared, using\naccounting policies in compliance with IFRS as issued by IASB.\nNew Standards, Interpretations and Amendments Adopted from April 1, 2023\nCertain IFRS pronouncements were issued that were mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after April\n1, 2023, or later periods. Many have been excluded as management does not expect them to have a material effect,\nhowever, management is still in the process of evaluating any potential impacts. The following amendments are\neffective for the year beginning April 1, 2023:\nIAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements (“IAS 1”) and IFRS Practice Statement 2. In February 2021, the IASB\nissued amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, providing guidance to\nhelp entities meet the accounting policy disclosure requirements. The amendments aim to make accounting policy\ndisclosures more informative by replacing the requirement to disclose ‘significant accounting policies’ with ‘material\naccounting policy information’. The amendments also provide guidance under what circumstance, the accounting\npolicy information is likely to be considered material and therefore requiring disclosure. These amendments have no\nPa ge 26 | 41\neffect on the measurement or presentation of any items in the consolidated financial statements of the Company but\neffect the disclosure of accounting policies of the Company.\nIAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (IAS 8). The amendment to IAS 8, which\nadded the definition of accounting estimates, clarifies that the effects of a change in an input or measurement\ntechnique are changes in accounting estimates, unless resulting from the correction of prior period errors. These\namendments clarify how entities make the distinction between changes in accounting estimate, changes in accounting\npolicy and prior period errors. These amendments clarify how entities make the distinction between changes in\naccounting estimate, changes in accounting policy and prior period errors. These amendments had no effect on the\nconsolidated financial statements of the Company.\nIAS 12 - Income Taxes (\"IAS 12\"). In May 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12, which clarify whether the\ninitial recognition exemption applies to certain transactions that result in both an asset and a liability being recognised\nsimultaneously (e.g., a lease in the scope of IFRS 16). The amendments introduce an additional criterion for the\ninitial recognition exemption, whereby the exemption does not apply to the initial recognition of an asset or liability\nwhich at the time of the transaction, gives rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. These\namendments had no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\nNew Standards, Interpretations and Amendments not yet Effective\nThere are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued by the\nIASB that are effective in future accounting periods that the Company has decided not to adopt early.\nThe following amendments are effective for the year beginning April 1, 2024:\nLiability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases);\nClassification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of\nFinancial Statements);\nNon-Current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial\nStatements); and\nSupplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7\nFinancial Instruments: Disclosures).\nThe following amendments are effective for the year beginning April 1, 2025:\nLack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates)\nThe Company is currently assessing the impact of these new accounting standards and amendments. The\nCompany does not expect any of the standards issued by the IASB, but are yet to be effective, to have a material\nimpact on the Company.\nCritical Judgments and estimation uncertainties\nThe areas which require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions in determining\ncarrying values include, but are not limited to:\nInventory\nJudgement is required in determining whether net realizable value should be evaluated on a product-by-product basis\nor if products cannot be evaluated separately from other products in inventory and should be grouped with similar\nproducts.\nPa ge 27 | 41\nExpected credit loss allowance and provision\nThe Company determines an expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on the estimated expected\nlifetime credit loss, considering the actual credit loss in prior years and forward-looking estimates of expected\ncollections. This estimate varies depending on the nature of the trade receivables, the majority of which are associated\nwith the health sciences business; however, also includes receivables from government agencies. The loss allowance\nis reviewed on a quarterly basis and any change in estimate is accounted for prospectively. The Company also\nassesses the expected credit loss of non-trade financial assets, such as the loan receivable, which is secured by\nproperty mortgages, to determine if an allowance is required.\nImpairment (impairment reversal) of exploration and evaluation assets\nWhile assessing whether any indications of impairment or impairment reversal exist for exploration and evaluation\nassets, consideration is given to both external and internal sources of information. Information the Company\nconsiders includes changes in the market, economic and legal environment in which the Company operates that are\nnot within its control that could affect the recoverable amount of exploration and evaluation assets. Internal sources\nof information include the manner in which exploration and evaluation assets are being used or are expected to be\nused and indications of expected economic performance of the assets. Estimates include but are not limited to\nestimates of the discounted future pre-tax cash flows expected to be derived from the Company’s mineral exploration\nproperties, costs to sell the properties and the appropriate discount rate. Reductions in metal price forecasts, increases\nin estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount of\nrecoverable mineral reserves and mineral resources and/or adverse current economics can result in a write-down of\nthe carrying amounts of the Company’s exploration and evaluation assets.\nImpairment (impairment reversal) of property and equipment\nJudgements are required to assess when internal or external indicators of impairment or impairment reversal exist,\nand impairment testing is required. Management considers internal and external sources of information including\nforecasted sales, cashflows and expected production volumes. Judgement is required to assess these internal and\nexternal factors when determining if the carrying amount of an asset is impaired, or in the case of a previously\nimpaired asset, whether the carrying amount of the asset has been restored.\nShare-based payments\nManagement determines costs for share-based payments using market-based valuation techniques. The fair value of\nthe market-based and performance-based share awards are determined at the date of grant using generally accepted\nvaluation techniques. Assumptions are made and judgment used in applying valuation techniques. These assumptions\nand judgments include estimating the future volatility of the stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee\nturnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviours and corporate performance. Such judgments\nand assumptions are inherently uncertain. Changes in these assumptions affect the fair value estimates.\nContingencies\nBy their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events transpire. The assessment of\ncontingencies inherently involves estimating the outcomes of future events. The Company has disclosed its disputes\nand was required to exercise judgement in assessing the recorded amounts.\nFinancial Instruments and Other Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and other receivables, loan\nreceivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, lease liability and long-term debt. Unless otherwise noted, the\nCompany does not expect to be exposed to significant interest, currency or credit risks arising from these financial\ninstruments. The Company estimates that the fair value of these financial instruments approximates carrying values.\nPa ge 28 | 41\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company does not have any financial instruments recorded at fair value and that\nrequire classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nFair value estimates are made at the balance sheet date based on relevant market information and information about\nthe financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties in significant matters of\njudgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these\nestimates.\nDisclosure of Outstanding Share Data\nThe Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares, of which 104,064,815 (March 31,2024 –\n100,819,577) shares were issued and outstanding as fully paid and non-assessable as at September 30, 2024.\nRefer to Note 11(c) to the condensed interim consolidated financial statements for details regarding stock options\nissued and exercisable as at September 30, 2024.\nAs at the date hereof, the Company had 104,064,815 common shares issued and outstanding as fully paid and non-\nassessable, and stock options exercisable for an aggregate of 7,428,334 common shares outstanding.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe operations of the Company are speculative due to the high-risk nature of its business, which includes the\ndevelopment of certain intellectual property and the manufacturing of graphene related products, and which may include\nthe future acquisition, financing, and development of the Albany Graphite Project. These risk factors could materially\naffect the Company’s future operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those described in\nforward–looking information relating to the Company. Accordingly, any investment in securities of the Company is\nspeculative and investors should not invest in securities of the Company unless they can afford to lose their entire\ninvestment.\nThe Company assesses and attempts to minimize the effects of these risks through careful management and planning of\nits operations and hiring qualified personnel but is subject to a number of limitations in managing risk resulting from its\nearly stage of development. Below is a non-exhaustive summary of the principal risks and related uncertainties that may\nimpact the Company. Such risk factors, as well as additional risks and uncertainties set out elsewhere in the Company’s\npublicly filed documents, and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Company or that the Company\ncurrently deems immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and\nresults of operations or the trading price of the common shares.\nNegative Operating Cash Flow\nDuring the six-month period ended September 30, 2024, the Company had negative operating cash flow because its\nrevenues did not exceed its operating expenses. In addition, as a result of the Company’s business plans for the\ndevelopment of its products, the Company expects cash flow from operations to be negative until revenues improve\nto offset its operating expenditures. The Company’s cash flow from operations may be affected in the future by\nexpenditures incurred by the Company to continue to develop its products. To the extent the Company has negative\ncash flow in any future period, the Company may be required to allocate funds to fund such negative cash flow from\noperating activities. In order to stay in business, in the absence of cash flow from operations, the Company will have\nto raise funding through financing activities. However, there is no certainty the Company will be able to raise funds\nat all or on terms acceptable to the Company in the event it needs to do so. Furthermore, additional funds raised by\nthe Company through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities would cause the Company’s current\nshareholders to experience dilution. Such securities also may grant rights, preferences or privileges senior to those\nof the Company’s shareholders. The Company does not have any contractual restrictions on its ability to incur debt\nand, accordingly, the Company could incur significant amounts of indebtedness to finance its operations. Any such\nindebtedness could contain restrictive covenants, which likely would restrict the Company’s operations.\nPa ge 29 | 41\nUncertainties Relating to the Company’s Business Plans\nThere is no assurance that broad successful commercial applications may be feasible for the Company. The Company\nis continuing to explore, develop, and test its current products and new products, and there can be no assurance that\nnew uses of existing products or new products will be fully developed for commercial application, that test results will\nbe successful, if completed at all, that any necessary permits or approvals required in order to market such products will\nbe obtained by the Company, or that existing technology or products will become profitable. Furthermore, there is no\nassurance that the Company will complete any acquisitions or acquire any know-how or trade secrets to carry out certain\nof its future objectives. Should the Company fail to achieve any of the foregoing, this could have a material adverse\nimpact on the business and planned business of the Company.\nThe Company’s business is in part dependent on patents, trade secret and other intellectual property laws of Canada,\nand potentially foreign jurisdictions. The Company may be unable to prevent third parties from using its intellectual\nproperty without its authorization. Some of the Company’s current or future technologies and trade secrets may not\nbe covered by any patent or patent application, and the Company’s issued and pending patents may not provide the\nCompany with any competitive advantage and could be challenged by third parties. The Company’s inability to\nsecure issuance of pending patent applications may limit its ability to protect the intellectual property rights these\npending patent applications were intended to cover. The Company’s competitors may attempt to design around its\npatents to avoid liability for infringement and, if successful, could adversely affect the Company’s market share.\nFurthermore, the expiration of the Company’s patents may lead to increased competition.\nAdditionally, the Company plans to construct facilities for some of its operations and business activities. There can\nbe no assurance that locations will be secured on terms favourable to the Company or at all, that engineering plans\nwill be completed or will be satisfactory for the intended business activities of the Company, that any required\npermitting will be obtained, that construction of such facilities will be completed, or that such facilities will ever\nbecome operational. If such facilities are not constructed, or do not become operational, or do not operate at the\ncapacity required or anticipated, there could be a material adverse effect of the Company’s planned business and\noperations.\nEconomic and Political Conditions\nWorldwide financial and economic cycles or conditions are uncertain, and recovery from a business downturn or\nrecession could be very slow and have a significant impact on the Company’s business. The Company’s business is\nsensitive to changes in economic and political conditions, including interest rates, currency issues, energy prices,\ntrade issues, international or domestic conflicts or political crises, and epidemics or pandemics.\nThe credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions due to the current conflicts in\nthe Middle East and between Ukraine and Russia. The conflicts are expected to have further global economic\nconsequences, including but not limited to the possibility of severely diminished liquidity and credit availability,\ndeclines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in inflation rates and uncertainty about\neconomic and political stability. In addition, the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia\nwhich increases the risk that Russia, as a retaliatory action, may launch cyberattacks against the United States, its\ngovernment, infrastructure and businesses. Any of the foregoing consequences, including those we cannot yet\npredict, may cause our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our ordinary shares to be\nadversely affected.\nRevenue from Graphene-related Products Sales; Long and Complex Sales Cycle\nTo date, the Company has recorded minimal revenue from its graphene enhanced products sales. There can be no\nassurance that significant losses will not occur in the near future or that the Company will be profitable in the future.\nThe Company’s operating expenses, and capital expenditures may increase in subsequent years. The Company\nPa ge 30 | 41\nexpects to continue to incur losses unless and until such time as it enters into long-term and large-volume supply\nagreements and generates sufficient revenues to fund its continuing operations.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company relies on the patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws of Canada, and foreign\njurisdictions. The Company may be unable to prevent third parties from using its intellectual property without its\nauthorization. The unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property could reduce any competitive advantage\nthat it has developed, reduce its market share or otherwise harm its business. In the event of unauthorized use of the\nCompany’s intellectual property, litigation to protect and enforce the Company’s rights could be costly, and the\nCompany may not prevail.\nSome of the Company’s current or future technologies and trade secrets may not be covered by any patent or patent\napplication, and the Company’s issued and pending patents may not provide the Company with any competitive\nadvantage and could be challenged by third parties. The Company’s inability to secure issuance of pending patent\napplications may limit its ability to protect the intellectual property rights these pending patent applications were\nintended to cover.\nThe Company’s competitors may attempt to design around its patents to avoid liability for infringement and, if\nsuccessful, could adversely affect the Company’s market share. Furthermore, the expiration of the Company’s\npatents may lead to increased competition.\nIn addition, effective patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in\nsome foreign countries. In some countries, the Company may not apply for patent or other intellectual property\nprotection. The Company also relies on unpatented technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and\nmaintain its competitive position. Although the Company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its\nemployees and third parties to protect its intellectual property, these confidentiality agreements are limited in duration,\ncould be breached and may not provide meaningful protection of its trade secrets. Adequate remedies may not be\navailable if there is an unauthorized use or disclosure of the Company’s trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. In\naddition, others may obtain knowledge about the Company’s trade secrets through independent development or by legal\nmeans. The failure to protect the Company’s processes, technology, trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing\nexpertise, methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on its business by jeopardizing critical\nintellectual property.\nWhere a product formulation or process is kept as a trade secret, third parties may independently develop or invent\nand patent products or processes identical to such trade secret products or processes. This could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s ability to make and sell products or use such processes and could potentially result\nin costly litigation in which the Company might not prevail. The Company could face intellectual property\ninfringement claims that could result in significant legal costs and damages and impede its ability to produce key\nproducts, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProduct Development and Technological Change\nThere is no assurance that broad successful commercial applications for the Company’s products may be feasible.\nMost, if not all, of the scientific and engineering data related to the Company’s products has been generated by the\nCompany’s own laboratories or laboratory environments of the Company’s partners, such as universities. There can\nbe no assurance that laboratory data translates to or is representative in commercial applications.\nAdditionally, the industries in which the Company seeks to operate are characterized by rapid technological change\nand frequent new product introductions. Part of the Company’s business strategy is to monitor such changes and take\nsteps to remain technologically current, but there is no assurance that such a strategy will be successful. If the\nCompany is not able to adapt to new advances in materials sciences, or if unforeseen technologies or materials\nPa ge 31 | 41\nemerge that are not compatible with the Company’s or that could replace its products, the Company’s revenues and\nbusiness would likely be adversely affected.\nMarket Development and Growth\nFailure to further develop the Company’s key markets and existing geographic markets or to successfully expand its\nbusiness in the future into new markets could have an adverse impact on sales growth and operating results. The\nCompany’s ability to further penetrate its key markets and the existing geographic markets in which it competes\nand/or aims to compete, and to successfully expand its business into other countries, is subject to numerous factors,\nmany of which are beyond its control. There can be no assurance that efforts to increase market penetration in the\nCompany’s key markets and existing geographic markets will be successful. Failure to achieve these goals may have\na material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results.\nUnpredictable Sales Cycles\nThe sales cycle for graphene products may range considerably from one to multiple years from the time a customer\nbegins testing the Company’s product until the time that they could be used in a commercial product. Timing of\nproduct introduction could vary significantly based on the target market.\nAdditionally, any demand for the Company’s products based in whole or in part on the coronavirus (COVID-19)\npandemic could materially change in the event the pandemic ends or decreases in severity. The Company has\ndemonstrated little track record of success in completing customer development projects, which makes it difficult to\nevaluate the likelihood of future success. The sales and development cycles for the Company’s products are subject\nto customer budgetary constraints, internal acceptance procedures, competitive product assessments, scientific and\ndevelopment resource allocations, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. If the Company is not able to\nsuccessfully accommodate these factors to achieve commercial success, the Company may be unable to achieve\nsufficient sales to reach profitability.\nGovernment Regulation and Import/Export Controls\nThe Company’s future operations, including development, and commencement and continuation of commercial\nproduction, require licenses, permits or other approvals from various federal, provincial, local and potentially foreign\ngovernmental authorities, and such operations are or will be governed by laws and regulations relating to production,\nexports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health and safety, waste disposal, toxic substances, prospecting,\ndevelopment, mining, land use, water use, environmental protection, land claims of indigenous people and other\nmatters. Furthermore, in certain foreign jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those\nin Canada. Certain export control laws or economic sanctions laws may include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale\nor supply of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology, including import and export permitting and\nlicensing requirements, and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit the Company’s ability to distribute its\nproducts. Changes in the Company’s products, or future changes in export and import regulations may prevent any\npotential international customers from utilizing the Company’s products globally or, in some cases, prevent the export\nor import of the Company’s products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether.\nAny change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation, or change in the countries,\ngovernments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of the Company’s\nproducts in the future by, or in the Company’s decreased ability to export or sell its products to, potential international\ncustomers. Any limitation on the Company’s ability to export or sell its products would likely adversely affect the\nCompany’s future business, results of operations, and financial results.\nLarge volume production of graphene requires permits and approvals from various government authorities, and is\nsubject to extensive federal, provincial, state, and local laws and regulations governing development, production,\nexports, taxes, labour standards, occupational health and safety, environment, and other matters. As graphene is a\nPa ge 32 | 41\nnew chemical substance, production and sale of graphene may be subject to specific occupational health and safety\nand environment regulatory approvals in different jurisdictions including, without limitations, under the Canadian\nEnvironmental Protection Act (Canada), the Food and Drug Act (Canada), the Toxic Substances Control Act (USA),\nthe Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (USA) and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of\nChemicals (Europe).\nHealth Canada also regulates certain markets into which the Company intends to supply products or license its\nintellectual property. There is no assurance that Health Canada or any other body will grant license for sales into markets\nit regulates. Each foreign jurisdiction for the Company’s products is regulated and no assurance exists that sales of\ngraphene-related products will be permitted. Any inability by the Company to obtain approval from Health Canada\nand/or international bodies could have a material adverse impact of the business of the Company.\nThe Company is also subject to consumer protection laws that may impact its sales and marketing efforts. These laws,\nas well as any changes in these laws, could make it more difficult for the Company to sell and market its products.\nThese laws and regulations are subject to change over time and thus the Company must continue to monitor and dedicate\nresources to ensure continued compliance. Non-compliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject\nthe Company to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and\ncriminal penalties, or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if the Company does not prevail in\nany possible civil or criminal litigation, its business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially\nadversely affected.\nAdditionally, in order for the Company to carry out its activities, any required licenses and permits must be obtained\nand kept current. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will obtain on reasonable terms or at all the\npermits and approvals, and the renewals thereof, which it may require for the conduct of its future operations or that\ncompliance with applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals will not have an adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business plans. Possible future environmental and mineral tax legislation, regulations and actions could\ncause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions and delay on the Company’s planned exploration and\noperations, the extent of which cannot be predicted.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions\nthereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed,\nand may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial\nactions. Parties engaged in mining operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by\nreason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable\nlaws or regulations.\nIndustry Competition\nThe Company seeks to compete with other graphene and manufacturing companies, in highly competitive markets.\nSome of the Company’s competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources and higher\nmarket share than the Company has in certain products or geographic areas. As the markets for the Company’s products\nexpand, additional competition may emerge, and competitors may commit more resources to products which directly\ncompete with the Company’s products. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete\nsuccessfully with existing competitors or be able to develop any market for its products, or that its business will not be\nadversely affected by increased competition or by new competitors.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to compete successfully with its competitors in\nacquiring such properties or prospects and any such inability could have a material adverse effect on the Company's\nbusiness and financial condition.\nPa ge 33 | 41\nLack of Trading Market for Graphene\nUnlike commodity minerals such as copper, gold or silver, industrial minerals such as graphene precursor graphene\nmaterials and graphite do not have a metals exchange or an open market upon which to trade and therefore prices are\nnot set in an open market or publicly traded market, and there can be no assurance that certain items can be sold or\npurchased at any time. As prices are set with private suppliers and private customers, it is difficult to predict what\nmarket prices may be at the time of any transaction. There can be no guarantees that the Company will be able to\nsell its graphene products in a profitable manner, or at all.\nShortages\nThe Company will be dependent on various supplies, equipment, parts and labour, and the services of contractors to carry\nout its business objectives. The availability and cost of such supplies, equipment, parts or labour or the services of\ncontractors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to successfully carry out its exploration and\ndevelopment activities.\nLiquidity Concerns and Future Financing\nThe Company's approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities\nwhen due. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a cash balance of $2,935,172 (2024 - $3,521,420) to settle\ncurrent liabilities of $2,435,976 (2024 - $1,819,004). On August 19, 2024, the Company closed a Non-Brokered Private\nPlacement of units (the “Units”) through the issuance of 2,361,500 Units at a price of $1.30 per Unit for gross proceeds\nof $3,069,950. Net proceeds of the Offering will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. However,\nthe Company is ultimately dependent on the commercial sales of its products. Any delay in the sales of such products\ncould require additional financing. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining the\nrequired financing as and when needed. Volatile markets may make it difficult or impossible for the Company to obtain\ndebt financing or equity financing on favourable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain additional financing on a timely basis\nmay cause the Company to postpone or slow down its development plans or reduce or terminate some or all of its\nactivities.\nReliance on Key Personnel\nThe Company’s development to date has depended, and in the future, will depend largely on the efforts of key\nmanagement and other key personnel. Loss of any of these people, particularly to competitors, could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company’s business. Further, with respect to the future development of the Company’s projects,\nit may become necessary to attract both international and local personnel for such development. The marketplace for\nkey skilled personnel is becoming more competitive, which means the cost of hiring, training, and retaining such\npersonnel may increase. Factors outside the Company’s control, including competition for human capital and the high-\nlevel of technical expertise and experience required to execute this development will affect the Company’s ability to\nemploy the specific personnel required. The failure to retain or attract a sufficient number of key skilled personnel\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. The\nCompany has not taken out and does not intend to take out “key man insurance” in respect of any directors, officer,\nor other employees.\nQualified Employees\nRecruiting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to the Company’s success. Especially if it relates to its graphene\noperations, finding skilled scientists and a sales team familiar with the subject matter is difficult. As the Company\ngrows further, the need for skilled labour will increase. The number of persons skilled in the high-tech manufacturing\nbusiness is limited and competition for this workforce is intense. This may adversely affect the business of the\nCompany if it is unable to recruit and retain qualified personnel as and when required.\nPa ge 34 | 41\nCybersecurity Threats\nThe reliability and security of the Company’s information technology (“IT”) systems are important to the Company’s\nbusiness and operations. Although the Company has established and continues to enhance security controls intended to\nprotect the Company’s IT systems and infrastructure, there is no guarantee that such security measures will be effective\nin preventing unauthorized physical access or cyberattacks. A significant breach of the Company’s IT systems could,\namong other things, cause disruptions in the Company’s manufacturing operations (such as operational delays from\nproduction downtime, inability to manage the supply chain or produce products for customers, disruptions in inventory\nmanagement), lead to the loss, destruction, corruption or inappropriate use of sensitive data, including employee\ninformation or intellectual property, result in lost revenues due to theft of funds or due to a disruption of activities,\nincluding remediation costs, or from litigation, fines and liability or higher insurance premiums, the costs of\nmaintaining security and effective IT systems, which could negatively affect results of operations and the potential\nadverse impact of changing laws and regulations related to cybersecurity or result in theft of the Company’s, its\ncustomers’ or suppliers’ intellectual property or confidential information. If any of the foregoing events (or other\nevents related to cybersecurity) occurs, the Company may be subject to a number of consequences, including\nreputational damage, a diminished competitive advantage and negative impacts on future opportunities which could\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company.\nShare Price Fluctuations\nThe market price of securities of many companies, particularly development stage companies, experience wide\nfluctuations in price that are not necessarily related to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects\nof such companies. There can be no assurance that fluctuations in the Company’s share price will not occur. In\nparticular, the fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of the Company’s common shares is low.\nCost Absorption and Purchase Orders\nEspecially as it relates to its activities in the transportation industry, and given the current trends in that industry, the\nCompany is under continuing pressure to absorb costs related to product design and development, engineering,\nprogram management, prototypes and validation. In particular, OEMs are requesting that suppliers pay for the above\ncosts and recover these costs through the piece price of the applicable component. Contract volumes for customer\nprograms not yet in production are based on the Company’s customers’ estimates of their own future production\nlevels. However, actual production volumes may vary significantly from these estimates due to a reduction in\nconsumer demand or new product launch delays, often without any compensation to the supplier by its OEM\ncustomer. Typical purchase orders issued by customers do not require that they purchase a minimum number of the\nCompany’s products. For programs currently under production, the Company is generally unable to request price\nchanges when volumes differ significantly from production estimates used during the quotation stage. If estimated\nproduction volumes are not achieved, the product development, design, engineering, prototype and validation costs\nincurred by the Company may not be fully recovered. Similarly, future pricing pressure or volume reductions by the\nCompany’s customers may also reduce the amount of amortized costs otherwise recoverable in the piece price of the\nCompany’s products. Either of these factors could have an adverse effect on the Company’s profitability. While it is\ngenerally the case that once the Company receives a purchase order for products of a particular vehicle program it\nwould continue to supply those products until the end of such program, customers could cease to source their\nproduction requirements from the Company for a variety of reasons, including the Company’s refusal to accept\ndemands for price reductions or other concessions.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company could seek to acquire complementary businesses, assets, technologies, services or products, at\ncompetitive prices. The Company could pursue acquisitions in those product areas which were identified as key to the\nCompany’s long-term business strategy. However, as a result of intense competition in these strategic areas, the\nCompany may not be able to acquire the targets needed to achieve its strategic objectives. The completion of such\ntransactions poses additional risks to the Company’s business.\nPa ge 35 | 41\nAcquisitions are subject to a range of inherent risks, including the assumption of incremental regulatory/compliance,\npricing, supply chain, commodities, labor relations, litigation, environmental, pensions, warranty, recall, IT, tax or\nother risks. Although the Company seeks to conduct appropriate levels of due diligence on acquisition targets, these\nefforts may not always prove to be sufficient in identifying all risks and liabilities related to the acquisition, including\nas a result of limited access to information; time constraints for conducting due diligence; inability to access target\ncompany facilities and/or personnel; or other limitations in the due diligence process. Additionally, the Company may\nidentify risks and liabilities that cannot be sufficiently mitigated through appropriate contractual or other protections.\nThe realization of any such risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or profitability.\nThe benefit to the Company of previous and future acquisitions is highly dependent on the Company’s ability to\nintegrate the acquired businesses and their technologies, employees and products into the Company, and the Company\nmay incur costs associated with integrating and rationalizing the facilities (some of which may need to be closed in\nthe future).\nThe Company cannot be certain that it will successfully integrate acquired businesses or that acquisitions will\nultimately benefit the Company. Any failure to successfully integrate businesses or failure of the businesses to benefit\nthe Company could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations. Such transactions may\nalso result in additional dilution to the Company’s shareholders or increased debt. Such transactions may involve\npartners, and the formula for determining contractual sale provisions may be subject to a variety of factors that may\nnot be easily quantified or estimated until the time of sale (such as market conditions and determining fair market\nvalue).\nLaunch and Operational Costs\nThe launch of new business, in an existing or new facility, is a complex process, the success of which depends on a\nwide range of factors, including the production readiness of the Company and its suppliers, as well as factors related\nto tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. A failure to successfully launch material\nnew or takeover business could have an adverse effect on profitability. The Company’s manufacturing processes are\nvulnerable to operational problems that can impair its ability to manufacture its products in a timely manner, or which\nmay not be performing at expected levels of profitability. The Company’s facilities and proposed facilities contain\ncomplex and sophisticated equipment that is used in its manufacturing processes. The Company could experience\nequipment failure in the future due to wear and tear, design error or operator error, among other things, which could\nhave an adverse effect on profitability. From time to time, the Company may have some operating divisions which\nare not performing at expected levels of profitability. Significant underperformance of one or more operating\ndivisions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s profitability and operations.\nMaterial and Commodity Prices\nPrices for key raw materials and commodities used in the production of graphene-based products, as well as energy\nprices, have proven to be volatile at certain times. To the extent that the Company is unable to fully mitigate its\nexposure to price change of key raw materials and commodities, particularly through engineering products with\nreduced content, by passing price increases to customers, or otherwise, such additional costs could have a material\nadverse effect on profitability. Increased energy prices could also have an impact on production or transportation\ncosts which in turn could affect competitiveness.\nUninsured Risks\nThe Company maintains insurance to cover normal business risks. In the course of its manufacturing businesses,\ncertain risks and, in particular, unexpected or unusual catastrophic events including explosions and fire may occur.\nIt is not always possible to fully insure against such risks as a result of high premiums or other reasons. Should such\nliabilities arise, they could reduce or eliminate any future profitability and result in increasing costs and a decline in\nthe value of the common shares of the Company.\nPa ge 36 | 41\nLitigation\nThe Company has entered into legally binding agreements with various third parties, including supply, license,\ndistribution, non-disclosure, consulting and partnership agreements. The interpretation of the rights and obligations\nthat arise from such agreements is open to interpretation and the Company may disagree with the position taken by\nthe various other parties resulting in a dispute that could potentially initiate litigation and cause the Company to incur\nlegal costs in the future. Given the speculative and unpredictable nature of litigation, the outcome of any such disputes\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.\nCredit Risk\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company's credit risk was primarily attributable to cash, accounts and other\nreceivables and loan receivable. The Company issued a loan receivable during the year ended March 31, 2022, further\nincreasing its exposure to credit risk. In June 2023, a partial payment of $2.5M was received against the loan\nreceivable, decreasing credit risk. The remaining $0.5M was due September 29, 2023, but was subsequently\nextended to October 31, 2024. On November 5, 2024, the remaining balance of $531,479 was collected and no\nfurther amounts are owing related to this amended and restated promissory note. The Company performed an\nanalysis of collectivity and based on the collateral against the loan, determined that no provision was required.\nFinancial instruments included in accounts and other receivables consisted of trade receivables generated through\nsales as well as recoverable Harmonized Sale Tax. The Company’s cash is held with reputable financial institutions.\nManagement believes that the credit risk with respect to financial instruments included in accounts and other\nreceivables is remote.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company has cash and cash equivalent balances at federally regulated Canadian banks. The Company\nperiodically monitors the investments it makes, the security of such investments and is satisfied with the credit ratings\nof its banks. The Company closely monitors interest rates to determine the appropriate course of action to be taken\nby the Company.\nPrice Risk\nThe Company is exposed to price risk with respect to commodity prices. The Company closely monitors commodity\nprices to determine the appropriate course of action to be taken by the Company.\nFinancial Capability and Additional Financing\nThe Company has limited financial resources and there is no assurance that sufficient additional funding will be\navailable to enable it to fulfill its business objectives or obligations, on acceptable terms or at all. Unanticipated expenses\nand other developments could cause existing funds to be depleted sooner than expected. In the event that its existing\ncash resources are inadequate to fund operational expenses, and in order to fund the planned business objectives of the\nCompany, the Company will be required to raise additional financing from external sources, such as debt financing,\nequity financing or joint ventures. The Company's ability to raise additional equity financing may be affected by\nnumerous factors beyond the Company's control, including, but not limited to, adverse market conditions, commodity\nprice changes and an economic downturn. Failure to obtain additional funding on a timely basis could result in delay\nor indefinite postponement of the development of the Company’s business and could cause the Company to reduce or\nterminate its operations. Additional funds raised by the Company from treasury share issuances may result in significant\ndilution to existing shareholders, a depressive effect on the price of the common shares and/or a change of control.\nPermits and Government Regulation\nAlthough the Company believes it has all of the necessary permits to carry out the proposed business programs, the\noperations of the Company may require licenses and permits from time to time from various governmental authorities\nPa ge 37 | 41\nto carry out exploration and development at its projects or locations. Obtaining permits can be a complex, time-\nconsuming process. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the necessary licenses and\npermits on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. The costs and delays associated with obtaining permits and\ncomplying with these permits and applicable laws and regulations could stop or materially delay or restrict the\nCompany from continuing or proceeding with existing or future operations or projects. Any failure to comply with\npermits and applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could result in the interruption or closure of\noperations or material fines, penalties or other liabilities. In addition, the requirements applicable to sustain existing\npermits and licenses may change or become more stringent over time and there is no assurance that the Company\nwill have the resources or expertise to meet its obligations under such licenses and permits.\nFluctuating Prices\nThe profitability of the Company’s operations will be dependent upon the market price of the ZenGUARD™ masks\nand other products, their global acceptance and demand along with their regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions.\nThe level of interest rates, rate of inflation, production costs, healthcare and consumer demand, and stability of\nexchange rates can all cause significant fluctuations in revenue. Such external economic factors are in turn influenced\nby changes in international purchasing patterns, COVID-19 pandemic situation, monetary systems and political\ndevelopments.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nAGC’s Albany Graphite Project is subject to environmental laws and regulations which may materially and adversely\naffect its future operations. These laws and regulations control the exploration and development of the Albany\nGraphite Project and their effects on the environment, including air and water quality, waste handling and disposal,\nthe protection of different species of plant and animal life, and the preservation of lands. These laws and regulations\nwill require AGC to acquire permits and other authorizations for certain activities. There can be no assurance that\nAGC will be able to acquire such necessary permits or authorizations on a timely basis, if at all.\nFurther, environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement,\nincreased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects\nand a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. There is no\nassurance that future changes in environmental regulation, if any, will not adversely affect AGC’s operations.\nAGC is not currently insured against most environmental risks. Without such insurance, and if AGC becomes subject to\nenvironmental liabilities, the payment of such liabilities would reduce or eliminate its available funds or could exceed\nthe funds AGC has to pay such liabilities and result in bankruptcy.\nEconomic Dependence on Supply Agreements\nCurrently, the Company has entered into a limited number of supply or sales agreements for the sale of its products.\nUntil additional supply agreements are executed by the Company, the Company’s revenues will be completely\ndependent on such agreements. If such agreements are terminated, or if less of the Company’s product than\nanticipated is purchased pursuant to such agreements, this could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s\nbusiness, operations and results.\nLegal proceedings and regulatory actions\nOther than as set out below, the Company was not subject to any material legal proceedings during its most recently\ncompleted financial year, nor is the Company or any of its properties a party to or the subject of any such proceedings,\nand no such proceedings are known to be contemplated. The Company may be involved in routine, non-material\nlitigation arising in the ordinary course of business, from time to time.\nPa ge 38 | 41\nThere were no penalties or sanctions imposed against the Company by a court relating to provincial and territorial\nsecurities legislation or by a securities regulatory authority during its most recently completed financial year, nor\nhave there been any other penalties or sanctions imposed by a court or regulatory body against the Company, and\nthe Company has not entered into any settlement agreements before a court relating to provincial and territorial\nsecurities legislation or with a securities regulatory authority.\nThe Company is involved in legal proceedings relating to claims involving a former director and officer of the\nCompany. The claim was commenced in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on September 26, 2018, by Aubrey\nEveleigh and Eveleigh Geological Consulting. Mr. Eveleigh seeks damages in excess of $5,000,000 in connection\nwith an employment dispute. The Company is defending the claim and the proceedings remain ongoing, though the\nCompany believes that the risk of significant loss in respect of the litigation is remote.\nThe Company subsequently commenced a claim against Mr. Eveleigh and Eveleigh Geological Consulting on March\n24, 2020, in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List), in connection with past breaches of Mr.\nEveleigh’s fiduciary duties. Mr. Eveleigh has defended the claim, and the Company submits that it continues to\ndefend the action and maintains that the allegations as set out in the claim are frivolous and without merit.\nOn November 28, 2022, following the discovery process, the Company amongst other things, amended its claim to:\n(i) seek an order that Mr. Eveleigh disgorge any benefits obtained as a result of his misconduct; (ii) seek an order\ncancelling certain common shares of the Company held by Mr. Eveleigh; (iii) seek an order declaring that Mr.\nEveleigh has no entitlement to any royalty payments or success fees in connection with the Albany Graphite Project;\nand (iv) seek an order that declares a constructive trust in favour of the Company over any and all monies received,\ndirectly or indirectly. The trial commenced on October 21, 2024, with closing submissions expected to be completed\nin January 2025\nOn January 29, 2021, the Company was served with a statement claim issued by Graphene Composites Ltd. and is\nin the process of defending the action, which it considers frivolous and without merit.\nThe Company has considered the allegations as set out in the claim and, in light of the facts, the lack of clarity in the\nclaim, and, based on discussions with the Company’s litigation counsel, the assessment of the merits of the claim\nand the defenses available to the Company, and the Company’s conclusion is that the risk of the Company suffering\nloss in respect of the claim is remote, and therefore the Company determined the claim not to be material or\nconstituting ”significant litigation” pursuant to the policies of the TSXV. The Company continues to view this claim\nas frivolous and will continue to vigorously defend itself against these allegations.\nProposed Transactions\nAs is typical of rapidly growing companies, the Company is continually reviewing partnerships, potential merger,\nacquisition, investment and joint venture transactions and opportunities.\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company has an employment agreement with its Chief Executive Officer. During the period ended September\n30, 2024, the salary level for the individual pursuant to the employment agreement is $325,000 annually.\nThe Company had an employment agreement with its former Executive Chairman and Chief Operating Officer,\nwhich was terminated effective May 1, 2024, upon resignation of the officer. During the period ended September 30,\n2024, the salary level for the individual pursuant to the employment agreement was $300,000 annually.\nThe Company has an employment agreement with its Chief Financial Officer. During the period ended September\n30, 2024, the salary level for the individual pursuant to the employment agreement is $240,000 annually.\nPa ge 39 | 41\nContingent Liabilities\nIn September 2018, the Company received a statement of claim from a former employee, Aubrey Eveleigh and\nEveleigh Geological Consulting. The Company is in the process of defending the claim but views the claim as\nunmeritorious. On March 24, 2020, the Company commenced an action claim against the former employee for relief\nrelating to contracts and transactions between that employee and the Company, seeking to set aside those agreements\nand, where applicable, seeking disgorgement of unspecified amounts relating to benefits obtained under those\nagreements. Although there can be no assurance that any particular claim will be resolved in the Company’s favour,\nmanagement does not believe that the outcome of any claim or potential claims of which it is currently aware will\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nA detailed summary of all of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the March 31,\n2024, audited annual consolidated financial statements.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over financial\nreporting as such term is defined in the rules of the National Instrument 52-109 in Canada and under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, in the United States.

Search\n\nNovember 27, 2024\n\n# ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters to Be Added as Class 1 Medical Device Under Zentek’s Medical Device Establishment Licence\n\n**Guelph, ON – November 27, 2024, Zentek Ltd.** (“**Zentek** ” or the “**Company** ”) (Nasdaq: ZTEK; TSX-V: ZEN), an intellectual property development and commercialization company, announces its decision that its ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters will be added under the company’s existing medical device establishment licence (“MDEL”), similar to ZenGUARD™ Surgical Masks. \n\n  * Initial test work and validation began on ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters in early 2021, culminating in the award of an Innovative Solutions Canada (“ISC”) Testing Stream _._\n  * The purpose of the ISC Testing Stream – The Government of Canada contract awarded in 2021 – was to determine whether ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters could achieve a significant net reduction in airborne respiratory pathogens, thereby validating it as an effective device to mitigate the transmission of disease.\n  * Independent proof-of-concept testing and validation was completed by the National Research Council of Canada in their unique bioaerosol facility, a purpose-built modular room intended to simulate the risk of infection in a real-world classroom environment. LMS Technologies Inc. was subsequently contracted to test ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filter finished products and reported an average viral filtration efficiency (“VFE”) enhancement of ~66% compared to an untreated filter, or an average ~67% VFE under simulated operating conditions over 6 months with negligible change in pressure drop.\n  * This extensive testing program was conducted over the course of approximately two years and successfully demonstrated that ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters can achieve a significant reduction in airborne respiratory pathogens to help mitigate the transmission of disease indoors.\n\n\n  * To further validate this, the Company completed a study with ParticleOne, a RWDI Ventures company. ParticleOne’s computational model showcased ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filter’s viral filtration action, effectively reducing the spread of viral pathogens and enhancing indoor safety. It also demonstrated potential cost savings from absenteeism related to poor indoor air quality.\n\n\n\n**Quality Management System**\n\nPrior to distributing and selling an additional medical device in Canada, certain testing, process updates and additional documentation related to the Company’s supply chain will be required to qualify ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters as a medical device under its MDEL and ensure compliance with its ISO 13485:2016 Quality Management System. While this process will take additional time and resources, the Company expects it to be significantly less than that required under the previous pathway to market being pursued. \n\n“ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters will offer a safe and effective way to help prevent the transmission of disease indoors without increasing energy consumption and emissions. This unique value proposition was borne out of an ask from the Government of Canada’s Innovation Science and Economic Development agency – and we look forward to fulfilling that ask and helping many others in Canada with a safe and effective technology,” said Greg Fenton, CEO of Zentek.\n\n**Management Changes**\n\nThe Company also announces that Nick Hansford, Vice President, Strategy and Product Development, and member of the Zentek management team, has left the company to pursue other opportunities.\n\n**About Zentek Ltd.**\n\nZentek is an ISO 13485:2016 certified intellectual property technology company focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel products seeking to give the Company's commercial partners a competitive advantage by making their products better, safer, and greener.\n\nZentek's patented technology platform ZenGUARD™ is shown to have enhanced viral filtration efficiency for surgical masks and aims to do the same for HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems. Zentek's ZenGUARD™ production facility is in Guelph, Ontario. \n\n**For further information on Zentek:**\n\ninvestorrelations@zentek.com\n\nRyan Shacklock\n\nSenior VP, Strategy & Business Development\n\nEmail: rshacklock@zentek.com\n\nPhone: 306-270-9610\n\nTo find out more about Zentek, please visit our website at [www.Zentek.com](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zentek.com%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cslombardo%40zentek.com%7C8c33c24ff4904a9a9e5908dbb2cc709c%7C2487f341d5b942e49533d613c3b47042%7C0%7C0%7C638300363354284062%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Nz0VW6sZkZ9oTJmmVYR02LCNMODbHNIzLoT50Y2h5Z0%3D&reserved=0 \"https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.zentek.com%2f&data=05%7c01%7cslombardo%40zentek.com%7c8c33c24ff4904a9a9e5908dbb2cc709c%7c2487f341d5b942e49533d613c3b47042%7c0%7c0%7c638300363354284062%7cunknown%7ctwfpbgzsb3d8eyjwijoimc4\").

Receive $1.1 Million Government of Canada Contract to Test Multivalent Aptamer Technology\n\n**Guelph, ON – November 6, 2024, Zentek Ltd. (“Zentek” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ZTEK; TSX-V: ZEN)** , announces that its wholly-owned subsidiary Triera Biosciences Ltd. (“Triera”) has received a $1.1 million Government of Canada contract to test its multivalent aptamer technology for the rapid drug discovery of therapeutics or prophylactics of highly pathogenic avian influenza (“HPAI”) A(H5N1).\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n  * The Government of Canada has identified the life sciences sector as a priority of the Canadian economy and is seeking advanced medical technology solutions to address ongoing challenges\n  * Triera was awarded a $1.1 million Government of Canada R&D contract through Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada's (“ISED”) Innovative Solutions Canada (“ISC”) program: [Health Advanced And Emerging Medical Technologies](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/innovative-solutions-canada/en/health)\n  * Triera’s multivalent aptamer technology was selected for its potential to be used as a rapid drug development platform\n  * Government of Canada testing partners include Health Emergency Readiness Canada (“HERC”) within ISED, and Defence Research and Development Canada (“DRDC”), the science and technology organization of the Department of National Defence (“DND”)\n  * The test will help develop a prophylactic and therapeutic for HPAI A(H5N1) following the multivalent aptamer strategy that successfully produced a SARS‑CoV-2 aptamer\n\n\n\nTriera has proven the capability of the multivalent aptamer platform by developing a universal therapeutic and prophylactic that is effective against all variants of SARS‑CoV‑2. The contract will allow Triera to prove the capability for developing a lead candidate for HPAI A(H5N1).\n\nHERC is a new federal organization within ISED dedicated to protecting Canadians against future pandemics and delivering on Canada’s life sciences and medical countermeasures readiness objectives. HERC will provide a sustained focus on advancing life sciences industrial capabilities and innovation to respond to health threats, building on significant achievements in the sector since 2020, including $2.2B that has been invested under Canada’s Biomanufacturing and Life Sciences Strategy.\n\nDRDC is Canada's defence science, technology, and innovation leader. DRDC develops and delivers new technical solutions and advice to the DND, the Canadian Armed Forces, and safety and security communities. This is accomplished by working with partners in industry, academia, other government departments and international allies.\n\nThe contract requires Triera to develop a lead candidate for HPAI A(H5N1) within six months of the project initiation. The lead candidate will be tested for its efficacy as a therapeutic and prophylactic along with its safety profile by the Miller Laboratory at McMaster University.\n\n“We are very pleased that our multivalent aptamer platform has been recognized through this ISC Program Testing Stream. We are working with government organizations that understand the significance of our avian flu program and can promote and support further development of our technology. Upon successful completion, Triera will be eligible for further government investment and recognition from Canada and its key allies,” said Greg Fenton, CEO of the Company and Triera. \n\n“The potential for an avian influenza pandemic continues to grow and the consequences of a new variant, which would allow human-to-human transmission, could lead to devastating results,” Triera’s advisor, Dr. Matthew Miller said, “As with national security, the need for an outbreak response must be regarded as a failure to prevent.” \n\n**About Triera Biosciences Ltd.**\n\nTriera holds an exclusive, worldwide royalty bearing license from McMaster University to use and practice all aptamer and DNAzyme uses developed through the collaboration with the Li Lab by McMaster University for the next 20 years. Triera and McMaster’s combined expertise and capabilities in aptamer technology offer significant potential to reduce the cost and time required for the development of new treatments.\n\n**About Zentek Ltd.**\n\nZentek is an ISO 13485:2016 certified intellectual property technology company focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel products seeking to give the Company's commercial partners a competitive advantage by making their products better, safer, and greener.\n\nZentek's patented technology platform ZenGUARD™, is shown to have 99-per-cent anti-microbial activity and to significantly increase the bacterial and viral filtration efficiency of both surgical masks and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems. Zentek's ZenGUARD™ production facility is located in Guelph, Ontario. \n\nZentek, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Triera Biosciences Ltd., has a global exclusive license to the aptamer-based platform technology developed by McMaster University, which is being jointly developed by Zentek and McMaster for both the diagnostic and therapeutic markets.\n\nThe Company is not making any express or implied claims that its aptamer technology has the ability to eliminate, cure or contain the COVID-19 (or SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus) at this time.\n\n**For further information contact:**\n\nDr. Colin van der Kuur\n\nChief Science Officer\n\nEmail: cvanderkuur@triera.ca\n\nPhone: 778-808-6424\n\nTo find out more about Zentek, please visit our website at [www.zentek.com](http://www.zentek.com).

Search\n\nOctober 31, 2024\n\n# Zentek Provides Regulatory Update for ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters\n\n**Guelph, ON – October 31, 2024, Zentek Ltd.** (“**Zentek** ” or the “**Company** ”) (Nasdaq: ZTEK; TSX-V: ZEN), an intellectual property development and commercialization company announces that it has withdrawn its submission to the Health Canada Pest Management Regulatory Agency (“PMRA”) for its ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters. Based on feedback received from PMRA, and continued analysis of the Canadian regulatory environment, the Company believes there are other, more cost-effective, and timely pathways, to bring ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters to market in Canada. The Company has been evaluating and planning for these potential alternative options in parallel with the PMRA assessment process over the last several months and will now shift its focus to these other pathways.\n\n“Our top priority as a Company is ensuring we do everything we can to create value for our stakeholders as quickly and effectively as possible, which is why we are shifting our focus to pursue other pathways to market in Canada for ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters,” said Greg Fenton, CEO of Zentek.\n\n“Importantly, we know that one of the biggest challenges facing society is climate change and building decarbonization. Buildings contribute nearly 40% of global energy-related CO2 emissions – and ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters are one of the only tools in the toolbox to help control infectious aerosols without significantly increasing energy consumption and emissions. The sooner we can bring ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters to market, the sooner we can do our part to help reduce emissions while keeping people safe indoors – not only in Canada, but globally as well.”\n\n**About Zentek Ltd.**\n\nZentek is an ISO 13485:2016 certified intellectual property technology company focused on the research, development and commercialization of novel products seeking to give the Company's commercial partners a competitive advantage by making their products better, safer, and greener.\n\nZentek's patented technology platform ZenGUARD™, is shown to have 99-per-cent antimicrobial activity and to significantly increase the viral filtration efficiency for surgical masks and aims to do the same for HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems.
