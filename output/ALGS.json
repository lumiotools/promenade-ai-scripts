(Nasdaq: ALGS, “Aligos”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapeutics to address unmet medical needs in liver and viral diseases, today announced positive data from one late-breaker oral and three poster presentations at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease’s (AASLD) The Liver Meeting (TLM) 2024, being held November 15 – 19, 2024 in San Diego, CA.\n\nThe clinical poster presentation highlighted the continued potent antiviral activity of ALG-000184 for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus infection in both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative subjects, demonstrating the potential for the molecule to become first-line therapy for chronic suppression and the backbone for regimens aimed at functional cure.\n\nData from ≤84 weeks following an oral daily dose of 300 mg ALG-000184 monotherapy demonstrated sustained HBV DNA suppression (<LLOQ <10 IU/mL) in 7/7 (100%) HBeAg-positive CHB subjects. All HBeAg- subjects achieved sustained HBV DNA suppression by Week 24 and 11/11 (100%) subjects achieved sustained HBV DNA <LLOQ at Week 48 with 10/11 (91%) subjects further achieving HBV DNA below the lower limit of detection (LLOD <4.92 IU/mL). Importantly, no subject demonstrated viral resistance to ALG-000184 monotherapy and suppression was maintained throughout the dosing period.\n\nAll subjects achieved sustained HBV RNA < LLOQ by Week 44 in HBeAg+ subjects and Week 8 in HBeAg- subjects. Multi-log10 reductions in HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBcrAg were observed in HBeAg+ subjects, and HBcrAg decline was observed in HBeAg- subjects. In both patient populations, ALG-000184 continues to be well tolerated with no viral breakthrough observed and no known CAM resistant mutations identified with monotherapy treatment.\n\nAdditionally, the late-breaker oral presentation highlighted the best-in-class potential of ALG-055009, a purpose built THR-β agonist discovered by Aligos scientists. 12-weeks of once daily ALG-055009 treatment in MASH patients met the primary endpoint, with robust reductions in liver fat content at Week 12. Doses of 0.5 mg to 0.9 mg ALG-055009 demonstrated statistically significant reductions in liver fat at Week 12, with placebo-adjusted median relative reductions up to 46.2% as measured by MRI-PDFF. Up to 70% of subjects achieved ≥30% relative reduction in liver fat compared to baseline, a positive prognostic indicator of histological improvements in MASH resolution and fibrosis reduction. Eighteen subjects who were on stable GLP-1 agonist therapy qualified for enrollment in the study, with liver fat content meeting the inclusion criteria of ≥10% at baseline as measured by MRI-PDFF. Notably, 11/14 subjects on stable GLP-1 agonists treated with ALG-055009 had liver fat decreases, whereas 4/4 subjects on stable GLP-1 agonists treated with placebo had increases in liver fat over the 12-week dosing period.\n\nSignificant reductions in atherogenic lipids, including LDL-C, lipoprotein (a) and apolipoprotein B and dose-dependent increases in SHBG were observed. In particular, ALG-055009 demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction from baseline of up to 26.8% at Week 12 for lipoprotein (a), which is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease that has been resistant to treatment with statin therapy. Treatment with ALG-055009 was well-tolerated, with rates of gastrointestinal-related AEs similar to placebo.\n\n“The presentation of longer duration dosing of ALG-000184 in CHB patients strengthens our belief that this therapy will become both first-line for chronic suppression as well as the backbone of next generation HBV treatments aimed at functional cure,” stated Lawrence Blatt, PhD, MBA, Chairman, President, & CEO of Aligos Therapeutics. “Additionally, we are pleased to have presented the HERALD data, showing robust reductions in liver fat for patients treated with ALG-055009. The subgroup analysis in patients enrolled in the study on stable GLP-1 agonist therapy suggests a role for ALG-055009 to augment liver fat reductions in patients receiving incretin therapy.”\n\nDetails of the presentations are as follows:\n\n**_ALG-000184: Potential first-/best-in-class small molecule CAM-E for chronic hepatitis B_**** _(CHB)_**\n\n**Abstract #:** 1213\n\n**Title:**_Monotherapy with the Capsid Assembly Modulator, ALG-000184, Results in High Viral Suppression Rates in Untreated HBeAg+ and HBeAg- Subjects with Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection_\n\n**Presenter:** Professor Man-Fung Yuen, MBBS, MD, PhD, DSc, Chair and Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Hong Kong\n\n**Date/Time:** November 15, 2024, 8:00am – 5:00pm PT\n\n**Abstract #:** 1266\n\n**Title:**_Capsid Assembly Modulators Such as ALG-001075 Induce Profound HBV DNA Knockdown and Directly Target HBeAg In Vitro_\n\n**Presenter:** Cheng Liu, PhD\n\n**Date/Time:** November 15, 2024, 8:00am – 5:00pm PT\n\n**_ALG-055009: Potential best-in-class small molecule THR-_****_β_**** _for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH)_**\n\n**Format:** Oral presentation\n\n**Title:**_ALG-055009, a Novel Thyroid Hormone Receptor Beta (THR-β) Agonist, was Well-tolerated with Significant Reductions in Liver Fat at Week 12 in Non-cirrhotic MASH Patients in the Ongoing Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 2_\n\n**Presenter:** Rohit Loomba, MD, MHSc, Chief, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of California, San Diego\n\n**Date/Time:** November 19, 2024 at 10:30am – 10:40am PT\n\n**Abstract #:** 3226\n\n**Title:**_Nonclinical Toxicology Profile of ALG-055009, a Novel and Potent Thyroid Hormone Receptor β Agonist, for the Treatment of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH)_\n\n**Presenter:** Dinah Misner, PhD\n\n**Date/Time:** November 17, 2024, 8:00am – 5:00pm PT\n\nThe presentations can be found on the [Posters & Presentations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=BffBBkO34Xww_ow8-g0zG9xNQkqplb9A38a7ULjZefQQCChR1wYyyNIAqFUmYbUJRvejcXA2QsSogJ3uwiLjwEUWk_K1-yUJdHsLnhQEBHSBpgkXsUyf98Vc65CfVZ2e-aPLclo7wBCdE-A7QhbGYw==) section of the Aligos website ([www.aligos.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=E945yxYKyyQdxsIsgDWUbH-bRbv7V5qHbCLWdJdjums5xwF2OMBhJrSOn_pncZXXU5sWYxTibA2FtHXQ2EHHOsCxeQnPsFzQUcs8bxdKeguSwWq1X0zFAKoT5zT6L-X2S89i1P6Zi0x-O69KdPDW6_71pkaBc8_xpwPxTH7ezXdGn2K93tJtHaAY6x-ndhUjmX23us8yDxz3Fi44iyltGROuCsJgdGXqwbma5tR4tpVOjHlAHsDFzKexCuQQgJcduXSG4tpRkfoIUFARzTLHwrBuP4GMvMKIrPiRuUpbgWcKd9ajlQ76iWbArGYZGMKGLqwSxx6Ls0Zc6fx2ust3P6G5U1J2P5pQ6G2h6Vm1ezAI06TE1fINXp1520ZPz7Ekbp_HrF0WUcJJyHwa2KkWoYV56aBwASKoPr4CW9DS9sk=)).\n\n**About Aligos** Aligos Therapeutics, Inc.
