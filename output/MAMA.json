Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama’s Creations, said: “We continued to execute in the third quarter, with a robust cadence of sales wins highlighted by new placements, such as the Company’s first-ever at Walmart with two SKUs and an upcoming rotation with a new product at a major club store. While we certainly saw the tail end of construction-related pressures in Farmingdale in the first half of the quarter – as noted in our last earnings call – we have since returned to improved production and a strong October on the back of lower chicken prices and more consistent grilling operations.\n\n“Following strategic CapEx investments and the recent completion of our executive team build-out, our team is ready and able to execute upon the new slate of operational efficiency and sales opportunities ahead of us. As we continue to receive market recognition in the form of industry awards and ultimately higher sales, I believe we are incredibly well positioned to become a leading force in the deli with the goal of driving sustainable, long-term value for my fellow shareholders,” concluded Michaels.\n\nA playback of the call will be available through Friday, January 10, 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA represents net income\n(loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for stock-based compensation. The company believes this non-GAAP\nmeasure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management\nregarding financial and business trends relating to the company’s results of operations. However, this non-GAAP measure has significant\nlimitations in that it does not reflect all the costs and other items associated with the operation of the company’s business as determined in\naccordance with GAAP. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently and are therefore not comparable to\nsimilar measures by other companies. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or\nsuperior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, its corresponding\nGAAP measure, is shown in the Company’s earnings press releases.\nNASDAQ: MAMA | 2\nMama’s Creations Overview\nOur Objective: To become the leading national “one-stop-shop”\nNASDAQ: MAMA\nsolution for high quality fresh, clean and easy to prepare foods\nShare Price1 $7.75\nMarket Cap1 $291M\n• Consumer Preferences are Changing: Shoppers increasingly prefer ready\nTTM Revenues2 $113M\nto eat, prepared food options at grocery and convenience stores with a\nTTM Gross Margin2 27.1%\nfocus on cleaner, protein-forward items with simple ingredients\nTTM Net Income2 $5.1M\n• Our Family of Brands: Growing variety of products geared towards today’s\nTTM Adj.

They settled in Bay\nRidge, Brooklyn and raised five children. Shortly after Daniel Mancini was born,\nhe was in the kitchen cooking alongside his grandmother. None of the recipes\nwere written down, just stored in her heart.\n“Every Sunday I would wake to the amazing\naroma of my Grandmother frying meatballs. I\ncall this a ‘Scented Memory.’”\n“I chose my Grandmothers Meatballs and Slow Cooked Italian Sauce as the first\nrecipe we would bring to your table. We prepare this dish the exact way she did\nso many years ago. The meatballs are made from 100% beef, whole fresh eggs,\nRomano cheese, onion, parsley, a pinch of salt and pepper and the exact amount\nof bread crumbs. They are formed by hand just like Anna did and lightly browned.\nWe place them in the Slow Cooked Italian Sauce which is pure Italian plum\ntomatoes, olive oil, garlic, some salt and pepper and a bay leaf and slowly cook\nthem for three hours. This is the only way to prepare authentic old world\nmeatballs and sauce. Gently stirring every 20 minutes guarantees perfect\nmeatballs every time. There are no shortcuts.” – Daniel Mancini\nNASDAQ: MAMA | 6\nMama’s Creations Strategic Platform\nOne-stop-shop Deli solution for Grocery, Mass, Club and Convenience\nstore owners to procure high quality, fresh, clean prepared foods\nProteins Salads Pasta & Grains Olives Sandwiches Soups Pizzas Sushi\nCurrent Categories Organic Expansion Potential M&A\nNASDAQ: MAMA | 7\nFull Line of All-Natural Products\nOne stop shop for freshly prepared meals –\nfrom our kitchen to yours – found in the deli\n• 50+ distinct Italian-inspired protein products by Mama’s Creations, packaged\nin both retail and bulk packages (for supermarket or food service)\n• 200+ chicken and salad products by T&L Creative Salads (Acquired Dec. 2021)\n• 50+ olive and savory products by Olive Branch (Acquired Dec. 2021)\n• Growing portfolio of international cuisine with launch of Mama’s Creations\nplatform brand at IDDBA in June 2023\nResearch & Manufacturing\nDistribution\nDevelopment & Packaging\nIn-House Capabilities for the Entire Product Lifecycle\nNNAASSDDAAQQ:: MMAAMMAA || 88\nSuccessful Product Innovation\nContinued new product development key to driving per-store SKU growth\nMarket Survey\nMeatballs in a Cup in Convenience Stores\nProduct Recommendation\n• Protein-oriented snack provides convenient, in-demand portable meals\n• Potential for thousands of store placements across numerous end markets 93% Would Recommend our Beef Meatballs\n• Quickly sold out in initial product launch with QVC with significant ongoing\nfood service testing, evaluating national rollouts\n7%\nWould Recommend\n• Cup form factor accommodates the launch of other snacking SKUs\nClub Store Packs\nWould Not Recommend\n• Satisfies consumer demands for fast, healthy family meals\n• Draws upon decades of white-label product success\n• Exciting opportunity to establish brand loyalty 93%\nQ2 2022 Online Market Survey\nTotal Sample: 516\nMeals for One in Grocery Stores\n• Heat-and-eat packaging style suited for the needs of busy consumers • “I Could Eat This Everyday” Award\n• Sold in grocery stores\n• Easily adapted to fit countless recipes, enabling more SKUs per store • Best Sauce\n• Introduced in January 2022, showing signs of widespread acceptance\n• Best Smart Swap\nNASDAQ: MAMA | 9\nIDDBA 2024: New Product Launches\nExpanded Offerings Across Product Lines\nIDDBA 2023 Launches\n• New SKUs serve to broaden product offerings and cement our positioning as a\ntrue one-stop-shop for our Deli partners.
