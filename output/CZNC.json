Moreover, we are committed to continuously enhancing our processes\nand talent, and to making improvements in the platform including ongoing investments in risk technology and\nframeworks. These actions are designed to support and enhance our risk management capabilities and regulatory\nprofile.\nCompetition\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive. Our branch footprint is predominantly in the New\nEngland, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, though certain lines of business serve national markets. Within these\nmarkets, we face competition from community banks, super-regional and national financial institutions, credit\nunions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage\nfirms, insurance companies, money market funds, hedge funds and private equity firms. Some of our larger\ncompetitors may make available to their customers a broader array of products, pricing and structure\nalternatives while some smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes. In addition,\nsome of our competitors may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as we are and, therefore, may\nhave lower costs they can pass on to customers in the form of more favorable terms. Competition among\nproviders of financial products and services continues to increase, with consumers having the opportunity to\nselect from a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives. The ability of non-banking financial\ninstitutions, including FinTech companies, to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has also\nintensified competition.\nIn Consumer Banking, the industry has become increasingly dependent on and oriented toward\ntechnology-driven delivery systems, permitting transactions to be conducted through online and mobile channels.\nIn addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-bank institutions to attract\nfunds and provide lending and other financial products and services. The emergence of digital-only banking\nmodels has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Given their lower cost structure, these models are\noften, on average, able to offer higher rates on deposit products than retail banking institutions with a\ntraditional branch footprint. The primary factors driving competition for loans and deposits are interest rates,\nfees charged, tailored value propositions to different customer segments, customer service levels, convenience,\nincluding branch locations and hours of operation, and the range of products and services offered.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 8\nIn Commercial Banking, we face competition in all our client segments from a variety of industry\nparticipants including traditional banking institutions, particularly large regional banks, as well as commercial\nfinance companies, leasing companies, other non-bank lenders, and institutional investors, including\ncollateralized loan obligation managers, hedge funds and private equity firms. Some larger competitors, including\ncertain national banks that compete in our market area, may offer a broader array of products and, due to their\nasset size, may be in a position to hold more exposure on their balance sheet. We compete on a number of\nfactors including providing innovative corporate finance solutions, quality of customer service and execution,\nrange of products offered, price and reputation.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our long-term success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a high-\nperforming workforce. Our goal is to create an environment where colleagues can thrive personally and\nprofessionally and can maximize their potential. As of December 31, 2023, Citizens had 17,570 full-time\nequivalent employees, primarily across New England and the Mid-Atlantic. Our Board of Directors and its\nCompensation and Human Resources Committee are responsible for overseeing our human capital management\nstrategy, with senior management providing regular updates to facilitate that oversight.\nLeadership, Talent Development, and Talent Acquisition and Mobility\nOur leaders are the catalysts to achieve the culture we want to foster. During 2023, we continued\ntailored leadership training and coaching for senior management following the detailed talent assessments\nconducted the prior year. We aim to equip all colleagues with the skills necessary to excel in their current roles\nand to build capabilities that will enable them to be highly valuable contributors in the future. We expanded our\nlearning academies as well as badging and bootcamp programs focusing on critical skills such as Innovation, Agile,\nNext Gen Tech, Banking and Credit, and Data & Analytics. Our culture is one of continuous learning, which we\nbelieve is crucial for colleagues to thrive as part of our organization and to feel a sense of accomplishment and\npurpose.\nThe talent market remains competitive, particularly in emerging skill areas, and we implemented a\nstrategy to fill critical gaps that utilizes a combination of external hiring in critical areas (e.g., technology,\ndigital, cyber, risk, marketing, and data), a strong internal mobility program made possible by the expanded\nlearning and development offerings provided to colleagues, and reliance on temporary workers for short-term or\ntechnical projects.\nEmployee Engagement\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to develop a high performing workforce and make Citizens a great place to\nwork and build a career, we conduct an annual organizational health survey (“OHS”). The results of our survey\nare instrumental in helping management prioritize areas of change that are most important to colleagues. Survey\nresults are used to refine our focus, address gaps, and strengthen efforts to improve our organizational\neffectiveness and colleague experience. Between our initial public offering and 2022, we had a 19-point increase\nin our overall survey score and achieved top quartile status within McKinsey’s global benchmarks. In 2023, with\nan eye toward continuing to evolve our strategy and culture, we transitioned to a new OHS tool. In 2023, 87% of\ncolleagues participated in the OHS, which is our all-time highest participation rate.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe foster a culture where all stakeholders feel respected, valued, and heard. Our DE&I strategy is\nfocused on creating an environment of inclusion and belonging, building a more diverse workforce and evaluating\nthe effectiveness of our initiatives.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 9\nDevelopment programs are designed to build a strong pipeline of emerging talent, including diverse\ntalent, internally, and have been effective in increasing the development of our overall colleague base as well as\nincreasing the number of women and people of color in senior leader roles. We also partner with external\norganizations to offer additional resources for reskilling and upskilling colleagues, including diverse colleagues.\nWe acknowledge that there are opportunities to further increase the representation of women and people of\ncolor, particularly in leadership roles, and we continue to develop strong partnerships with business and\ncommunity organizations to help identify diverse candidates for roles within every segment of our organization.\nIn addition, we ensure that interview slates for senior openings include candidates with diverse backgrounds and\nperspectives. An internal dashboard is used to monitor our progress across multiple DE&I metrics. Information\nregarding our workforce demographics can be found in our Environmental Social Governance Report and on our\nwebsite, which includes a link to our most recently filed EEO-1 report.\nVarious resources are used by management to understand what drives a sense of inclusion and belonging\nand to identify what actions will be effective in attracting and retaining diverse colleagues. Analytics are used to\nhelp prioritize initiatives, including responses to our OHS, which we segment by various colleague populations to\nprovide additional insights. In addition, we have seven business resource groups (“BRGs”), which are integral to\nidentifying and formulating solutions to DE&I issues that are most important to customers, colleagues, and the\ncommunity. Our BRGs include Citizens WIN (Women’s Impact Network), Citizens Elev8 (Rising Professionals),\nPrism (Multicultural), Citizens Pride (LGBTQ+), Citizens Veterans, and Citizens Awake (Disability Awareness). In\n2023, we launched an additional BRG, Caring for Citizens (Caregivers). Each BRG is sponsored by a member of the\nexecutive team and approximately 3,500 colleagues belonged to at least one BRG as of December 31, 2023. We\nalso offer education programs focused on embedding inclusive behaviors in our culture designed for colleagues at\nall levels of leadership.\nHealth, Well-Being, and Flexibility\nWe prioritize the health and well-being of our colleagues and their loved ones. Our benefit programs are\ndesigned to support colleagues’ physical, mental, and financial well-being and we have added several resources\nin recent years. In an effort to greater support each colleague’s unique journey, we enhanced our partnership\nwith our BRGs by providing subject matter experts to share their experience and expertise with all BRG\nmembers, as well as increasing awareness of available tools and resources.\nIn late 2022, we enhanced our Parental Leave Policy to six weeks of paid time off for all permanent\ncolleagues who become parents; birth mothers are eligible for an additional 10 weeks, for a total of 16 weeks. In\n2023, we increased paid bereavement leave, added several mental health resources, and provided each\ncolleague an extra day of paid time-off to be used as a wellness day. In recognition of the impact of inflation on\ncolleagues there were also no increases to colleague premiums, co-pays or deductibles for medical, dental, and\nvision coverage for 2023.\nWe continue to embrace flexibility and manage our hybrid workforce in a manner that ensures colleagues\nare working in ways that best support our customers, foster engagement and innovation, and maintain our\ncompany culture.\nFair and Equitable Compensation\nWe strive to compensate our colleagues fairly based on market data, experience, and performance, and\nwe compare our compensation to other companies in our peer group as well as others in the financial services\nindustry.\nPart of our commitment to building and fostering a diverse, inclusive, high-performing culture includes\nensuring our compensation and benefits are fair and competitive for all colleagues. We engage an independent\nthird-party expert firm to conduct an annual pay equity analysis, accounting for factors that appropriately\nexplain differences in pay such as role, performance, and experience. Additional information about this analysis,\nincluding our most recent results, can be found in our Environmental Social Governance Report and on our\nwebsite.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 10\nSustainability\nOur efforts relative to ESG matters are aligned with the needs, interests, and expectations of our\nstakeholders and are divided into four focus areas: Leading with Robust Corporate Governance, Driving Positive\nClimate Impact, Building the Workforce of the Future, and Fostering Strong Communities. These areas speak to\nthe strengths of our company, align with our business priorities, and define how we can have an outsized impact\non our business, society, and the planet.\nIn 2023, we announced a $50 billion Sustainable Finance Target, including $5 billion in green financing,\nby 2030. As part of this announcement, we committed to engage corporate clients in high-emitting sectors on\nclimate-related topics, beginning with a target to engage 100% of our Oil & Gas clients by the end of 2024. In\naddition, we committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2035.\nFor more details regarding ESG and other corporate responsibility matters, go to our website.\nRegulation and Supervision\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination under federal and state\nlaws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending practices,\ndeposit insurance, customer privacy and cybersecurity, capital adequacy and planning, liquidity, safety and\nsoundness, consumer protection and disclosure, permissible activities and investments, and certain transactions\nwith affiliates. These laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of customers, depositors, the\nDIF and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders or other investors. The\ndiscussion below outlines the material elements of selected laws and regulations applicable to us and our\nsubsidiaries. Changes in applicable law or regulation, and in their interpretation and application by regulatory\nagencies and other governmental authorities, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to examinations by federal banking regulators, as well as the SEC, FINRA and various state\ninsurance and securities regulators. In some cases, regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that may not\nbe publicly disclosed, and such actions may restrict or limit our activities or activities of our subsidiaries. As part\nof our regular examination process, regulators may advise us to operate under various restrictions as a prudential\nmatter. We have periodically received requests for information from regulatory authorities at the federal and\nstate level, including from banking, securities and insurance regulators, state attorneys general, federal agencies\nor law enforcement authorities, and other regulatory authorities, concerning our business practices. Such\nrequests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. For a further discussion of how regulatory\nactions may impact our business, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.” For additional information regarding regulatory\nmatters, see Note 25 in Item 8.\nOverview\nWe are a BHC under the Bank Holding Company Act and have elected to be treated as a FHC under\namendments to this Act as effected by GLBA. As such, we are subject to the supervision, examination and\nreporting requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the FRB, including through the\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston. Under the system of “functional regulation” established under the Bank Holding\nCompany Act, the FRB serves as the primary regulator of our consolidated organization. The OCC serves as the\nprimary regulator for CBNA, and the SEC and FINRA serve as the primary regulators of our broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries.\nThe federal banking regulators have authority to approve or disapprove mergers, acquisitions,\nconsolidations, the establishment of branches and similar corporate actions. These banking regulators also have\nthe power to prevent the continuance or development of unsafe or unsound banking practices or other violations\nof law. Federal law governs the activities in which CBNA engages, including the investments it makes and the\naggregate amount of available credit that it may grant to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance laws\nand regulations also affect its operations. The actions the FRB takes to implement monetary policy also affect us.\nIn addition, CBNA is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB with respect to\nconsumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of\nconsumer financial products by depository institutions, such as CBNA, with more than $10 billion in total assets.\nThe CFPB may promulgate rules under a variety of consumer financial protection statutes, including the Truth in\nLending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Real Estate Settlement\nProcedures Act.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 11\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Regulatory Tailoring Rules\nAs a BHC with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets, we are currently subject to enhanced\nprudential standards and associated capital and liquidity rules (“Tailoring Rules”). The Tailoring Rules assign each\nBHC, including its bank subsidiaries, to one of four categories based on its size and certain risk-based indicators.\nCFG and CBNA are each subject to Category IV standards, the least restrictive of the requirements under the\nTailoring Rules. As discussed in greater detail in “Capital and Stress Testing Requirements” and “Long-Term Debt\nRequirements”, the federal banking regulators proposed sweeping changes to the regulatory capital and liquidity\nrules that would significantly impact the application of those rules to the Company.\nBank and Financial Holding Company Regulation\nAs a FHC, we may engage in a broader range of activities than a BHC that is not also a FHC. These\nactivities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking\nand other activities that are determined by the FRB, in coordination with the Treasury Department, to be\n“financial in nature or incidental thereto” or that the FRB determines unilaterally to be “complementary” to\nfinancial activities. In addition, a FHC may commence new permissible financial activities or acquire non-bank\nfinancial companies engaged in such activities, in either case, with after-the-fact notice to the FRB.\nTo maintain FHC status, a BHC and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must remain “well\ncapitalized” and “well managed,” as described below under “Federal Deposit Insurance Act.” If a BHC fails to\nmeet these regulatory standards, the FRB could place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial\nactivities permissible for FHCs or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the BHC or its\naffiliates. If the deficiencies persisted, the FRB could order the BHC to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease\nengaging in any activities permissible for FHCs that are not permissible for BHCs, or the BHC could elect to\nconform its non-banking activities to those permissible for a BHC that is not also a FHC. In addition, the CRA\nrequires U.S. banks to help serve the needs of their communities. If a depository institution subsidiary of a BHC\nwere to receive a CRA rating of less than “satisfactory”, the BHC would be prohibited from engaging in certain\nactivities or acquisitions (see “Community Reinvestment Act” below).\nFederal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions of other\ndepository institutions or BHCs. As noted above, FRB approval is generally not required for BHCs to acquire a\ncompany engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature,\nas determined by the FRB. Prior regulatory approval is required, however, before a BHC may acquire or control\nmore than 5% of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a BHC, including a FHC, or a bank.\nIn considering applications for approval of acquisitions, the banking regulators may take several factors into\naccount, including the competitive effects of the transaction in the relevant geographic markets; the financial\nand managerial resources and future prospects of companies involved in the transaction; the effect of the\ntransaction on the financial stability of the U.S. banking or financial system; the companies’ compliance with\nanti-money laundering laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and\nthe performance record of the IDIs involved in the transaction under the CRA.\nCapital and Stress Testing Requirements\nWe are required to comply with the U.S. Basel III rules, which establish risk-based and leverage capital\nrequirements. The risk-based requirements are based on a banking organization’s RWA, which is inclusive of the\norganization’s on- and off-balance sheet exposures. We calculate RWA using the standardized approach and have\nmade the AOCI opt-out election, permitting us to exclude components of AOCI from regulatory capital. The\nleverage requirements are based on a banking organization’s average consolidated on-balance sheet assets.\nUnder the U.S. Basel III rules, the minimum capital ratios are:\n• CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%;\n• Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%;\n• Total capital ratio of 8.0%; and\n• Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 12\nFor BHCs with $100 billion or more in assets, such as us, the FRB’s capital rules impose an institution-\nspecific SCB on top of each of the three minimum risk-based capital ratios listed above. Banking institutions that\nfail to meet the effective minimum ratios including the SCB will be subject to constraints on capital distributions,\nincluding dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation. The severity of the\nconstraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income”, defined as\nthe greater of four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income, or\nthe average four quarter trailing net income.\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted the CECL accounting standard. In reaction to the COVID disruption, on\nSeptember 30, 2020, the federal banking regulators adopted a final rule relative to regulatory capital treatment\nof the ACL under CECL. This rule allowed electing banking organizations to delay the estimated impact of CECL\non regulatory capital for a two-year period ending December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year transition period\nending December 31, 2024. The three-year transition period will phase-in the reversal of the aggregate amount\nof the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay.\nAs a Category IV firm under the Tailoring Rules, we are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing and\nare exempt from company-run stress testing and related disclosure requirements. The FRB supervises Category IV\nfirms on an ongoing basis, including evaluating the capital adequacy and capital planning processes of firms\nduring off-cycle years. We are required to develop, maintain and submit an annual capital plan for review and\napproval by our Board of Directors, or one of its committees, as well as FR Y-14 reporting requirements.\nOn July 27, 2023, the federal banking regulators issued a proposal to implement the Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision’s finalization of the post-crisis bank regulatory capital reforms. The proposal, commonly\nreferred to as Basel III “Endgame,” would significantly revise the capital requirements applicable to large\nbanking organizations with total assets of $100 billion or more, including the Company. Under the proposal,\nCategory III and IV firms, including the Company as a Category IV firm, would become subject to the same capital\ntreatment regarding the inclusion of AOCI, deductions, and rules for minority interest as Category I and II firms.\nThe proposal would also replace the existing models-based approaches for credit and operational risk, which\ncurrently apply only to Category I and II firms, with two new approaches applicable to Category I through IV\nfirms. The first would use the existing standardized approach and a proposed revised market risk capital rule.\nThe second would use a new expanded risk-based approach, consisting of new non-models-based approaches for\ncredit risk, operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk, as well as the proposed revised market risk\ncapital rule. The approach resulting in the lower ratio would establish the binding ratio for purposes of satisfying\nregulatory capital requirements and buffers, including the SCB. Category III and IV firms would also be required\nto calculate counterparty credit exposure relating to derivative transactions using the standardized approach for\ncounterparty credit risk. Additionally, Category IV firms would become subject to the supplementary leverage\nratio and the countercyclical capital buffer. The Company estimates a pro forma CET1 ratio, adjusted for the\nAOCI opt-out removal, of 9.0% as of December 31, 2023. In addition, the proposal is estimated to modestly\nincrease our RWA on a fully phased-in basis. Under the proposal, the rule would take effect on July 1, 2025, with\na three-year phase-in of the capital impact through June 30, 2028. Comments on the proposal were due by\nJanuary 16, 2024. We continue to evaluate the full impact of the proposal.\nFor more details regarding our regulatory capital and SCB, see the “Capital and Regulatory Matters”\nsection of Item 7. We are also subject to the FRB's risk-based capital requirements for market risk. See the\n“Market Risk” section of Item 7 for additional details.\nLiquidity Requirements\nThe liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”) is designed to ensure that a covered bank or BHC maintains an\nadequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day\ntime horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The NSFR is designed to promote more medium- and long-\nterm funding of the assets and activities of banking organizations over a one-year time horizon. Under the\nTailoring Rules, Category IV firms with less than $50 billion in weighted short-term wholesale funding, such as us,\nare not subject to any LCR or NSFR requirement.\nWe are subject to certain liquidity requirements under the Tailoring Rules including liquidity buffer,\nstress testing, risk management and reporting requirements. In addition, as a Category IV firm, we are required\nto calculate collateral positions monthly, establish a set of liquidity risk limits, and monitor certain elements of\nintraday liquidity risk exposures.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 13\nResolution Planning\nCategory IV firms such as CFG are no longer required to submit resolution plans under section 165(d) of\nthe Dodd-Frank Act. However, CBNA is required to periodically file an IDI resolution plan with the FDIC. This plan\nenables the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the institution under applicable receivership provisions of the FDIA in a\nmanner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the\ninstitution’s failure, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of the institution’s\nassets and minimizes the amount of any loss to the institution’s creditors. In 2021, the FDIC issued a Statement\non Resolution Plans for IDIs that, among other things, established a three-year filing cycle for banks with $100\nbillion or more in total assets, such as CBNA, and provided details regarding the content of the resolution plans\nthat filers are required to prepare. CBNA submitted its most recent resolution plan to the FDIC on December 1,\n2022.\nOn August 29, 2023, the FDIC issued a proposal that would require IDIs with total assets of $100 billion or\nmore, including CBNA, to submit a more robust resolution plan biennially that includes a comprehensive strategy\nfrom the point of failure to liquidation or return of the institution to the private sector. The identified strategy\nmust ensure timely access to insured deposits, maximize value from the sale or disposition of assets, minimize\nlosses realized by creditors, and address potential risks of adverse effects on U.S. economic conditions or\nfinancial stability. In addition, the strategy generally expects, but does not require, a default scenario whereby\nthe FDIC, as receiver of the failed institution, operates the institution under a bridge bank. The proposal also\nenhances how the credibility of resolution plans will be assessed, expands expectations regarding engagement\nand capabilities testing, and requires IDIs to demonstrate the capability to promptly establish a virtual data room\nin the run-up to or upon failure. The proposal provides that IDIs submit their initial resolution plan no earlier than\n270 days from the effective date of the amended rule. Comments on the proposal were due by November 30,\n2023. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the proposal on our business.\nLong-Term Debt Requirements\nOn August 29, 2023, the federal banking regulators issued a proposal that would require large bank\nholding companies and IDIs with total assets of $100 billion or more, such as CFG and CBNA, to maintain a\nminimum amount of long-term debt. The joint agency proposal aims to increase the resolvability and resiliency of\nlarge banking organizations by mandating a long-term debt requirement to provide the regulatory agencies\nadditional resources to resolve failed banking organizations, foster depositor confidence, and decrease costs to\nthe DIF in the event of a large banking organization failure. Under the proposal, large bank holding companies\nand IDIs would each be required to maintain a minimum amount of eligible long-term debt equal to the greater of\n6 percent of RWA, 3.5 percent of average total consolidated assets, and 2.5 percent of total leverage exposure\nfor those banks subject to the supplementary leverage ratio. The proposal also prohibits large banking\norganizations from engaging in certain activities that could complicate their resolution and discourages them\nfrom holding long-term debt issued by other banks to reduce interconnectedness. The proposal provides for a\nthree-year transition period, with 25 percent of the long-term debt requirement to be met one year after the\nrule is finalized, 50 percent after two years, and 100 percent after three years. Comments on the proposal were\ndue by January 16, 2024. We continue to evaluate the full impact of the proposal.\nStandards for Safety and Soundness\nThe FDIA requires the federal banking regulators to prescribe operational and managerial standards for\nall IDIs, including CBNA. Regulations and interagency guidelines adopted by these agencies set forth the safety\nand soundness standards used to identify and address problems at IDIs before capital becomes impaired. If an\nagency determines that a bank fails to satisfy any standard, it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan\nto achieve compliance, consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness\ncompliance plans. If, after being notified to submit a compliance plan, an institution fails to submit an\nacceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the\nagency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other\ntypes of actions that an undercapitalized institution is subject to under the FDIA as discussed in “Federal Deposit\nInsurance Act” below. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such\norder in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 14\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act\nThe FDIA requires, among other things, that federal banking regulators take “prompt corrective action”\nwith respect to IDIs that do not meet minimum capital requirements, as described above in “Capital and Stress\nTesting Requirements.” The FDIA sets forth the following five capital categories: “well-capitalized,” “adequately\ncapitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” An IDI’s\ncapital category is determined based on how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures\nand certain other factors that are established by regulation. The federal banking regulators must take certain\nmandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to\ninstitutions that are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, with the\nactions becoming more restrictive and punitive the lower the institution’s capital category. Under existing rules,\nan IDI that is not an advanced approaches institution, such as CBNA, is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a\nCET1 ratio of at least 6.5%, a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, a total capital ratio of at least 10%, and a tier 1\nleverage ratio of at least 5%.\nThe FRB’s regulations which are applicable to BHCs, such as the Parent Company, separately define “well\ncapitalized”as having a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6% and a total capital ratio of at least 10%. As described\nabove under “Bank and Financial Holding Company Regulation”, a FHC that is not well capitalized and well\nmanaged (or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed) under applicable prompt\ncorrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose FHC status. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, both the Parent Company and CBNA were well-capitalized.\nThe FDIA prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any\ndeposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally, depending\nupon where the deposits are solicited, unless it is “well-capitalized,” or it is “adequately capitalized” and\nreceives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is “adequately capitalized” and accepts brokered deposits under a\nwaiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain\nprevailing market rates. The FDIA imposes no such restrictions on a bank that is “well-capitalized.”\nDeposit Insurance\nThe DIF provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, up to a standard maximum deposit insurance\namount of $250,000 per depositor based on ownership right and capacity category codes and is funded through\nassessments on IDIs based on the risk each institution poses to the DIF. CBNA accepts customer deposits insured\nby the DIF and, therefore, must pay insurance premiums. The FDIC may increase CBNA’s insurance premiums\nbased on various factors, including the FDIC’s assessment of its risk profile. The FDIC also requires large\ndepository institutions, including CBNA, to maintain enhanced deposit account recordkeeping and related\ninformation technology system capabilities to facilitate prompt calculation of insured deposits if such an\ninstitution was taken into FDIC receivership.\nThe FDIC, as required under the FDIA, established a plan in September 2020 to restore the DIF reserve\nratio, 1.13% as of September 30, 2023, to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of 1.35% within eight years.\nThis plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate. During 2022, the FDIC determined\nthat the DIF reserve ratio was at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of\nSeptember 30, 2028, absent an increase in assessment rates. In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to\nincrease initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning with the first quarterly\nassessment period of 2023. This increase in assessment rates was intended to improve the likelihood that the DIF\nreserve ratio will reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028.\nIn November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to impose special assessments to recover the loss to the\nDIF arising from the protection of uninsured depositors in connection with the systemic risk determination\nannounced on March 12, 2023, following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, as required by\nthe FDIA. Under the final rule, the special assessment is levied on an IDI’s assessment base, which is equal to\nestimated uninsured deposits as reported on the institution’s December 31, 2022 Call Report, excluding the first\n$5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits. The special assessment is imposed at an annual rate of approximately\n13.4 basis points and will be collected over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarter of\n2024.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 15\nThe FDIC’s current estimate of the loss attributable to this systemic risk determination is $16.3 billion.\nThis estimate will be periodically adjusted as assets are sold, liabilities are satisfied, and receivership expenses\nare incurred. The FDIC would cease collection of special assessments before the end of the initial eight-quarter\ncollection period if they expect the loss to be less than expected assessment collections. The FDIC also reserves\nthe right to impose an extended special assessment collection period after the initial eight-quarter period to\ncollect the difference between losses and amounts collected, and impose a one-time final shortfall special\nassessment after both receiverships terminate.\nBased on the final rule and related accounting guidance, CBNA’s special assessment is approximately\n$225 million and was recognized in other operating expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of\nOperations for the year ended December 31, 2023. CBNA’s special assessment is subject to change if the eventual\nloss to the DIF differs from the FDIC’s current estimate.\nDividends\nVarious federal statutory provisions and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount\nof dividends that we and our subsidiaries may pay.\nOur payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to oversight by the FRB. In particular, the FRB\nreviews the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large BHC based on capital plans submitted as part of\nthe CCAR process and the results of stress tests, as discussed above. In addition to other limitations, our ability\nto make any capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, is subject to the prior approval of\nthe FRB if we are required to resubmit our capital plan. See “Capital and Stress Testing Requirements” above.\nDividends payable by CBNA, as a national bank subsidiary, are limited to the lesser of the amount\ncalculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test. Under the recent earnings test, a\ndividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared during any calendar year exceeds the sum of\ncurrent year net income and retained net income of the two preceding years, less any required transfers to\nsurplus, unless the national bank obtains the approval of the OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend\nmay not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” (generally accumulated net profits that have not\nbeen paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). Federal banking regulatory agencies have issued policy\nstatements that provide that FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally\npay dividends only out of current operating earnings.\nSupport of Subsidiary Bank\nThe Parent Company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to CBNA and,\nunder appropriate conditions, to commit resources to support CBNA. This support may be required by the FRB at\ntimes when the Parent Company may not have the financial resources to do so, or when doing so may not serve\nour interests or those of our shareholders or creditors. In addition, any capital loans by a BHC to a subsidiary\nbank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In\nthe event of a BHC’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain\nthe capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.\nTransactions with Affiliates and Insiders\nSections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act establish certain quantitative limits and other prudential\nrequirements for loans, purchases of assets, and certain other transactions between a member bank or its\nsubsidiaries and its affiliates. The term “member bank” includes national banks such as CBNA.\nSection 23A prohibits a bank from entering a “covered transaction” with an affiliate if, after the\ntransaction, the aggregate amount of the bank’s covered transactions with that affiliate would exceed 10% of the\nbank’s capital stock and surplus, or the aggregate amount of the bank’s covered transactions with all of its\naffiliates would exceed 20% of the bank’s capital stock and surplus. Covered transactions include loans and other\nextensions of credit to an affiliate, investments in the securities of an affiliate, purchases of assets from an\naffiliate, and certain other transactions that expose the bank to the credit risks of its affiliates.\nSection 23B of the Federal Reserve Act requires that transactions, including all covered transactions, be\non terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for\ncomparable transactions with non-affiliates (the “Market Terms Requirement”). In addition to covered\ntransactions, the Market Terms Requirement applies to certain other transactions between CBNA and its\naffiliates, including services between CBNA and the Parent Company and loans to CBNA from the Parent\nCompany.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 16\nUnder sections 22(g) and (h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation O, we are also subject\nto quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and\ntheir related interests. These extensions of credit may not exceed certain quantitative limits, must be made on\nsubstantially the same terms as those currently prevailing in the market for comparable transactions with third\nparties, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.\nCertain extensions of credit also require the approval of our Board.\nVolcker Rule\nThe Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing\nin, sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as certain hedge funds or private equity\nfunds. This statutory provision is commonly called the “Volcker Rule.” Under this rule, we are viewed as having\n“moderate” trading assets and liabilities, which subjects us to a simplified compliance program requirement that\nis appropriate for our activities, size, scope, and complexity. This Volcker Rule does not have a material impact\non Citizens.\nConsumer Financial Protection Regulations\nThe retail activities of banks are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect\nconsumers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include, but are\nnot limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting\nAct, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the\nExpedited Funds Availability Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Funds\nTransfer Act, and their respective federal regulations and state law counterparts.\nIn addition to these federal laws and regulations, the guidance and interpretations of the various federal\nagencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such regulations also influence loan and deposit\noperations.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over various\nconsumer financial protection laws, including those referenced above, fair lending laws and certain other\nstatutes. The CFPB also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository\ninstitutions with $10 billion or more in assets, including the authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts\nor practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The OCC also examines our retail\nactivities.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and standards than those\nadopted at the federal level, and in certain circumstances allows state attorneys general to enforce compliance\nwith both the state and federal laws and regulations on banks like us.\nProtection of Customer Personal Information and Cybersecurity\nThe privacy provisions of GLBA generally prohibit financial institutions, including us, from disclosing\nnonpublic personal financial information of consumer customers to third parties for certain purposes unless\ncustomers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts information\nsharing among affiliates for marketing purposes. Both the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, which are\nissued by the FRB, govern the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies.\nThe federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance\ncyber risk management standards among financial institutions. Financial institutions are expected to design\nmultiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management\nprocesses also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to\nreliably authenticate customers when accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. Further, a\nfinancial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to\nensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack\ninvolving destructive malware or other compromise of customer data and/or systems. A financial institution is\nalso expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address\nrebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to\nthis type of cyber-attack or compromise. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to\nvarious regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. For a further discussion of risks related to\ncybersecurity, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.”\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 17\nA financial institution is also required to notify its primary banking regulator within 36 hours of computer-\nsecurity incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or\ndegrade its:\n• ability to carry out banking operations, activities, or processes, or deliver banking products and\nservices to a material portion of its customer base;\n• business lines, including associated operations, services, functions, and support, that upon failure\nwould result in a material loss of revenue, profit, or franchise value; or\n• operations, including associated services, functions, and support, the failure or discontinuance of\nwhich would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.\nIn addition, in August 2023, the SEC adopted a final rule that requires the disclosure of material\ncybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K. Registrants must describe the material aspects of the nature, scope and\ntiming of the incident, as well as the impact of the incident on the registrant. The final rule also requires\nregistrants to describe, on Form 10-K, their processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from\ncybersecurity threats and whether such risks have materially affected the registrant. Registrants must also\ndescribe Board oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and management’s role and expertise in assessing\nand managing material risks from such threats. See Item 1C “Cybersecurity” for more information.\nState regulators have also been active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and\nregulations. Recently, several states have adopted laws and regulations requiring certain financial institutions to\nimplement cybersecurity programs and provide details with respect to these programs. In addition, many states\nhave recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. We expect\nthis trend of state-level activity to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which\nwe operate.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nThe CRA requires CBNA’s primary federal bank regulatory agency, the OCC, to evaluate the bank’s record\nin meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods\nand individuals. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve,”\nor “Substantial Noncompliance.” A bank’s CRA record is considered by regulatory agencies in evaluating mergers,\nacquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. In addition, the CRA record of a subsidiary bank of a\nFHC is considered if a FHC wishes to commence certain new financial activities or to acquire a company engaged\nin such activities, which requires a rating of at least “satisfactory.” CBNA received an “Outstanding” rating on its\nmost recent CRA evaluation.\nOn October 24, 2023, the federal banking regulators issued a joint final rule that revises the agencies’\nCRA regulations. The primary provisions of the final rule, along with the most significant changes from the\nexisting CRA regulatory framework, are outlined below:\n• a tiered evaluation framework is established based on a bank’s asset size, similar to the existing CRA\nregulatory framework;\n• the geographic area in which banks may be evaluated for performance is expanded to include areas\noutside of where they have physical locations in order to capture the varied activities a bank\nconducts, such as online and mobile banking, and the communities in which it operates;\n• bank retail lending and community development financing will be evaluated using a new metrics-\nbased approach; and\n• clarifies eligible CRA activities, such as affordable housing.\nThe final rule takes effect on April 1, 2024, with staggered compliance dates of January 1, 2026, and\nJanuary 1, 2027 for certain reporting requirements. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the final\nrule on our business.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 18\nCompensation\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal banking regulators. Guidance issued\nby the federal banking regulators is designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements take into\naccount risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key\nprinciples with respect to incentive compensation arrangements:\n• the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and\nfinancial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to\nimprudent risk;\n• the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and\n• the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance.\nThe U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB, the OCC and the SEC, jointly proposed regulations in\n2011 and again in 2016 to implement the incentive compensation requirements of Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank\nAct. These regulations have not been finalized.\nAnti-Money Laundering\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and the Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering (“AML”) and financial\ntransparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering\nand terrorist financing activities. The BSA, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires depository institutions and\ntheir holding companies to maintain an AML program, verify the identity of customers and certain beneficial\nowners for legal entity customers, monitor for and report suspicious transactions, report on cash transactions\nexceeding specified thresholds, and respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law\nenforcement agencies. We are also required to provide our employees with AML training, designate an AML\ncompliance officer, and undergo an annual, independent audit to assess the effectiveness of our AML program.\nWe have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with these AML\nrequirements. Financial services regulators are focusing their examinations on AML compliance, and we continue\nto monitor and augment, where necessary, our AML compliance programs. The federal banking agencies are\nrequired, when reviewing bank and bank holding company acquisition or merger applications, to take into\naccount the effectiveness of the AML activities of the applicants.\nThe Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (“AMLA”), enacted in January 2021 as part of the National\nDefense Authorization Act, requires the U.S. Treasury Department to issue National Anti-Money Laundering and\nCountering the Financing of Terrorism Priorities and conduct studies and issue regulations that may, over the\nnext few years, significantly alter some of the due diligence, recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the\nBSA and the Patriot Act impose on financial institutions. The AMLA also increases penalties for violations of the\nBSA and significantly expands a whistleblower award program both of which could increase the prospect of\nregulatory enforcement. In 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S.\nTreasury Department, issued the priorities for AML and countering the financing of terrorism policy, as required\nunder the AMLA. These priorities include corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime,\ndrug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing.\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control Regulation\nThe U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries,\nnationals and others, that are administered by OFAC. OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many\ndifferent forms and generally contain one or more of the following elements:\n• restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct\nor indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons\nengaging in financial transactions relating to, making investments in, or providing investment-related\nadvice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and\n• a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned\ncountry have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including\nproperty in the possession or control of U.S. persons. Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank\ndeposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from\nOFAC.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 19\nLists including the names of individuals and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in\nterrorist acts, including the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, is published and routinely\nupdated by OFAC. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such\ntargets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked\ntransactions after they occur. If we identify a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an\nOFAC list we must freeze the associated account, file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate\nauthorities. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.\nRegulation of Broker-Dealers\nOur subsidiaries, Citizens Securities, Inc., and Citizens JMP Securities, LLC are registered broker-dealers\nwith the SEC and subject to regulation and examination by the SEC as well as FINRA and other self-regulatory\norganizations. These regulations cover a broad range of matters, including capital requirements; sales and\ntrading practices; use of client funds and securities; the conduct of directors, officers and employees; record-\nkeeping and recording; supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information;\nqualification and licensing of sales personnel; and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions.\nIn addition to federal registration, state securities commissions require the registration of certain broker-dealers.\nHeightened Risk Governance Standards\nCBNA is subject to OCC guidelines that impose heightened risk governance standards on large national\nbanks with average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The guidelines set forth minimum standards\nfor the design and implementation of a bank’s risk governance framework and its associated oversight by a bank’s\nboard of directors. The guidelines are intended to protect the safety and soundness of covered banks and\nimprove the ability of bank examiners to assess compliance with the OCC’s expectations. Under the guidelines, a\nbank may use the risk governance framework of its parent company if it meets the minimum standards and the\nrisk profiles of the parent company and the covered bank are substantially the same, along with certain other\nconditions. CBNA has elected to use the Parent Company’s risk governance framework. A bank’s board of\ndirectors is required to have two members who are independent of bank and parent company management,\nensure that the risk governance framework meets the appropriate standards, provide active oversight and a\ncredible challenge to management’s recommendations and decisions, and ensure that decisions made by the\nparent company do not jeopardize the safety and soundness of the bank.\nIntellectual Property\nIn the highly competitive banking industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks and logos are\nimportant to the success of our business. We own and license a variety of trademarks, service marks, logos and\npending registrations and are spending significant resources to develop our stand-alone brands.\nWebsite Access to Citizens’ Filings with the SEC and Corporate Governance Information\nWe maintain a website at investor.citizensbank.com. We make available on our website, free of charge,\nour annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, including\nexhibits, and amendments to those reports that are filed or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934. These documents are made available on our website as soon as reasonably\npracticable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The SEC also maintains an internet\nsite (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding\nissuers that file electronically with the SEC. Information about our Board and its committees and corporate\ngovernance, including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, is available on our website at\ninvestor.citizensbank.com/about-us/investor-relations/corporate-governance.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and cash flows. As a financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in our\ntransactions and operations and the business decisions we make. Therefore, we encounter risk as part of the\nnormal course of our business and design a risk management framework and associated processes to help manage\nthese risks.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 20\nOur success is dependent on our ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by our\nbusiness activities so that we can appropriately balance risk taking with revenue generation and profitability. We\ndiscuss the primary risks we face and our risk management framework and associated processes and strategies in\nthe “Risk Governance” section in Item 7.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors that may affect our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations or cash flows. Other factors that could affect us are discussed in the “Forward-Looking\nStatements” section above. However, there may be additional risks that are not currently material or known, and\nfactors besides those discussed below, or in this or other reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, that could\nadversely affect us. Therefore, the risks described in the risk factors below should not be considered a complete\nlist of risks that we may encounter.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy.\nOur business strategy is designed to maximize the full potential of our business and drive sustainable\ngrowth and enhanced profitability, with our success resting on our ability to distinguish ourselves. Our future\nsuccess and the value of our stock depends, in part, on our ability to effectively implement our business strategy,\nincluding the cost savings and efficiency components, and achieve our financial performance goals, including the\nanticipated benefits of the Private Bank start-up investment and Investors acquisition. There are risks and\nuncertainties, many of which are not within our control, associated with each element of our strategy. If we are\nnot able to successfully execute our business strategy, we may not achieve our financial performance goals and\nany shortfall may be material. See the “Business Strategy” section in Item 1 for further information.\nSupervisory requirements and expectations on us as a financial holding company and a bank\nholding company and any regulator-imposed limits on our activities could adversely affect our ability to\nimplement our strategic plan, expand our business, continue to improve our financial performance and\nmake capital distributions to our stockholders.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the federal banking\nregulators, as well as the CFPB. As part of the supervisory and examination process, if we are unsuccessful in\nmeeting the requirements and expectations that apply to us, regulatory agencies may from time to time take\nsupervisory actions against us that may not be publicly disclosed. Such actions may include restrictions on our\nactivities or the activities of our subsidiaries, informal (nonpublic) or formal (public) supervisory actions or public\nenforcement actions, including the payment of civil money penalties, which could increase our costs and limit\nour ability to implement our strategic plans and expand our business, and as a result could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See the “Regulation and Supervision”\nsection in Item 1 for further information.\nDifficult economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, would likely have an adverse effect\non our business, financial position and results of operations.\nFrom March 2022 to July 2023, the FRB raised its benchmark interest rate eleven times in response to\ninflationary pressures throughout the economy. Financial markets remain volatile amidst the uncertainty of\neconomic conditions, including potential recessionary conditions. Changes in interest rates can affect numerous\naspects of our business and may impact our future performance. Also, see “Changes in interest rates may have an\nadverse effect on our profitability” below for more information on the risks associated with changes in interest\nrates.\nProlonged periods of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our costs and\nexpenses, including increasing funding costs and expense related to talent acquisition and retention, and\nnegatively impacting consumer demand and client purchasing power for our products and services. If significant\ninflation continues, our business could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased default rates\nleading to credit losses which could adversely impact our earnings and capital.\nAny of the effects of these adverse economic conditions would likely have an adverse impact on our\nearnings, with the significance of the impact generally depending on the nature and severity of the economic\nconditions.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 21\nOur ability to meet our obligations, and the cost of funds to do so, depend on our ability to access\nidentified sources of liquidity at a reasonable cost.\nLiquidity risk is the risk arising from the inability to meet our obligations when they come due. We must\nmaintain adequate funding to meet current and future obligations, including customer loan requests, customer\ndeposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, equipment and premises leases, and other cash commitments,\nunder both normal operating conditions and under periods of company-specific and/or market stress.\nWe primarily rely on customer deposits to be a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. In\naddition to customer deposits, our funding sources also include our ability to securitize loans in secondary\nmarkets, raise funds in the debt and equity capital markets, pledge loans and/or securities for borrowing from\nthe FHLB, pledge securities as collateral for borrowing under repurchase agreements, and sell AFS securities.\nOur ability to meet our obligations and support our operations could be materially affected by a variety\nof conditions, including market-wide illiquidity or disruption, a loss of market or customer confidence in the\nfinancial services industry generally or in the Company specifically, or reductions in one or more of our credit\nratings. This could limit our ability to retain our deposits, securitize or sell assets, access the debt or equity\ncapital markets, or otherwise borrow money at a reasonable cost. Additionally, these conditions, among others,\nif severe enough, could create unanticipated material outflows of cash due to, among other factors, draws on\nunfunded commitments or deposit attrition, which could have significant adverse impact on our liquidity.\nFurther, changes to the FHLB’s or the FRB’s underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies\nmay limit or restrict our ability to borrow, and therefore could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity.\nChanges in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our liquidity and profitability.\nChanges in interest rates can have a material impact on the value of our securities, a primary objective\nof which is to provide a ready source of contingent liquidity. An increase in rates could lower the collateral value\nof these securities, reducing the amount we could borrow, and lead to losses in the event of their sale.\nSince our earning assets are primarily in the form of loans and debt securities, changes in interest rates\ncan have a material impact our net interest income, net interest margin, fee income, and credit costs. Changes\nin interest rates can affect our net interest income and margin as our asset yields and funding costs may not rise\nor fall in parallel, causing our net interest income to increase or decrease and our margin to expand or contract.\nIf our funding costs rise faster than our asset yields, or if our asset yields fall faster than our funding costs, our\nnet interest income could decrease, and our margin could contract.\nAn increase in interest rates could cause lower demand for loans by customers, reducing our net interest\nincome due to lower loan balances and origination-related fee income due to lower production volume, and could\nalso have an adverse impact on our credit costs, as borrowers may have difficulty in making higher interest\npayments. Additionally, an increase in rates could cause recognition of losses on the debt securities in our AFS\nportfolio if the securities needed to be sold.\nSimilarly, a decrease in interest rates could lower our net interest income, net interest margin and fee\nincome. We may be adversely affected by a prolonged period of low interest rates as it may result in us holding\nlower yielding loans and securities should rates rise rapidly after the period of low interest rates.\nChanges in the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates (i.e., the yield curve) can also\nhave a material impact on our net interest income and net interest margin. Typically, the yield curve is upward\nsloping, with short-term rates being lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve flattens or inverts, our net\ninterest income and net interest margin may decrease if the cost of our short-term funding increases relative to\nthe yield we can earn on our long-term assets.\nInterest rates and the yield curve are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control,\nincluding general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in\nparticular, the Federal Open Market Committee. Although we have policies and procedures designed to manage\nour interest rate risks, as further discussed in the “Risk Governance” section in Item 7, there can be no assurance\nthat these policies and procedures will be effective in avoiding material adverse effects on our profitability.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 22\nWe could fail to attract, retain or motivate highly-skilled and qualified personnel, including our\nsenior management, other key employees or members of our Board, which could impair our ability to\nsuccessfully execute our strategic plan and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to implement our strategic plan and our future success depends on our ability to attract,\nretain and motivate highly-skilled and qualified personnel, including our senior management and other key\nemployees and directors. The marketplace for skilled personnel continues to be competitive, which means the\ncost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to rise. The failure to attract and retain\nhighly skilled and qualified personnel could place us at a significant competitive disadvantage and impair our\nability to implement our strategic plan successfully and achieve our performance targets, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLimitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions, such as us, can compensate their\nofficers and employees, including those contained in pending rule proposals implementing the requirements of\nSection 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act, may make it more difficult for such institutions to compete for talent with\nfinancial institutions and other companies not subject to these or similar limitations. If we are unable to compete\neffectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps\nmaterially.\nA reduction in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nCredit ratings affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding. Rating agencies\nregularly evaluate us, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and\nconditions affecting the financial services industry generally. Any downgrade in our ratings would likely increase\nour borrowing costs and could limit our access to capital markets, which would adversely affect our business. For\nexample, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect our ability to sell or market our securities, including long-\nterm debt, engage in certain longer-term derivatives transactions and retain our customers, particularly\ncorporate customers who may require a minimum rating threshold in order to place funds with us. In addition,\nunder the terms of our derivatives contracts, we may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating, post\nadditional collateral or terminate such contracts. Any of these results of a ratings downgrade could increase our\ncost of funding, reduce our liquidity and have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. For more information regarding our credit ratings, see the “Liquidity” section in Item 7.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by deterioration in borrower credit quality.\nRisks arising from actual or perceived changes in credit quality and uncertainty over the recoverability of\namounts due from borrowers is inherent in our businesses. If the economic environment were to deteriorate,\nmore of our borrowers may have difficulty in repaying their loans which could result in higher credit losses and\nincreased loan loss provision expense. Further, our credit risk and credit losses may increase to the extent our\nloans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, collateral type, borrower type, or location of the\ncollateral or borrower.\nA significant portion of our earnings assets are in the form of loans to borrowers across the U.S.,\nprimarily for residential, commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, education, auto and other retail\npurposes. A deterioration in economic conditions or changes in consumer or business behavior that negatively\nimpacts home property or commercial property values could, in event of the borrower’s default, result in\nmaterially higher credit losses. Similarly, higher unemployment levels and higher interest rates can adversely\naffect our customers’ ability to repay their loans, which can negatively impact our credit performance.\nThe credit quality of our borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside our control,\nincluding prevailing economic and market conditions and collateral valuations. The trends and risks affecting\nborrower credit quality have caused, and in the future may cause, us to experience credit losses, impairment\ncharges, increased repurchase demands, higher recovery costs, and an inability to engage in routine funding\ntransactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 23\nOur framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nOur risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage our risk\nexposure. The framework to manage risk, including the framework’s underlying assumptions, may not be\neffective under all conditions and circumstances. If the risk management framework proves ineffective, we could\nsuffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nOne of the main types of risks inherent in our business is credit risk. An important feature of our credit\nrisk management system is to employ an internal credit risk control system through which we identify, measure,\nmonitor and mitigate the existing and emerging credit risk of our customers. This process involves a detailed\nanalysis of the customer or credit risk, taking into account both quantitative and qualitative factors, and is\ninherently subject to human error. In exercising their judgment, our employees may not always be able to assign\nan accurate credit rating to a customer or credit risk, which may result in our exposure to higher credit risks than\nindicated by our risk rating system.\nIn addition, we have undertaken certain actions to enhance our credit policies and guidelines to address\npotential risks associated with particular industries or types of customers. However, we may not be able to\neffectively implement these initiatives, or consistently follow and refine our credit risk management system. If\nany of the foregoing were to occur, it may result in an increase in the level of nonaccrual loans and a higher risk\nexposure for us, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we\nreport our financial results and condition.\nThe FASB and SEC periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the\naccounting for our financial results and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes\ncan be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of\noperations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would\nresult in the recasting of our prior period financial statements.\nOur financial and accounting estimates and risk management framework rely on analytical\nforecasting and models.\nThe processes we use to estimate loan losses, measure the fair value of financial instruments and\nestimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results\nof operations are reliant upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. Some of our tools and metrics for\nmanaging risk are based on observed historical market behavior, and we rely on quantitative models to measure\nrisks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in processes such as determining the pricing of\nvarious products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting\nlosses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as estimating the value of\nfinancial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models could adversely affect\nour business decisions if the information is inadequate. In addition, our models may fail to predict future risk\nexposures if the information used is inaccurate, obsolete or not sufficiently comparable to actual events as they\noccur. We seek to incorporate appropriate historical data in our models, but the range of market values and\nbehaviors reflected in any period of historical data is not always predictive of future developments in any\nparticular period and the period of data we incorporate into our models may turn out to be inappropriate for the\nfuture period being modeled. In these instances, our ability to manage risk would be limited and our risk\nexposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated, which could harm our reputation\nand adversely affect our revenues and profits. Finally, information provided to our regulators based on poorly\ndesigned or implemented models could be inaccurate or insufficient. Some of the decisions that our regulators\nmake, including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders, could be adversely affected due to\ntheir perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 24\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make subjective determinations and use\nestimates that may vary from actual results and materially impact our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to\nmake significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Our accounting policies and methods are\nfundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations and, at times, require\nmanagement to exercise judgment in their application so as to report our financial condition and results of\noperations in the most appropriate manner. Certain accounting policies are critical because they require\nmanagement to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and\nthe likelihood that materially different estimates would result under different conditions or through the\nutilization of different assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates include the ACL, estimations of fair value\nand review of goodwill for impairment. If our estimates are inaccurate or need to be adjusted periodically, our\nfinancial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted. For more information regarding our\nuse of estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, see Note 1 in Item 8 and the\n“Critical Accounting Estimates” section in Item 7.\nOperational risks are inherent in our businesses.\nOur operations depend on our ability to process a very large number of transactions efficiently and\naccurately while complying with applicable laws and regulations. Operational risk and losses can result from\ninternal and external fraud; improper conduct or errors by employees or third parties; failure to document\ntransactions properly or to obtain proper authorization; failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory\nrequirements and business conduct rules; equipment failures, including those caused by natural disasters or by\nelectrical, telecommunications or other essential utility outages; business continuity and data security system\nfailures, including those caused by computer viruses, cyber-attacks against us or our vendors, or unforeseen\nproblems encountered while implementing new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems; or the\ninadequacy or failure of systems and controls, including those of our suppliers or counterparties. Although we\nimplement risk controls and loss mitigation actions and devote substantial resources to developing efficient\nprocedures, identifying and rectifying weaknesses in existing procedures and training staff, it is not possible to be\ncertain that such actions have been or will be effective in controlling each of the operational risks we face. Any\nweakness in these systems or controls, or any breaches or alleged breaches of such laws or regulations, could\nresult in increased regulatory supervision, enforcement actions and other disciplinary action, and have an\nadverse impact on our business, applicable authorizations and licenses, reputation and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry, including the banking sector, continues to make technological\nenhancements to meet customer preferences, as well as meet legal and regulatory requirements, and we\nmay not be able to compete effectively as a result of these changes.\nTechnology within the financial services industry continues to evolve and new, unexpected technological\nchanges could have a transformative effect on the way banks offer products and services. We believe our success\ndepends, to a great extent, on our ability to utilize technology to offer products and services that address the\nneeds of our customers and to create efficiencies in our operations. However, we may not be able to, among\nother things, keep up with the rapid pace of technological changes, effectively implement new technology-driven\nproducts and services, or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. As a result,\nour ability to compete effectively to attract or retain business may be impaired, and our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, changes in the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate require us to update\nour information systems to ensure compliance. Our need to review and evaluate the impact of ongoing rule\nproposals, final rules and implementation guidance from regulators further complicates the development and\nimplementation of new information systems for our business. Regulatory guidance continues to be focused on the\nneed for financial institutions to perform appropriate due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor\nrelationships, thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the efficiency otherwise\nresulting from our relationships with third-party technology providers. Given the significant number of ongoing\nregulatory reform initiatives, it is possible that we incur higher than expected information technology costs in\norder to comply with current and impending regulations. Also, see “Supervisory requirements and expectations\non us as a financial holding company and a bank holding company and any regulator-imposed limits on our\nactivities could adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic plan, expand our business, continue to\nimprove our financial performance and make capital distributions to our stockholders.”\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 25\nWe are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect how we\nconduct our business.\nEvolving technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers,\nterrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties present a significant information security risk to\nlarge financial institutions such as us. Third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present\noperational and information security risks to us, including security breaches or failures of their own systems.\nRisks related to cyber-attacks on our vendors and other third parties, including supply chain attacks affecting our\nsoftware and information technology service providers, are on the rise as such attacks become more frequent and\nsevere. Employee error, failure to follow security procedures, or malfeasance also present these risks. Our\noperations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer\nsystems and networks as well as in the third-party computer systems and networks used to provide products and\nservices on our behalf. Although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and\ncontrols based on our adherence to applicable laws and regulations and industry standards, our technologies,\nsystems, and networks may be the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in\nthe unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, theft, sale or loss or destruction of the confidential\nand/or proprietary information of CFG, and our customers, vendors, counterparties, or employees. We and our\nthird-party vendors are under continuous threat of loss or network degradation due to cyber-attacks, such as\ncomputer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, ransomware, and Distributed Denial of Service\n(“DDoS”) attacks (collectively, “fraudulent schemes”). Also, our customers are routinely the target of fraudulent\nschemes. This is especially true as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize the Internet and other\nremote channels to transact business. Two of the most significant cyber-attack risks that we face as a result of\nthese fraudulent schemes are potential loss of funds resulting from customers falling victim to cybercriminal\ncommunications directed to them or unauthorized access to sensitive customer data. Cybercriminals can use\nfraudulent schemes directly targeting our customers or our own systems to compromise and directly extract\nfunds from a customer’s account or access sensitive customer data. Certain technology protections such as\nCustomer Profiling and Step-Up Authentications are implemented so that we are compliant with the FFIEC\nAuthentication and Access to Financial Institution Services and Systems guidelines.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to\ncontinue to modify or enhance our layers of defense, to investigate and remediate any information security\nvulnerabilities internally, to assess and mitigate issues associated with customers that have fallen victim to\nfraudulent schemes, and perform additional due diligence with respect to our third-party vendors. System\nenhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating\nthem with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the\nprocess of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of system disruptions and security issues. In\naddition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may\naffect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software\nproviders to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional\nrisks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors. Cyber-attacks against the\npatches themselves have also proven to be a significant risk that companies will have to address going forward.\nDespite our efforts to prevent a cyber-attack, a successful cyber-attack could persist for an extended\nperiod of time before being detected, and, following detection, could take considerable time for us to obtain full\nand reliable information about the cybersecurity incident and the extent, amount and type of information\ncompromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not necessarily know the full effects of the incident\nor how to remediate it, and actions and decisions that are taken or made in an effort to mitigate risk may further\nincrease the costs and other negative consequences of the incident. Moreover, new regulations may require us to\ndisclose information about a cybersecurity event before it has been resolved or fully investigated.\nThe techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can\nbe initiated from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These\nactors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other third-party users of our systems to\ndisclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or our systems. In the event that a cyber-attack is\nsuccessful, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. For a discussion\nof the guidance that regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards, see\nthe “Regulation and Supervision” section of Item 1.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 26\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business.\nAny failure, interruption or breach in the security of our communication and information systems,\nincluding due to cyber-attacks or our failure to adequately maintain and manage our systems or implement\nsystem changes and upgrades, could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management,\ngeneral ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. Although our policies and procedures are designed to prevent or\nlimit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be\nno assurance that these policies and procedures will be successful and that any such failure, interruption or\nsecurity breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any\nfailure, interruption or security breach of our information systems could require us to devote substantial\nresources to recovery and response efforts, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject\nus to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Although we\nmaintain insurance coverage for information security events, we may incur losses as a result of such events that\nare not insured against or not fully covered by our insurance.\nWe rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology.\nWe rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology\nfunctions and the provision of information technology and business process services including, but not limited to,\nthe operation of our data communications networks, hosted services, and a wide range of other support services.\nThe success of our business depends in part on the continuing ability of third parties to perform these functions\nand services in a timely and satisfactory manner, which performance could be disrupted or otherwise adversely\naffected due to failures or other information security events originating at the third parties or at the third\nparties’ suppliers or vendors (so-called “fourth party risk”). We may not be able to effectively monitor or\nmitigate third or fourth-party risk, in particular as it relates to the use of common suppliers or vendors by the\nthird parties that perform functions and services for us. If we experience a disruption in the provision of any\nfunctions or services performed by third parties, we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms\nfavorable to us and in reasonable time frames. If these services are not performed in a satisfactory manner, we\nwould not be able to adequately serve our customers. In either situation, our business could incur significant\ncosts and be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to reputational risk and the risk of damage to our brands and the brands of our\naffiliates.\nOur success and results depend on our reputation and the strength of our brands. We are vulnerable to\nadverse market perception as we operate in an industry where integrity, customer trust and confidence are\nparamount. We are exposed to the risk that litigation, employee misconduct, operational failures, the outcome\nof regulatory or other investigations or actions, press speculation and negative publicity, perception of our\nenvironmental, social and governance practices and disclosures, among other factors, could damage our brands\nor reputation. Our brands and reputation could also be harmed if we sell products or services that do not perform\nas expected or customers’ expectations for the product are not satisfied.\nUnpredictable catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events\nand other large-scale catastrophes, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and\nresults of operations.\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorists attacks, extreme weather events,\nsuch as hurricanes, tropical storms, or tornadoes, and other large-scale catastrophes could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base,\nimpair the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, and\ncause significant property damage or operational disruptions, resulting in loss of revenue or causing us to incur\nadditional expenses.\nFurthermore, although we maintain both business continuity and disaster recovery plans, if a terrorist\nattack, extreme weather event, or other catastrophe rendered our production and recovery data unusable, there\ncan be no assurance that these plans and related capabilities will adequately protect us from such events, and\nour business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhile the U.S. economy has generally recovered since the onset of the COVID disruption, a resurgence of\npandemic conditions could reintroduce, or intensify, these impacts and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations, as well as our liquidity and capital profile.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 27\nThe effects of geopolitical instability may adversely affect us and create significant risks and\nuncertainties for our business, with the ultimate impact dependent on future developments, which are\nhighly uncertain and unpredictable.\nOngoing geopolitical instability, such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, has negatively\nimpacted, and could in the future negatively impact, the global and U.S. economies, including by causing supply\nchain disruptions, rising prices for oil and other commodities, volatility in capital markets and foreign currency\nexchange rates, rising interest rates and heightened cybersecurity risks. The extent to which such geopolitical\ninstability adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our liquidity\nand capital profile, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including\nthe extent and duration of the wars and the associated immeasurable humanitarian toll inflicted as a result. If\ngeopolitical instability adversely affects us, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks related to our\nbusiness.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nAny deterioration in national economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is affected by national economic conditions, as well as perceptions of those conditions and\nfuture economic prospects. Changes in such economic conditions are not predictable and cannot be controlled.\nAdverse economic conditions, such as recent inflationary pressures, could require us to charge off a higher\npercentage of loans and increase the provision for credit losses, which would reduce our net income and\notherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in an industry that is highly competitive, which could result in losing business or margin\ndeclines and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which could become even more competitive as a result of\nlegislative, regulatory and technological changes, as well as continued consolidation. We face aggressive\ncompetition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial\nservices, including non-banking financial institutions that are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as\nbanks and BHCs, securities firms and insurance companies, and competitors that may have greater financial\nresources.\nWith respect to non-banking financial institutions, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to\nentry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. For\nexample, consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage\naccounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring\nfunds directly without the assistance of banks. In addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new\ntechnologies that do not require intermediation, including distributed ledgers such as digital assets and\nblockchain, as well as advances in robotic process automation, could significantly affect the competition for\nfinancial services. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as “disintermediation,” could result\nin the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those\ndeposits. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and,\ntherefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. As a result of these and other sources of\ncompetition, we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less\nadvantageous terms to retain or attract clients, either of which would adversely affect our profitability.\nClimate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our operations,\nbusinesses and customers.\nThere is increasing global concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental\nsustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding and\nwildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and\nprolonged drought. Such events could disrupt our operations or those of our clients, customers, or service\nproviders, including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and\nmarket volatility.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 28\nWe are also exposed to risks associated with the transition to a lower-carbon economy in response to\nconcerns around climate change. Such risks may result from changes in policies, laws and regulations,\ntechnologies, or market preferences that are intended to address climate change. These changes could\nmaterially and negatively impact our or our customers’ business, results of operations, financial condition and\nreputation. This could occur as a result of our or our customers’ involvement in, or decision not to participate in,\ncertain industries or projects associated with exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to\ncontinue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations related to climate change. Ongoing\nlegislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result\nin higher regulatory, compliance, credit and reputational risks and costs.\nThe conditions of other financial institutions or of the financial services industry could adversely\naffect our operations and financial condition.\nFinancial services institutions are typically interconnected as a result of trading, investment, liquidity\nmanagement, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. Within the financial services industry, the default\nby any one institution could lead to defaults by other institutions. Concerns about, or a default by, one\ninstitution could lead to significant market and customer perception of the risk of similar problems at other\ninstitutions. This perception of risk could, in and of itself, lead to adverse impacts on liquidity. Liquidity\nproblems and losses or defaults by other institutions, as the financial soundness of financial institutions is closely\nrelated as a result of these credit, trading, clearing and other relationships. Even the perceived lack of\ncreditworthiness of, or questions about, a counterparty may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or\ndefaults by various institutions. This systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing\nagencies, banks and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis, or key funding providers such as the\nFHLBs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulations Governing Our Industry\nAs a financial holding company and a bank holding company, we are subject to comprehensive\nregulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs a FHC and a BHC, we are subject to comprehensive regulation, supervision and examination by the\nFRB. In addition, CBNA is subject to comprehensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. Our\nregulators supervise us through regular examinations and other means that allow them to gauge management’s\nability to identify, assess and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure\ncompliance with laws and regulations. In the course of their supervision and examinations, our regulators may\nrequire improvements in various areas. We may be required to devote substantial resources to meet supervisory\nexpectations or remediate supervisory findings. In addition, the failure to meet supervisory expectations can\nresult in practical limitations on the ability of a bank, BHC or FHC to engage in new activities, pursue growth\nopportunities, engage in acquisitions, return capital to shareholders through repurchases or dividends, or\ncontinue to conduct existing activities. If we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a\ntimely and effective manner, we could become subject to informal (nonpublic) or formal (public) supervisory\nactions and public enforcement orders that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our\nability to engage in any new business. Such forms of supervisory action could include, without limitation, written\nagreements, cease and desist orders, and consent orders and may, among other things, result in restrictions on\nour ability to pay dividends, requirements to increase capital, restrictions on our activities, the imposition of civil\nmonetary penalties, and enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders. We could also be\nrequired to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. The terms of any such supervisory\nor enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe are a BHC that has elected to become a FHC pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act. FHCs are\nallowed to engage in certain financial activities in which a BHC is not otherwise permitted to engage. However,\nto maintain FHC status, a BHC and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be “well capitalized” and\n“well managed.” If a BHC ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, there are many penalties\nit would be faced with, including the imposition of limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities by the\nFRB, as well as the inability to undertake any of the broader financial activities permissible for FHCs or to\nacquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the FRB. If a company does not\nreturn to compliance within 180 days, which period may be extended, the FRB may require divestiture of the\ncompany’s depository institutions. If we fail to meet FHC requirements and remediate deficiencies in a timely\nmanner, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 29\nOur regulators may impose restrictions or limitations on our operations.\nFrom time to time, bank regulatory agencies take supervisory actions that restrict or limit a financial\ninstitution’s activities and lead it to raise capital or subject it to other requirements. In addition, as part of our\nregular examination process, our regulators may advise us to conduct significant remediation activities or\noperate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. Any such actions or restrictions, if and in whatever\nmanner imposed, could adversely affect our costs and revenues. Moreover, efforts to comply with any such\nnonpublic supervisory actions or restrictions may require material investments in additional resources and\nsystems, as well as a significant commitment of managerial time and attention. As a result, such supervisory\nactions or restrictions, if and in whatever manner imposed, could have a material adverse effect on our business\nand results of operations.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate continues to be subject to significant and evolving\nregulatory requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings.\nWe are heavily regulated by multiple banking, consumer protection, securities and other regulatory\nauthorities at the federal and state levels. This regulatory oversight is primarily established to protect\ndepositors, the DIF, consumers of financial products, and the financial system as a whole, not for the protection\nof shareholders or other investors. Changes to statutes, regulations, rules or policies, including their\ninterpretation, implementation or enforcement, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including\nby, for example, subjecting us to additional costs, limiting the types of financial services and other products we\nmay offer, limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties, including non-\nbanks, to offer competing financial services and products. In recent years, we, together with the rest of the\nfinancial services industry, have faced particularly intense scrutiny, with many new regulatory initiatives and\nvigorous oversight and enforcement on the part of numerous regulatory and governmental authorities.\nLegislatures and regulators have pursued a broad array of initiatives intended to promote the safety and\nsoundness of financial institutions, financial market stability, the transparency and liquidity of financial markets,\nand consumer and investor protection. Certain regulators and law enforcement authorities have also recently\nrequired admissions of wrongdoing and, in some cases, criminal pleas as part of the resolutions of matters\nbrought by them against financial institutions. Any such resolution of a matter involving us could lead to\nincreased exposure to civil litigation, could adversely affect our reputation, could result in penalties or\nlimitations on our ability to do business or engage in certain activities and could have other negative effects. In\naddition, a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings,\nincluding by multiple federal and state regulators and other governmental authorities.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of our customers,\nemployees, counterparties and others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us\nto liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time\nand resources needed for us to comply with those laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for non-\ncompliance and our reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase.\nWhile there have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to us that have been\nfinalized in recent years, there are other rules to implement changes that have yet to be proposed or enacted by\nour regulators. The final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to\nfinancial institutions remains uncertain. For more information on regulations to which we are subject and recent\ninitiatives to reform financial institution regulation, see the “Regulation and Supervision” section in Item 1.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity standards, and if we fail to meet these standards\nour financial condition and operations would be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to several capital adequacy and liquidity standards. To the extent that we are unable to\nmeet these standards, our ability to make distributions of capital will be limited and we may be subject to\nadditional supervisory actions and limitations on our activities. See “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1 and\nthe “Capital and Regulatory Requirements” and “Liquidity” sections in Item 7, for further discussion of the\nregulations to which we are subject.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 30\nThe Parent Company could be required to act as a “source of strength” to CBNA, which would have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFRB policy historically required BHCs to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their\nsubsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. This support may be\nrequired by the FRB at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not\notherwise in the interests of CFG or our stockholders or creditors, and may include one or more of the following:\n• The Parent Company may be compelled to contribute capital to CBNA, including by engaging in a public\noffering to raise such capital. Furthermore, any extensions of credit from the Parent Company to CBNA\nthat are included in CBNA’s capital would be subordinate in right of payment to depositors and certain\nother indebtedness of CBNA.\n• In the event of a BHC’s bankruptcy, any commitment that the BHC had been required to make to a\nfederal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the\nbankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.\n• In the event of impairment of the capital stock of CBNA, the Parent Company, as CBNA’s stockholder,\ncould be required to pay such deficiency.\nThe Parent Company depends on CBNA for substantially all of its revenue, and restrictions on\ndividends and other distributions by CBNA could affect its liquidity and ability to fulfill our obligations.\nAs a BHC, the Parent Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from CBNA, our banking subsidiary.\nThe Parent Company typically receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from CBNA. These dividends\nare the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity and interest and principal on our debt. Various\nfederal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that\nCBNA may pay to the Parent Company. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s\nliquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. In the event CBNA is\nunable to pay dividends to the Parent Company, it may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay\ndividends on its common stock. The inability to receive dividends from CBNA could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See the “Regulation and Supervision” section\nin Item 1 and the “Capital and Regulatory Matters” section in Item 7.\nFrom time-to-time, we may become or are subject to regulatory actions that may have a material\nimpact on our business.\nWe may become or are involved, from time to time, in reviews, investigations and proceedings (both\nformal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business. These regulatory\nactions involve accounting, compliance and operational matters, among others, some of which may result in\nadverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief that may require changes to our\nbusiness or otherwise materially impact our business.\nIn regulatory actions, such as those referred to above, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any\nloss is probable or whether it is possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any loss. We cannot predict with\ncertainty if, how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual fine, penalty or other relief,\nconditions or restrictions, if any, may be, particularly for actions that are in their early stages of investigation.\nWe may be required to make significant restitution payments to CBNA customers arising from certain compliance\nissues and also may be required to pay civil money penalties in connection with certain of these issues. This\nuncertainty makes it difficult to estimate probable losses which, in turn, can lead to substantial disparities\nbetween the reserves we may establish for such proceedings and the eventual settlements, fines, or penalties.\nAdverse regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 31\nWe are and may be subject to litigation that may have a material impact on our business.\nOur operations are diverse and complex and we operate in legal and regulatory environments that expose\nus to potentially significant litigation risk. In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to\ntime, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in\nconnection with our activities as a financial services institution, including with respect to alleged unfair or\ndeceptive business practices, mis-selling of certain products, violations of contract or intellectual property\nrights, and other compliance or operational failures. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include\nclaims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In\nsome cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in\nfinancial distress. Moreover, a number of recent judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue\nlending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.”\nGenerally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or\ncontractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the\nborrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders.\nThis could increase the amount of private litigation to which we are subject. For more information regarding\nongoing significant legal proceedings in which we may be involved, see Note 19 in Item 8.\nCompliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules involves significant cost\nand effort.\nWe are subject to rules and regulations regarding money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\nMonitoring compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing rules can put a significant\nfinancial burden on banks and other financial institutions and poses significant technical challenges. Although we\nbelieve our current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with applicable rules and regulations, we\ncannot guarantee that our anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing policies and procedures completely\nprevent situations of money laundering or terrorism financing. Any such failure events may have severe\nconsequences, including sanctions, fines and reputational consequences, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nYou should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky, and you should invest in our common\nstock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things,\nthe factors described in this “Risk Factors” section, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThese factors include:\n• quarterly variations in our results of operations or the quarterly financial results of companies\nperceived to be similar to us;\n• changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by\nsecurities analysts and investors;\n• our announcements or our competitors’ announcements regarding new products or services,\nenhancements, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments;\n• fluctuations in the market valuations of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n• failures of financial institutions perceived to be similar to us;\n• future sales of our common stock;\n• additions or departures of members of our senior management or other key personnel;\n• changes in industry conditions or perceptions; and\n• changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations and other dynamics.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and\ncontinue to affect the market price of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been\nunrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market\nfluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of\ninvestor confidence, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the\nmarket price of our common stock.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class\naction litigation that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 32\nWe may not repurchase shares or pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board may declare out of\nfunds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common\nstock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future, which\ncould adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Also, as a BHC, our ability to repurchase shares\nand declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the rules of\nthe FRB regarding capital adequacy and dividends. Additionally, we are also generally required to receive the\nFRB’s approval for any dividends, share repurchases, or redemption of capital securities if we are required to\nresubmit our capital plan. Further, if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any\nreason, we may be limited in our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends on our capital stock.\nSee the “Regulation and Supervision” section in Item 1 and the “Capital and Regulatory Matters” section in Item\n7 for further discussion of the regulations to which we are subject.\n“Anti-takeover” provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult\nfor a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders.\nWe are a BHC incorporated in the state of Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our\nrestated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals that\nwould be required under federal law, could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may\nprevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions could\nadversely affect the market price of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get\nif we are sold.\nFurthermore, banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any\nstockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of an FDIC-insured depository\ninstitution. These laws include the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nThe Company’s Cybersecurity Program (“CSP”) drives an end-to-end, continuous process that protects our\ncustomers, colleagues, assets, premises, systems, and information (electronic and non-electronic), and is\ndesigned to ensure compliance with current and emerging federal and state laws and regulations. The CSP is\ndesigned to ensure the effective implementation of the Corporate Security and Resilience Operating Model across\nall business lines of the Company and is under the supervision of the Chief Security Officer (“CSO”).\nNon-Financial Risk Management coordinates the development, maintenance, and day-to-day oversight of\nthe Company’s Enterprise Risk Management Governance Framework (“the Framework”), which defines an\nintegrated enterprise-wide approach to risk management. This centrally managed program is designed to ensure\nthat all business lines play a role in the successful implementation of the CSP. The CSP aligns with the\nFramework, enabling the CSO to provide risk oversight to and drive accountability from the business lines.\nThe CSP is designed to assess and mitigate threats and risks to the Company. New and emerging threats\nare assessed through an intelligence lifecycle, which includes threat modeling. In addition, risk assessment\nprocesses drive risk identification and measurement related to security. Once risks are identified and measured,\nthe Framework is leveraged to track and mitigate them. Control testing is utilized to demonstrate that risks are\nmanaged effectively, identify gaps in expected control operation, and develop appropriate remediation plans, in\norder to manage risk to the Company within tolerable limits.\nAs part of the Company’s Third Party Risk Management Program and in support of the CSP, reviews for\ncybersecurity, business continuity, fraud, and other policy-related topics are performed for the onboarding of\nnew vendors and ongoing monitoring of existing vendors. Ratings assigned to a vendor determine review\nfrequency and scope. Results are reported to key stakeholders and identified issues are tracked and monitored.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 33\nThe Company regularly reviews the nature of its business activities and modifies the CSP as appropriate.\nMany of the elements of the CSP are cyber defense related and are in place to reduce our risk to a wide range of\npotential cyber threats that may target our assets and information daily. The effectiveness of the CSP is assessed\nand measured periodically by various lines of defense within the Company and is conducted primarily through risk\nassessments, assurance testing, and an independent audit. External organizations are also routinely engaged to\nassess our CSP and test our perimeter defenses. The effectiveness of the CSP is reported periodically to the\nappropriate governance committees.\nGovernance\nUnder the guidance of our CSO, we maintain a comprehensive CSP designed to protect our employees,\ncustomers, assets, premises, systems, and information against unauthorized access, misuse, alteration, or\ndestruction that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to our customers, and loss or reputational\ndamage. The CSP incorporates all of our security policies and covers the core elements of access control,\ninfrastructure security, cybersecurity event and incident management, data protection, third-party vendor cyber\nrisk oversight, payment security, and training and awareness. Independent assessment and benchmarking of the\nCSP are regularly completed, and the CSP is reviewed and assessed by federal regulators. While we look to\nnumerous frameworks to ensure the CSP is maintained in line with regulatory expectations and industry best\npractices, the National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework is the primary standard\nagainst which we benchmark ourselves.\nBoth the Risk and Audit Committees have oversight of the management of our cybersecurity risk. The\nAudit Committee is responsible for overseeing the CSP under its risk oversight responsibilities as it relates to\nfinancial controls. The Risk Committee is responsible for oversight of the management of cybersecurity risk\nconsistent with the Framework.\nThe CSP is presented by the CSO to the Risk Committee annually for approval in conjunction with an\nannual cybersecurity briefing. This briefing provides an overall assessment of the effectiveness of the CSP and an\noutlook for the upcoming year. In addition to the annual cybersecurity briefing, the CSO provides updates on\ncybersecurity to the Risk Committee at each of its meetings. The Audit Committee and Board also receive regular\ncybersecurity updates as part of the reporting provided by the Technology/Cyber Oversight Committee, a\nmanagement committee chaired by the CEO which provides executive oversight, guidance and transparency to\nkey transformative initiatives designed to enhance our technology stability, cyber defenses and risk management\ncapabilities. Further, to ensure the Board maintains the appropriate knowledge for providing effective oversight,\nit is provided with relevant cybersecurity training on an annual basis, with any additional training provided as\nrequested.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe lease five operations centers in Boston, Medford, and Westwood, Massachusetts; Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania; and Glen Allen, Virginia. We own two principal operations centers in Johnston and East Providence,\nRhode Island. At December 31, 2023, our subsidiaries owned and operated a total of 60 facilities and leased an\nadditional 1,193 facilities. We believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our needs.

Headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island, we offer a broad range of\nretail and commercial banking products and services to individuals, small businesses, middle-market companies,\nlarge corporations and institutions. We help our customers reach their potential by listening to them and by\nunderstanding their needs in order to offer tailored advice, ideas and solutions. In Consumer Banking, we provide\nan integrated experience that includes mobile and online banking, a full-service customer contact center and the\nconvenience of approximately 3,200 ATMs and more than 1,100 branches in 14 states and the District of\nColumbia.

In Commercial Banking, we offer a broad complement of financial\nproducts and solutions, including lending and leasing, deposit and treasury management services, foreign\nexchange, interest rate and commodity risk management solutions, as well as loan syndication, corporate\nfinance, merger and acquisition, and debt and equity capital markets capabilities. More information is available\nat www.citizensbank.com.\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the\nConsolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, as well as other\ninformation contained in this document.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as “Underlying” results and “including\nAOCI impact.” Underlying results for any given reporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that\nperiod which management does not consider indicative of our on-going financial performance. We believe these\nnon-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are used by management to\nevaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe our\nUnderlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial performance in that period and,\naccordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further believe the presentation\nof Underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results.\nOther companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated differently\nfrom the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable\nto similar measures used by such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP\nfinancial measures, but to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our\nresults reported under GAAP.\nNon-GAAP measures are denoted throughout our MD&A by the use of the term “Underlying.” Where there\nis a reference to these metrics in that paragraph, all measures that follow are on the same basis when\napplicable. For more information on the computation of non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures and Reconciliations.”\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 38\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nKey Highlights\nNet income decreased $465 million, with earnings per diluted common share down $0.97 to $3.13\ncompared to 2022.\nResults reflect notable items of $357 million or $0.75 per diluted common share, net of tax benefit,\ncompared to $352 million or $0.74 per diluted common share, net of tax benefit, in 2022.\nTable 1: Notable Items\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nLess: notable items\nReported Integration Underlying\nresults related TOP and FDIC special results\n(dollars in millions) (GAAP) costs(1) other(2) assessment(3) Provision (non-GAAP)\nNoninterest expense $5,507 $104 $177 $225 $— $5,001\nIncome tax expense 422 (28) (63) (58) — 571\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nLess: notable items\nReported Integration Underlying\nresults related TOP and FDIC special results\n(dollars in millions) (GAAP) costs(1) other(2) assessment Provision(4) (non-GAAP)\nProvision for credit losses $474 $— $— $— $169 $305\nNoninterest income 2,009 (31) — — — 2,040\nNoninterest expense 4,892 213 49 — — 4,630\nIncome tax expense 582 (58) (9) — (43) 692\n(1) Includes integration related costs associated with acquisitions for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and mark-to-market losses on loans acquired\nfrom Investors classified as LHFS for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(2) Includes our TOP transformational and revenue and efficiency initiatives for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, a one-time deferred tax benefit for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 and income tax impacts related to legacy tax matters for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(3) Represents an industry-wide FDIC special assessment. For more information, see “Regulation and Supervision - Deposit Insurance” in Item 1.\n(4) Includes the initial provision for credit losses tied to the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition. As required by purchase accounting, a fair value mark for\nperforming loans including both credit and interest rate components is recorded in addition to the provision for credit losses expense, thus the credit exposure\nhas been “double counted.”\n• Net income available to common stockholders decreased $469 million to $1.5 billion compared to 2022.\n◦ On an Underlying basis, which excludes notable items, net income available to common stockholders\nof $1.8 billion compared to $2.3 billion in 2022.\n◦ On an Underlying basis, earnings per diluted common share of $3.88 compared to $4.84 in 2022.\n• Total revenue increased $203 million to $8.2 billion compared to 2022, driven by an increase of 4% in net\ninterest income, including the impacts of the HSBC transaction and Investors acquisition.\n• The efficiency ratio of 67.0% compared to 61.0% in 2022.\n◦ On an Underlying basis, the efficiency ratio of 60.8% compared to 57.5% in 2022.\n• ROTCE of 10.9% compared to 13.9% in 2022.\n◦ On an Underlying basis, ROTCE of 13.5% compared to 16.4%.\n• Tangible book value per common share of $30.91 increased 11% from 2022.\nFor additional information regarding our financial performance, see “Results of Operations — 2023\ncompared with 2022” included in this report.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 39\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS — 2023 compared with 2022\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is our largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on\ninterest-earning assets (generally loans, leases and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in\nconnection with interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits and borrowed funds). The level of net interest\nincome is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on our average interest-earning\nassets and the effective cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced by the pricing and\nmix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors\nsuch as economic conditions, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the FRB and market\ninterest rates.

The increase in FDIC deposit insurance\nreflects CBNA’s special assessment of $225 million and an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate of\ntwo basis points that commenced with the first quarterly assessment period in 2023. For more information\nregarding CBNA’s special assessment, see “Regulation and Supervision - Deposit Insurance” in Item 1.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 42\nProvision for Credit Losses\nThe provision for credit losses is the result of a detailed analysis performed to estimate our ACL. The\ntotal provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded\ncommitments. Refer to “Analysis of Financial Condition — Credit Quality” for more information.\nProvision expense of $687 million for 2023 compares to $474 million for 2022. The provision expense for\n2023 reflects higher reserves against the Commercial Real Estate Office portfolio primarily driven by rising\ninterest rates and return to office dynamics.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense of $422 million decreased $160 million and our effective income tax rate of 20.8%\ndecreased from 21.9% compared to 2022. These decreases were driven by lower pre-tax income, the favorable\nimpact of certain tax matters and additional benefits from tax-advantaged investments, partially offset by the\nadoption of the proportional amortization method for qualified investments in tax credit structures in 2023 and\nincreased non-deductible FDIC premium expense.\nBusiness Operating Segments\nWe have three business operating segments: Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, and Non-Core.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, our indirect auto and certain purchased consumer loan portfolios were\ntransferred from the Consumer Banking segment into a new Non-Core segment to reflect the manner in which\nmanagement is currently assessing performance and allocating resources. This new segment structure aligns with\nour recently announced balance sheet optimization strategy to discontinue the origination of certain non-\nstrategic lending portfolios. Prior period results have been revised to conform to the new segment presentation.\nFor more information regarding our business operating segments see Note 26.\nThe following table presents certain financial data of our business operating segments. Total business\noperating segment financial results differ from total consolidated financial results. These differences are\nreflected in Other non-segment operations.

This increase was partially offset by higher\nfunding costs.\nNoninterest income decreased $61 million compared to 2022, driven by capital markets fees reflecting\nlower loan syndication, underwriting and M&A advisory fees, and foreign exchange and derivative products\nrevenue reflecting lower client hedging activity. This decline was partially offset by service charges and fees\nreflecting the benefit of acquisitions and improvement in Treasury Solutions fees and card fees given higher\ntransaction volumes.\nNoninterest expense increased $72 million compared to 2022, driven primarily by salaries and employee\nbenefits, and equipment and software driven by software maintenance and amortization costs.\nNet charge-offs increased $204 million compared to 2022, reflecting an increased net charge-off level in\nthe Commercial Real Estate Office portfolio primarily driven by rising interest rates and return to office\ndynamics, and the normalization of credit losses from pandemic-era lows.\nNon-Core\nNet interest income decreased $507 million compared to 2022, driven by the highest-cost implied\nmarginal funding sources during 2023, including secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans, FHLB advances\nand, to the extent necessary to fully fund the Non-Core segment, brokered certificates of deposit.\nNet charge-offs increased $26 million compared to 2022, driven by auto as credit losses continue to\ngradually normalize from pandemic-era lows.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS — 2022 compared with 2021\nFor a description of our results of operations for 2022, see the “Results of Operations — 2022 compared\nwith 2021” section of Item 7 in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 44\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nSecurities\nTable 7: Amortized Cost and Fair Value of Securities\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAmortized Amortized\n(dollars in millions) Cost(1) Fair Value Cost Fair Value\nU.S. Treasury and other $4,493 $4,380 $3,678 $3,486\nState and political subdivisions 1 1 2 2\nMortgage-backed securities:\nFederal agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities 26,289 24,477 21,250 19,062\nOther/non-agency 279 255 280 251\nTotal mortgage-backed securities 26,568 24,732 21,530 19,313\nCollateralized loan obligations 667 664 1,248 1,206\nTotal debt securities available for sale $31,729 $29,777 $26,458 $24,007\nMortgage-backed securities:\nFederal agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities $8,696 $7,887 $9,253 $8,506\nTotal mortgage-backed securities 8,696 7,887 9,253 8,506\nAsset-backed securities 488 463 581 536\nTotal debt securities held to maturity $9,184 $8,350 $9,834 $9,042\nTotal debt securities available for sale and held to maturity $40,913 $38,127 $36,292 $33,049\nEquity securities, at cost(2) $869 $869 $1,058 $1,058\nEquity securities, at fair value(2) 173 173 153 153\n(1) Excludes portfolio level basis adjustments of $60 million for securities designated in active fair value hedge relationships.

For more information regarding our borrowed funds see “Liquidity” and Note 13.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 53\nCAPITAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nAs a BHC and FHC, we are subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. Our banking subsidiary,\nCBNA, is a national banking association primarily regulated by the OCC. Our regulation and supervision continues\nto evolve as the legal and regulatory frameworks governing our operations continue to change. For more\ninformation, see the “Regulation and Supervision” section in Item 1.\nCapital Adequacy Process\nOur assessment of capital adequacy begins with our Board-approved risk appetite and risk management\nframework. This framework provides for the identification, measurement and management of material risks.\nCapital requirements are determined for actual and forecasted risk portfolios using applicable regulatory capital\nmethodologies. The assessment also considers the possible impacts of approved and proposed changes to\nregulatory capital requirements. Key analytical frameworks, including scenario analysis and stress testing,\nsupplement our base line forecast to help inform a range of potential outcomes. A governance framework\nsupports our capital planning process, including capital management policies and procedures that document\ncapital adequacy metrics and limits, as well as our Capital Contingency Plan and the active engagement of both\nthe Board and senior management in oversight and decision-making.\nForward-looking assessments of capital adequacy provide for the development of a single capital plan,\nwhich is periodically submitted to the FRB, that covers both us and our banking subsidiary. We prepare this plan\nin accordance with the Capital Plan Rule and we participate annually in the FRB’s horizontal capital review as\npart of their normal supervisory process, which includes an assessment of specific capital planning areas.\nThe FRB regularly supervises and evaluates our capital adequacy and capital planning processes, including\nthe submission of an annual capital plan approved by our Board of Directors or one of its committees. Under the\nFRB’s capital requirements we must maintain capital ratios above the sum of the regulatory minimum and SCB\nrequirement to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The FRB utilizes the\nsupervisory stress test to determine our SCB, which is re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory stress test and\nupdated annually to reflect our planned common stock dividends. As an institution subject to Category IV\nstandards, we are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing in even-numbered years; however, the FRB\nrequired us to participate in the 2023 CCAR supervisory stress test to incorporate the effects of the Investors\nacquisition. Our SCB associated with the 2023 supervisory stress test was 4.0%, effective October 1, 2023 through\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nRegulations relating to capital planning, regulatory reporting, stress testing and capital buffer\nrequirements applicable to firms like us are presently subject to rule-making and potential further guidance and\ninterpretation by the applicable federal regulators. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these and any\nother prudential regulatory changes, including their potential resultant changes in our regulatory and compliance\ncosts and expenses.\nRegulatory Capital Ratios and Capital Composition\nUnder the current U.S. Basel III capital framework, we and our banking subsidiary, CBNA, must meet the\nfollowing specific minimum requirements: CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, total capital\nratio of 8.0% and tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. As a BHC, our SCB of 4.0% is imposed on top of the three minimum\nrisk-based capital ratios listed above and a CCB of 2.5% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based\ncapital ratios listed above for CBNA.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 54\nFor additional discussion of the U.S. Basel III capital framework and its related application, see the\n“Regulation and Supervision” section in Item 1. The table below presents the regulatory capital ratios for CFG\nand CBNA under the U.S. Basel III Standardized rules:\nTable 23: Regulatory Capital Ratios Under the U.S. Basel III Standardized Rules\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRequired Minimum\n(dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Capital Ratio(1)\nCET1 capital\nCFG $18,358 10.6 % $18,574 10.0 % 8.5 %\nCBNA 19,411 11.3 20,669 11.2 7.0\nTier 1 capital\nCFG 20,372 11.8 20,588 11.1 10.0\nCBNA 19,411 11.3 20,669 11.2 8.5\nTotal capital\nCFG 23,608 13.7 23,755 12.8 12.0\nCBNA 22,453 13.0 23,534 12.7 10.5\nTier 1 leverage\nCFG 20,372 9.3 20,588 9.3 4.0\nCBNA 19,411 8.9 20,669 9.4 4.0\nRisk-weighted assets\nCFG 172,601 185,224\nCBNA 172,094 184,781\nQuarterly adjusted average assets(2)\nCFG 219,591 220,779\nCBNA 218,974 220,182\n(1) Represents minimum requirement under the current capital framework plus the SCB of 4.0% and CCB of 2.5% for CFG and CBNA, respectively. The SCB and CCB\nare not applicable to the Tier 1 leverage ratio.\n(2) Represents total average assets less certain amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital.\nAt December 31, 2023, CFG’s CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios increased compared to December 31, 2022,\nprimarily driven by net income and a $12.6 billion decrease in RWA, partially offset by dividends, common share\nrepurchases, and a decrease in the modified CECL transition amount as we entered the second year of the CECL\nthree-year transition period. Lower commercial and auto loans were the key drivers for the decline in RWA.\nAt December 31, 2023, CBNA’s CET1 and tier 1 capital ratios increased slightly compared to December\n31, 2022. Net income and a $12.7 billion decrease in RWA, primarily driven by lower commercial and auto loans,\nwas partially offset by dividend payments to the Parent Company and a decrease in the modified CECL transition\namount as we entered the second year of the CECL three-year transition period.\nAt December 31, 2023, CFG’s and CBNA’s total capital ratios increased driven by their respective changes\nin CET1 and tier 1 capital described above and a reduction in the modified AACL transition amount.\nAt December 31, 2023, CFG’s tier 1 leverage ratio was stable compared to December 31, 2022, whereas\nCBNA’s tier 1 leverage ratio decreased. CBNA’s tier 1 leverage ratio reflects a decline in quarterly adjusted\naverage assets and changes in tier 1 capital described above.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 55\nTable 24: Capital Composition Under the U.S. Basel III Capital Framework\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022\nTotal common stockholders’ equity $22,328 $21,676\nExclusions:\nModified CECL transitional amount 192 288\nNet unrealized (gains)/losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax:\nDebt securities 2,338 2,771\nDerivatives 1,087 1,416\nUnamortized net periodic benefit costs 333 373\nDeductions:\nGoodwill, net of deferred tax liability (7,779) (7,780)\nOther intangible assets, net of deferred tax liability (134) (170)\nDeferred tax assets that arise from tax loss and credit carryforwards (7) —\nTotal common equity tier 1 capital 18,358 18,574\nQualifying preferred stock 2,014 2,014\nTotal tier 1 capital 20,372 20,588\nQualifying subordinated debt(1) 1,319 1,427\nAllowance for credit losses 2,318 2,240\nExclusions from tier 2 capital:\nModified AACL transitional amount (249) (374)\nAllowance on PCD assets (152) (126)\nAdjusted allowance for credit losses 1,917 1,740\nTotal capital $23,608 $23,755\n(1) As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of non-qualifying subordinated debt excluded from regulatory capital was $482 million and $367 million,\nrespectively.

See “Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities” in Item 5 above for\ninformation regarding our available capacity to repurchase shares at December 31, 2023. All future capital\ndistributions are subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors prior to execution. The timing\nand amount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including our capital\nposition, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, and regulatory\nconsiderations.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 56\nRecent Regulatory Developments\nBank Failures\nOn April 28, 2023, the FRB issued a report relative to its review of the supervision and regulation of\nSilicon Valley Bank (“SVB”). The report details the FRB’s assessment of the primary causes for SVB’s failure and\nemphasizes the FRB’s view that supervision and regulation need to be strengthened based on its findings. As a\nresult, the FRB stated it intends to evaluate its supervisory and regulatory framework, with a focus on the\nfollowing areas:\n• Regulatory tailoring framework, including a reassessment of a range of rules for banks with $100 billion\nor more in assets;\n• Management of interest rate risk;\n• Liquidity risk, commencing with the risks of uninsured deposits; and\n• Capital requirements.\nProposals addressing the regulatory tailoring framework and capital requirements were issued by the\nregulatory agencies during the third quarter of 2023. See the “Regulation and Supervision” section in Item 1 for\nmore information.\nWe will continue to monitor and address changes to the FRB’s supervisory and regulatory framework that\nmay result from this targeted review by the FRB and their associated impact on our business, financial condition\nor results of operations.\nAOCI Impact on Regulatory Capital\nUnder the current applicable regulatory capital rules we have made the AOCI opt-out election, which\nenables us to exclude components of AOCI from regulatory capital. As noted in the “Capital and Stress Testing\nRequirements” section of “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1, the regulatory agencies are considering the\ninclusion of AOCI components in regulatory capital for Category IV firms like us, notably the AOCI relative to\nsecurities and pension.\nThe following table presents our regulatory capital ratios including the AOCI impact from securities and\npension, which we believe provides useful information in light of recent events and the potential for change in\nthe regulatory capital framework.\nTable 25: AOCI Impact on Regulatory Capital\nDecember 31, 2023\nCFG CBNA\n(dollars in millions) CET1 Tier 1 Total CET1 Tier 1 Total\nRegulatory capital, including AOCI impact:\nRegulatory capital (as reported) $18,358 $20,372 $23,608 $19,411 $19,411 $22,453\nUnrealized gains (losses) on securities and pension (2,671) (2,671) (2,671) (2,649) (2,649) (2,649)\nDeferred tax assets - securities and pension AOCI (15) (15) (15) (16) (16) (16)\nRegulatory capital, including AOCI impact (non-GAAP) $15,672 $17,686 $20,922 $16,746 $16,746 $19,788\nRisk-weighted assets, including AOCI impact:\nRisk-weighted assets (as reported) $172,601 $172,601 $172,601 $172,094 $172,094 $172,094\nUnrealized gains (losses) on securities and pension (722) (722) (722) (701) (701) (701)\nDeferred tax assets - securities and pension AOCI 2,188 2,188 2,188 2,168 2,168 2,168\nRisk-weighted assets, including AOCI impact (non-GAAP) $174,067 $174,067 $174,067 $173,561 $173,561 $173,561\nRatio:\nRegulatory capital ratio (as reported) 10.6 % 11.8 % 13.7 % 11.3 % 11.3 % 13.0 %\nRegulatory capital ratio, including AOCI impact (non-GAAP) 9.0 % 10.2 % 12.0 % 9.6 % 9.6 % 11.4 %\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 57\nLIQUIDITY\nWe consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity fundamental to our safety and\nsoundness. We define liquidity as our ability to meet our obligations when they come due. As a financial\ninstitution, we must maintain operating liquidity to meet expected daily and forecasted cash-flow requirements,\nas well as contingent liquidity to meet unexpected (stress scenario) funding requirements. Reflecting the\nimportance of meeting all unexpected and stress-scenario funding requirements, we identify and manage\ncontingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB, unencumbered high-quality liquid securities and\nunused FHLB borrowing capacity. Separately, we also identify and manage asset liquidity as a subset of\ncontingent liquidity, consisting of cash balances at the FRB and unencumbered high-quality liquid securities. We\nmaintain additional secured borrowing capacity at the FRB discount window, but do not view this as a primary\nmeans of funding, but rather a potential source in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. We\nmanage liquidity at the consolidated enterprise level and at each material legal entity.\nParent Company Liquidity\nOur Parent Company’s primary sources of cash are dividends and interest received from CBNA resulting\nfrom investing in bank equity and subordinated debt as well as externally issued preferred stock, senior debt and\nsubordinated debt. Uses of cash include the routine cash flow requirements as a bank holding company, including\nperiodic share repurchases and payments of dividends, interest and expenses; the needs of subsidiaries, including\nCBNA for additional equity and, as required, its need for debt financing; and the support for extraordinary\nfunding requirements when necessary. To the extent the Parent Company has relied on wholesale borrowings,\nuses also include payments of related principal and interest.\nOur Parent Company’s cash and cash equivalents represent a source of liquidity that can be used to meet\nvarious needs and totaled $2.9 billion and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Parent Company declared dividends on common\nstock of $808 million and $779 million, respectively, and declared dividends on preferred stock of $117 million\nand $113 million, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Parent Company repurchased $906 million and\n$153 million, respectively, of its outstanding common stock.\nOn January 23, 2024, CFG issued $1.25 billion in six-year 5.841% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes.\nCBNA Liquidity\nAs CBNA’s primary business involves taking deposits and making loans, a key role of liquidity management\nis to ensure that customers have timely access to funds. Liquidity management also involves maintaining\nsufficient liquidity to repay wholesale borrowings, pay operating expenses and support extraordinary funding\nrequirements when necessary. In the ordinary course of business the liquidity of CBNA is managed by matching\nsources and uses of cash. The primary sources of bank liquidity include deposits from our consumer and\ncommercial customers; payments of principal and interest on loans and debt securities; and wholesale\nborrowings, as needed, and as described under “Liquidity Risk Management and Governance.” The primary uses\nof bank liquidity include withdrawals and maturities of deposits; payment of interest on deposits; funding of\nloans and related commitments; and funding of securities purchases. To the extent that CBNA has relied on\nwholesale borrowings, uses also include payments of related principal and interest. For further information on\nCBNA’s outstanding debt see Note 13.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, CBNA completed the following transactions:\n• Issued $450 million of 5.284% fixed-to-floating rate senior notes;\n• Redeemed $750 million of senior notes due March 2023; and\n• Issued $3.5 billion of secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans.\nOn January 23, 2024, CBNA issued approximately $1.5 billion of secured borrowings collateralized by auto\nloans.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 58\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk arising from the inability to meet our obligations when they come due. We must\nmaintain adequate funding to meet current and future obligations, including customer loan requests, customer\ndeposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, equipment and premises leases, and other cash commitments,\nunder both normal operating conditions and under periods of company-specific and/or market stress.\nWe primarily rely on customer deposits to be a relatively stable and low-cost source of funding. In\naddition to customer deposits, our funding sources also include our ability to securitize loans in secondary\nmarkets, raise funds in the debt and equity capital markets, pledge loans and/or securities for borrowing from\nthe FHLB, pledge securities as collateral for borrowing under repurchase agreements, and sell AFS securities.\nCredit ratings assigned by agencies such as Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch impact our access to\nunsecured wholesale market funds and to large uninsured customer deposits and are presented in the table\nbelow.\nTable 26: Credit Ratings\nDecember 31, 2023\nStandard and\nMoody’s Poor’s Fitch\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc.:\nLong-term issuer Baa1 BBB+ BBB+\nShort-term issuer NR A-2 F1\nSubordinated debt Baa1 BBB BBB\nPreferred Stock Baa3 BB+ BB\nCitizens Bank, National Association:\nLong-term issuer Baa1 A- BBB+\nShort-term issuer NR A-2 F1\nLong-term deposits A1 NR A-\nShort-term deposits P-1 NR F1\nNR = Not Rated\nWe currently have a “stable” outlook at Standard & Poor’s, a “negative” outlook at Moody’s and a\n“stable” outlook at Fitch. Changes in our public credit ratings could affect both the cost and availability of our\nwholesale funding.\nExisting and evolving regulatory liquidity requirements represent another key driver of systemic liquidity\nconditions and liquidity management practices. The FRB and OCC regularly evaluate our liquidity as part of the\noverall supervisory process. In addition, we are subject to existing and evolving regulatory liquidity\nrequirements, some of which are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable\nfederal regulators. For further discussion, see the “Liquidity Requirements” section under “Regulation and\nSupervision” in Item 1.\nLiquidity Risk Management and Governance\nLiquidity risk is measured and managed by the Funding and Liquidity unit within our Treasury group in\naccordance with policy guidelines promulgated by our Board and the Asset Liability Committee. The Funding and\nLiquidity unit is responsible for maintaining a liquidity management framework that effectively manages liquidity\nrisk. Processes within this framework include, but are not limited to, regular and comprehensive reporting,\nincluding current levels versus threshold limits for a broad set of liquidity metrics and early warning indicators,\nexplanatory commentary relating to emerging risk trends and, as appropriate, recommended remedial strategies,\nliquidity stress testing, contingency funding plans, and collateral management.\nOur Funding and Liquidity unit’s primary goals are to deliver and maintain prudent levels of operating\nliquidity to support expected and projected funding requirements, contingent liquidity to support unexpected\nfunding requirements resulting from idiosyncratic, systemic, and combination stress events, and regulatory\nliquidity requirements in a timely manner from stable and cost-efficient funding sources. We seek to accomplish\nthese goals by funding loans with stable deposits, by prudently controlling dependence on wholesale funding,\nparticularly short-term unsecured funding, and by maintaining ample available liquidity, including a contingent\nliquidity buffer of unencumbered high-quality loans and securities.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 59\nWe maintain a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet\nongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. The\nplan identifies members of the liquidity contingency team and provides a framework for management to follow,\nincluding notification and escalation of potential liquidity stress events.\nIn response to the recent U.S. bank failures, the FRB established the Bank Term Funding Program to make\nadditional funding available to eligible depository institutions to ensure the ability to meet the needs of all\ndepositors. This program was designed to provide another source of liquidity against the par value of high-quality\nsecurities, eliminating the need to sell these securities during times of stress. The Company is eligible to borrow\nunder this program, which expires in March 2024, based on its existing eligibility for primary credit under the FRB\ndiscount window. The Company has taken steps to support readiness but has not participated in the program\nthrough December 31, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023:\n• Organically generated deposits continue to be our primary source of funding, resulting in a consolidated\nperiod-end loans-to-deposits ratio, excluding LHFS, of 82.3%;\n◦ Estimated insured/secured deposits comprise 71% of our consolidated deposit base of $177.3\nbillion.\n• Our total available liquidity, comprised of contingent liquidity and available discount window capacity,\nwas approximately $78.8 billion;\n◦ Contingent liquidity was $57.1 billion, consisting of unencumbered high-quality liquid securities\nof $31.4 billion, unused FHLB capacity of $15.9 billion, and our cash balances at the FRB of $9.8\nbillion; and\n◦ Available discount window capacity was $21.7 billion, defined as available total borrowing\ncapacity from the FRB based on identified collateral, which is primarily secured by non-mortgage\ncommercial and retail loans.\nFor a summary of our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended December 31, 2023,\n2022 and 2021, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8.\nThe Funding and Liquidity unit monitors a variety of liquidity and funding metrics and early warning\nindicators and metrics, including specific risk thresholds limits. These monitoring tools are broadly classified as\nfollows:\n• Current liquidity sources and capacities, including cash balances at the FRB, free and liquid securities,\nand secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB and FRB discount window;\n• Liquidity stress sources, including idiosyncratic, systemic and combined stresses, in addition to evolving\nregulatory requirements; and\n• Current and prospective exposures, including secured and unsecured wholesale funding, and spot and\ncumulative cash-flow gaps across a variety of horizons.\nFurther, certain of these metrics are monitored individually for CBNA and for our consolidated enterprise\non a daily basis, including cash position, unencumbered securities, asset liquidity and available FHLB borrowing\ncapacity. In order to identify emerging trends and risks and inform funding decisions, specific metrics are also\nforecasted over a one-year horizon.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash\npayments, including customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, lease obligations and other cash\ncommitments. For more information regarding these obligations, see Notes 9, 12 and 13.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe engage in a variety of activities that are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that are\ngenerally referred to as “off-balance sheet arrangements.” For more information on these types of activities, see\nNote 19.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 60\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report are prepared in accordance with\nGAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting\npolicies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAn accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a\nmaterial effect on our audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates are made using facts and\ncircumstances known at a point in time. Changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results\nsubstantially different from those estimates. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their\nrelated application are discussed below. See Note 1 for further discussion of our significant accounting policies.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe ACL increased from $2.2 billion at December 31, 2022 to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2023.\nOur ACL as of December 31, 2023 accounts for an economic forecast over our two-year reasonable and\nsupportable period with peak unemployment of approximately 5% and peak-to-trough GDP decline of\napproximately 0.4%. This forecast reflects a mild recession over the two-year reasonable and supportable period.\nThis compares to our December 31, 2022 forecast which reflected peak unemployment of approximately 6% with\na more adverse peak-to-trough GDP decline of approximately 1.4%.\nOur determination of the ACL is sensitive to changes in forecasted macroeconomic conditions during the\nreasonable and supportable forecast period. To illustrate the sensitivity, we applied a more pessimistic scenario\nthan that described above which reflects deeper real GDP contraction across our two-year reasonable and\nsupportable forecast period, resulting in a 1.7% peak-to-trough decline in real GDP. Excluding consideration of\nqualitative adjustments, this scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate of approximately 1.10x\nour modeled period-end ACL, or an increase of approximately $233 million. This analysis relates only to the\nmodeled credit loss estimate and not to the overall period-end ACL, which includes qualitative adjustments.\nBecause several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the ACL, this\nsensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ACL or even what\nthe ACL would be under these economic circumstances. The sensitivity is intended to provide insights into the\nimpact of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment and the corresponding impact to modeled loss\nestimates. The hypothetical determination does not incorporate the impact of management judgment or other\nqualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the ACL and does not imply any expectation\nof future deterioration in our loss rates.\nIt remains difficult to estimate how changes in economic forecasts might affect our ACL because such\nforecasts consider a wide variety of variables and inputs, and changes in the variables and inputs may not occur\nat the same time or in the same direction, and such changes may have differing impacts by product type. The\nvariables and inputs may be idiosyncratically affected by risks to the economy, including changing monetary and\nfiscal policies, impacts from the recent stress on the banking industry, and their impact on inflationary trends.\nChanges in one or multiple of the key macroeconomic variables may have a material impact to our estimation of\nexpected credit losses.\nFor additional information regarding the ACL, see Note 6.\nGoodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business\ncombinations are recorded at their fair values. Business combinations typically result in goodwill, which is\nsubject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the\ngoodwill has been attributed. We review the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as\nof October 31st or more frequently if events or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist.\nWhen assessing goodwill for impairment, a qualitative assessment may be made to determine whether it is more-\nlikely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Alternatively, a quantitative\nassessment may be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. At December 31, 2023, goodwill\ntotaled $8.2 billion, including $6.9 billion from pre-IPO acquisitions, and is assigned to our reporting units as\nfollows: $5.5 billion to Commercial Banking, including $4.7 billion from pre-IPO acquisitions, and $2.7 billion to\nConsumer Banking, including $2.2 billion from pre-IPO acquisitions.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 61\nThe process of evaluating the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective, involving management\nassumptions and estimates and the use of external or internal valuations. Valuation techniques include\ndiscounted cash flow and market approach analysis. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the quantitative impairment\ntest estimated the fair value of the reporting units using an equal weighting of an income approach (i.e.,\ndiscounted cash flows method) and market-based approach (i.e., the guideline public company method). The\nguideline public company method utilizes comparable public company information and key valuation multiples,\nand considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise\nfrom obtaining control over a reporting unit, and guideline transactions, when applicable.\nUnder the income approach, cash flow projections are based on multi-year financial forecasts developed\nfor each reporting unit that consider key business drivers such as new business initiatives, customer retention\nstandards, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, fees and expenses, forward interest\nrates, historical performance, credit performance, and industry and economic trends, among other\nconsiderations. The projection of net interest income and noninterest expense are the most significant inputs to\nthe financial projections of the Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking reporting units. The long-term\nearnings growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was 3% as of October 31,\n2023, based on management’s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit.\nDiscount rates are estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest\nrate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The\ndiscount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. A\ndiscount rate of 13% was utilized for the Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking reporting units as of October\n31, 2023.\nWe performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023 as part of our\nannual impairment assessment. Based on this quantitative assessment, we concluded that the estimated fair\nvalue of the Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking reporting units exceeded their carrying value. The\nCommercial Banking reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. Circumstances\nthat could negatively impact the future fair value of the Commercial Banking reporting unit include a sustained\ndecrease in our stock price, decline in industry peer multiples, deterioration in the reporting unit’s forecasts,\nand an increase in the discount rate driven by an increase in the risk-free rate or the risk we may not achieve our\nforecasted cash flows.\nWe monitored events and circumstances during the period from October 31, 2023 through December 31,\n2023, including macroeconomic and market factors, industry and banking sector events, Company-specific\nperformance indicators, a comparison of management’s forecast and assumptions to those used in its October 31,\n2023 quantitative impairment test, and the sensitivity of the October 31, 2023 quantitative test results to\nchanges in assumptions through December 31, 2023. Based on these considerations, management concluded that\nit was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of either of its reporting units is below its respective carrying\namount as of December 31, 2023.\nFor additional information regarding Goodwill, see Note 10.\nFair Value\nWe asses the fair value of assets and liabilities by applying various valuation methodologies which may\ninvolve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when active markets do not exist for the items being\nvalued. Quoted market prices are used to estimate the fair value of certain assets such as trading assets,\ninvestment securities and residential real estate loans held for sale. Assumptions are used to estimate the fair\nvalue of items for which an observable active market does not exist and include discount rates, rates of return on\nassets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different\nassumptions could produce significantly different fair value estimates, which could have a material impact on our\nresults of operations, financial condition or fair value disclosures.\nWe also assess whether there are any declines in fair value below the carrying value of assets that\nrequire recognition of a loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, including certain investments,\ncapitalized servicing assets, goodwill, and core deposit and other intangible assets.\nFor additional information regarding our fair value measurements, see Note 20.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 62\nACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS\nAccounting standards issued but not adopted as of December 31, 2023\nPronouncement Summary of Guidance Effects on Financial Statements\nImprovements to Reportable • Requires disclosure of significant segment • Required effective date: January 1,\nSegment Disclosures expenses regularly provided to the chief 2024 for our annual disclosures and\noperating decision maker (“CODM”) January 1, 2025 for our interim\nIssued November 2023 disclosures.

A key aspect of our Board’s responsibility as\nthe main decision-making body is setting our risk appetite to ensure that the levels of risk that we are willing to\naccept in the attainment of our strategic business and financial objectives are clearly understood.\nTo enable our Board to carry out its objectives, it has delegated authority for risk management activities,\nas well as governance and oversight of those activities, to a number of Board and executive management level\nrisk committees. The Executive Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for oversight of\nrisk across the enterprise and actively considers our inherent material risks, analyzes our overall risk profile and\nseeks confirmation that the risks are being appropriately identified, assessed and mitigated. Reporting to the\nExecutive Risk Committee are the following committees covering specific areas of risk: Compliance and\nOperational Risk, Model Risk, Credit Policy, Asset Liability, Business Initiatives Review, and Conduct and Ethics.\nRisk Framework\nOur risk management framework is embedded in our business through a “Three Lines of Defense” model\nwhich defines responsibilities and accountabilities for risk management activities.\nFirst Line of Defense\nThe business lines, including their associated support functions, are the first line of defense and are\naccountable for identifying, assessing, managing, and controlling the risks associated with the products and\nservices they provide. The business lines are responsible for performing regular risk assessments to identify and\nassess the material risks that arise in their area of responsibility, complying with relevant risk policies, testing\nand certifying the adequacy and effectiveness of their operational and financial reporting controls on a regular\nbasis, establishing and documenting operating procedures, and establishing a governance structure for identifying\nand managing risk.\nSecond Line of Defense\nThe second line of defense includes independent monitoring and control functions accountable for the\ndevelopment of risk and control frameworks and related policies, and their associated implementation. This\ncentralized risk function is independent from the business and is accountable for overseeing and challenging our\nbusiness lines on the effective management of their risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market,\noperational, regulatory, reputational, interest rate, liquidity, legal and strategic risks.\nThird Line of Defense\nOur Internal Audit function is the third line of defense providing independent assurance of the\neffectiveness of our internal controls, governance practices, and culture so that risk is managed appropriately for\nthe size, complexity, and risk profile of the organization. Internal Audit has complete and unrestricted access to\nall of our records, physical properties and personnel. Internal Audit issues a report following each internal review\nand provides an audit opinion to the Board’s Audit Committee on a quarterly basis.\nCredit Review reports to the Chief Audit Executive and provides the Board, senior management and other\nstakeholders with independent assurance on the quality of credit portfolios and adherence to agreed Credit Risk\nAppetite and Credit Policies and processes. In line with its procedures and regulatory expectations, the Credit\nReview function undertakes a program of portfolio testing, assessing and reporting through four Risk Pillars of\nAsset Quality, Rating and Data Integrity, Risk Management and Credit Risk Appetite.\nRisk Appetite\nRisk appetite is a strategic business and risk management tool. We define our risk appetite as the\nmaximum limit of acceptable risk beyond which we could be unable to achieve our strategic objectives and\ncapital adequacy obligations.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 64\nOur principal non-market risks include credit, operational, regulatory, reputational, liquidity and\nstrategic risks. We are also subject to certain market risks which include potential losses arising from changes in\ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or\nprices. Market risk in our business arises from trading activities that serve customer needs, including hedging of\ninterest rates, foreign exchange risk and non-trading activities within capital markets. We have established\nenterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report on market risk. We actively\nmanage both trading and non-trading market risks. See “Market Risk” for further information. Our risk appetite is\nreviewed and approved annually by the Board Risk Committee.\nCredit Risk\nOverview\nCredit risk represents the potential for loss arising from a customer, counterparty, or issuer failing to\nperform in accordance with the contractual terms of the obligation. While the majority of our credit risk is\nassociated with lending activities, we do engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes\nincluding investing, asset and liability management, and trading activities. Given the financial impact of credit\nrisk on our earnings and balance sheet, the assessment, approval and management of credit risk represents a\nmajor part of our overall risk-management responsibility.\nObjective\nThe independent Credit Risk Function is responsible for reviewing and approving credit risk appetite\nacross all lines of business and credit products, approving larger and higher-risk credit transactions, monitoring\nportfolio performance, identifying problem credit exposures, and ensuring remedial management.\nOrganizational Structure\nManagement and oversight of credit risk is the responsibility of both the business line and the second line\nof defense. The second line of defense, the independent Credit Risk Function, is led by the Chief Credit Officer\nwho oversees all credit risk and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Credit Officer, acting in a manner\nconsistent with Board policies, has responsibility for, among other things, the governance process around\npolicies, procedures, risk acceptance criteria, credit risk appetite, limits and authority delegation. The Chief\nCredit Officer and team also have responsibility for credit approvals for larger and higher-risk transactions and\noversight of line of business credit risk activities. Reporting to the Chief Credit Officer are the heads of the\nsecond line of defense credit functions specializing in: Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, Citizens\nRestructuring Management, Portfolio and Corporate Reporting, ALLL Analytics, Current Expected Credit Loss, and\nCredit Policy and Administration. Each team under these leaders is composed of experienced credit professionals.\nGovernance\nThe primary mechanisms used to govern our credit risk function are our consumer and commercial credit\npolicies. These policies outline the minimum acceptable lending standards that align with our desired risk\nappetite. Material changes in our business model and strategies that identify a need to change our risk appetite\nor highlight a risk not previously contemplated are identified by the individual committees and presented to the\nCredit Policy Committee, Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee for approval, as appropriate.\nKey Management Processes\nWe employ a comprehensive and integrated risk control program to proactively identify, measure,\nmonitor, and mitigate existing and emerging credit risks across the credit life cycle including origination,\naccount/portfolio management, and loss mitigation and recovery.\nConsumer\nOn the Consumer Banking side of credit risk, our teams use models to evaluate consumer loans across the\nlife cycle of the loan. Credit scoring models are used to forecast the probability of default of an applicant at\norigination. When approving customers for a new loan or extension of an existing credit line, credit scores are\nused in conjunction with other credit risk variables such as affordability, length of term, collateral value,\ncollateral type, and lien subordination.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 65\nLending authority is granted by the second line of defense credit risk function to each underwriter to\nensure proper oversight of the underwriting teams. The amount of delegated authority depends on the\nexperience of the individual. We periodically evaluate the performance of each underwriter and annually\nreauthorize their delegated authority. Only senior members of the second line of defense credit risk team are\nauthorized to approve significant exceptions to credit policies. It is not uncommon to make exceptions to\nestablished policies when compensating factors are present. There are exception limits which, when reached,\ntrigger a comprehensive analysis.\nCredit scores and collateral values are refreshed at regular intervals once an account is established to\nallow for proactive identification of increasing or decreasing levels of credit risk. Our approach to managing\ncredit risk is highly analytical and, where appropriate, is automated to ensure consistency and efficiency.\nCommercial\nOn the Commercial Banking side of credit risk, risk management begins with defined credit products and\npolicies and is separated into commercial and industrial loans, CRE and leases. Within commercial and industrial\nloans and leases there are separate verticals established for certain specialty products (e.g., asset-based lending,\nleasing, franchise finance, health care, technology and mid-corporate). A “specialty vertical” is a stand-alone\nteam of industry or product specialists. Substantially all activity that falls under the ambit of the defined\nindustry or product is managed through a specialty vertical when one exists. CRE also operates as a specialty\nvertical.\nCommercial transactions are subject to individual analysis and approval at origination and, with few\nexceptions, are subject to a formal annual review requirement. The underwriting process includes the\nestablishment and approval of credit grades that establish the PD and LGD. All material transactions require the\napproval of both a business line approver and an independent credit approver with the requisite level of\ndelegated authority. The approval level of a particular credit facility is determined by the size of the credit\nrelationship as well as the PD. The checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit\napprover function are designed to appropriately assess and sanction the level of credit risk being accepted,\nfacilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they occur, and to provide for effective problem asset\nmanagement and resolution. All authority to grant credit is delegated through the independent Credit Risk\nfunction and is closely monitored and updated annually at a minimum.\nThe primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower,\nassessment of the borrower’s management capabilities, cash flows from operations, industry sector trends, type\nand sufficiency of collateral, type of exposure, transaction structure, and the general economic outlook. While\nthese are the primary factors considered, there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the\ndecision process. In addition to the credit analysis conducted during the approval process at origination and\nannual review, our Credit Review group performs testing to provide an independent review and assessment of the\nquality of the portfolio and new originations. This group conducts portfolio reviews on a risk-based cycle to\nevaluate individual loans and validate risk ratings, as well as test the consistency of the credit processes and the\neffectiveness of credit risk management.\nThe maximum level of credit exposure to individual credit borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based\non the perceived risk of each borrower or related group of borrowers. Concentration risk is managed through\nlimits on industry asset class and loan quality factors. We focus predominantly on extending credit to commercial\ncustomers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary markets, although we do engage in\nlending opportunities outside our primary markets if we believe that the associated risks are acceptable and\naligned with strategic initiatives.\nSubstantially all loans categorized as Classified are managed by a specialized group of credit\nprofessionals.\nMARKET RISK\nMarket risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates,\nequity prices, commodity prices and/or other relevant market rates or prices. Modest market risk arises from\ntrading activities that serve customer needs, including the hedging of interest rate and foreign exchange risk. As\ndescribed below, the market risk arising from our non-trading banking activities, such as the origination of loans\nand deposit-gathering, is more significant. We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to\nidentify, measure, monitor and report market risk. We actively manage market risk for both non-trading and\ntrading activities.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 66\nNon-Trading Risk\nOur non-trading banking activities expose us to market risk. This market risk is composed of interest rate\nrisk, as we have no commodity risk and de minimis direct currency and equity risk. We also have market risk\nrelated to capital markets loan originations, as well as the valuation of our MSRs.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk emerges from the balance sheet after the aggregation of our assets, liabilities and\nequity. We refer to this non-trading risk embedded in the balance sheet as “structural interest rate risk” or\n“interest rate risk in the banking book.”\nA major source of structural interest rate risk is a difference in the repricing of assets relative to\nliabilities and equity. There are differences in the timing and drivers of rate changes reflecting the maturity and/\nor repricing of assets and liabilities. For example, the rate earned on a commercial loan may reprice monthly\nwith changes in the benchmark rate, while the rate paid on debt or certificates of deposit may be fixed for a\nlonger period. There may also be differences in the drivers of rate changes. Loans may be tied to a specific index\nrate such as SOFR or Prime, while deposits may not be as correlated with such rates and more dependent upon\ncompetitive demand. Due to these basis differences, net interest income is sensitive to changes in spreads\nbetween certain indices or repricing rates.\nA primary source of our structural interest rate risk relates to faster repricing of floating-rate loans\nrelative to core deposit funding. This source of asset sensitivity is more biased toward the short end of the yield\ncurve.\nThe secondary source of our interest rate risk is driven by longer term rates comprising the rollover or\nreinvestment risk on fixed-rate loans, as well as prepayment risk on mortgage-related loans and securities funded\nby non-rate sensitive deposits and equity.\nAnother important source of structural interest rate risk relates to the potential exercise of explicit or\nembedded options. For example, most consumer loans can be prepaid without penalty and most consumer\ndeposits can be withdrawn without penalty. The exercise of such options by customers can exacerbate the timing\ndifferences discussed above.\nThe primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk within\npolicy limits approved by our Board. These limits and guidelines reflect our tolerance for interest rate risk over\nboth short-term and long-term horizons. To ensure that exposure to interest rate risk is managed within our risk\nappetite, we measure the exposure and hedge it, as necessary. The Treasury Asset and Liability Management\nteam is responsible for measuring, monitoring and reporting on our structural interest rate risk position. These\nexposures are reported on a monthly basis to the Asset Liability Committee and at Board meetings.\nWe measure structural interest rate risk through a variety of metrics intended to quantify both short-\nterm and long-term exposures. The primary method we use to quantify interest rate risk is simulation analysis in\nwhich we model net interest income from assets, liabilities and hedge derivative positions under various interest\nrate scenarios over a three-year horizon. Exposure to interest rate risk is reflected in the variation of forecasted\nnet interest income across these scenarios.\nKey assumptions in this simulation analysis relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, changes\nin product balances and the behavior of our loan and deposit customers in different rate environments. Repricing\ncharacteristics and balance fluctuations of deposits with indeterminate (i.e., non-contractual) maturities, as well\nas the pace of mortgage prepayments are the most significant behavioral assumptions. We utilize product level\nmodels that consider specific product characteristics and composition of the deposit portfolio, along with current\nand forward-looking market dynamics, to project deposit rates. Similarly, we employ dynamic prepayment and\nmortgage rate models to project prepayment behaviors specific to each of our product offerings. These models\nare developed based on internal performance data over prior interest rate cycles and calibrated to our\nexperience and outlook for rates across a diverse set of market environments. We assess our models and\nassumptions periodically by running sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of changes to inputs or\nassumptions on our risk results, which are reported to the Asset Liability Committee.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 67\nSince we cannot predict the future path of interest rates, we use simulation analysis to project net\ninterest income under various interest rate scenarios including a “most likely” (implied forward) scenario, as well\nas a variety of extreme and unlikely scenarios. These scenarios may assume gradual ramping of the overall level\nof interest rates, immediate shocks to the level of rates and various yield curve twists in which movements in\nshort- or long-term rates predominate. Generally, projected net interest income in any interest rate scenario is\ncompared to net interest income in a base case where market-forward rates are realized.\nThe table below reports net interest income exposures against a variety of interest rate scenarios. Our\npolicies involve measuring exposures as a percentage change in net interest income over the next year due to\neither instantaneous or gradual parallel changes in rates relative to the market implied forward yield curve. As\nthe following table illustrates, our balance sheet is marginally asset-sensitive; net interest income would benefit\nfrom an increase in interest rates, while exposure to a decline in interest rates is within limits established and\nmonitored by senior management. While an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is included in this\nanalysis, we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would be more gradual and, therefore, have a more\nmodest impact.\nThe table below presents the sensitivity of net interest income to various parallel yield curve shifts from\nthe market implied forward yield curve:\nTable 27: Sensitivity of Net Interest Income\nEstimated % Change in\nNet Interest Income over\n12 Months\nDecember 31,\nBasis points 2023 2022\nInstantaneous Change in Interest Rates\n+200 — % 4.8%\n+100 0.5 2.4\n-100 (1.5) (2.5)\n-200 (3.0) (5.6)\nGradual Change in Interest Rates\n+200 0.4 % 2.7%\n+100 0.5 1.4\n-100 (1.0) (1.4)\n-200 (1.9) (3.0)\nWe continue to manage asset sensitivity within the scope of our policy, changing market conditions and\nchanges in our balance sheet. The Company’s base case net interest income assumes the forward-rate path\nimplied by the yield curve is realized, which reflects a Fed Funds rate of 4.25% at the end of 2024, reflecting five\n25 basis point reductions beginning in the second quarter of 2024. The rate risk exposure is then measured based\non assumed changes from that base case rate path.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our asset sensitivity has shifted to a more neutral position compared to 2022.\nThis reflects the impacts of changes in our balance sheet mix, including securities, loans, deposits, borrowed\nfunds and ongoing hedge activity, which is primarily comprised of received fixed swaps that offset our naturally\nasset-sensitive balance sheet. Our sensitivity profile exhibits asymmetry for up and down rate scenarios as we\nexpect to see incremental deposit migration to higher rate products in response to rising rate scenarios compared\nto declining rate scenario.\nWe use a valuation measure of exposure to structural interest rate risk, EVE, as a supplement to net\ninterest income simulations. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk\nexposure over a long-term horizon. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities\nand off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. This analysis is highly\ndependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. We employ\nsophisticated models for prepayments and deposit pricing and attrition, which provide a granular view of cash\nflows based on the unique characteristics of the underlying products and customer segments. The change in value\nis expressed as a percentage of regulatory capital.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 68\nWe use interest rate contracts as part of our ALM strategy to manage exposure to the variability in the\ninterest cash flows on our floating-rate assets and wholesale funding, the variability in the fair value of AFS\nsecurities, and to hedge market risk on fixed-rate capital markets debt issuances.\nThe following table presents interest rate derivative contracts that we have entered into as of December\n31, 2023 and 2022.\nTable 28: Interest Rate Derivative Contracts Used to Manage Non-Trading Interest Rate Exposure\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nWeighted Average Weighted Average\nNotional Maturity Fixed Reset Notional Maturity Fixed Reset\n(dollars in millions) Amount (Years) Rate Rate Amount (Years) Rate Rate\nFair value hedges:\nAsset conversion swaps:\nAFS securities:\nPay fixed/receive SOFR $5,365 6.2 3.8 % 5.4 % $— — — % — %\nLiability conversion swaps:\nLong-term borrowed funds:\nReceive fixed/pay 3-month LIBOR — — — — 1,000 1.6 2.7 4.7\nReceive fixed/pay SOFR 500 1.9 2.6 5.6 — — — —\nTotal fair value hedges 5,865 1,000\nCash flow hedges:\nAsset conversion swaps:\nLoans:\nSwaps\nReceive fixed/pay SOFR 17,780 0.8 4.0 5.4 500 2.7 3.5 4.3\nReceive fixed/pay SOFR - forward-starting 31,250 2.9 3.3 4.6 13,500 3.2 3.0 4.5\nReceive fixed/pay 1-month LIBOR — — — — 15,250 3.8 1.8 4.3\nReceive fixed/pay 1-month LIBOR - forward-\nstarting — — — — 2,000 5.2 2.9 4.9\nBasis swaps\nReceive SOFR/pay 1-month term SOFR 5,000 1.0 — 5.3/5.3 — — — —\nReceive SOFR/pay 1-month term SOFR -\nforward-starting 14,000 2.7 — 5.2/5.1 7,000 3.3 — 4.4/4.4\nFloor Cap Floor Cap\nRate Rate Rate Rate\nOptions\nInterest rate collars(1) 1,000 1.5 2.5 3.7 — — — —\nInterest rate collars - forward-starting(1) 500 2.5 2.7 4.4 1,500 2.8 2.6 3.9\nFloor spreads - forward-starting(2) 2,500 2.8 2.2/3.2 — — — — —\nTotal cash flow hedges 72,030 39,750\nTotal hedges $77,895 $40,750\n(1) Weighted average floor and cap rates represent strike rates through which CFG will receive interest if the SOFR rate falls below the floor strike rate and pay\ninterest if the SOFR rate exceeds the cap strike rate.\n(2) Weighted average floor rate represents strike rates for the short and long interest rate floors, respectively.

This amount could differ from amounts actually\nrecognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent\nto December 31, 2023.\nLIBOR Transition\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom’s FCA announced that it would no longer require banks to submit LIBOR\nrates after 2021. On March 5, 2021, the FCA formally announced the future cessation of 1-week and 2-month U.S.\nDollar LIBOR rates as of December 31, 2021, with all other U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenors ceasing as of June 30, 2023.\nIn the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of private-market participants\nconvened to help ensure a successful transition away from U.S. Dollar LIBOR, identified SOFR as its recommended\nalternative rate.\nOn March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”) was signed into law, with\nthe FRB adopting its final rule, effective February 27, 2023, to implement the LIBOR Act on December 16, 2022.\nThe final rule addresses references to LIBOR in contracts that (i) are governed by U.S. law; (ii) will not mature\nbefore June 30, 2023; and (iii) lack fallback provisions providing for a clearly defined and practical replacement\nfor LIBOR. The Company assessed the impact of this legislation and applied its provisions accordingly to transition\nits LIBOR contracts to an alternative rate.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company’s transition and remediation efforts were complete, with ongoing\nmonitoring for LIBOR-based financial instruments that will transition to alternative rates at their next interest\nrate reset date.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 70\nCapital Markets\nA key component of our capital markets activities is the underwriting and distribution of corporate credit\nfacilities to finance merger and acquisition transactions for our clients. We have a rigorous risk management\nprocess around these activities, including a limit structure capping our underwriting risk, potential loss, and sub-\nlimits for specific asset classes. Further, the ability to approve underwriting exposure is delegated only to senior\nlevel individuals in the credit risk management and capital markets organizations with each transaction\nadjudicated in the Loan Underwriting Approval Committee.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nWe have market risk associated with the value of residential MSRs, which are impacted by various types\nof inherent risks, including duration, basis, convexity, volatility and yield curve.\nAs part of our overall risk management strategy we enter into various free-standing derivatives, such as\ninterest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, interest rate futures and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-\nbacked securities to economically hedge the change in fair value of our MSRs. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe fair value of our MSRs was $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, and the total notional amount of related\nderivative contracts was $15.1 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively. Gains and losses on MSRs and the related\nderivatives used for hedging are included in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAs with our traded market risk-based activities, earnings at risk excludes the impact of MSRs. MSRs are\ncaptured under our single price risk management framework that is used for calculating a management value at\nrisk consistent with the definition used by banking regulators.\nTrading Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk primarily through client facilitation activities including derivatives and\nforeign exchange products as well as underwriting and market making activities. Exposure is created as a result\nof changes in interest rates and related basis spreads and volatility, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and\ncredit spreads on a select range of interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities, equity securities, corporate\nbonds and secondary loan instruments. These securities underwriting and trading activities are conducted\nthrough CBNA and Citizens JMP Securities, LLC.\nClient facilitation activities consist primarily of interest rate derivatives, financially settled commodity\nderivatives and foreign exchange contracts where we enter into offsetting trades with a separate counterparty or\nexchange to manage our market risk exposure. In addition, we operate trading desks covering secondary loans,\ncorporate bonds, and equity securities, with the objective of meeting secondary liquidity needs of our issuing\nclients’ transactions and investor clients. We do not engage in any trading activities to benefit from short-term\nprice differences.\nMarket Risk Governance\nThe process of setting our market risk limit is established in accordance with the formal enterprise risk\nappetite process and policy, which reflects the strategic and enterprise level articulation of opportunities for\ncreating franchise value set to the boundaries of how much market risk to assume. Dealing authorities represent\nthe key control tool in the management of market risk that allows the cascading of the risk appetite throughout\nthe enterprise. A dealing authority sets the operational scope and tolerances within which a business and/or\ntrading desk is permitted to operate, which is reviewed annually at a minimum. Dealing authorities are\nstructured to accommodate client facing trades and hedges needed to manage the risk profile, with responsibility\nfor remaining within established tolerances residing with the business. Key risk indicators, including VaR, open\nforeign currency positions and single name risk are monitored daily and reported against tolerances consistent\nwith our risk appetite and business strategy to the appropriate business line management and risk counterparts.\nMarket Risk Measurement\nWe use VaR as a statistical measure for estimating potential exposure of our traded market risk in normal\nmarket conditions. Our VaR framework for risk management and regulatory reporting is the same. Risk\nmanagement VaR is based on a one-day holding period to a 99% confidence level and regulatory VaR is based on a\nten-day holding period to the same confidence level. In addition to VaR, non-statistical measurements for\nmeasuring risk such as sensitivity analysis, market value and stress testing are employed.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 71\nOur market risk platform and associated market risk and valuation models capture correlation effects\nacross all our “covered positions” and allow for aggregation of market risk across products, risk types, business\nlines and legal entities. We measure, monitor and report market risk for management and regulatory capital\npurposes.\nVaR Overview\nThe market risk measurement model is based on historical simulation. The VaR measure estimates the\nextent of any fair value losses on trading positions that may occur due to broad market movements (General VaR)\nsuch as changes in the level of interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. It is\ncalculated on the basis that current positions remain relatively unaltered over the course of a given holding\nperiod with the assumption that markets are sufficiently liquid to allow the business to close its positions, if\nrequired, within this holding period. Based on the composition of our “covered positions,” we also use a\nstandardized add-on approach for the loan trading and high yield bond desks’ Specific Risk capital, which\nestimates the extent of any losses that may occur from factors other than broad market movements. The General\nVaR approach is expressed in terms of a confidence level over the past 500 trading days. The internal VaR\nmeasure, used as the basis of the main VaR trading limits, is a 99% confidence level with a one-day holding\nperiod, indicating that a loss greater than the VaR is expected to occur, on average, on only one day in 100\ntrading days (i.e., 1% of the time). Theoretically, there should be a loss event greater than VaR two to three\ntimes per year. The regulatory measure of VaR is a 99% confidence level with a ten-day holding period. The\nhistorical market data applied to calculate the VaR is updated on a two-business day lag. Refer to “Market Risk\nRegulatory Capital” below for details of our ten-day VaR metrics for the quarters ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\nMarket Risk Regulatory Capital\nThe U.S. banking regulators’ “Market Risk Rule” covers the calculation of market risk capital. Under this\nrule all of our client facing trades and associated hedges maintain a net low risk and qualify as “covered\npositions.” The internal management VaR measure is calculated based on the same population of trades that is\nutilized for regulatory VaR.\nTable 31: Results of Modeled and Non-Modeled Measures for Regulatory Capital Calculations\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Three Months Ended\n(dollars in millions) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nPeriod Period\nMarket Risk Category End Average High Low End Average High Low\nInterest Rate $3 $3 $5 $2 $3 $2 $3 $1\nForeign Exchange Currency Rate — — 2 — — — — —\nCredit Spread 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 2\nCommodity — — — — — — — —\nGeneral VaR 4 4 6 3 5 3 5 2\nSpecific Risk VaR — — — — — — — —\nTotal VaR $4 $4 $6 $3 $5 $3 $5 $2\nStressed General VaR $4 $7 $14 $3 $12 $10 $15 $6\nStressed Specific Risk VaR — — — — — — — —\nTotal Stressed VaR $4 $7 $14 $3 $12 $10 $15 $6\nMarket Risk Regulatory Capital $33 $39\nSpecific Risk Not Modeled Add-on 17 20\nde Minimis Exposure Add-on 1 —\nTotal Market Risk Regulatory Capital $51 $59\nMarket Risk-Weighted Assets $643 $739\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 72\nStressed VaR\nSVaR is an extension of VaR and utilizes a longer historical look-back horizon, fixed from January 3, 2005,\nto identify headline risks from more volatile periods and to provide a counterbalance to VaR, which may be low\nduring periods of low volatility. The holding period for profit and loss determination is ten days. In addition to its\nutilization for risk management purposes, SVaR is a component of market risk regulatory capital. We calculate\nSVaR daily under its own dynamic window regime whereby values of the ten-day, 99% VaR are calculated over all\n260-day periods that can be obtained from the complete historical data set. Refer to “Market Risk Regulatory\nCapital” above for SVaR metrics.\nSensitivity Analysis\nSensitivity analysis is the measure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a one basis point change in\nrates or credit spread. We conduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, basis spreads, foreign exchange\nexposures, option prices and credit spreads. Since VaR is based on previous moves in market risk factors over\nrecent periods, it may not be an accurate predictor of future market moves. Sensitivity analysis complements\nVaR as it provides an indication of risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market moves and is an\neffective tool in evaluating the appropriateness of hedging strategies and concentrations.\nStress Testing\nConducting a stress test of a portfolio consists of running risk models with the inclusion of key variables\nthat simulate various historical or hypothetical scenarios. For historical stress tests, profit and loss results are\nsimulated for select time periods corresponding to the most volatile underlying returns, while hypothetical stress\ntests aim to consider concentration risk, illiquidity under stressed market conditions and risk arising from our\ntrading activities that may not be fully captured by our other risk-measurement methodologies. Hypothetical\nscenarios also assume that market moves occur simultaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes\nplace to mitigate losses as market events unfold. Stress tests of our trading positions are generated daily.\nVaR Model Review and Validation\nOur market risk measurement models are independently reviewed and subject to ongoing performance\nanalysis by the model owners. This independent review and validation focuses on model methodology, market\ndata and performance and is the responsibility of Citizens’ Model Risk Management and Validation team. This\nteam challenges the assumptions used and quantitative techniques employed, including the theoretical\njustification supporting them, and performs an assessment of the soundness of the required data over time. The\nquantitative impact of the major underlying modeling assumptions is estimated (e.g., through developing\nalternative models), if possible. The market risk models may be periodically enhanced due to changes in market\nprice levels and price action regime behavior. The Market Risk Management and Validation team conducts\ninternal validation before a new or changed model element is implemented and before a change is made to\nmarket data mapping.\nVaR Backtesting\nBacktesting is one form of validation of the VaR model and is run daily. The Market Risk Rule requires a\ncomparison of our internal VaR measure to the actual net trading revenue (excluding fees, commissions,\nreserves, intra-day trading and net interest income) for each day over the preceding year (the most recent 250\nbusiness days). Any observed loss in excess of the VaR number is taken as an exception.

The Company’s system of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is designed, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief\nFinancial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023 based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment,\nmanagement concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is\neffective.\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Deloitte &\nTouche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report appearing\non page 83, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 79\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc.\nProvidence, Rhode Island\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and its\nsubsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of\noperations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in\nthe period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated\nfinancial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their\noperations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based\non criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2024, expressed an unqualified\nopinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility\nis to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are\nfree of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,\nand performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any\nway our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical\naudit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures\nto which they relate.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 80\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s estimate of expected credit losses in its loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the ACL. The ACL\nis maintained at a level the Company believes to be appropriate to absorb expected lifetime credit losses over\nthe contractual life of a loan or lease and on the unfunded lending commitments. The determination of the ACL\nis based on periodic evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable. A number of relevant underlying factors, including key assumptions and evaluation\nof quantitative and qualitative information, are considered.\nKey assumptions used in the ACL measurement process include the use of a two-year reasonable and supportable\neconomic forecast period followed by a one-year reversion period to historical credit loss information.\nThe quantitative evaluation of the adequacy of the ACL utilizes a single economic forecast as its foundation and\nis primarily based on econometric models that use known or estimated data as of the balance sheet date and\nforecasted data over the reasonable and supportable period. Known and estimated data include current PD, LGD\nand EAD for commercial loans, timing and amount of expected draws for unfunded lending commitments, FICO,\nLTV, and term for retail loans. The mix and level of loan balances, delinquency levels, assigned risk ratings,\nprevious loss experience, current business conditions, amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, and\nfactors particular to specific commercial credits such as competition, business and management performance are\nalso considered. Forward-looking economic assumptions include real gross domestic product, unemployment rate,\ninterest rate curve, and changes in collateral values. This data is accumulated to estimate expected credit losses\nover the contractual life of the loans and leases, adjusted for expected prepayments. Historical information,\nsuch as financial statements for commercial customers or consumer credit ratings, may not be as important to\nestimating future expected losses as forecasted inputs to the models during volatile economic time periods.\nThe ACL may also be affected by a variety of qualitative factors that the Company considers that are not\nmeasured in the statistical procedures including uncertainty related to the economic forecasts, loan growth,\nbacktesting results, credit underwriting policy exceptions, regulatory and audit findings, and peer comparisons.\nThe qualitative allowance is further affected by sensitivity analysis for certain industry sectors or loan classes,\nincluding CRE office.\nGiven the size of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded commitments and the subjective nature of\nestimating the ACL, including the estimated impact of the factors noted above and related economic forecasting\nuncertainty, auditing the ACL involved a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the ACL for the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded commitments included\nthe following, among others:\n• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the (i) selection of the economic forecasts, (ii) development,\nexecution. and monitoring of the econometric models, (iii) estimation of management’s adjustments to the\nmodeled reserves in the industry sectors facing challenges in the current macroeconomic environment, (iv)\ndetermination of the qualitative allowance, and (v) overall calculation and disclosure of the ACL.\n• With the assistance of credit specialists, we (i) evaluated the reasonableness of the econometric models and\nrelated assumptions, (ii) assessed the reasonableness of design, theory, and logic of the econometric models\nfor estimating expected credit losses, (iii) tested the accuracy of the data input into the econometric\nmodels, and (iv) tested the arithmetic accuracy of the models’ calculations of the expected credit losses.\n• We (i) evaluated the appropriateness and relevance of the qualitative factors, including management’s\nconsideration of the economic forecasting uncertainty and adjustments to the modeled reserves for the\nindustry sectors facing challenges in the current macroeconomic environment, (ii) tested the accuracy and\nevaluated the relevance of the historical loss data used in determining the qualitative allowance, (iii)\nevaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s assessment and determination of the qualitative factors and\nrelated impact on the estimation of the qualitative allowance and (iv) tested the arithmetic accuracy of the\ncalculation of the qualitative allowance.\n• We tested the arithmetic accuracy of the calculation of the overall ACL and assessed the reasonableness of\nthe related disclosures.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 81\nGoodwill – Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nManagement has identified and assigned goodwill to two reporting units, Consumer Banking and Commercial\nBanking.\nManagement reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of October 31st or\nmore frequently if events or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist.\nManagement performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test due to a triggering event in the third quarter of\n2023 in addition to performing a quantitative impairment test associated with its annual assessment date. In both\ninstances, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units was determined using a combination of income and\nmarket-based approaches. Under the income approach, key assumptions included cash flow projections based on\nmulti-year forecasts, long-term earnings growth rate, and discount rates. Under the market-based approach, key\nassumptions included determination of comparable public companies, valuation multiples, and utilization of a\nmarket control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining\ncontrol over a reporting unit, and guideline transactions, when applicable.\nWe identified the goodwill impairment tests as a critical audit matter because these fair value determinations\nrequire management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the\nreasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased\nextent of effort, including the involvement of our valuation specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation of the Company’s reporting units included the following, among\nothers:\n• We tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the goodwill\nimpairment tests, including controls over the (i) accounting and valuation conclusions reached by\nmanagement, (ii) relevant business and valuation assumptions, and (iii) determination of its operating\nsegments and reporting units.\n• With the assistance of internal valuation specialists, we (i) evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation\nmethodology used and the reasonableness of the valuation and business assumptions, including the selection\nof discount rates, market multiples, and long-term earnings growth rate, (ii) assessed the mathematical\naccuracy of the valuation calculations, and (iii) assessed the reasonableness of the consolidated Company\nvaluation in comparison to the Company’s market capitalization.\n• We tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the valuation of the commercial and consumer\nreporting units.\n• We tested the reasonableness of Management’s forecast used in the valuation of the commercial and\nconsumer reporting units.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 16, 2024\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2000.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 82\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc.\nProvidence, Rhode Island\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Citizens Financial Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries\n(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In\nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nof the Company and our report dated February 16, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and\nfor its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nReport of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with\nthe U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan\nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for\nexternal purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records\nthat, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nconsolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts\nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the\npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 16, 2024\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 83\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in millions, except par value) 2023 2022\nASSETS:\nCash and due from banks(1) $1,794 $1,489\nInterest-bearing cash and due from banks 9,834 9,058\nInterest-bearing deposits in banks(1) 405 303\nDebt securities available for sale, at fair value (including $110 and $270 pledged to creditors,\nrespectively)(2) 29,777 24,007\nDebt securities held to maturity (fair value of $8,350 and $9,042, respectively, and including\n$204 and $110 pledged to creditors, respectively)(2) 9,184 9,834\nLoans held for sale, at fair value 676 774\nOther loans held for sale 103 208\nLoans and leases 145,959 156,662\nLess: Allowance for loan and lease losses (2,098) (1,983)\nNet loans and leases(1) 143,861 154,679\nDerivative assets 440 842\nPremises and equipment, net 895 844\nBank-owned life insurance 3,291 3,236\nGoodwill 8,188 8,173\nOther intangible assets(3) 157 197\nOther assets(1) 13,359 13,089\nTOTAL ASSETS $221,964 $226,733\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\nLIABILITIES:\nDeposits:\nNoninterest-bearing $37,107 $49,283\nInterest-bearing 140,235 131,441\nTotal deposits 177,342 180,724\nShort-term borrowed funds 505 3\nDerivative liabilities 1,562 1,909\nLong-term borrowed funds(1) 13,467 15,887\nOther liabilities(1) 4,746 4,520\nTOTAL LIABILITIES 197,622 203,043\nCommitments and Contingencies (refer to Note 19)\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\nPreferred Stock:\n$25.00 par value,100,000,000 shares authorized; 2,050,000 shares issued and outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 2,014 2,014\nCommon stock:\n$0.01 par value, 1,000,000,000 shares authorized; 647,829,720 shares issued and\n466,418,055 shares outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 645,220,018 shares issued and\n492,282,158 shares outstanding at December 31, 2022 6 6\nAdditional paid-in capital 22,250 22,142\nRetained earnings 9,816 9,159\nTreasury stock, at cost, 181,411,665 and 152,937,860 shares at December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively (5,986) (5,071)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (3,758) (4,560)\nTOTAL STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY 24,342 23,690\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY $221,964 $226,733\n(1) Includes amounts in consolidated VIEs.

to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 89\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations\nThe Company is a regional bank holding company organized under Delaware law and headquartered in\nProvidence, Rhode Island. Through its bank subsidiary, CBNA, the Company provides a broad range of retail and\ncommercial banking products and services to individuals, small businesses, middle-market companies, large\ncorporations and institutions. The Company’s retail branch network is primarily located in the New England, Mid-\nAtlantic and Midwest regions, with certain lines of business serving national markets.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Citizens and its subsidiaries, including\nVIEs in which Citizens is a primary beneficiary, and are presented in accordance with GAAP. Investments in VIEs\nin which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are not consolidated. All\nintercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, the Company’s indirect auto and certain purchased consumer loan\nportfolios were transferred from the Consumer Banking segment into a new Non-Core segment to reflect the\nmanner in which management is currently assessing performance and allocating resources. Prior period results\nhave been revised to conform to the new segment presentation. See Note 26 for additional information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.\nActual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to\nsignificant change include the determination of the ACL, fair value measurements and the evaluation and\nmeasurement of goodwill impairment.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe following table identifies the Company’s significant accounting policies and the Note and Page where\na detailed description of each policy can be found.\nNote Page\nCash and Due From Banks 3 96\nSecurities 4 96\nLoans and Leases 5 100\nAllowance for Credit Losses and FDMs 6 102\nPremises, Equipment and Software 7 116\nMortgage Servicing Rights 8 117\nLeases 9 118\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets 10 120\nVariable Interest Entities 11 121\nDerivative Instruments 14 126\nEmployee Benefits 15 129\nTreasury Stock 17 132\nEmployee Share-Based Compensation 18 133\nFair Value Measurement 20 136\nRevenue Recognition 21 142\nIncome Taxes 23 144\nEarnings Per Share 24 147\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 90\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2023\nPronouncement Summary of Guidance Effects on Financial Statements\nTroubled Debt Restructurings • Effective date: January 1, 2023. • The Company adopted the new\nand Vintage Disclosures standard on January 1, 2023, and\n• Eliminates the separate recognition and elected to apply the new\nIssued March 2022 measurement guidance for TDRs. measurement and recognition\nguidance for legacy TDRs under the\n• Requires evaluation of all modifications to modified retrospective transition\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty (or method.\nFDMs) to determine whether the modification\nresults in a new loan or continuation of an • Adoption did not have a material\nexisting loan. impact on the Company’s\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n• Requires expected credit losses measured Required disclosures and discussion\nunder a discounted cash flow method to be of significant accounting policies for\ndetermined using an effective interest rate modifications to borrowers\nbased on the modified (not original) experiencing financial difficulty are\ncontractual terms of the loan. included in Note 6.\n• Enhances disclosures by creditors for\nmodifications of receivables from borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty in the form of\nprincipal forgiveness, an interest rate\nreduction, an other-than-insignificant payment\ndelay or a term extension.\n• Requires disclosure of current period gross\ncharge-offs by vintage year for loans and net\ninvestments in leases.\n• Transition is prospective, with an option to\nadopt the recognition and measurement\nguidance for TDRs on a modified retrospective\nbasis, resulting in a cumulative-effect\nadjustment to retained earnings in the period\nof adoption.\nFair Value Hedging - Portfolio • Effective date: January 1, 2023. • The Company adopted the new\nLayer Method standard on January 1, 2023.\n• Replaces the ‘last-of-layer’ method.\nIssued March 2022 • Adoption did not have a material\n• Allows the designation of multiple layers in a impact on the Company’s\nclosed portfolio of financial assets.

The acquired liabilities and assets included approximately $6.3 billion in deposits and $1.5 billion in\nloans. The transaction resulted in an increase to goodwill of $120 million, which was allocated to the Consumer\nbusiness segment as of December 31, 2022.\nThe impact of the HSBC transaction, along with supplemental pro forma information as if the HSBC\ntransaction had occurred on January 1, 2021, are not material to the Company’s Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nThe HSBC transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed from HSBC were recorded at fair value as of the transaction date. The determination of fair\nvalue requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market\nconditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and are subject to change. The fair value\nof the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from HSBC were deemed final as of June 30, 2022 and are not\nmaterial to the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nInvestors Acquisition\nOn April 6, 2022, Citizens completed its Investors acquisition pursuant to an agreement and plan of\nmerger entered into on July 28, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Investors merged with Citizens,\nwith Citizens as the surviving corporation, and Investors Bank, a New Jersey state-chartered bank and wholly-\nowned subsidiary of Investors, merged with CBNA, with CBNA as the surviving bank. The Investors acquisition\nbuilt Citizens’ physical presence in the Mid-Atlantic region with the addition of 154 branches located in the\ngreater New York City and Philadelphia metropolitan areas and across New Jersey.\nUpon closing of the acquisition, each share of Investors common stock was converted into 0.297 of a\nshare of the Company’s common stock. This conversion, coupled with the conversion of equity awards noted\nbelow under “Share-Based Compensation Activity”, resulted in an increase of approximately 73.6 million basic\nand diluted shares. The Company also paid $1.46 in cash to shareholders of Investors for each share they owned.\nThe Investors acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, the assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed from Investors were recorded at fair value as of the closing date. The determination of\nfair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market\nconditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and are subject to change. Fair value\nestimates related to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Investors were subject to adjustment for up\nto one year after the closing date as new information was obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as\nof the closing date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that\ndate.\nShare-Based Compensation Activity\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement with Investors, stock options and restricted shares granted by\nInvestors that were outstanding as of April 6, 2022 were converted into CFG awards and remained subject to\ntheir original terms and conditions. Citizens issued 1,151,301 stock options and 259,316 restricted shares in\nconnection with the transaction.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 92\nThe following table includes an allocation of the consideration paid for the fair value of the identifiable\ntangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Investors:\n(dollars in millions, except per share data) April 6, 2022\nConsideration\nCFG common shares issued 72,148,855\nCFG share price on April 6, 2022 $42.08\nFair value of consideration for outstanding common stock $3,036\nCash paid 355\nConsideration related to equity awards 19\nFair value of merger consideration 3,410\nAssets acquired\nCash and equivalents 287\nInvestment securities 3,826\nLoans held for sale 2,162\nNet loans and leases 20,139\nPremises and equipment 62\nCore deposit intangible and other intangible assets 119\nOther assets(1) 919\nTotal assets acquired 27,514\nLiabilities assumed\nDeposits 20,217\nBorrowed funds 4,097\nOther liabilities(1) 677\nTotal liabilities assumed 24,991\nLess: Net assets 2,523\nGoodwill(1) $887\n(1) Reflects purchase accounting adjustments made during 2023.\nGoodwill of $887 million recorded in connection with the acquisition resulted from the expected\nsynergies, operational efficiencies and expertise of Investors. The amount of goodwill recorded reflected the\nincreased market share and related synergies that resulted from the acquisition, and represents the excess\npurchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired from Investors. The goodwill was\nallocated to the Company’s Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking business operating segments and is not\ndeductible for income tax purposes.\nIntangible assets from the Investors acquisition consisted of core deposits and naming rights. For\nadditional information regarding the Company’s goodwill and intangible assets see Note 10.\nThe following table includes the fair value and unpaid principal balance of the loans acquired from\nInvestors:\nApril 6, 2022\nUnpaid Principal\n(dollars in millions) Balance Fair Value\nCommercial and industrial $3,021 $2,899\nCommercial real estate 13,310 13,065\nLeases 9 9\nTotal commercial 16,340 15,973\nResidential mortgages 3,949 3,889\nHome equity 267 273\nOther retail 4 4\nTotal retail 4,220 4,166\nNet loans and leases $20,560 $20,139\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 93\nFair value as of April 6, 2022 reflected a credit mark of $101 million on PCD funded loans recorded\nthrough purchase accounting, and an accretable discount of $320 million comprised of $179 million in interest\nrate mark and $141 million in non-PCD credit mark.\nThe following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair value of significant assets and\nliabilities:\nCash and Equivalents\nThe carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the\nshort-term nature of these assets.\nInvestment Securities\nFair value estimates for AFS securities were determined by third-party pricing vendors. The third-party\nvendors use a variety of methods when pricing securities that incorporate relevant market data to arrive at an\nestimate of what a buyer in the marketplace would pay for a security under current market conditions. These\nmethods include the use of quoted prices for an identical or similar security and an alternative market-based or\nincome approach like the discounted cash flow pricing model. Substantially all of the investment securities\nacquired in connection with the Investors acquisition were sold subsequent to closing to align with Citizens’\nportfolio management strategy.\nLoans held for sale\nLoans held for sale are valued based on quoted market prices, where available, prices for other traded\nloans with similar characteristics, and purchase commitments and bid information from market participants. The\nprices are adjusted as necessary to take into consideration the specific characteristics of certain loans that are\npriced based on the pricing of similar loans.\nLoans and Leases\nFair values for loans and leases are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors\nincluding type of loan and lease and related collateral, fixed or variable interest rate, term, amortization status,\ncredit loss and prepayment expectations, market interest rates and other market factors (e.g., liquidity) from\nthe perspective of a market participant. Loans and leases were grouped together according to similar\ncharacteristics when applying various valuation techniques. The discount rates used are based on current market\nrates for new originations of comparable loans and leases and include adjustments for liquidity. The probability\nof default, loss given default, exposure at default and prepayment assumptions are the key factors driving credit\nlosses which are embedded into the estimated cash flows.\nPremises and Equipment\nFair value of premises is based on a market approach using third-party appraisals and broker opinions of\nvalue for land, office and branch space.\nCore Deposit Intangible\nFair value of core deposit intangible represents the value of certain client deposit relationships,\nestimated utilizing the favorable source of funds method. Appropriate consideration was given to deposit costs\nincluding servicing costs, client retention and alternative funding source costs at the time of acquisition. The\ndiscount rate used was derived taking into account the estimated cost of equity, risk-free return rate and risk\npremium for the market, and specific risk related to the asset’s cash flows. The core deposit intangible is being\namortized over 10 years using an accelerated depreciation methodology.\nDeposits\nFair value of time deposits was estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using current market\nrates for instruments with similar maturities.

A variety of factors are\nconsidered in connection with the identification of more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality\nincluding, but not limited to, nonperforming status, delinquency, risk ratings, TDR classification, FICO scores and\nother qualitative factors. The amortized cost of a PCD loan is initially measured by adding the acquisition date\nestimate of expected credit losses to the loan's purchase price. The initial ALLL for PCD loans of $101 million was\nestablished through an adjustment to the Investors loan balance and related purchase accounting mark. Non-PCD\nloans and PCD loans had a fair value of $15.6 billion and $4.5 billion at the acquisition date and unpaid principal\nbalance of $15.9 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively. In accordance with U.S. GAAP there was no carryover of\nthe ACL that was previously recorded by Investors. Subsequent to the acquisition, an ACL on non-PCD loans of\n$145 million was recorded through provision expense for credit losses.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 95\nThe following table presents PCD loan activity at the date of acquisition:\n(dollars in millions) April 6, 2022\nPrincipal balance $4,685\nALLL at acquisition (101)\nNon-credit discount (72)\nPurchase price $4,512\nNOTE 3 - CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS\nFor the purpose of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents have original maturities of three\nmonths or less and include cash and due from banks and interest-bearing cash and due from banks. The Company\nhad no material restrictions on the use or availability of its cash as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nNOTE 4 - SECURITIES\nInvestments include debt, equity and other securities. Citizens classifies debt securities as AFS, HTM, or\ntrading based on management’s intent to hold to maturity at the time of purchase. Management reserves the\nright to change the initial classification of a security based on its intent to hold to maturity or as permitted by\nperiodic changes in accounting guidance. Equity securities are recorded at fair value or at cost if there is not a\nreadily determinable fair value.\nDebt securities that will be held for indefinite periods of time and may be sold in response to changes in\ninterest rates or prepayment risk, among other factors, are classified as AFS and reported at fair value, with\nunrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in AOCI as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.\nGains and losses on the sale of AFS securities are recognized in noninterest income in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations and are computed using the specific identification method.\nDebt securities for which the Company has the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as HTM\nand reported at amortized cost. Transfers of debt securities to the HTM classification are recognized at fair value\nat the date of transfer.\nInterest income for AFS and HTM debt securities is recorded on the accrual basis including the\namortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts utilizing the effective interest method over the\nestimated lives of the individual securities. Citizens uses actual prepayment experience and estimates of future\nprepayments to determine the constant effective yield necessary to apply the effective interest method of\nincome recognition. Estimates of future prepayments are based on the underlying collateral characteristics of\neach security and are derived from market sources. Judgment is involved in making determinations about\nprepayment expectations and in changing those expectations in response to changes in interest rates and\nmacroeconomic conditions. The amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts associated with\nmortgage-backed securities may be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment assumptions.\nSecurities classified as trading are held principally for sale in the near-term and carried at fair value,\nwith changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on such securities are\nreported in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nEquity securities primarily consist of FHLB and FRB stock carried at cost and money market mutual fund\ninvestments held by the Company’s broker-dealers carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in\nnoninterest income. Equity securities are recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with those\ncarried at cost reviewed at least annually for impairment. Valuation adjustments, to the extent necessary, are\nreported in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 96\nThe following table presents the major components of securities at amortized cost and fair value:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nGross Gross Gross Gross\nAmortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair\n(dollars in millions) Cost(1) Gains Losses Value Cost Gains Losses Value\nU.S. Treasury and other $4,493 $26 ($139) $4,380 $3,678 $1 ($193) $3,486\nState and political subdivisions 1 — — 1 2 — — 2\nMortgage-backed securities:\nFederal agencies and U.S. government\nsponsored entities 26,289 45 (1,857) 24,477 21,250 10 (2,198) 19,062\nOther/non-agency 279 — (24) 255 280 — (29) 251\nTotal mortgage-backed\nsecurities 26,568 45 (1,881) 24,732 21,530 10 (2,227) 19,313\nCollateralized loan obligations 667 — (3) 664 1,248 — (42) 1,206\nTotal debt securities available for sale,\nat fair value $31,729 $71 ($2,023) $29,777 $26,458 $11 ($2,462) $24,007\nMortgage-backed securities:\nFederal agencies and U.S. government\nsponsored entities $8,696 $9 ($818) $7,887 $9,253 $4 ($751) $8,506\nTotal mortgage-backed securities 8,696 9 (818) 7,887 9,253 4 (751) 8,506\nAsset-backed securities 488 — (25) 463 581 — (45) 536\nTotal debt securities held to maturity $9,184 $9 ($843) $8,350 $9,834 $4 ($796) $9,042\nEquity securities, at cost(2) $869 $— $— $869 $1,058 $— $— $1,058\nEquity securities, at fair value(2) 173 — — 173 153 — — 153\n(1) Excludes portfolio level basis adjustments of $60 million for securities designated in active fair value hedge relationships.

These repurchase agreements are typically short-term in nature and are\naccounted for as secured borrowed funds in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company\nrecognized no offsetting of short-term receivables or payables as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nSecuritizations of mortgage loans retained in the investment portfolio for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022 were $102 million and $143 million, respectively. These securitizations include a substantive\nguarantee by a third party. The guarantors were FNMA and FHLMC in 2023 and 2022. The debt securities received\nfrom the guarantors are classified as AFS.\nImpairment\nUpon purchase of HTM investment securities and at each subsequent measurement date, Citizens is\nrequired to evaluate the securities for risk of loss over their life and, if necessary, establish an associated\nreserve. Recognition of a reserve for expected credit losses is not required if the amount the Company expects to\nrealize is zero (commonly referred to as “zero expected credit losses”). The Company evaluated its existing HTM\nportfolio as of December 31, 2023 and concluded that 95% of HTM securities met the zero expected credit loss\ncriteria and, therefore, no ACL was recognized. Lifetime expected credit losses on the remainder of the HTM\nportfolio were determined to be insignificant based on the modeling of the Company’s credit loss position in the\nsecurities. The Company monitors the credit exposure through the use of credit quality indicators. For these\nsecurities, the Company uses external credit ratings or an internally derived credit rating when an external rating\nis not available. All securities were determined to be investment grade at December 31, 2023.\nCitizens reviews its AFS debt securities for impairment at the individual security level on a quarterly\nbasis, or more frequently if a potential loss triggering event occurs. The initial indicator of impairment for AFS\ndebt securities is a decline in fair value below its amortized cost basis. The Company recognizes an impairment\nloss for any security that has declined in fair value below its amortized cost basis if management has the intent\nto sell the security or if it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its\namortized cost basis.\nEstimating the recovery of the amortized cost basis of a debt security is based on an assessment of the\ncash flows expected to be collected. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted\nat the security’s original effective yield, is less than the amortized cost basis, impairment equal to the shortfall\nin cash flows has occurred and Citizens must evaluate whether any impairment is attributable to credit-related\nfactors. If credit-related factors exist, a credit-related impairment has occurred regardless of the Company’s\nintent to hold the security until it recovers.\nThe credit-related portion of impairment is recognized as provision expense through the establishment of\nan allowance for AFS securities, to the extent the allowance does not reduce the carrying value of the AFS\nsecurity below its current fair value. The remaining non-credit related portion of impairment is recognized in\nOCI. Improvement in credit losses in subsequent periods results in a reversal of the allowance for AFS securities\nand a corresponding decrease to provision expense, to the extent the allowance does not become negative.\nAccrued interest receivable on AFS debt securities is excluded from the balances used to calculate the allowance\nfor AFS securities. All accrued and uncollected interest is immediately reversed against interest income when it is\ndeemed uncollectible.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 99\nThe following tables present AFS debt securities with fair values below their respective carrying values,\nseparated by the duration the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position:\nDecember 31, 2023\nLess than 12 Months 12 Months or Longer Total\nGross Gross Gross\nUnrealized Unrealized Unrealized\n(dollars in millions) Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses\nU.S. Treasury and other $49 $— $3,245 ($139) $3,294 ($139)\nMortgage-backed securities:\nFederal agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities 2,939 (24) 16,398 (1,833) 19,337 (1,857)\nOther/non-agency — — 255 (24) 255 (24)\nTotal mortgage-backed securities 2,939 (24) 16,653 (1,857) 19,592 (1,881)\nCollateralized loan obligations 56 — 607 (3) 663 (3)\nTotal $3,044 ($24) $20,505 ($1,999) $23,549 ($2,023)\nDecember 31, 2022\nLess than 12 Months 12 Months or Longer Total\nGross Gross Gross\nUnrealized Unrealized Unrealized\n(dollars in millions) Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses Fair Value Losses\nU.S. Treasury and other $3,356 ($193) $— $— $3,356 ($193)\nMortgage-backed securities:\nFederal agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities 13,353 (1,136) 5,042 (1,062) 18,395 (2,198)\nOther/non-agency 80 (8) 171 (21) 251 (29)\nTotal mortgage-backed securities 13,433 (1,144) 5,213 (1,083) 18,646 (2,227)\nCollateralized loan obligations 785 (26) 421 (16) 1,206 (42)\nTotal $17,574 ($1,363) $5,634 ($1,099) $23,208 ($2,462)\nCitizens does not currently have the intent to sell these debt securities, and it is not more likely than not\nthat the Company will be required to sell these debt securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost bases.\nCitizens has determined that credit losses are not expected to be incurred on the AFS debt securities identified\nwith unrealized losses as of December 31, 2023. The unrealized losses on these debt securities reflect non-credit-\nrelated factors driven by changes in interest rates. Therefore, the Company has determined that these debt\nsecurities are not impaired.\nNOTE 5 - LOANS AND LEASES\nLoans are classified as held for investment when management has the intent and ability to hold the loan\nfor the foreseeable future, or until maturity or payoff. Loans held for investment are reported at the amount of\ntheir outstanding principal, net of charge-offs, unearned income, deferred loan origination fees and costs, and\nunamortized premiums and discounts on purchased loans. Deferred loan origination fees and costs and premiums\nand discounts on purchased loans are amortized as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan using the\neffective interest method. Unamortized amounts that remain when a loan is prepaid or sold are recorded as\ninterest income or gain (loss) on sale, respectively. Credit card receivables include billed and uncollected\ninterest and fees.\nInterest income on loans is determined using the effective interest method, which calculates periodic\ninterest income at a constant effective yield on the net investment in the loan, providing a constant rate of\nreturn over the loan term. Loans accounted for using the fair value option are measured at fair value with\ncorresponding changes reported in mortgage banking fees for residential mortgage LHFS and in capital markets\nfees for commercial LHFS in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCommitment fees for loans that are likely to be drawn down, along with other credit-related fees, are\ndeferred and recognized as an adjustment to the effective interest rate over the loan term. Commitment fees\nare recognized over the commitment period on a straight-line basis if it is unlikely that a loan will be drawn down\nand are reported in letter of credit and loan fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nLoans and leases are disclosed in portfolio segments and classes. The Company’s loan and lease portfolio\nsegments are commercial and retail. The classes of loans and leases are: commercial and industrial, commercial\nreal estate, leases, residential mortgages, home equity, automobile, education and other retail.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 100\nThe following table presents loans and leases, excluding LHFS:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022\nCommercial and industrial $43,826 $51,836\nCommercial real estate 29,471 28,865\nLeases 1,148 1,479\nTotal commercial 74,445 82,180\nResidential mortgages 31,332 29,921\nHome equity 15,040 14,043\nAutomobile 8,258 12,292\nEducation 11,834 12,808\nOther retail 5,050 5,418\nTotal retail 71,514 74,482\nTotal loans and leases $145,959 $156,662\nAccrued interest receivable on loans and leases held for investment totaled $875 million and $820 million\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nLoans pledged as collateral for FHLB borrowing capacity, primarily residential mortgages and home\nequity products, totaled $36.0 billion and $38.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The\ndetermination of whether an arrangement is a lease and the related lease classification are made at lease\ninception. Lease terms predominantly range from three to ten years and may include options to purchase the\nleased property prior to the end of the lease term. The Company does not have lease agreements that contain\nboth lease and non-lease components.\nA lessee is evaluated from a credit perspective using the same underwriting standards and procedures for\na loan borrower. A lessee is expected to make rental payments based on its cash flows and the viability of its\noperations. Leases are not typically evaluated as collateral-based transactions and, therefore, the lessee’s\noverall financial strength is the most important credit evaluation factor.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 101\nThe components of the net investment in direct financing and sales-type leases, before ALLL, are\npresented below:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022\nTotal future minimum lease rentals $942 $1,193\nEstimated residual value of leased equipment (non-guaranteed) 322 413\nInitial direct costs 5 5\nUnearned income (121) (132)\nTotal leases $1,148 $1,479\nInterest income on direct financing and sales-type leases for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021 was $46 million, $46 million and $49 million, respectively, and is reported within interest and fees on\nloans and leases in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nA maturity analysis of direct financing and sales-type lease receivables at December 31, 2023 is\npresented below:\nYear (dollars in millions)\n2024 $258\n2025 213\n2026 156\n2027 133\n2028 84\nThereafter 98\nTotal undiscounted future minimum lease rentals $942\nNOTE 6 - CREDIT QUALITY AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company’s estimate of expected credit losses in its loan and lease portfolios is recorded in the ACL\nand considers extensive historical loss experience, including the impact of loss mitigation and restructuring\nprograms that the Company offers to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, as well as projected loss\nseverity as a result of loan default. The ACL is maintained at a level the Company believes to be appropriate to\nabsorb expected lifetime credit losses over the contractual life of a loan or lease and on unfunded lending\ncommitments. The determination of the ACL is based on periodic evaluation of loan and lease portfolios and\nunfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. A number of relevant underlying\nfactors, including key assumptions and the evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information, are\nconsidered.\nKey assumptions used in the ACL measurement process include the use of a two-year reasonable and\nsupportable economic forecast period followed by a one-year reversion period to historical credit loss\ninformation. The evaluation of quantitative and qualitative information is performed by assessing groups of assets\nthat share similar risk characteristics and certain individual loans and leases that do not share similar risk\ncharacteristics with the collective group. Loans are generally grouped by product type (e.g., commercial and\nindustrial, commercial real estate, residential mortgage), and significant loan portfolios are assessed for credit\nlosses using econometric models.\nThe quantitative evaluation of the adequacy of the ACL utilizes a single economic forecast as its\nfoundation and is primarily based on econometric models that use known or estimated data as of the balance\nsheet date and forecasted data over the reasonable and supportable period. Known and estimated data include\ncurrent PD, LGD and EAD for commercial loans, timing and amount of expected draws for unfunded lending\ncommitments, FICO, LTV, and term for retail loans. The mix and level of loan balances, delinquency levels,\nassigned risk ratings, previous loss experience, current business conditions, amount and timing of expected\nfuture cash flows, and factors specific to commercial credits such as competition, business and management\nperformance are also considered. Forward-looking economic assumptions include real GDP, unemployment rate,\ninterest rate curve, and changes in collateral values. This data is accumulated to estimate expected credit losses\nover the contractual life of the loans and leases, adjusted for expected prepayments. Historical information,\nsuch as financial statements for commercial customers or consumer credit ratings, may not be as important to\nestimating future expected losses as forecasted inputs to the models during volatile economic time periods.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 102\nThe ACL may also be affected by a variety of qualitative factors that the Company considers that are not\nmeasured in the statistical procedures including uncertainty related to economic forecasts, loan growth,\nbacktesting results, credit underwriting policy exceptions, regulatory and audit findings, and peer comparisons.\nThe qualitative allowance is further affected by sensitivity analysis for certain industry sectors or loan classes,\nincluding CRE office.\nThe measurement process results in specific or pooled allowances for loans, leases and unfunded lending\ncommitments, and qualitative allowances that are determined and applied across the portfolio.\nCertain loan portfolios don’t require an econometric model to calculate expected credit losses. For these\nportfolios, approaches that are less data intensive and non-modeled are utilized to estimate credit losses as they\nare considered more efficient and practical for portfolios that have outstanding balances that are not material\n(e.g., runoff or closed portfolios, new products or products that are not significant to the Company’s overall\ncredit risk exposure).\nLoans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics are individually assessed for expected\ncredit losses. Nonaccrual commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding\nbalance of $5 million or greater are assessed on an individual loan level basis. Generally, measurement of the\nACL on an individual loan or lease is the present value of its future cash flows or the fair value of its underlying\ncollateral, if the loan or lease is collateral dependent.\nA loan is considered to be collateral dependent when repayment of the loan is expected to be provided\nsubstantially through the operation or sale of the underlying collateral, rather than by cash flows from the\nborrower’s operations, income or other resources. Generally, this occurs when cash flows to repay the loan from\nall other available sources, including guarantors, are expected to be no more than nominal. Loans that are\ndeemed to be collateral dependent are written down to the fair value, less costs to sell, as of the evaluation\ndate and are reassessed each subsequent period, which may result in an increase or decrease to the ACL based\non a corresponding change in the fair value of the collateral during the period. Any decrease to the ACL would be\nlimited to the total amount previously written off for a given loan or lease.\nCollateral values for residential mortgage and home equity loans are based on appraisals, which are\nupdated every 90 days at a minimum, less estimated costs to sell. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company\nhad collateral-dependent residential mortgage and home equity loans totaling $556 million and $561 million,\nrespectively.\nCommercial loans are secured by various types of collateral, including real estate, inventory, equipment,\naccounts receivable, securities and cash, among others. Collateral values are generally based on appraisals for\ncommercial real estate loans, which are updated based on management judgment on a case-by-case basis.\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had collateral-dependent commercial loans totaling $233\nmillion and $21 million, respectively.\nThe amortized cost basis of mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate for which formal\nforeclosure proceedings were in-process was $336 million and $250 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nExpected recoveries are considered in management’s estimate of the ACL and may result in a reduction\nto the ACL balance. A negative ACL for a collateral dependent loan exists if the fair value of the collateral\nincreases in a subsequent reporting period and cannot exceed the total amount previously charged off. Accrued\ninterest receivable on loans and leases is excluded from asset balances used to calculate the ACL.\nThe Company estimates expected credit losses associated with off-balance sheet financial instruments\nsuch as standby letters of credit, financial guarantees and unfunded loan commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable. Off-balance sheet financial instruments are subject to individual reviews and are\nanalyzed and segregated by risk according to the Company’s internal risk rating scale. These risk classifications,\nin conjunction with historical loss experience, current and future economic conditions, timing and amount of\nexpected draws, and performance trends within specific portfolio segments, are considered to estimate the\nallowance for unfunded lending commitments. The Company does not recognize a reserve for future draws from\ncredit lines that are unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards).\nThe ALLL and the allowance for unfunded lending commitments are reported in the allowance for loan\nand lease losses and other liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets . The provision for credit\nlosses related to loan and lease portfolios and unfunded lending commitments is reported in provision (benefit)\nfor credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 103\nLoan Charge-Offs\nCommercial loans are charged-off when available information indicates that a loan, or portion thereof, is\ndetermined to be uncollectible. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off involves many factors,\nincluding the prioritization of the Company’s claim in bankruptcy, workout/restructuring expectations of the loan\nand valuation of the borrower’s equity or loan collateral.\nRetail loans are generally fully charged-off or written down to the net realizable value of the underlying\ncollateral, with an offset to the ALLL, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with\nstandards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate, credit card and unsecured open-end loans are\ngenerally charged-off in the month when the account becomes 180 days past due. Auto, education and unsecured\nclosed-end loans are generally charged off in the month when the account becomes 120 days past due. Certain\nretail loans will be charged-off or written down to their net realizable value earlier in the following\ncircumstances:\n• FDMs that are determined to be collateral dependent.\n• Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event (e.g., bankruptcy) that suggests a loss is either known\nor highly certain.\n◦ Residential real estate and auto loans are written down to fair value less costs to sell within 60\ndays of receiving notification of the bankruptcy filing, unless repayment is likely to occur, or\nwhen the loan subsequently becomes 60 days past due.\n◦ Credit card loans are fully charged-off within 60 days of receiving notification of the bankruptcy\nfiling or other event.\n◦ Education loans are generally charged-off when the loan becomes 60 days past due after\nreceiving notification of a bankruptcy.\n• Auto loans are written down to fair value less costs to sell upon repossession of the collateral.\nThe following table presents a summary of changes in the ACL for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n(dollars in millions) Commercial Retail Total\nAllowance for loan and lease losses, beginning of period $1,060 $923 $1,983\nCharge-offs (285) (472) (757)\nRecoveries 18 130 148\nNet charge-offs (267) (342) (609)\nProvision expense (benefit) for loans and leases 457 267 724\nAllowance for loan and lease losses, end of period 1,250 848 2,098\nAllowance for unfunded lending commitments, beginning of period 207 50 257\nProvision expense (benefit) for unfunded lending commitments (32) (5) (37)\nAllowance for unfunded lending commitments, end of period 175 45 220\nTotal allowance for credit losses, end of period $1,425 $893 $2,318\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, net charge-offs of $609 million and a provision for expected\ncredit losses of $687 million resulted in an increase of $78 million to the ACL.\nOur ACL as of December 31, 2023 accounts for an economic forecast over our two-year reasonable and\nsupportable period with peak unemployment of approximately 5% and peak-to-trough GDP decline of\napproximately 0.4%.

Citizens defines the vintage date for the purpose of this disclosure as the date of the most recent\ncredit decision. Renewals are categorized as new credit decisions and reflect the renewal date as the vintage\ndate, except for renewals of loans modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, or FDMs, which are\npresented in the original vintage.\nCitizens utilizes internal risk ratings to monitor credit quality for commercial loans and leases. These\nratings are assigned at loan origination and are periodically reevaluated utilizing a risk-based approach, annually\nat a minimum, or any time management becomes aware of information affecting a borrower’s ability to fulfill\ntheir obligations. The reevaluation process considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. The following\ncategories are utilized to develop the ACL:\n• Pass - includes obligations where the probability of default is considered low and repayment in full is\nexpected in accordance with the contractual loan terms;\n• Special Mention - includes obligations that have potential weakness that, if left uncorrected, may\nresult in deterioration of the Company’s credit position at some future date;\n• Substandard Accrual - includes obligations that have well-defined weaknesses that could hinder\nnormal repayment or collection of the debt, but are currently performing;\n• Nonaccrual - includes obligations where management has determined that full payment of principal\nand interest is in doubt. For more information on nonaccrual loans and leases see “Nonaccrual and\nPast Due Assets” below.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 105\nFor commercial and industrial loans, the performance of the borrower is monitored in a disciplined and\nregular manner based upon the level of credit risk inherent in the loan. To evaluate the level of credit risk, an\ninternal risk rating is assigned reflecting the borrower’s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional credit risk rating\nmethodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process. These ratings are generally reviewed annually at\na minimum. The combination of the PD and LGD assigned ratings, which reflect credit quality characteristics as\nof the reporting date and are used as inputs into the loss forecasting process, capture both the expectation of\ndefault and loss severity in the event of default. Each loan is periodically reviewed by management based on the\namount of the lending arrangement and risk rating assessment, with priority given to those loans which are\nperceived to be of higher risk, or loans for which credit quality is weakening (e.g., payment delinquency). Loans\nare proactively managed by utilizing various procedures that are customized to the risk of a given loan, including\nongoing outreach to the borrower, assessment of the borrower’s financial condition and appraisal of the\ncollateral.\nCredit risk associated with commercial real estate loans is managed similar to commercial and industrial\nloans by evaluating PD and LGD. Risks associated with commercial real estate activities are typically correlated\nto the loan structure, collateral location, project progress and business environment. As a result, these attributes\nare monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. Periodic reviews are also performed to assess market/\ngeographic risk and business unit/industry risk, which may result in increased scrutiny on loans that are perceived\nto be of higher risk, had adverse changes in risk ratings and/or areas that concern management. These reviews\nare designed to assess risk and facilitate actions to mitigate such risks.\nCredit risk associated with leases is managed similar to commercial and industrial loans by evaluating PD\nand LGD. Reviews are generally performed annually based upon the dollar amount of the lease and the level of\ncredit risk, and may be more frequent if circumstances warrant. The review process includes analysis of the\nfollowing factors: equipment value/residual value, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk, industry risk, guarantor\nrequirements, and regulatory compliance as applicable.\nCommercial loans with renewal terms in the original contract are recognized as current year originations\nupon renewal unless the loan automatically renewed without a new credit decision. Citizens generally reserves\nthe right to not renew the loan or lease until current underwriting is completed and approved.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 106\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of commercial loans and leases by vintage date and\ninternal risk rating as of December 31, 2023, and gross charge-offs by vintage date for the year ended December\n31, 2023:\nTerm Loans by Origination Year Revolving Loans\nWithin the\nPrior to Revolving Converted\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2019 Period to Term Total\nCommercial and industrial\nPass $3,599 $6,338 $5,049 $1,254 $1,085 $2,031 $21,033 $53 $40,442\nSpecial Mention 59 194 354 29 48 113 368 — 1,165\nSubstandard Accrual 5 175 325 212 121 284 792 11 1,925\nNonaccrual 1 72 51 4 5 102 53 6 294\nTotal commercial and industrial 3,664 6,779 5,779 1,499 1,259 2,530 22,246 70 43,826\nGross charge-offs 1 3 34 4 1 34 44 — 121\nCommercial real estate\nPass 1,906 5,791 6,062 2,555 2,294 3,895 1,975 8 24,486\nSpecial Mention — 713 539 222 183 260 75 — 1,992\nSubstandard Accrual — 277 203 469 528 939 100 — 2,516\nNonaccrual 1 66 2 23 144 238 3 — 477\nTotal commercial real estate 1,907 6,847 6,806 3,269 3,149 5,332 2,153 8 29,471\nGross charge-offs — — — 56 13 95 — — 164\nLeases\nPass 95 174 282 191 62 268 — — 1,072\nSpecial Mention — 27 1 1 2 — — — 31\nSubstandard Accrual 3 14 12 6 4 3 — — 42\nNonaccrual — — 3 — — — — — 3\nTotal leases 98 215 298 198 68 271 — — 1,148\nGross charge-offs — — — — — — — — —\nTotal commercial\nPass 5,600 12,303 11,393 4,000 3,441 6,194 23,008 61 66,000\nSpecial Mention 59 934 894 252 233 373 443 — 3,188\nSubstandard Accrual 8 466 540 687 653 1,226 892 11 4,483\nNonaccrual 2 138 56 27 149 340 56 6 774\nTotal commercial(1) $5,669 $13,841 $12,883 $4,966 $4,476 $8,133 $24,399 $78 $74,445\nGross charge-offs $1 $3 $34 $60 $14 $129 $44 $— $285\n(1) In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company revised its presentation of commercial loans and leases by vintage date and internal risk rating to reflect how the\nCompany currently manages the commercial credit portfolio.

Due Assets\nNonaccrual loans and leases are those on which accrual of interest is suspended. Loans, other than\ncertain retail loans insured by U.S. government agencies, are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of\nprincipal and interest is in doubt, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection.\nWhen a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the accrued interest receivable is reversed against interest\nincome and the amortization of any net deferred fees is suspended. Interest collected on nonaccrual loans and\nleases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are generally applied to reduce the carrying\nvalue of the asset first. Otherwise, interest income may be recognized to the extent of the cash received if the\nloan is deemed fully collectible. A loan or lease may be returned to accrual status if:\n• no principal and interest payments are due and unpaid, and repayment of the remaining contractual\nprincipal and interest is expected;\n• the loan or lease has otherwise become well-secured and in the process of collection; or\n• the borrower has made regularly scheduled payments in full for the prior six months and it is\nreasonably assured that the loan or lease will be brought current within a reasonable period.\nCommercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and leases are generally placed on\nnonaccrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more, or earlier if management believes that the\nprobability of collection is insufficient to warrant further accrual. Some of these loans and leases may remain on\naccrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more if management considers the loan collectible.\nResidential mortgages are generally placed on nonaccrual status when past due 120 days, or sooner if\ndetermined to be collateral dependent, unless repayment of the loan is fully or partially guaranteed by the FHA,\nVA or USDA. Credit card balances are placed on nonaccrual status when past due 90 days or more and are\nrestored to accrual status if they subsequently become less than 90 days past due. All other retail loans are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status when past due 90 days or more, or earlier if management believes that the\nprobability of collection is insufficient to warrant further accrual. Loans less than 90 days past due may be placed\non nonaccrual status due to the death of the borrower, fraud or bankruptcy.\nThe following tables present an aging analysis of accruing loans and leases, and nonaccrual loans and\nleases as of December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023\nDays Past Due and Accruing\nNonaccrual\nwith no\n(dollars in millions) Current 30-59 60-89 90+ Nonaccrual Total related ACL\nCommercial and industrial $43,447 $61 $18 $6 $294 $43,826 $30\nCommercial real estate 28,745 150 59 40 477 29,471 71\nLeases 1,144 1 — — 3 1,148 —\nTotal commercial 73,336 212 77 46 774 74,445 101\nResidential mortgages(1) 30,499 282 118 256 177 31,332 144\nHome equity 14,640 82 33 — 285 15,040 198\nAutomobile 8,005 144 48 — 61 8,258 7\nEducation 11,732 49 23 2 28 11,834 3\nOther retail 4,899 49 34 29 39 5,050 —\nTotal retail 69,775 606 256 287 590 71,514 352\nTotal $143,111 $818 $333 $333 $1,364 $145,959 $453\nGuaranteed residential mortgages(1) $675 $128 $76 $243 $— $1,122 $—\n(1) Guaranteed residential mortgages represent loans fully or partially guaranteed by the FHA, VA and USDA, and are included in the amounts presented for\nResidential mortgages.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 111\nDecember 31, 2022\nDays Past Due and Accruing\nNonaccrual\nwith no\n(dollars in millions) Current 30-59 60-89 90+ Nonaccrual Total related ACL\nCommercial and industrial $51,389 $152 $25 $21 $249 $51,836 $64\nCommercial real estate 28,665 51 45 1 103 28,865 7\nLeases 1,475 4 — — — 1,479 —\nTotal commercial 81,529 207 70 22 352 82,180 71\nResidential mortgages(1) 29,228 95 45 319 234 29,921 187\nHome equity 13,719 64 19 — 241 14,043 185\nAutomobile 12,039 152 45 — 56 12,292 9\nEducation 12,718 36 17 4 33 12,808 3\nOther retail 5,294 44 30 22 28 5,418 1\nTotal retail 72,998 391 156 345 592 74,482 385\nTotal $154,527 $598 $226 $367 $944 $156,662 $456\nGuaranteed residential mortgages(1) $789 $57 $34 $316 $— $1,196 $—\n(1) Guaranteed residential mortgages represent loans fully or partially guaranteed by the FHA, VA and USDA, and are included in the amounts presented for\nResidential mortgages.\nLoan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted accounting guidance that eliminates the separate\nrecognition and measurement of TDRs. Upon adoption of this guidance, all loan modifications to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty, or FDMs, are evaluated to determine whether the modification should be\naccounted for as a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan. The existing loan is derecognized and the\nrestructured loan is accounted for as a new loan if the effective yield on the restructured loan is at least equal to\nthe effective yield for comparable loans with similar collection risk and the modification to the original loan is\nmore than minor. Any unamortized fees and costs from the original loan are recognized in interest income when\nthe new loan is granted. If a loan restructuring does not meet these conditions, the existing loan’s amortized cost\nbasis is carried forward and the modified loan is accounted for as a continuation of the existing loan. FDMs are\ngenerally accounted for as a continuation of the existing loan given the terms are typically not at market rates.\nThe Company offers loan modifications to retail and commercial borrowers as a result of its loss\nmitigation activities that may result in a payment delay, interest rate reduction, term extension, principal\nforgiveness, or combination thereof. Payment delays consist of modifications that result in a delay of contractual\namounts due greater than three months over a rolling 12-month period.\nCommercial loan modifications are offered on a case-by-case basis and generally include a payment\ndelay, term extension and/or interest rate reduction. The Company does not typically offer principal forgiveness\nfor commercial loans. Retail loan modifications are offered through structured loan modification programs, which\nare summarized below.\n• Forbearance programs provide borrowers experiencing some form of hardship a period of time during\nwhich their contractual payment obligations are suspended, resulting in a payment delay and/or term\nextension.\n• Other repayment plans are offered due to hardship and include an interest rate reduction and/or term\nextension designed to enable the borrower to return the loan to current status in an expeditious manner.\n• Settlement agreements may be executed with borrowers experiencing a long-term hardship or who are\ndelinquent, resulting in principal forgiveness. Upon fulfillment of the terms of the settlement agreement,\nthe unpaid principal amount is forgiven resulting in a charge-off of the outstanding principal balance.\n• Certain reorganization bankruptcy judgments may result in any one of the four modification types or\nsome combination thereof.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 112\nRetail and commercial loans whose contractual terms have been modified in a FDM and are current at the\ntime of the modification may remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the\nmodification and payment in full under the modified terms is expected. Cash receipts on nonaccrual impaired\nloans, including nonaccrual loans involved in FDMs, are generally applied to reduce the unpaid principal balance.\nCertain FDMs that are current in payment status are classified as nonaccrual in accordance with regulatory\nguidance. Nonaccrual FDMs that meet the guidelines above for accrual status can be returned to accruing if\nsupported by a well-documented evaluation of the borrowers’ financial condition, and if they have been current\nfor at least six months.\nThe following table presents the period-end amortized cost of loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty that were modified during the year ended December 31, 2023, disaggregated by class of financing\nreceivable and modification type.

Concessions granted in TDRs for all classes of loans may include lowering the interest rate, forgiving a\nportion of principal, extending the loan term, lowering scheduled payments for a specified period of time,\nwaiving or delaying a scheduled payment of principal or interest for other than an insignificant time period, or\ncapitalizing past due amounts. A rate increase can be a concession if the increased rate is lower than a market\nrate for debt with risk similar to that of the restructured loan. TDRs for commercial loans may also involve\ncreating a multiple note structure, accepting non-cash assets, accepting an equity interest, or receiving a\nperformance-based fee. In some cases, a TDR may involve multiple concessions.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 114\nCash receipts on nonaccrual impaired loans, including nonaccrual loans involved in TDRs, are generally\napplied to reduce the unpaid principal balance. Certain TDRs that are current in payment status are classified as\nnonaccrual in accordance with regulatory guidance. Nonaccrual TDRs may be returned to accruing if supported by\na well-documented evaluation of the borrowers’ financial condition, and if they have been current for at least six\nmonths.\nThe ACL for loans previously identified as TDRs is measured at the product level based on post-\nmodification credit attributes and use of an econometric model or at the fair value of collateral less costs to sell,\nif less than the loan’s amortized cost basis. Any portion of the loan’s amortized cost basis the Company does not\nexpect to collect as a result of the modification is charged off at the time of modification. For retail TDR\naccounts assessed based on the fair value of collateral, any portion of the loan’s recorded investment in excess\nof the collateral value less costs to sell is charged off at the time of modification or at the time of subsequent\nand regularly recurring valuations.\nThe following tables summarize loans modified during the year ended December 31, 2022. The balances\nrepresent the post-modification outstanding amortized cost basis and may include loans that became TDRs during\nthe period and were subsequently paid off in full, charged off, or sold prior to period end.

Generally, loans are collateralized by assets\nincluding real estate, inventory, accounts receivable, other personal property and investment securities. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no material concentration risks within the commercial or retail loan\nportfolios. Exposure to credit losses arising from lending transactions may fluctuate with fair values of collateral\nsupporting loans, which may not perform according to contractual agreements.

These changes are recorded in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nThe fair value of MSRs is estimated by using the present value of estimated future net servicing cash\nflows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount rates,\ncontractual servicing fee income, servicing costs, default rates, ancillary income, and other economic factors,\nwhich are determined based on current market interest rates. The valuation does not attempt to forecast or\npredict the future direction of interest rates.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 117\nThe sensitivity analysis below presents the impact of an immediate 10% and 20% adverse change in key\neconomic assumptions to the current fair value of MSRs. These sensitivities are hypothetical, with the effect of a\nvariation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs calculated independently without changing any\nother assumption. Changes in one factor may result in changes in another (e.g., changes in interest rates, which\ndrive changes in prepayment rates, could result in changes in discount rates), which may amplify or counteract\nthe sensitivities. The primary risk inherent in the Company’s MSRs is an increase in prepayments of the\nunderlying mortgage loans serviced, which is largely dependent upon movements in market interest rates.\n(dollars in millions) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nFair value $1,552 $1,530\nWeighted average life (years) 8.8 9.1\nWeighted average constant prepayment rate 7.2% 6.8%\nDecline in fair value from 10% adverse change $37 $34\nDecline in fair value from 20% adverse change $71 $66\nWeighted average option adjusted spread 630 bps 629 bps\nDecline in fair value from 10% adverse change $43 $43\nDecline in fair value from 20% adverse change $87 $86\nThe Company’s mortgage banking derivatives include commitments to originate mortgages held for sale,\ncertain loan sale agreements, and other financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative.

A right-of-use asset represents the value of the Company’s contractual right to use\nan underlying leased asset and a lease liability represents the Company’s contractual obligation to make\npayments on the same asset. Operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the\ncommencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the non-cancelable lease term. In\ninstances where the lease does not specify an implicit rate, the Company utilizes an incremental borrowing rate\nbased on information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of the lease\npayments. The Company evaluates right-of-use assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.\nThe Company leases both equipment and real estate, including office and branch space, in the normal\ncourse of business. Lease terms predominantly range from one year to ten years and may include options to\nextend the lease, terminate the lease, or purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease. Certain lease\nagreements include rental payments based on an index or are adjusted periodically for inflation. Lease\ncomponents are accounted for as a single lease component when lease agreements contain lease and non-lease\ncomponents and for certain real estate leases.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Balance\nSheets and are recognized in occupancy expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term. The Company may also enter into subleases with third parties for certain\nleased real estate properties that are no longer occupied.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 118\nThe components of operating lease cost are presented below.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nOperating lease cost $221 $216 $161\nShort-term lease cost 2 2 1\nVariable lease cost 5 7 8\nSublease income (1) (1) (4)\nTotal $227 $224 $166\nOperating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in\noccupancy and equipment and software in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSupplemental information related to the Company’s operating lease arrangements is presented in the\ntables below:\nDecember 31, December 31, Affected Line Item in\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022 Consolidated Balance Sheets\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $885 $1,019 Other assets\nOperating lease liabilities 977 1,066 Other liabilities\nWeighted average remaining lease term (years) 7 7 —\nWeighted average discount rate 3.10 % 2.74 % —\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in measurement of liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $232 $219 $163\nSupplemental non-cash information on lease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets:\nRight-of-use assets in exchange for new operating lease liabilities 64 408 79\nLease liabilities maturing under non-cancelable operating leases are presented below as of December 31,\n2023.\nYear (dollars in millions)\n2024 $210\n2025 201\n2026 161\n2027 140\n2028 111\nThereafter 262\nTotal lease payments 1,085\nLess: Interest 108\nPresent value of lease liabilities $977\nCitizens as Lessor\nOperating lease assets where Citizens was the lessor totaled $254 million and $260 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Operating lease rental income associated with these assets is\nrecognized in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm.\nDepreciation expense associated with operating lease assets is recorded on a straight-line basis over their\nestimated useful life and is included in other operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOperating lease assets are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis, with an impairment loss recognized in\nother operating expense if the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds its fair value and is not recoverable.\nThe carrying amount of a leased asset is not recoverable if its carrying value exceeds the sum of the\nundiscounted cash flows expected to result from the lease payments and the estimated residual value of the\nasset.\nFor a discussion of direct finance and sales-type leases where Citizens is the lessor, see Note 5.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 119\nNOTE 10 - GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill is the purchase premium associated with the acquisition of a business and is assigned to the\nCompany’s reporting units at the acquisition date. A reporting unit is a business operating segment or a\ncomponent of a business operating segment. The Company has identified and assigned goodwill to two reporting\nunits, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking, based upon reviews of the structure of the Company’s\nexecutive team and supporting functions, resource allocations and financial reporting processes. Goodwill no\nlonger retains its association with a particular acquisition once assigned to a reporting unit, and all of the\nactivities within a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically grown, are available to support the value of\nthe goodwill.\nGoodwill is subject to an annual impairment test and not amortized. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment\nannually as of October 31st and in interim periods when events or changes indicate the carrying value of one or\nmore reporting units may not be recoverable. The Company has the option of performing a qualitative\nassessment of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit\nis less than the carrying value. If it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying value, then no\nfurther testing is necessary; otherwise, a quantitative assessment of goodwill must be performed.\nThe Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment,\nwhich is used to identify potential impairment and involves comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its\ncarrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value inclusive of\ngoodwill, applicable goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit inclusive of\ngoodwill exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess, establishing a new basis in the\ngoodwill, and cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit. Subsequent reversal of\ngoodwill impairment losses is not permitted.\nThe fair value of the Company’s reporting units is determined using a combination of income and market-\nbased approaches. The Company relies on several assumptions to estimate the fair value of its reporting units\nunder the income-based approach including discount rate, projected loan losses, income tax and capital\nretention rates.\nThe Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023 as\npart of its annual impairment assessment. Based on this quantitative assessment, the Company concluded that\nthe estimated fair value of the Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking reporting units exceeded their\ncarrying value; therefore, the Company determined that there was no impairment to the carrying value of its\ngoodwill as of December 31, 2023. The Commercial Banking reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying\nvalue by approximately 10%.\nThe Company monitored events and circumstances during the period from October 31, 2023 through\nDecember 31, 2023, including macroeconomic and market factors, industry and banking sector events, Company-\nspecific performance indicators, a comparison of the Company’s forecast and assumptions to those used in its\nOctober 31, 2023 quantitative impairment test, and the sensitivity of the October 31, 2023 quantitative test\nresults to changes in assumptions through December 31, 2023. Based on these considerations, the Company\nconcluded that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of either of its reporting units is below its\nrespective carrying amount as of December 31, 2023.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 120\nChanges in the carrying value of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are presented\nbelow.\nConsumer Commercial\n(dollars in millions) Banking Banking Total\nBalance at December 31, 2021 $2,258 $4,858 $7,116\nBusiness acquisitions 415 642 1,057\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $2,673 $5,500 $8,173\nBusiness acquisitions 5 10 15\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $2,678 $5,510 $8,188\nAccumulated impairment losses related to the Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking reporting units\ntotaled $5.9 billion and $50 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023 and 2022. No impairment was recorded\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nOther Intangibles\nOther intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if the asset arises as a result of\ncontractual rights or if the asset is capable of being separated and sold, transferred or exchanged. These assets\nare amortized on a straight-line basis with the exception of core deposits, which are amortized using an\naccelerated methodology, and are subject to an annual impairment evaluation. Amortization expense is recorded\nin other operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nA summary of the carrying value of intangible assets is presented below.\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAmortizable Accumulated Accumulated\n(dollars in millions) Lives (years) Gross Amortization Net Gross Amortization Net\nCore deposits 10 $144 $44 $100 $144 $20 $124\nAcquired technology 5 - 7 23 21 2 23 19 4\nAcquired relationships 2 - 15 52 26 26 54 21 33\nNaming Rights 5 - 10 33 12 21 33 7 26\nOther 2 - 8 18 10 8 17 7 10\nTotal $270 $113 $157 $271 $74 $197\nAs of December 31, 2023, all of the Company’s intangible assets were being amortized. Amortization\nexpense recognized on intangible assets was $42 million, $41 million and $11 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company’s projection of amortization expense is based on\nbalances as of December 31, 2023. Future amortization expense may vary from these projections.\nEstimated intangible asset amortization expense for the next five years is as follows:\nYear (dollars in millions)\n2024 $35\n2025 32\n2026 28\n2027 24\n2028 17\nNOTE 11 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nCitizens, in the normal course of business, engages in a variety of activities with entities that are\nconsidered VIEs, as defined by GAAP, with its variable interest arising from contractual, ownership or other\nmonetary interests in the entity. A VIE typically does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities\nwithout additional subordinated financial support from other parties. Citizens is the primary beneficiary of a VIE,\nand must consolidate it, if its variable interest provides it with the power to direct the activities that\nsignificantly impact the VIE and it has the right to receive benefits, or the obligation to absorb losses, that could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Citizens considers both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the\nnature, size and form of its involvement with the VIE to determine whether or not a variable interest held is\nsignificant to the VIE. Citizens assesses whether or not it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 121\nTransfers of financial assets in which the Company has not surrendered control over the transferred\nassets are accounted for as a secured borrowing with a pledge of collateral. Control is generally considered\nsurrendered when 1) the transferred assets are legally isolated from the Company and its creditors, even in\nbankruptcy, 2) the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets it received, with no\ncondition that constrains the transferee from taking advantage of this right or that provides more than a trivial\nbenefit to the Company, and 3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial\nassets. Judgment is required to assess whether the Company maintains effective control over transferred\nfinancial assets.\nConsolidated VIEs\nThe Company has consolidated VIEs related to secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans. The\nfollowing table summarizes the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for the Company’s consolidated VIEs:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023\nAssets:\nCash and due from banks $13\nInterest-bearing deposits in banks 106\nNet loans and leases 3,194\nOther assets 14\nTotal assets $3,327\nLiabilities:\nLong-term borrowed funds $2,692\nOther liabilities 8\nTotal liabilities $2,700\nSecured Borrowings\nCitizens utilizes a portion of its auto loan portfolio to support certain secured borrowing arrangements,\nwhich provide a source of funding for the Company and involves the transfer of auto loans to bankruptcy remote\nspecial purpose entities (“SPEs”). These SPEs then issue asset-backed notes to third-parties collateralized by the\ntransferred loans. Citizens holds certain residual interests in the loans and, therefore, has a right to receive\nbenefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the SPEs. In addition, the\nCompany retains servicing for the transferred loans and, therefore, holds the power to direct the most significant\nactivities that impact the economic performance of the SPEs. As a result, the Company concluded that it is the\nprimary beneficiary of these SPEs and, accordingly, consolidates these VIEs.\nThe assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. Creditors of these\nVIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. The performance of the loans transferred to the\nSPEs is the most significant driver impacting the economic performance of the VIEs.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nCitizens is involved with various VIEs that are not consolidated, including investments in entities that\nsponsor affordable housing, renewable energy and economic development projects, and asset-backed securities.\nIn addition, Citizens provides lending facilities to special purpose entities. Citizens’ maximum exposure to loss as\na result of its involvement with these entities is limited to the balance sheet carrying amount of its investments,\nunfunded commitments, and the outstanding principal balance of loans to special purpose entities.\nA summary of these investments is presented below:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022\nLending to special purpose entities included in loans and leases $4,760 $4,578\nLIHTC investment included in other assets 2,444 2,230\nLIHTC unfunded commitments included in other liabilities 1,025 1,046\nAsset-backed investments included in HTM securities 488 581\nRenewable energy investments included in other assets 314 374\nNMTC investments included in other assets 3 4\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 122\nLending to Special Purpose Entities\nCitizens provides lending facilities to third-party sponsored special purpose entities. Because the sponsor\nfor each respective entity has the power to direct how proceeds from the Company are utilized and maintains\nresponsibility for any associated servicing commitments, Citizens is not the primary beneficiary of these entities.\nAccordingly, Citizens does not consolidate these VIEs. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the lending facilities\nhad undrawn commitments to extend credit of $2.7 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. For more information\non commitments to extend credit see Note 19.\nAsset-backed securities\nThe Company’s investments in asset-backed securities are collateralized by education loans sold to a\nthird-party sponsored VIE. Citizens acts as the primary servicer for the sold loans and receives a servicing fee. A\nthird-party servicer is responsible for all loans that become significantly delinquent.\nThe Company’s investment in asset-backed securities, as well as the primary servicing fee, are\nconsidered variable interests in the VIE since some of the losses of the VIE could be absorbed by the Company’s\ninterest in the asset-backed securities or the primary servicing fee. However, Citizens did not control the\ndetermination of the assets purchased by the VIE and does not control the servicing activities on significantly\ndelinquent loans. Since these activities significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE, the Company\nhas concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE. Accordingly, Citizens does not consolidate the\nVIE.\nLow Income Housing Tax Credit Partnerships\nThe purpose of the Company’s LIHTC investments is to assist in achieving the goals of the CRA and to\nearn an adequate return of capital. LIHTC partnerships are managed by unrelated general partners that have the\npower to direct the activities which most significantly affect the performance of the partnerships and, therefore,\nCitizens is not the primary beneficiary of these partnerships. Accordingly, Citizens does not consolidate these\nVIEs.\nRenewable Energy Entities\nThe Company’s investments in certain renewable energy entities provide benefits from government\nincentives and other tax attributes (e.g., tax depreciation). As a tax equity investor, Citizens does not have the\npower to direct the activities which most significantly affect the performance of these entities and, therefore, is\nnot the primary beneficiary of these entities. Accordingly, Citizens does not consolidate these VIEs.\nContingent commitments related to the Company’s renewable energy investments were $67 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, and are expected to be paid in varying amounts through 2026. These payments are\ncontingent upon the level of electricity production attained by the renewable energy entity relative to its\ntargeted threshold and changes in the production tax credit rates set by the Internal Revenue Service.\nNew Markets Tax Credit Program\nThe Company participates in the NMTC program which provides a tax incentive for private sector\ninvestment into economic development projects and businesses located in low-income communities. The United\nStates Department of the Treasury oversees the program and it is directly administered by the Community\nDevelopment Financial Institutions Fund.\nThe Company’s investments in entities that sponsor economic development projects provide income tax\ncredits to offset federal taxable income over a specified period of time. Independent third parties manage these\nentities and have the power to direct the activities which most significantly affect their performance. Therefore,\nCitizens is not the primary beneficiary of these entities and does not consolidate these VIEs as a result.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 123\nThe Company applies the proportional amortization method to account for its LIHTC investments.\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company made an election to account for its renewable energy and NMTC\ninvestments using the proportional amortization method under newly adopted accounting guidance. Under the\nproportional amortization method, the Company applies a practical expedient for its LIHTC and NMTC\ninvestments and amortizes the initial cost of qualifying investments in proportion to the income tax credits\nreceived in the current period as compared to the total income tax credits expected to be received over the life\nof the investment. For renewable energy investments, the Company amortizes the initial cost of qualifying\ninvestments in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received in the current period\nas compared to the total income tax credits and other income tax benefits expected to be received over the life\nof the investment. The net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits received are\nincluded as a component of income tax expense (benefit).\nThe following table summarizes the impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations relative to the\nCompany’s tax credit programs for which it has elected to apply the proportional amortization method of\naccounting:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nTax credits recognized $334 $236 $202\nOther tax benefits recognized 71 59 48\nAmortization (320) (247) (208)\nNet benefit (expense) included in income tax expense 85 48 42\nOther income 5 — —\nAllocated income (loss) on investments (10) — —\nNet benefit (expense) included in noninterest income (5) — —\nNet benefit (expense) included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations(1) $80 $48 $42\n(1) Includes the impact of tax credit investments when the election to apply the proportional amortization method was in effect during the periods presented. For\n2023, this includes LIHTC, renewable energy and NMTC investments, and for 2022 and 2021, includes LIHTC investments.\nThe Company did not recognize impairment losses resulting from the forfeiture or ineligibility of income\ntax credits or other circumstances during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nNOTE 12 - DEPOSITS\nThe following table presents the major components of deposits:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022\nDemand $37,107 $49,283\nMoney market 53,812 49,905\nChecking with interest 31,876 39,721\nSavings 27,983 29,805\nTerm 26,564 12,010\nTotal deposits $177,342 $180,724\nThe following table presents the maturity distribution of term deposits by year as of December 31, 2023:\nYear (dollars in millions)\n2024 $25,529\n2025 866\n2026 74\n2027 59\n2028 33\n2029 and thereafter 3\nTotal $26,564\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 124\nThe following table presents the remaining maturities of term deposits with a denomination of $250,000\nor more as of December 31, 2023:\n(dollars in millions)\nThree months or less $2,559\nAfter three months through six months 1,527\nAfter six months through twelve months 1,358\nAfter twelve months 229\nTotal term deposits $5,673\nNOTE 13 - BORROWED FUNDS\nShort-term borrowed funds\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company’s short-term borrowed funds:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022\nOther short-term borrowed funds $505 $3\nTotal short-term borrowed funds $505 $3\nLong-term borrowed funds\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company’s long-term borrowed funds:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022\nParent Company:\n3.750% fixed-rate subordinated debt, due July 2024 $90 $90\n4.023% fixed-rate subordinated debt, due October 2024 17 17\n4.350% fixed-rate subordinated debt, due August 2025 133 133\n4.300% fixed-rate subordinated debt, due December 2025 336 336\n2.850% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, due July 2026 499 498\n2.500% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, due February 2030 298 298\n3.250% fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, due April 2030 746 746\n3.750% fixed-rate reset subordinated debt, due February 2031 69 69\n4.300% fixed-rate reset subordinated debt, due February 2031 135 135\n4.350% fixed-rate reset subordinated debt, due February 2031 60 61\n2.638% fixed-rate subordinated debt, due September 2032 563 556\n5.641% fixed-rate reset subordinated debt, due May 2037 398 397\nCBNA’s Global Note Program:\n3.700% senior unsecured notes, due March 2023(1) — 497\n5.676% floating-rate senior unsecured notes, due March 2023(1)(2) — 250\n2.250% senior unsecured notes, due April 2025 749 748\n4.119% fixed/floating-rate senior unsecured notes, due May 2025 649 648\n6.064% fixed/floating-rate senior unsecured notes, due October 2025 599 598\n5.284% fixed/floating-rate senior unsecured notes, due January 2026 349 —\n3.750% senior unsecured notes, due February 2026 483 475\n4.575% fixed/floating-rate senior unsecured notes, due August 2028 798 797\nAdditional Borrowings by CBNA and Other Subsidiaries:\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances, 5.570% weighted average rate, due through 2041(3) 3,786 8,519\nSecured borrowings, 6.026% weighted average rate, due through 2030(3)(4) 2,692 —\nOther 18 19\nTotal long-term borrowed funds $13,467 $15,887\n(1) Notes were redeemed on February 27, 2023.\n(2) Rate disclosed reflects the floating rate as of December 31, 2023, or final floating rate as applicable.\n(3) Rate disclosed reflects the weighted average rate as of December 31, 2023.\n(4) Collateralized by auto loans.

OTC-cleared derivative instruments are\ntypically settled in cash each day based on their value from the previous day. Information regarding the valuation\nmethodology and inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s derivative instruments is described in\nNote 20.\nDerivative assets and liabilities are netted by counterparty in the Consolidated Balance Sheets if a “right\nof setoff” is established in a master netting agreement between the Company and the counterparty. This netted\nderivative asset or liability position is also netted against the fair value of any cash collateral that is pledged or\nreceived in accordance with a master netting agreement.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 126\nThe following table presents derivative instruments included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNotional Derivative Derivative Notional Derivative Derivative\n(dollars in millions) Amount Assets Liabilities Amount Assets Liabilities\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts $86,895 $173 $44 $42,250 $16 $53\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts 185,993 291 1,105 174,384 331 1,579\nForeign exchange contracts 32,528 434 378 29,475 527 519\nCommodities contracts 1,251 685 640 1,103 953 942\nTBA contracts 2,337 3 16 2,370 7 14\nOther contracts 549 7 — 913 5 4\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 222,658 1,420 2,139 208,245 1,823 3,058\nTotal gross derivatives 309,553 1,593 2,183 250,495 1,839 3,111\nLess: Gross amounts offset in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets(1) (471) (471) (623) (623)\nLess: Cash collateral applied(1) (682) (150) (374) (579)\nTotal net derivatives presented in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets $440 $1,562 $842 $1,909\n(1) Amounts represent the impact of enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions, as well as\ncollateral paid and received.\nThe Company’s derivative transactions are internally divided into three sub-groups: institutional,\ncustomer facilitation and residential loan. Certain derivative transactions within these sub-groups are designated\nas fair value or cash flow hedges, as described below:\nDerivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments\nThe Company’s institutional derivatives qualify for hedge accounting treatment. The net interest accruals\non interest rate swaps designated in a fair value or cash flow hedge relationship are treated as an adjustment to\ninterest income or interest expense of the item being hedged. All hedging relationships are formally documented\nat inception, as well as risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. In\naddition, the effectiveness of hedge relationships is monitored during the duration of the hedge period. The\nmethods utilized to assess hedge effectiveness vary based on the hedge relationship and each relationship is\nmonitored to ensure that management’s initial intent continues to be satisfied. Hedge accounting treatment is\ndiscontinued when the derivative is terminated or when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be,\nor has ceased to be, effective as a hedge. Changes in the fair value of a derivative are reflected in earnings after\ntermination of the hedge relationship.\nFair Value Hedges\nIn a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or\nliability attributable to the risk being hedged are recognized in the same income statement line item in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations when the changes in fair value occur. During 2023, the Company entered\ninto fair value hedges to manage interest rate risk within the AFS securities portfolio.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 127\nThe following table presents the change in fair value of interest rate contracts designated as fair value\nhedges, as well as the change in fair value of the related hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged,\nincluded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations:\nYear Ended December 31,\nAffected Line Item in the Consolidated\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021 Statements of Operations\nInterest rate swaps hedging long-term borrowed funds $10 ($69) ($72) Interest expense - long-term borrowed funds\nHedged long-term borrowed funds attributable to the\nrisk being hedged (10) 68 71 Interest expense - long-term borrowed funds\nInterest rate swaps hedging LHFS — 13 — Interest and fees on other loans held for sale\nHedged LHFS attributable to the risk being hedged — (13) — Interest and fees on other loans held for sale\nInterest rate swaps hedging debt securities available\nfor sale (48) 29 68 Interest income - investment securities\nHedged debt securities available for sale attributable\nto risk being hedged 50 (29) (68) Interest income - investment securities\nThe following table reflects amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to cumulative\nbasis adjustments for fair value hedges:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nDebt securities Long-term Debt securities Long-term\navailable for borrowed available for borrowed\n(dollars in millions) sale(1) funds sale funds\nCarrying amount of hedged assets $7,253 $— $— $—\nCarrying amount of hedged liabilities — 483 — 972\nCumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the\ncarrying amount of the hedged items 60 (17) — (27)\n(1) Includes the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging relationships under the portfolio layer method. The hedged item is a layer of\nthe closed portfolio which is expected to be remaining at the end of the hedging relationship. As of December 31, 2023, the amortized cost basis of the closed\nportfolios used in these hedging relationships was $5.9 billion, including associated cumulative basis adjustments of $39 million, and the amount of the\ndesignated hedging instruments was $4.0 billion.\nCash Flow Hedges\nIn a cash flow hedge the entire change in the fair value of the interest rate swap included in the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness is initially recorded in OCI and is subsequently reclassified from AOCI to\ncurrent period earnings (net interest income) in the same period that the hedged item affects earnings.\nCitizens has entered into interest rate swap agreements designed to hedge a portion of the Company’s\nfloating-rate assets and liabilities. All of these swaps are deemed highly effective cash flow hedges. The\nCompany has also entered into certain interest rate option agreements that utilize interest rate floors and caps,\nor some combination thereof, providing the ability to hedge the variability in cash flows within different interest\nrate bands. Option premiums paid and received are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are\namortized over the life of the instruments.\nThe following table presents the pre-tax net gains (losses) recorded in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations and in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income related to derivative instruments\ndesignated as cash flow hedges:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nAmount of pre-tax net gains (losses) recognized in OCI ($145) ($1,806) ($66)\nAmount of pre-tax net gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into interest income (596) (111) 183\nAmount of pre-tax net gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into interest expense — (4) (48)\nUsing the interest rate curve at December 31, 2023 with respect to cash flow hedge strategies, the\nCompany estimates that approximately $914 million in pre-tax net losses will be reclassified from AOCI to net\ninterest income over the next 12 months, including $460 million related to terminated swaps. This amount could\ndiffer from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition\nof other hedges subsequent to December 31, 2023.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 128\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nThe Company offers derivatives to customers in connection with their risk management needs. These\nderivatives primarily consist of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivative contracts. Market risk\nexposure from customer transactions is primarily managed by entering into a variety of hedging transactions with\nthird-party dealers. Gains and losses on customer-related derivatives are reported in foreign exchange and\nderivatives products in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nResidential mortgage loans that will be sold in the secondary market and the related loan commitments,\nwhich are considered derivatives, are accounted for at fair value. Changes in the fair value of the loans and\nrelated commitments due to interest rate risk are hedged with forward contracts to sell mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Gains and losses on the loans and related commitments, and the derivatives used to economically\nhedge them, are reported in mortgage banking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nResidential MSRs are accounted for at fair value. Derivatives utilized to hedge the fair value of\nresidential MSRs include interest rate futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts to purchase mortgage-\nbacked securities.

The related expense is\ncharged to earnings on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (i.e., vesting period) of the award.\nWith respect to performance-based stock awards, compensation expense is adjusted upward or downward based\nupon the probability of achievement of performance. Awards that continue to vest after retirement are expensed\nover the shorter of the period of time from grant date to the final vesting date or from the grant date to the date\nwhen an employee is retirement eligible. Awards granted to employees who are retirement eligible at the grant\ndate are generally expensed immediately.\nShare-based compensation expense was $87 million, $84 million and $59 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation\nexpense for unvested awards granted was $76 million. This expense is expected to be recognized over a\nweighted-average period of approximately two years.\nCitizens recognized income tax benefits related to share-based compensation arrangements of $16\nmillion, $19 million and $12 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNOTE 19 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nA summary of outstanding off-balance sheet arrangements is presented below:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022\nCommitments to extend credit $94,201 $96,076\nLetters of credit 1,977 2,119\nLoans sold with recourse 96 92\nMarketing rights 18 23\nRisk participation agreements 3 4\nTotal $96,295 $98,314\nCommitments to Extend Credit\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers in accordance with conditions\ncontractually agreed upon in advance. Generally, the commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination\nclauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire without\nbeing drawn upon, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 134\nLetters of Credit\nLetters of credit in the table above reflect commercial, standby financial and standby performance\nletters of credit. Financial and performance standby letters of credit are issued by the Company for the benefit\nof its customers. They are used as conditional guarantees of payment to a third party in the event the customer\neither fails to make specific payments (financial) or fails to complete a specific project (performance). The\nCompany’s exposure to credit loss in the event of counterparty nonperformance in connection with the above\ninstruments is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. Generally, letters of credit are\ncollateralized by cash, accounts receivable, inventory or investment securities. Credit risk associated with letters\nof credit is considered in determining the appropriate amount of allowances for unfunded commitments. Standby\nletters of credit and commercial letters of credit are issued for terms of up to two years and one year,\nrespectively.\nOther Commitments\nCitizens has additional off-balance sheet arrangements that are summarized below:\n• Marketing Rights - During 2003, Citizens entered into a 25-year agreement to acquire the naming and\nmarketing rights of a baseball stadium in Pennsylvania.\n• Loans sold with recourse - Citizens is an originator and servicer of residential mortgages and routinely\nsells such mortgage loans in the secondary market and to GSEs. In the context of such sales, the Company\nmakes certain representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the underlying loans and,\nas a result, may be contractually required to repurchase such loans or indemnify certain parties against\nlosses for certain breaches of those representations and warranties. The Company also sells the\ngovernment guaranteed portion of certain SBA loans to outside investors, for which it retains the\nservicing rights.\n• Risk Participation Agreements - RPAs are guarantees issued by the Company to other parties for a fee,\nwhereby the Company agrees to participate in the credit risk of a derivative customer of the other party.\nThe current amount of credit exposure is spread out over multiple counterparties. At December 31, 2023,\nthe remaining terms on these RPAs ranged from less than one year to ten years.\nContingencies\nThe Company operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to potentially significant\nrisks. A certain amount of litigation ordinarily results from the nature of the Company’s banking and other\nbusinesses. The Company is a party to legal proceedings, including class actions. The Company is also the subject\nof investigations, reviews, subpoenas, and regulatory matters arising out of its normal business operations which,\nin some instances, relate to concerns about fair lending, unfair and/or deceptive practices, and mortgage-related\nissues. In addition, the Company engages in discussions with relevant governmental and regulatory authorities on\na regular and ongoing basis regarding various issues, and any issues discussed or identified may result in\ninvestigatory or other action being taken. Litigation and regulatory matters may result in settlements, damages,\nfines, penalties, public or private censure, increased costs, required remediation, restrictions on business\nactivities, or other impacts on the Company.\nIn these disputes and proceedings, the Company contests liability and the amount of damages as\nappropriate. Given their complex nature, and based on the Company's experience, it may be years before some\nof these matters are finally resolved. Moreover, before liability can be reasonably estimated for a claim,\nnumerous legal and factual issues may need to be examined, including through potentially lengthy discovery and\ndetermination of important factual matters, and by addressing novel or unsettled legal issues relevant to the\nproceedings in question. The Company cannot predict with certainty if, how, or when such claims will be\nresolved or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, may be, particularly for claims\nthat are at an early stage in their development or where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages.\nThe Company recognizes a provision for a claim when, in the opinion of management after seeking legal advice,\nit is probable that a liability exists and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In many proceedings,\nhowever, it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable or to estimate the amount of any loss.\nBased on information currently available, the advice of legal counsel and other advisers, and established\nreserves, management believes that the aggregate liabilities, if any, potentially arising from these proceedings\nwill not have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 135\nNOTE 20 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nCitizens measures or monitors many of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on\na recurring basis for assets and liabilities for which fair value is the required or elected measurement basis of\naccounting. Fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate assets for impairment or for disclosure\npurposes. Nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower of cost or market\naccounting or write-downs of individual assets. Fair value measurement guidance is also applied to determine\namounts reported for certain disclosures in this Note for assets and liabilities that are not required to be\nreported at fair value in the financial statements.\nFair Value Option\nCitizens elected to account for residential mortgage LHFS and certain commercial and industrial, and\ncommercial real estate LHFS at fair value. The election of the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities\nis optional and irrevocable. Applying fair value accounting to residential mortgage LHFS better aligns the\nreported results of the economic changes in the value of these loans and their related economic hedge\ninstruments. Certain commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate LHFS are managed by a commercial\nsecondary loan desk that provides liquidity to banks, finance companies and institutional investors. Fair value\naccounting is applied to these loans since the Company holds these loans with the intent to sell them in the near-\nterm.\nThe following table presents the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid\nprincipal balance of LHFS measured at fair value:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nAggregate Aggregate\nFair Value Fair Value\nGreater (Less) Greater (Less)\nThan Than\nAggregate Aggregate Aggregate Aggregate\nAggregate Unpaid Unpaid Aggregate Unpaid Unpaid\n(dollars in millions) Fair Value Principal Principal Fair Value Principal Principal\nResidential mortgage LHFS, at fair value $614 $593 $21 $666 $656 $10\nCommercial and industrial, and commercial real\nestate LHFS, at fair value 62 69 (7) 108 127 (19)\nResidential Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\nThe fair value of residential mortgage LHFS is derived from observable mortgage security prices and\nincludes adjustments for loan servicing value, agency guarantee fees, and other loan level attributes which are\nobservable in the marketplace. Credit risk does not have a significant impact on the valuation of these loans as\nthey are sold shortly after origination. Residential mortgage LHFS are classified as Level 2 in the fair value\nhierarchy given the observable market inputs utilized to value these loans.\nResidential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option are initially measured at fair value\nwhen the financial asset is originated or purchased. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in mortgage\nbanking fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest income on residential mortgage loans held for sale is calculated based on the contractual\ninterest rate of the loan and is recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCommercial and Industrial, and Commercial Real Estate Loans Held for Sale\nThe fair value of commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate LHFS is estimated using\nobservable prices of similar loans that transact in the marketplace. External pricing services that provide fair\nvalue estimates based on quotes from various dealers transacting in the market, sector curves or benchmarking\ntechniques are also utilized. Commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate loans managed by the\ncommercial secondary loan desk are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy given the observable market\ninputs utilized to value these loans.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 136\nThese commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option are initially measured at fair value\nwhen the financial asset is recognized. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in capital markets fees in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the fair value of the commercial trading portfolio are due\nto changes in credit risk since the portfolio is comprised of floating-rate obligations only. These credit-related\nchanges may include observed changes in overall credit spreads and/or changes to the creditworthiness of an\nindividual borrower.\nInterest income on commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate LHFS is calculated based on\nthe contractual interest rate of the loan and is recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is measured using the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based upon\nquoted market prices in an active market, if available, or observable market-based inputs or independently\nsourced parameters if quoted prices are not available. Inputs may include prices for similar assets or liabilities,\nyield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, and foreign exchange rates.\nThe Company carries certain assets and liabilities at fair value, including AFS securities, derivative\ninstruments and other investment securities. In addition, the Company has elected to account for its residential\nmortgage LHFS and loans managed by the commercial secondary loan trading desk at fair value. Assets and\nliabilities carried at fair value are classified in accordance with the three-level valuation hierarchy:\n• Level 1. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments,\nquoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated\nby market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n• Level 3. Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market information and that are\nsignificant to the fair value measurement.\nClassification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement of the asset or liability. For instruments classified in Levels 1 and 2 where inputs are primarily\nbased upon observable market data, there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value. For instruments\nclassified in Level 3, management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data.\nFair value hierarchy classifications are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes related to the\nobservability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value\nhierarchy levels and are recognized based on period-end balances.\nA variety of valuation techniques are utilized to measure the Company’s assets and liabilities at fair value\non a recurring basis, with those utilized for significant assets and liabilities presented below:\nDebt securities available for sale\nAFS debt securities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy if quoted prices in active markets\nare available. Classes of securities that are valued using this market approach include debt securities issued by\nthe U.S. Treasury. The fair value of a security is estimated under the market or income approach using pricing\nmodels if quoted market prices are not available. These securities are classified as Level 2 since they trade in\nactive markets and the inputs to their valuations are observable. The pricing models used to value securities\ngenerally commence with market prices, or rates, for similar instruments, with adjustments made based on the\ncharacteristics of the instrument being valued. These adjustments reflect assumptions made regarding the\nsensitivity of each security’s value to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds. Classes of securities that\nare valued using this market approach include pooled mortgage “pass-through” securities, collateralized loan\nobligations, and other debt securities issued by U.S. GSEs and state and political subdivisions. The pricing models\nused to value securities under the income approach generally commence with the contractual cash flows of each\nsecurity, with adjustments made based on forecasted prepayment speeds, default rates, and other market-\nobservable information. The adjusted cash flows are then discounted at a rate derived from observed rates of\nreturn for comparable assets or liabilities that are traded in the market. Classes of instruments that are valued\nusing this market approach include residential and commercial CMOs.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 137\nA majority of the Company’s Level 1 and 2 debt securities are priced using an external pricing service.\nThe pricing accuracy of this service is verified on a quarterly basis and involves the use of a secondary external\nvendor to provide valuations for the Company’s securities portfolio for comparison purposes. Any valuation\ndiscrepancies exceeding a certain threshold are researched and, if necessary, corroborated by an independent\noutside broker.\nIn certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation model,\nsecurities are classified as Level 3.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nMSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices and, therefore, are classified as\nLevel 3 since their valuation utilizes significant unobservable inputs. The fair value is determined using a\ndiscounted cash flow model, which includes assumptions associated with weighted-average life, prepayment\nspeed, and weighted-average option adjusted spread. The underlying assumptions and estimated values are\ncorroborated by values received from independent third parties based on their review of the servicing portfolio\nand comparisons to market transactions. Refer to Note 8 for more information.\nDerivatives\nThe Company’s interest rate derivatives are traded in OTC markets where quoted market prices are not\nreadily available. Fair value is determined through models that primarily use market observable inputs, such as\nswap rates and yield curves. These pricing models determine the sum of each instrument’s fixed and variable\ncash flows, which are then discounted using an appropriate yield curve (i.e., Overnight Index Swap curve) to\narrive at the fair value of each derivative instrument. The pricing models do not contain a high level of\nsubjectivity as the methodologies used do not require significant judgment. Certain adjustments to the modeled\nprice that market participants would make when pricing each instrument are also considered, including a credit\nvaluation adjustment that reflects the credit quality of the derivative counterparty. The effect of exposure to a\nparticular counterparty’s credit is incorporated by netting their derivative contracts with the available collateral\nand calculating a credit valuation adjustment on the basis of the net position with the counterparty where\npermitted. This adjustment requires judgment on behalf of Company management; however, the total amount of\nthis portfolio-level adjustment is not material to the total fair value of the interest rate derivative portfolio.\nTherefore, interest rate derivatives are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe fair value of commodity derivatives uses the mid-point of market observable quoted prices as an\ninput into the fair value model. These observed market prices, combined with other market observed inputs to\nderive the fair value of the instrument, generally classifies the commodity derivative as a Level 2 instrument.\nThe fair value of foreign exchange derivatives uses the mid-point of daily quoted currency spot prices.\nThe valuation model estimates fair value based on these quoted prices along with interest rate yield curves and\nforward currency rates. Since all of these inputs are observable in the market, foreign exchange derivatives are\nclassified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe fair value of TBA contracts is estimated using observable prices of similar loan pools that transact in\nthe marketplace, as well as sector curves and benchmarking techniques. Therefore, the TBA contracts are\nclassified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy given the observable market inputs.\nOther contracts primarily consist of interest rate lock commitments, which are valued utilizing loan\nclosing rate assumptions that are internally generated. These assumptions are a significant unobservable input\nand, therefore, interest rate lock commitments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 138\nEquity Securities, at fair value\nThe fair value of money market mutual fund investments is determined based on unadjusted quoted\nmarket prices and is considered a Level 1 fair value measurement.\nThe following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value, including gross derivative assets\nand liabilities, on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023:\n(dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDebt securities available for sale:\nMortgage-backed securities $24,732 $— $24,732 $—\nCollateralized loan obligations 664 — 664 —\nState and political subdivisions 1 — 1 —\nU.S. Treasury and other 4,380 4,380 — —\nTotal debt securities available for sale 29,777 4,380 25,397 —\nLoans held for sale, at fair value:\nResidential loans held for sale 614 — 614 —\nCommercial loans held for sale 62 — 62 —\nTotal loans held for sale, at fair value 676 — 676 —\nMortgage servicing rights 1,552 — — 1,552\nDerivative assets:\nInterest rate contracts 464 — 464 —\nForeign exchange contracts 434 — 434 —\nCommodities contracts 685 — 685 —\nTBA contracts 3 — 3 —\nOther contracts 7 — — 7\nTotal derivative assets 1,593 — 1,586 7\nEquity securities, at fair value(1) 115 115 — —\nTotal assets $33,713 $4,495 $27,659 $1,559\nDerivative liabilities:\nInterest rate contracts $1,149 $— $1,149 $—\nForeign exchange contracts 378 — 378 —\nCommodities contracts 640 — 640 —\nTBA contracts 16 — 16 —\nOther contracts — — — —\nTotal derivative liabilities 2,183 — 2,183 —\nTotal liabilities $2,183 $— $2,183 $—\n(1) Excludes investments of $58 million included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per\nshare (or its equivalent) practical expedient.

Current income tax expense approximates taxes to be paid or\nrefunded for the current period while deferred income tax expense results from changes in gross deferred tax\nassets and liabilities between periods. Gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent changes in taxes\nexpected to be paid in the future due to the reversal of temporary differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.\nCitizens assesses the probability that positions taken, or expected to be taken, in its income tax returns\nwill be sustained by taxing authorities. A “more likely than not” (i.e., more than 50 percent) recognition\nthreshold must be met before a tax benefit can be recognized. Tax positions that are more likely than not to be\nsustained are reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 144\nThe following table presents total income tax expense:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nIncome tax expense $422 $582 $658\nTax effect of changes in OCI 289 (1,319) (199)\nTotal comprehensive income tax expense (benefit) $711 ($737) $459\nThe following table presents the components of income tax expense:\n(dollars in millions) Current Deferred Total\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nU.S. federal $497 ($135) $362\nState and local 167 (107) 60\nTotal $664 ($242) $422\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nU.S. federal $355 $88 $443\nState and local 170 (31) 139\nTotal $525 $57 $582\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nU.S. federal $871 ($345) $526\nState and local 216 (84) 132\nTotal $1,087 ($429) $658\nThe following table presents a reconciliation between the U.S. federal income tax rate and the\nCompany’s effective income tax rate:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\n(dollars in millions) Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount Rate\nU.S. federal income tax expense and tax rate $426 21.0 % $558 21.0 % $625 21.0 %\nIncrease (decrease) resulting from:\nState and local income taxes (net of federal\nbenefit) 58 2.9 133 5.0 126 4.2\nBank-owned life insurance (20) (1.0) (19) (0.7) (14) (0.5)\nTax-exempt interest (12) (0.6) (8) (0.3) (7) (0.2)\nTax advantaged investments (including related\ncredits) (77) (3.8) (102) (3.8) (95) (3.2)\nOther tax credits (3) (0.1) (9) (0.3) (7) (0.2)\nAdjustments for uncertain tax positions 5 0.2 1 — 3 0.1\nNon-deductible FDIC insurance premiums 35 1.7 20 0.7 14 0.5\nLegacy tax matters — — 3 0.1 — —\nOther 10 0.5 5 0.2 13 0.4\nTotal income tax expense and effective tax rate $422 20.8 % $582 21.9 % $658 22.1 %\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 145\nThe following table presents the significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and\nliabilities:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nOther comprehensive income $1,291 $1,546\nAllowance for credit losses 555 511\nFederal and state net operating and capital loss carryforwards 79 77\nAccrued expenses 1,152 863\nInvestment and other tax credit carryforwards 130 131\nOther 9 19\nTotal deferred tax assets 3,216 3,147\nValuation allowance (137) (133)\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 3,079 3,014\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nLeasing transactions 297 287\nAmortization of intangibles 421 413\nDepreciation 532 470\nPension and other employee compensation plans 130 128\nPartnerships 12 87\nDeferred Income 3 12\nMSRs 252 203\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 1,647 1,600\nNet deferred tax asset (liability) $1,432 $1,414\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and\ntax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded, as necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the\namount that management concludes is more likely than not to be realized.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $651\nmillion and capital loss carryforwards of $152 million. The majority of the federal and state tax net operating loss\ncarryforwards, if not utilized, will expire in varying amounts through 2042, while the capital loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards expire in varying amounts through 2027 and 2030, respectively. Limitations on the ability to realize\nthese carryforwards are reflected in the associated valuation allowance. At December 31, 2023, the Company\nhad a valuation allowance of $137 million against various deferred tax assets related to federal and state net\noperating losses, capital losses and state tax credits, as the Company’s current assessment is that it is more likely\nthan not that a portion of the deferred tax assets related to these items will not be realized.\nEffective with the fiscal year ended September 30, 1997, the reserve method for bad debts was no longer\npermitted for tax purposes. The repeal of the reserve method required the recapture of the reserve balance in\nexcess of certain base year reserve amounts attributable to years ended prior to 1988. At December 31, 2023,\nthe Company’s base year loan loss reserves attributable to years ended prior to 1988, for which no deferred\nincome taxes have been provided, was $557 million. This base year reserve may become taxable if certain\ndistributions are made with respect to the stock of the Company or if CBNA ceases to qualify as a bank for tax\npurposes. No actions are planned that would cause any portion of this reserve to become taxable.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and local\njurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state and local income tax\nexaminations by major tax authorities for years before 2016.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 146\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits:\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nBalance at the beginning of the year $6 $7 $4\nGross increase for tax positions related to current year 1 — 1\nGross increase for tax positions related to prior years 1 — 3\nDecrease for tax positions as a result of the lapse of the statutes of limitations — — (1)\nDecrease for tax positions related to settlements with taxing authorities (1) (1) —\nBalance at end of year $7 $6 $7\nTax positions are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent\nlikelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. The difference between the benefit\nrecognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. Any\nadjustment to unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations. The Company does not expect the balance of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the\nnext twelve months.\nInterest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported in income tax expense in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations. The Company’s liability for accrued interest related to unrecognized tax\nbenefits was $4 million as of December 31, 2023 and immaterial as of December 31, 2022. In addition, the\nincome tax expense recognized for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits was $3 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023 and immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. No amounts were\naccrued for penalties as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and no penalties were recognized in income tax\nexpense during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nNOTE 24 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average\nnumber of common shares outstanding during each period. Net income available to common stockholders\nrepresents net income less preferred stock dividends. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available\nto common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period,\ninclusive of potential dilutive shares such as share-based payment awards and warrants using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021\nNumerator (basic and diluted):\nNet income $1,608 $2,073 $2,319\nLess: Preferred stock dividends 117 113 113\nNet income available to common stockholders $1,491 $1,960 $2,206\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 475,089,384 475,959,815 425,669,451\nDilutive common shares: share-based awards 1,603,764 1,843,327 1,766,367\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 476,693,148 477,803,142 427,435,818\nEarnings per common share:\nBasic $3.14 $4.12 $5.18\nDiluted(1) 3.13 4.10 5.16\n(1) Potential dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS in the periods where the effect would be antidilutive. Excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted EPS were weighted-average antidilutive shares totaling 2,210,857, 949,606 and 2,929 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 147\nNOTE 25 - REGULATORY MATTERS\nAs a BHC and FHC, the Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. Our banking\nsubsidiary, CBNA, is a national banking association primarily regulated by the OCC.\nUnder the current U.S. Basel III capital framework, the Company and CBNA must meet the following\nspecific minimum requirements: CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, total capital ratio of 8.0%\nand tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. As a BHC, the Company’s SCB of 4.0% is imposed on top of the three minimum\nrisk-based capital ratios listed above and a CCB of 2.5% is imposed on top of the three minimum risk-based\ncapital ratios listed above for CBNA. The Company’s SCB will be re-calibrated with each biennial supervisory\nstress test and updated annually to reflect the Company’s planned common stock dividends. In addition, the\nCompany must not be subject to a written agreement, order or capital directive with any of its regulators.\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain actions that, if undertaken,\ncould have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table presents the regulatory capital ratios for the Company and CBNA under the U.S. Basel\nIII Standardized rules. The Company and CBNA have both declared as an “AOCI opt-out” institution, which means\nthey are not required to recognize the AOCI impact of net unrealized gains and losses on debt securities and\naccumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges and certain defined benefit pension plan assets in\nregulatory capital. In addition, both entities elected to delay the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital\nfor a two-year period ending December 31, 2021, followed by a three-year transition period ending December 31,\n2024, to phase-in the aggregate amount of the capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay.\nRequired Minimum\nActual Capital\n(dollars in millions) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio(1)\nAs of December 31, 2023\nCET1 capital\nCFG $18,358 10.6 % $14,671 8.5 %\nCBNA 19,411 11.3 12,047 7.0\nTier 1 capital\nCFG 20,372 11.8 17,260 10.0\nCBNA 19,411 11.3 14,628 8.5\nTotal capital\nCFG 23,608 13.7 20,712 12.0\nCBNA 22,453 13.0 18,070 10.5\nTier 1 leverage\nCFG 20,372 9.3 8,784 4.0\nCBNA 19,411 8.9 8,759 4.0\nAs of December 31, 2022\nCET1 capital\nCFG $18,574 10.0 % $14,633 7.9 %\nCBNA 20,669 11.2 12,935 7.0\nTier 1 capital\nCFG 20,588 11.1 17,411 9.4\nCBNA 20,669 11.2 15,706 8.5\nTotal capital\nCFG 23,755 12.8 21,116 11.4\nCBNA 23,534 12.7 19,402 10.5\nTier 1 leverage\nCFG 20,588 9.3 8,831 4.0\nCBNA 20,669 9.4 8,807 4.0\n(1) Represents minimum requirement under the current capital framework plus the SCB of 4.0% and CCB of 2.5% for CFG and CBNA, respectively. The SCB and CCB\nare not applicable to the Tier 1 leverage ratio.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 148\nThe Company’s capital distributions are subject to the oversight of the FRB. Under the FRB’s SCB\nframework, failure to maintain risk-based capital ratios above the respective minimum requirements including\nthe SCB would result in graduated restrictions on the Company’s ability to make certain discretionary bonus\npayments and capital distributions, including common stock dividends and share repurchases. The timing and\namount of future dividends and share repurchases will depend on various factors, including the Company’s\ncapital position, financial performance, capital impacts of strategic initiatives, market conditions, and regulatory\nconsiderations. All future capital distributions are subject to consideration and approval by the Board of Directors\nprior to execution. See Note 17 for more information regarding the Company’s common stock repurchases and\ndividends.\nDividends payable by CBNA, as a national bank subsidiary, are limited to the lesser of the amount\ncalculated under a “recent earnings” test and an “undivided profits” test. Under the recent earnings test, a\ndividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared during any calendar year exceeds the sum of\ncurrent year net income and retained net income of the two preceding years, less any required transfers to\nsurplus, unless the national bank obtains the approval of the OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend\nmay not be paid in excess of the entity’s “undivided profits” (generally accumulated net profits that have not\nbeen paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). Federal banking regulatory agencies have issued policy\nstatements that provide that FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies should generally\npay dividends only out of current operating earnings.\nNOTE 26 - BUSINESS OPERATING SEGMENTS\nCitizens is managed by its Chief Executive Officer on a segment basis. The Company’s three business\noperating segments are Consumer Banking, Commercial Banking, and Non-Core. The business operating segments\nare determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served. Each business\noperating segment has a segment head who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, who has final\nauthority over resource allocation decisions and performance assessment. The business operating segments\nreflect this management structure and the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the\nChief Executive Officer.\nDeveloping and applying methodologies used to allocate items among the business operating segments is\na dynamic process. Accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically as management systems are\nenhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines are updated, or our organizational structure\nchanges.\nSee Note 1 for a description of segment changes made during 2023.\nReportable Segments\nSegment results are determined based upon the Company’s organizational and management structure,\nwith balance sheet and statement of operations items assigned to each of the business segments. The results are\nnot necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. A description of\neach reportable business operating segment is presented below:\nConsumer Banking\nThe Consumer Banking segment serves consumer customers and small businesses with annual revenues of\nup to $25 million. It offers traditional banking products and services including deposits, mortgage and home\nequity lending, credit cards, business loans, education loans, point-of-sale finance loans, and wealth\nmanagement and investment services. Citizens Private Bank, launched during 2023, integrates wealth\nmanagement and banking services to serve high net-worth individuals and families, as well as businesses.\nThe segment’s distribution channels include a branch network, ATMs and a workforce of experienced\nspecialists covering lending, savings and investment needs as well as a broad range of small business products and\nservices. The Company’s Consumer Banking value proposition is based on providing simple, easy to understand\nproduct offerings and a convenient banking experience with a more personalized approach.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 149\nCommercial Banking\nThe Commercial Banking segment primarily serves companies and institutions with annual revenues of\n$25 million to more than $3.0 billion and strives to be a trusted advisor to its clients and preferred provider for\ntheir banking needs. A broad complement of financial products and solutions are offered, including lending and\nleasing, deposit and treasury management services, foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risk\nmanagement solutions, as well as syndicated loans, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, and debt and\nequity capital markets capabilities.\nThe segment focuses on middle-market companies, large corporations and institutions and has dedicated\nteams with industry and product expertise in Aerospace, Defense and Government Services, Communications,\nTransportation and Logistics, Food and Restaurants, Human Capital Management, and Gaming. While the\nsegment’s business development efforts are predominantly focused in the Company’s footprint, some of its\nspecialized industry businesses also operate on a national basis. A key component of Commercial Banking’s\ngrowth strategy is to present clients with ideas that help their businesses thrive and, in doing so, expand the\nbreadth and depth of our banking relationship with them.\nNon-Core\nThe Non-Core segment includes the Company’s indirect auto and certain purchased consumer loan\nportfolios that were transferred from the Consumer Banking segment into this newly created segment during\n2023. This new segment reflects the manner in which management is currently assessing performance and\nallocating resources and aligns with the Company’s recently announced balance sheet optimization strategy to\ndiscontinue the origination of certain non-strategic lending portfolios.\nNon-segment Operations\nOther\nNon-segment operations are classified as Other and include assets, liabilities, capital, revenues, provision\n(benefit) for credit losses, expenses and income tax expense not attributed to the Company’s Consumer Banking,\nCommercial Banking, or Non-Core segments as well as treasury and community development.\nManagement accounting practices utilized by the Company to measure the performance and produce the\nresults of its segments include the following:\nFunds Transfer Pricing\nThe Company’s FTP, a component of net interest income, ensures consistent business segment pricing\nbehavior by removing interest rate risk from business performance. This risk is centrally managed within the\nTreasury function and reported in Other non-segment operations. Business operating segments are provided an\ninterest credit for funding it generates and an interest charge for assets it holds. The sum of interest income/\nexpense and FTP charges/credits for each business operating segment is its designated net interest income. The\noffset to FTP charges and credits is recorded in Other non-segment operations.\nThe Company employs a matched maturity FTP methodology for the Consumer Banking and Commercial\nBanking business operating segments with rates based on a product’s repricing frequency and interest sensitivity,\nas well as other factors. The FTP charge for the Non-Core business operating segment is based on an implied\nreference pool of high-cost funding sources. This method applies a waterfall marginal funding approach\nreferencing the Company’s secured borrowings collateralized by auto loans, FHLB advances, and various other\nhigher-cost deposit sources required to fully debt-fund the assets.\nProvision for credit losses\nThe provision for credit losses for each business operating segment is based on actual net charge-offs\nrecognized by the business operating segment. The difference between the consolidated provision for credit\nlosses and total net charge-offs for all business operating segments is reflected in Other non-segment operations.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are assessed to each business operating segment at a standard tax rate with the residual\ntax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Other non-segment operations.\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 150\nExpenses\nNoninterest expenses incurred by centrally-managed operations or business lines that directly support the\noperations of another business line are charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization of those\nservices.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is allocated to the Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking business operating segments for\nimpairment testing purposes.\nSubstantially all revenues generated and long-lived assets held by the Company’s business operating\nsegments are derived from customers that reside in the United States. No business operating segment earns\nrevenue from a single external customer that represents ten percent or more of the Company’s total revenues.\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nConsumer Commercial\n(dollars in millions) Banking Banking Non-Core Other Consolidated\nNet interest income $4,187 $2,292 ($129) ($109) $6,241\nNoninterest income 1,067 784 — 132 1,983\nTotal revenue 5,254 3,076 (129) 23 8,224\nNoninterest expense 3,542 1,295 123 547 5,507\nProfit (loss) before provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,712 1,781 (252) (524) 2,717\nProvision (benefit) for credit losses 280 250 78 79 687\nIncome (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 1,432 1,531 (330) (603) 2,030\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 373 378 (86) (243) 422\nNet income (loss) $1,059 $1,153 ($244) ($360) $1,608\nTotal average assets $72,693 $76,028 $13,745 $59,755 $222,221\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nConsumer Commercial\n(dollars in millions) Banking Banking Non-Core Other Consolidated\nNet interest income $3,649 $2,103 $378 ($118) $6,012\nNoninterest income 1,063 845 — 101 2,009\nTotal revenue 4,712 2,948 378 (17) 8,021\nNoninterest expense 3,255 1,223 136 278 4,892\nProfit (loss) before provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,457 1,725 242 (295) 3,129\nProvision (benefit) for credit losses 174 46 52 202 474\nIncome (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 1,283 1,679 190 (497) 2,655\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 328 375 48 (169) 582\nNet income (loss) $955 $1,304 $142 ($328) $2,073\nTotal average assets $68,027 $74,919 $18,121 $53,994 $215,061\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nConsumer Commercial\n(dollars in millions) Banking Banking Non-Core Other Consolidated\nNet interest income $2,943 $1,706 $594 ($731) $4,512\nNoninterest income 1,223 809 — 103 2,135\nTotal revenue 4,166 2,515 594 (628) 6,647\nNoninterest expense 2,857 973 130 121 4,081\nProfit (loss) before provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,309 1,542 464 (749) 2,566\nProvision (benefit) for credit losses 162 156 23 (752) (411)\nIncome (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) 1,147 1,386 441 3 2,977\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 292 300 112 (46) 658\nNet income (loss) $855 $1,086 $329 $49 $2,319\nTotal average assets $57,916 $57,617 $17,592 $51,981 $185,106\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. | 151\nNOTE 27 - PARENT COMPANY FINANCIALS\nCondensed Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022\nASSETS:\nCash and due from banks $2,864 $1,821\nLoans and advances to:\nBank subsidiary 1,152 1,153\nNonbank subsidiaries 154 135\nInvestments in subsidiaries:\nBank subsidiary 23,289 23,674\nNonbank subsidiaries 291 302\nOther assets 194 182\nTotal assets $27,944 $27,267\nLIABILITIES:\nLong-term borrowed funds $3,344 $3,336\nOther liabilities 258 241\nTotal liabilities 3,602 3,577\nTotal stockholders’ equity 24,342 23,690\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $27,944 $27,267\nCondensed Statements of Operations\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollars in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nOPERATING INCOME:\nIncome from bank subsidiaries, excluding equity in undistributed income:\nDividends $2,875 $450 $1,120\nInterest 43 39 35\nManagement and service fees 69 69 64\nIncome from nonbank subsidiaries, excluding equity in undistributed income:\nDividends — 43 57\nInterest 8 3 2\nAll other operating income 1 1 1\nTotal operating income 2,996 605 1,279\nOPERATING EXPENSE:\nSalaries and employee benefits 39 43 36\nInterest expense 129 125 119\nAll other expenses 31 28 28\nTotal operating expense 199 196 183\nIncome (loss) before taxes and undistributed income 2,797 409 1,096\nIncome tax expense (benefit) (13) (13) (16)\nIncome before undistributed income of subsidiaries 2,810 422 1,112\nEquity in undistributed income (losses) of subsidiaries:\nBank (1,163) 1,724 1,188\nNonbank (39) (73) 19\nNet income $1,608 $2,073 $2,319\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes(1) 802 (3,895) (605)\nTotal comprehensive income (loss) $2,410 ($1,822) $1,714\n(1) See Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for comprehensive income (loss) detail.\nIn accordance with federal and state banking regulations, dividends paid by CBNA to the Company are\nsubject to certain limitations.

The\nCompensation and HR Committee has designed and administered a program that has a demonstrated history of\nmaintaining appropriate alignment between executive compensation and Company performance, considers and has been\nresponsive to shareholder feedback, and is supported by effective corporate governance and risk management. Our\nexecutive compensation program has strong shareholder support, with our say-on-pay proposal receiving over 93%\nsupport from shareholders in April 2023.\nPay Mix\nMore than 80% of our named executive officers’ (\"NEOs\") total compensation is at-risk variable compensation, which is\nillustrated below along with the portion of pay delivered in cash, restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and performance stock\nunits (\"PSUs\") for the 2023 performance year. At least 50% of long-term awards are granted in the form of performance\nawards with a three-year performance period, which increases to nearly two-thirds for our CEO, CFO, and the Heads of our\nConsumer and Commercial businesses.\nChief Executive Officer Other NEO Average\nHow We Make Compensation Decisions\nExecutive compensation is determined by the Compensation and HR Committee following a comprehensive evaluation of\nCompany and individual performance from a variety of perspectives – financial, customer, strategic, human capital, and\nrisk. As part of its process, the Compensation and HR Committee specifically considers the risk performance of each\nexecutive as assessed annually by our Chief Risk Officer. In addition, compensation decisions are informed by peer data,\ncompensation history, input from the Compensation and HR Committee’s independent consultant, feedback from each of\nthe CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer regarding executives other than themselves, and shareholder feedback.\nOnce all of those factors have been considered, the Compensation and HR Committee exercises structured discretion to\nmake executive compensation decisions that are aligned with performance, from both qualitative and quantitative\nperspectives. Maintaining a discretionary program also mitigates the risk of disproportionate focus on certain elements of\nperformance and allows the Compensation and HR Committee to be nimble in its decision-making to ensure continued\nalignment of executive compensation with Company performance and shareholders' interests.\n14 2024 Proxy Statement\nProxy Statement Summary\nPay and Performance Alignment\nThe Company has grown in size and scope and has made strong progress relative to our strategic plan. 2023 was a highly\nchallenging year given macroeconomic conditions and bank failures, which resulted in heightened scrutiny for regional\nbanks. Under Mr. Van Saun's leadership, during 2023 the senior management team effectively pivoted to items within\nmanagement's control, including maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, execution of several balance sheet\noptimization initiatives, and the launch of Citizens Private Bank. As a result, the Company emerged from 2023 in an even\nstronger position for long-term growth.\nDespite strong execution of the Company's long-term strategic plan under Mr. Van Saun's leadership during 2023, the\nCompensation and HR Committee understands the importance of aligning executive pay with key financial outcomes. As\ncan be seen below, CEO pay decisions by the Compensation and HR Committee during the past several years have been\naligned with our key financial metrics, Diluted Earnings Per Share (\"Diluted EPS\") and Return on Average Tangible Common\nEquity (\"ROTCE\").\nAsset Size (billions) n CEO Total Direct Comp (millions) – ROTCE* – Diluted EPS*\n* Results are presented on an Underlying basis, as applicable. See Appendix A for more information on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nand Reconciliations. Unless otherwise noted, references to balance sheet items above are on a period-end basis and any comparisons\nare on a year-over-year basis versus 2022. For information on how we define Diluted EPS and ROTCE, see page 60.\nThe Compensation and HR Committee is also conscious of stock price performance when evaluating performance and\ndetermining pay. Company one-year Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") was down 11%. Ultimately, the Compensation and HR\nCommittee delivered 2023 total compensation to Mr. Van Saun which was down 17% year-over-year, and which represented\na 33% reduction in variable cash compensation year-over-year.\nCFG 1-Year TSR 11%\nCEO Total\n17% YoY\nCompensation\nCEO Variable Cash\n33% YoY\nCompensation\nCitizens Financial Group 15\nCorporate Governance Matters\nPROPOSAL\nElect the Thirteen Named Director\n1\nNominees\nElect each of the director nominees nominated by the Board to serve until the 2025 annual meeting or\nuntil their respective successor is duly elected and qualified.\nThe Board recommends a vote FOR each director nominee.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or Charter, and Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that the\nBoard shall consist of between five and twenty-five directors, excluding any directors elected by holders of preferred stock\npursuant to provisions applicable only in the case of nonpayment of dividends under the terms of our preferred stock. The\nBoard fixes the exact number of directors from time to time and has fixed the number at 14 until the conclusion of the\nAnnual Meeting when Mr. Subramaniam will retire, following which it will decrease to 13. At each annual meeting, directors\nare elected to hold office for a term of one year expiring at the next annual meeting.\nThe Board has nominated 13 of the 14 directors currently serving on the Board for election at the Annual Meeting to serve\nuntil the 2025 annual meeting or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. If any nominee is unable\nto serve as a director, the Board by resolution may reduce the number of directors or choose a substitute nominee. We are\nnot aware of any nominee who will be unable to or will not serve as a director.\nMajority Voting and Director Resignation Policy\nOur Bylaws provide for the election of directors by a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election. This\nmeans that the 13 individuals nominated for election to the Board must receive more “FOR” than “AGAINST” votes\n(among votes properly cast at the meeting, electronically or by proxy) to be elected. Abstentions and broker\nnon-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose, and will have no effect on the election of\nnominees. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named. There is\nno cumulative voting. If any nominee for any reason is unable to serve or will not serve, proxies may be voted for\nsuch substitute nominee as the proxy holder may determine. If the election of directors is a contested election,\ndirectors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast.\nOur Bylaws also provide that directors may be removed, with or without cause, by an affirmative vote of shares\nrepresenting a majority of the outstanding shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Any vacancy\noccurring on our Board and any newly created directorship may be filled only by a vote of a majority of the\nremaining directors in office.\nIf a nominee does not receive a majority of “FOR” votes, he or she shall tender to the Board, via the Chair of the\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee, his or her resignation. The Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee will consider the resignation and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or\nreject the tendered resignation no later than 60 days following the date of the Annual Meeting in accordance with\nthe specific requirements outlined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\n16 2024 Proxy Statement\nCorporate Governance Matters\nDirector Nominees\nBoard Skills, Demographics and Diversity\nWe believe that the Board nominees as a whole represent an appropriate and diverse mix of experience, skills and\ndemographics relevant to the size and nature of our business, and our long-term strategy. The table below indicates the\nspecific skills and experience for each director which are most relevant to their board service and which the Nominating\nand Corporate Governance Committee considers to be key in making its nomination recommendations.

The Board also believes that,\ngiven the retirement of Mr. Subramaniam and the shorter tenure of the majority of our Board members, maintaining\nthe balance of shorter- and longer-tenured directors at this time is in the best interests of the Company. Should\nMs. Watson be reelected by our shareholders to serve on our Board for an additional term beginning April 25, 2024,\nwe expect that she will not stand for reelection at the April 2025 annual meeting.\n28 2024 Proxy Statement\nCorporate Governance Matters\nBoard Structure\nThe following sections provide an overview of our Board governance structure and processes as well as key aspects of our\nBoard operations and oversight, which collectively provide a strong governance framework that supports the Board in\ndischarging its duties.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nOur Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which outline the Board’s expectations as to how the Board, its\nvarious committees, individual directors and management should perform their functions. The Corporate Governance\nGuidelines are reviewed annually and address:\n• The Board’s roles and responsibilities concerning corporate strategy, risk management, succession planning, annual\nevaluation and director compensation;\n• Board structure and composition including size, independence, leadership and committee structure and\nresponsibilities;\n• Qualifications and selection of directors;\n• Board membership requirements concerning participation and preparation for Board meetings, stock ownership,\nparticipation on other boards, conflicts of interest, orientation and education, term limits, tenure and mandatory\nretirement age for directors; and\n• Board operations including Board agendas, executive sessions of independent directors, and access to management\nand independent advisors.\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on the corporate governance section of our website at\nhttps://investor.citizensbank.com/about-us/investor-relations/corporate-governance.aspx.\nBoard Leadership\nThe Board believes that the Company and its shareholders are best served by allowing the Board to exercise its judgment\nregarding the most appropriate Board leadership structure at a given time. The Board reviews its leadership structure\nperiodically and in doing so considers the composition of the Board, the needs of the Company and its shareholders,\nshareholder feedback, peer company practices, and other factors, retaining the flexibility and discretion to allocate the\nresponsibilities of the offices of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in any manner that serves the best interests of\nthe Company, including consideration of whether the same individual should serve as both Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer or whether the roles should be separated.\nThe Board has determined that a combined Chairman and Chief Executive Officer position, with a Lead Independent\nDirector, is the most appropriate Board leadership structure for the Company. Having a combined Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer:\n• provides efficient and effective governance and leadership to the Company;\n• ensures the Board is apprised of current risks and issues that may impact the Company in a timely manner; and\n• presents a single point of leadership to all Company stakeholders.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Van Saun, serves as Chairman of the Board, while an independent director, Mr.\nSubramaniam, serves as Lead Independent Director. The Board has named Edward J. Kelly III as Mr. Subramaniam's\nsuccessor as Lead Independent Director. Mr. Kelly will be appointed to the position, subject to his re-election, following\nthe Annual Meeting and Mr. Subramaniam's retirement.\nBelow is a summary of the key duties and responsibilities of the Chairman and the Lead Independent Director.\nCitizens Financial Group 29\nCorporate Governance Matters\nChairman CEO\nPresides at all meetings of the Board Manages and directs the business and\nand annual meeting of shareholders affairs of the Company under the oversight\nof the Board\nTogether with the Lead Independent\nDirector, reviews and approves the meeting Develops and executes the Company's\nagendas and schedules to assure content strategy against short- and long-term\nand sufficient time for discussion of all objectives\nagenda items\nBuilds and oversees the executive team\nFacilitates and encourages communication\nbetween management and the Board\nBruce\nVan Saun\nLead Independent Director\nFacilitator Collaborator\nPresides at Board and shareholder Reviews and approves agendas/agenda\nmeetings where the Chairman is not planners and materials for Board meetings in\npresent, including executive sessions of the coordination with the Chairman, adding items\nindependent directors to the agendas as appropriate\nServes as a liaison, facilitating Calls meetings of the independent directors\ncommunication between independent as required\ndirectors and the Chairman\nShivan\nProvides advice and guidance to the\nSubramaniam Chairman on board leadership, executive\nmanagement and corporate\nstrategy matters\nIndependent Advocate Communicator\nIndependent advocate ensuring Discusses with the CEO, together with the\naccountability to investors when potential Chair of the Compensation and HR\nconflicts of interest arise between Committee, the results of the Board’s annual\nmanagement and shareholders evaluation of the CEO’s performance\nCommunicates with major shareholders and\nregulators upon request\nExecutive Sessions of Our Non-Employee Directors\nThe Company’s non-employee directors, who are all independent, participate in regularly scheduled executive sessions in\nwhich management does not participate.

In its oversight\nof management, the Board monitors the Company to ensure it has established policies and procedures which allow for\nimplementation of a sound system of internal controls. This includes policies and procedures for enterprise risk\nmanagement; appropriate risk appetite and limits, capital and liquidity management and execution of debt and equity\ncapital markets transactions; proper accounting and financial statements; compliance with legal and regulatory\nrequirements and expectations; and execution against the Company’s strategic plan.\nRisk Oversight\nThe Board is responsible for oversight of the Company’s internal controls and risk management framework. This oversight\nincludes evaluation of management’s systems of internal control, financial reporting and public disclosure, the accuracy\nand completeness of financial results, and reviewing and approving the Company’s Enterprise-wide Risk Management\nGovernance Framework (the “ERMG Framework”). The Board has delegated certain risk oversight duties to the Risk\nCommittee, and with respect to financial controls, the Audit Committee, but each of the Board’s committees has risk\noversight responsibilities and the Board receives independent reports from each of its key committees at its meetings. In\naddition, the Chief Risk Officer provides an independent view of material risks across the Company to the Risk Committee,\nand to the full Board. While the Board and its committees oversee key risk areas, management is charged with day-to-day\nmanagement of risk through the utilization of the ERMG Framework. A key element of Citizens’ ERMG Framework is building\nand maintaining a strong risk management culture throughout the Company and to facilitate this, the ERMG Framework is\nconsistently applied across the Company and its effectiveness is evaluated on a continuous basis. Through the ERMG\nFramework, the Company seeks to proactively highlight current and emerging risks, promote timely resolution of issues,\nand eliminate repeat findings.\nThe ERMG Framework encompasses the policies, programs, and procedures which set the standards for the identification,\nassessment, monitoring, and control of material risks that could affect shareholder value, customers, colleagues or the\nsafety and soundness of the Company. Foundational to the ERMG Framework is the Risk Appetite Framework which governs\nthe Company’s approach to risk and serves to better inform the Company’s risk-taking strategy in its pursuit of strategic\nand financial goals. The Company’s risk appetite is embedded into key-decision making processes.\nThe ERMG Framework is implemented through a Three Lines of Defense model which incorporates (1) front line units\nresponsible for identifying, assessing, controlling, monitoring and reporting risk; (2) independent risk management which\nprovides independent challenge and oversight of our overall risk profile; and (3) internal audit and credit review functions\nwhich evaluate the design and effectiveness of the Company’s risk framework. The ERMG Framework incorporates both\nquantitative and qualitative methods for the identification and assessment of risks and events, including ongoing risk and\ncontrol self-assessment, and frequent scenario analyses. The model is designed to ensure effective management, control\nand oversight of all risks including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, market risk, operational risk, security, fraud,\nand financial crimes risk, technology risk, compliance risk, model risk, climate risk, strategic risk, and reputation risk.\nCitizens Financial Group 33\nCorporate Governance Matters\nCOMMITTEES\nBOARD\nNOMINATING &\nOF DIRECTORS\nAUDIT RISK COMPENSATION & HR CORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE\n• Oversees • Oversees design, • Evaluates executive • Oversees • Oversees\nevaluation of implementation performance, governance enterprise risk and\nsystems of and operation of including risk practices, risk management\ninternal control, the ERMG performance, and independence strategies, policies,\nfinancial Framework, which approves and effectiveness procedures, and\nreporting, and sets standards for compensation of the Board mitigation efforts\npublic disclosure the identification,\n• Establishes and • Oversees the • Oversees\nassessment,\n• Reviews the monitors Company’s Cybersecurity risk\nmonitoring and\naccuracy and compensation commitment to\ncontrol of material • Oversees utility\ncompleteness of programs and environmental,\nrisks and related operations,\nfinancial results performs an annual social and\ngovernance strategy, and\nrisk review of governance\n• Oversees our safety\n• Reviews and, as it compensation plans matters\nConduct Office,\ndeems • Monitors DEI and\nwhich monitors • Reviews director • Oversees the\nappropriate, diverse business\ncolleague compensation, with development and\nrecommends to spending\nbehavior in input from its implementation\nthe Board the initiatives\nrelation to our independent of the board\nCode of Business implementation of consultant annual training • Oversees capital\nConduct and the Company’s risk and continuing allocation related\nEthics, sales strategy, Risk • Oversees talent education to environmental\npractices, and Appetite management and program and climate\nother key policy Framework and succession planning initiatives\nspecific risk at the executive level\nconsiderations\nappetites and for the\nand limits organization overall,\nas well as diversity,\nequity and inclusion\ninitiatives\nBoth the Risk and Audit Committees oversee\nthe management of our cybersecurity risk.\nRegular reporting on cybersecurity and\ncyber threats as they continue to evolve is\nprovided to both committees and the Board.\nINCLUDES REPORTS FROM\n• Chief Financial • Chief Risk Officer • Chief Human • Corporate • Chief Financial\nOfficer Resources Officer Secretary Officer\n• Chief Compliance\n• Controller Officer • Head of Reward • Head of • Chief Risk Officer\nSustainability\n• Internal Audit • Head of Non- • Head of Development • General Counsel\nFinancial Risk • Chief Human\n• Independent • Chief Risk Officer • Chief Information\nManagement Resources Officer\nAuditor Officer\n• Independent\n• Treasurer • Head of\n• Chief Security Compensation • Chief Security\nGovernment\nOfficer • Chief Security Consultant Officer\nRelations\nOfficer\n• Head of • Business and • External advisors\nSustainability Functional Executive\nLeadership\n34 2024 Proxy Statement\nCorporate Governance Matters\nCybersecurity Oversight\nAs a financial institution, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential\ninformation in our network.

As part of this strategy, the Compensation and HR Committee reviews the Company’s talent\nmanagement and succession plans regularly. Talent management and succession plans for the CEO, including evaluations\nof successors and related development plans, are provided to the Compensation and HR Committee and to the Board at\nleast annually. A similarly detailed review of talent management and succession plans for the CEO’s management team\nalso occurs annually by the Compensation and HR Committee. The focus on talent management also extends below the\nexecutive level. To that end, the Compensation and HR Committee reviews talent management and succession plans for\nour primary businesses and functions on a regular basis. In addition to focusing on potential successors and team\nstrength, these deep dives also focus on the identification of emerging talent deeper in the organization. Board\nmembers also serve as formal mentors to certain members of our executive team and meet in small group sessions\nwith high-potential leaders across the Company throughout the year.\nCulture, Business Conduct and Ethics Oversight\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nOur Board has also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”), which sets forth key guiding\nprinciples concerning ethical conduct and is applicable to all of our directors, officers and employees. The Code of\nConduct addresses, among other things, conflicts of interest, protection of confidential information and compliance with\nlaws, rules, and regulations, and describes the process by which any concerns about violations should be reported. The\nCode of Conduct is available on the corporate governance section of our website at https://investor.citizensbank.com/\nabout-us/investor-relations/corporate-governance.aspx.

Under the Related Person Transaction\nPolicy, our executive officers, directors, significant shareholders, and their immediate family members (each a “Related\nPerson”), are not permitted to enter into a transaction with the Company without approval from our Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee. In accordance with the policy, any request to enter into a transaction with an executive\nofficer, director, significant shareholder or any of such persons’ immediate family members, in which the amount involved\nexceeds $120,000, and in which the Related Person has a direct or indirect material interest is required to be presented to\nour Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for review, consideration and approval.\nUnder the policy, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has pre-approved transactions which do not pose\na risk of creating conflicts of interest because they arise in the ordinary course of business, and the interests of the\nRelated Person are not material even if the amount involved exceeds $120,000. Pre-approved transactions include those\nthat do not require disclosure under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K; transactions that are subject to other approval\nprocesses such as employment and compensation arrangements of, or lending to, executive officers and directors; and\nordinary course banking, brokerage, investment, and financial services relationships, as well as other ordinary course of\nbusiness relationships and transactions with any beneficial owner of between 5% and 20% of the Company’s voting\nsecurities that is not a natural person, and is a Related Person solely as a result of stock ownership, provided they are on\nnon-preferential terms and the value does not exceed 1% of the consolidated gross revenues in a fiscal year of either the\nCompany or the beneficial owner.\nCitizens Financial Group 37\nCorporate Governance Matters\nIn approving or rejecting a proposed transaction, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will take into\naccount, among other factors it deems appropriate, (i) the commercial reasonableness of the terms, (ii) the benefit or\nperceived benefit, or lack thereof, to the Company, (iii) opportunity costs of alternate transactions, (iv) the materiality and\ncharacter of the Related Person’s direct or indirect interest, and (v) the actual or perceived conflict of interest of the\nRelated Person.\nTransactions with Related Persons\nWe maintain ordinary course banking relationships with some of our directors and officers.

With respect to other correspondence received by the Company on\nbehalf of one or more directors, the Board has requested that certain items, including the following, not be distributed to\ndirectors, because they generally fall into the purview of management, rather than the Board: junk mail and mass mailings,\nproduct and services complaints, product and services inquiries, resumes and other forms of job inquiries, solicitations for\ncharitable donations, surveys, business solicitations and advertisements.\nBoard Effectiveness\nBoard Education\nEach of our Board members participates in an annual training and continuing education program. Management\nincorporates director input to develop an annual schedule of board training that covers a broad range of topics to\nenhance and strengthen the skills, knowledge and competencies of directors, both individually and collectively. Topics\ncovered during 2023 included cybersecurity, payments, sustainability, innovation, and anti-money laundering. The program\nencompasses presentations from internal and external speakers as well as site visits to key locations and regular meetings\nwith management. In addition, directors are encouraged to avail themselves of educational programs offered through\nrecognized independent providers. Another key element of Board education is the mentoring program in place where\nBoard members serve as mentors to certain members of the executive team. Board members also meet in small group\nsessions with members of senior management below the executive level which assists in deepening the Board’s\nunderstanding of the business.\nEngagement with Engagement with Business and Strategy Review Sessions\nShareholders the Businesses\n• Director participation at annual strategy\nGovernance Discussions Calls with Management sessions\nFeedback from Provide an opportunity for • Strategic business updates presented at each\nshareholder engagements the CEO and executive Board meeting\nshared with the Board, leadership to discuss\nwith the Lead Company operations in real- Company Site Visits by Directors\nIndependent Director time with Board members as • Providence, RI\nparticipating in these appropriate • Short Hills, NJ\ndiscussions on request\nBusiness and Functional Deep • Stamford, CT\nDirector Education Dives • Johnston, RI\nAnnual Training Program Periodic sessions with • Boston, MA\nAnnual program supports business and functional Talent and Leadership Meetings\ncontinuous education for leaders provides opportunity\ndirectors for direct employee • Directors serve as mentors to certain members\ninteraction and better of the executive team\nNew Director Orientation understanding of Company • Directors meet in small group sessions with\nFull orientation program culture members of management below executive level\nfor new directors\nRegular Calls with CEO\nCitizens Financial Group 41\nCorporate Governance Matters\nBoard, Committee and Director Evaluations\nThe Board, led by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, conducts an annual self-evaluation to determine\nwhether it and its committees are functioning effectively. Under each committee’s charter, the committee evaluates and\nassesses its performance, skills and resources required to meet its obligations annually. In addition, all directors complete\na self-evaluation. Periodically, the Board will also complete peer evaluations; these were most recently completed in 2023.\nAn independent party was used to facilitate the evaluations in 2023 in accordance with our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines, which require an independent third-party to conduct the Board, committee, director and peer evaluations at\nleast every three years.\n1.

In accordance with our\nCorporate Governance Guidelines, which are reviewed annually, unless the Board determines that simultaneous service\nwould not impair the ability of a director to effectively serve on our Board or a committee of the Board, it is our policy that:\n• Non-employee directors may not serve on more than four public company boards, including ours;\n• Non-employee directors who are also CEOs of other public companies may not serve on more than three public\ncompany boards, including ours; and\n• Directors may not serve as members of our Audit Committee if such director serves on the audit committee of more\nthan two other public companies.\n42 2024 Proxy Statement\nCorporate Governance Matters\nDirector Compensation\nThe Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy (“Director Compensation Policy”) governs\nthe compensation of our non-employee directors. The Director Compensation Policy is reviewed on an annual basis by the\nCompensation and HR Committee, together with its independent compensation consultant, Compensation Advisory\nPartners (\"CAP\"), who reviews our program to ensure consistency with sound governance practices and makes\nrecommendations, as appropriate. The Compensation and HR Committee reviews market data and recommendations\nprovided by CAP and considers their advice on industry best practice when making decisions regarding director\ncompensation. Any changes to director compensation are approved by the Compensation and HR Committee in addition to\nthe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the full Board.\nAs a result of the review of director compensation in April 2023, the following changes were made: (i) directors' annual\nequity retainer was increased by $10,000 (to $145,000); (ii) Lead Director cash retainer was increased by $10,000 (to\n$50,000); (iii) chair retainer was increased by $5,000 for the Risk Committee Chair (to $35,000); and (iv) chair retainers were\nincreased by $5,000 for the Compensation and HR Committee Chair (to $30,000) and the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Chair (to $25,000). These changes were approved by the Compensation and HR Committee, the Nominating and\nCorporate Governance Committee, and the full Board and became effective on April 27, 2023. Below is a summary of the\nelements of our Director Compensation Policy, as amended.\nElement of Compensation Amount\nAnnual Retainer (cash) $ 105,000\nAnnual Restricted Stock Unit Award (equity) $ 145,000\nLead Director Retainer (cash) $ 50,000\nAudit Committee Chair Retainer (cash) $ 35,000\nRisk Committee Chair Retainer (cash) $ 35,000\nCompensation and HR Committee Chair Retainer (cash) $ 30,000\nNominating & Corporate Governance Committee Chair Retainer (cash) $ 25,000\nAudit Committee Member Retainer (cash) $ 10,000\nOn the date of each annual meeting of our shareholders, each non-employee director receives an annual grant of RSUs\nunder the Citizens Financial Group, Inc. 2014 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan as compensation for their service\nuntil the next annual meeting. RSUs vest immediately as of the grant date, subject to the terms and conditions of the plan\nand the applicable award agreement. Director RSUs are not settled until a director’s cessation of service. To the extent\ndividends are declared between the grant and ultimate settlement date, dividend equivalents are reinvested into\nadditional RSUs with the same terms and conditions as the related award.\nProposal 2 in this Proxy Statement requests that shareholders approve the Amended & Restated Citizens Financial Group,\nInc. 2014 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan (the \"A&R Directors Plan\"). The A&R Directors Plan includes an\nannual limit on equity awards for directors. More specifically, under the A&R Directors Plan, the total grant date value of\nequity awards granted to a non-employee director in any calendar year will not exceed $400,000. We plan to also adopt\nannual cash limits on director compensation when our Director Compensation Policy is next reviewed, scheduled for\nApril 2024.\nNon-employee directors are subject to stock ownership and retention guidelines requiring that they hold shares with a\nvalue at least equal to five times their annual cash retainer within five years following their service start date. As\nmentioned above, director RSUs are subject to mandatory deferral and are not settled until a director’s cessation of\nservice. The types of awards that count toward meeting this requirement are consistent with those applicable to\nexecutives, as discussed in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Governance Policies and Practices—\nExecutive and Director Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines.”\nDirectors may defer up to 100% of their cash compensation under our Directors Deferred Compensation Plan.\nContributions to this plan are credited with interest on a monthly basis, based on the applicable interest crediting rate.\nThe interest crediting rate is the annualized average yield on the United States Treasury bond 10-year constant maturity\nfor the immediately preceding calendar quarter plus 2%, which is then divided by 12 to determine the monthly interest\ncrediting rate. There are no Company contributions to this plan and no above-market or preferential earnings on\ncompensation deferred pursuant to this plan.\nCitizens Financial Group 43\nCorporate Governance Matters\nDirectors are also eligible to receive matching charitable contributions as part of our general matching charitable\ncontribution program. Under this program, to the extent directors choose to make charitable contributions to qualifying\ncharitable organizations the Company matches those contributions dollar-for-dollar up to an annual limit of $5,000. In\naddition, directors receive reimbursement of business expenses incurred in connection with their attendance at meetings.\nOur non-employee directors do not participate in our employee benefit programs.\n2023 Director Compensation Table\nThe following table shows compensation for our non-employee directors during 2023. As described above, the Director\nCompensation Policy was amended effective April 27, 2023.

In addition, throughout the year directors received additional RSUs through the\nreinvestment of dividends as provided under the terms of outstanding awards. The amounts shown in this column reflect the grant\ndate fair market value of the RSUs and dividend equivalent units granted to directors during 2023, calculated in accordance with\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (\"FASB ASC 718\"), using the valuation methodology\nand assumptions set forth in Note 18 to the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are hereby incorporated by reference.\nAs of December 31, 2023, directors held the below numbers of RSUs previously granted as compensation for their board service.\nName\nNumber of RSUs 12,950 35,517 8,895 35,517 25,261 19,723 25,261 8,895 35,517 12,950 35,517 35,517\n(3) Amounts in this column reflect matching charitable contributions made by the Company on behalf of directors during 2023.

On\nFebruary 15, 2024, upon the recommendation of the Compensation and HR Committee and the Nominating and Corporate\nGovernance Committee, the Board unanimously approved the Amended & Restated Citizens Financial Group, Inc. 2014 Non-\nEmployee Directors Compensation Plan (the “A&R Directors Plan”) and directed that this proposal be submitted to\nshareholders for approval. The A&R Directors Plan will provide us with the continued ability to grant non-employee\ndirectors equity-based compensation following the scheduled expiration of the Original Directors Plan.\nUnder this proposal, we are asking shareholders to approve the A&R Directors Plan, including a total plan share reserve of\n750,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (\"Shares” for purposes of this Proposal 2), which is 0.2% of\ncommon stock outstanding as of the record date. These 750,000 Shares will be in addition to any Shares subject to\npreviously granted, outstanding awards. The A&R Directors Plan will become effective upon shareholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 1,217,822 Shares remaining for future grants under the Original Directors Plan and a\ntotal of 291,522 full-value awards outstanding under the Original Directors Plan. Following approval of this A&R Directors\nPlan by shareholders, Shares in excess of the 750,000 requested that remain available for future awards and are not\nsubject to previously granted outstanding awards will be immediately removed from the plan reserve and returned to\nunallocated Shares.\nIf the A&R Directors Plan is not approved by shareholders, we would not be able to grant equity-based awards to our non-\nemployee directors following the expiration of the Original Directors Plan and would be forced to compensate our non-\nemployee directors entirely in cash, which does not align with the interests of our shareholders.\nShare Plan Reserve\nThe A&R Directors Plan reflects a proposed share plan reserve of 750,000 Shares, which represents approximately 0.2% of\nShares outstanding as of the record date. In determining this number, the Compensation and HR Committee worked with\nits independent compensation consultant and considered, among other things, burn rate, board size, annual director\naward limits, historic and anticipated director compensation levels over the next several years, the number of currently\noutstanding awards, shareholder guidelines regarding dilution, and our stock price and volatility. The closing price of our\ncommon stock on the NYSE on the record date was $30.74.\nPlease see Proposal 4 for detailed information regarding dilution and burn rate associated with all of our equity plans.\nAfter taking into consideration all of the above factors, we estimate that the Shares requested under the A&R Directors\nPlan will be sufficient to provide awards for the duration of the plan term. However, it is possible it may last for a period\nthat is shorter depending on various factors, including: our stock price; the number of non-employee directors serving on\nour board; regulatory guidance regarding incentive compensation; and any changes in anticipated grant volume in light of\nmarket practice on director compensation levels and pay mix.\nCitizens Financial Group 45\nCorporate Governance Matters\nA&R Directors Plan Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal features of the A&R Directors Plan. This summary is not a complete description\nof all provisions of the A&R Directors Plan and is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the plan, which is attached\nto this Proxy Statement as Appendix B.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of the A&R Directors Plan is to attract and retain the services of experienced non-employee directors by\nproviding them with compensation for their services in the form of equity-based awards and/or cash, thereby promoting\nthe long-term growth and financial success of the Company and aligning with the best interests of our shareholders.\nPlan Duration\nThe A&R Directors Plan will become effective upon approval by shareholders and will expire on the ten year anniversary of\nits effective date. The plan will expire sooner if, prior to the end of the ten-year term, the maximum number of Shares\navailable for issuance under the A&R Directors Plan has been issued or our Board terminates the plan.\nAuthorized Shares\nSubject to adjustment (as described below), 750,000 Shares are proposed to be reserved under the A&R Directors Plan.\nDetailed information is provided above in \"Share Plan Reserve\" regarding the size of that proposed share reserve and\nrelated considerations. Shares granted under the A&R Directors Plan that are subject to outstanding awards that are\nforfeited, expire, terminate, otherwise lapse or are settled for cash, in whole or in part, without the delivery of the Shares\nwill again be available for issuance under the plan. Shares used to satisfy the exercise price of a stock option will not\nbecome available for issuance under the plan. The number of Shares subject to the A&R Directors Plan may not be\nincreased by the Board without shareholder approval.\nAward Limits\nThe aggregate value of all awards granted as compensation under the A&R Directors Plan to any individual for service as a\nnon-employee director in any single calendar year will not exceed $400,000.\nPlan Administration\nThe Board will administer the A&R Directors Plan and has the broad authority to do so, including, but not limited to,\ndesignating participants, determining the types of awards to be granted, determining the terms and conditions of awards\nand the number of Shares subject to each award. The Board also has the authority to interpret the A&R Directors Plan,\nestablish the rules and regulations relating to the A&R Directors Plan, correct any defect, omission or inconsistency\ntherein, make any other determination and take any other action that the Board deems necessary or desirable for the\nadministration of the A&R Directors Plan and, subject to any limitations set forth in the A&R Directors Plan, to amend the\nA&R Directors Plan.\nFor the sake of clarity, all awards granted under the A&R Directors Plan must be approved by the full Board, and the\ndecision to grant awards to participants under this plan may not be delegated.\nEligible Participants\nEach non-employee director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be eligible to receive awards under the A&R\nDirectors Plan. As of the record date, 12 non-employee directors would have been eligible to receive awards under the A&R\nDirectors Plan.\nTypes of Awards\nThe A&R Directors Plan provides for grants of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other share-based\nawards and cash retainer awards. The Board, in its role as plan administrator, will determine the terms and conditions of\nall awards granted under the A&R Directors Plan.\n• Stock Options. Stock options provide the right to purchase Shares at a future date at a specified exercise price, which\nmay not be less than the fair market value of Shares on the date of grant (except in the case of substitute awards).\nStock options granted under the plan will not be exercisable more than ten years from the grant date. The Board shall\ndetermine when stock options will become exercisable and the method for payment of the exercise price. No dividend\nequivalents will be issued in connection with stock options.\n46 2024 Proxy Statement\nCorporate Governance Matters\n• Restricted Stock. Restricted stock is an award of Shares that is nontransferable and may be subject to substantial risk of\nforfeiture until specific conditions established by the Board are met. During the period of restriction, participants\nholding Shares of restricted stock have voting rights with respect to such Shares. Dividends, dividend equivalents or\nother distributions, as applicable, accrued with respect to a restricted stock award will only be paid as the award\nbecomes vested, in the form determined by the Board.\n• RSUs. RSUs are awards denominated in Shares that will be settled in an amount in cash, Shares, or a combination\nthereof, based on the fair market value of a specified number of Shares at the time of settlement. The terms and\nconditions of RSUs, including the vesting and delivery schedule, are established by the Board. Dividend equivalents\naccrued with respect to an RSU award will only be paid as the RSUs become settled, in the form determined by the\nBoard.\n• Other Share-Based Awards or Cash Retainers. The Board is authorized to also grant other Share-based awards as well as\ncash retainers, independently or as an element of or supplement to any other awards. The terms and conditions of any\nsuch awards would be determined by the Board.\nAdjustments\nIn the event of any dividend or other distribution, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger,\nconsolidation, separation, rights offering, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of our Shares or other\nsecurities, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase our Shares or other securities, issuance of our Shares pursuant\nto the anti-dilution provisions of our securities, or other similar corporate transaction or event affecting our Shares, the\nBoard may determine that an adjustment is appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential\nbenefits intended to be made available under the A&R Directors Plan. In that case, the Board will, subject to compliance\nwith Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), adjust equitably (including without\nlimitation, by payment of cash) any or all of: (i) the number and type of Shares or other securities that thereafter may be\nmade the subject of awards, including the Share plan reserve; (ii) the number and type of Shares or other securities\nsubject to outstanding awards; and (iii) the grant, purchase, exercise price for any award or, if deemed appropriate, make\nprovision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding award.\nIn addition, our Board is authorized to adjust the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, outstanding awards\nin recognition of any such events affecting us or our financial statements, or changes in applicable laws, regulations or\naccounting principles, whenever the Board determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution\nor enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the plan.\nAutomatic Awards\nThe Board may institute, by resolution, automatic award grants to new and to continuing members of the Board, with the\nnumber and type of such awards, the terms and conditions of such awards, and the criteria for the grant of such awards,\ndetermined by the Board in its sole discretion.\nProhibition on Repricing\nSubject to the adjustment provision summarized above, the Board may not directly or indirectly, through cancellation or\nregrant or any other method, reduce, or have the effect of reducing, the exercise price of any award established at the time\nof grant without approval of our shareholders.\nSeparation from Service and Change of Control\nThe Board will determine the effect of a separation from service on awards, which will be set forth in the related award\nagreement. In the event of a “change of control” (as defined in the A&R Directors Plan and summarized below), except as\notherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, our Board may provide for:\n• continuation or assumption of outstanding awards under the A&R Directors Plan by us (if we are the surviving\ncorporation) or by the surviving corporation or its parent;\n• substitution by the surviving corporation or its parent of awards with substantially the same terms and value as such\noutstanding awards under the A&R Directors Plan;\n• acceleration of the vesting (including the lapse of any restrictions) or the right to exercise outstanding awards\nimmediately prior to the date of the change of control and the expiration of awards not timely exercised by the date\ndesignated by the Board; or\nCitizens Financial Group 47\nCorporate Governance Matters\n• in the case of stock options, cancellation in consideration of a payment in cash or other consideration equal to the\nintrinsic value of the award. The Board may, in its sole discretion, terminate without the payment of any consideration,\nany stock options for which the exercise price is equal to or exceeds the per Share value of the consideration to be paid\nin the change of control transaction.\nUnder the A&R Directors Plan, except as otherwise provided in a participant’s award agreement, “change of control”\ngenerally means the occurrence of one or more of the following events:\n• the acquisition of more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding securities entitled to vote in the\nelection of directors (other than by an employee benefit plan or trust maintained by us);\n• the replacement of the majority of our directors during any 12-month period;\n• the consummation of our merger or consolidation with another entity (unless our voting securities outstanding\nimmediately before such transaction continue to represent, either by remaining outstanding or being converted into\nvoting securities of the surviving entity, at least 50% of the combined voting power and total fair market value of the\nsecurities of the surviving entity, or if applicable, the ultimate parent thereof, outstanding immediately after such\ntransaction); or\n• the sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of our assets, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, having an\naggregate fair market value of more than 50% of the fair market value of us and our subsidiaries immediately before\nsuch transaction(s), but only to the extent that in connection with such transfer or within a reasonable period\nthereafter, our shareholders receive distributions of cash and/or assets having a fair market value that is greater than\n50% of the fair market value of us and our subsidiaries immediately before such transaction(s).\nAmendment and Termination\nExcept to the extent prohibited by applicable law or otherwise expressly provided in an award agreement or the A&R\nDirectors Plan, the Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the A&R Directors Plan, which may be\nsubject to approval by our shareholders if required by applicable law or the rules of the NYSE. In addition, the Board may\nalso amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate, or waive any conditions or rights under any outstanding award.\nHowever, subject to the adjustment and change of control provisions of the A&R Directors Plan (each summarized above),\nany such actions by the Board with respect to the A&R Directors Plan overall or to any award granted under the plan that\nwould materially adversely affect the rights of a holder of an outstanding award may not be taken without the holder’s\nconsent, except (i) to the extent that such action is taken to cause the A&R Directors Plan to comply with applicable law,\nstock market or exchange rules and regulations, or accounting or tax rules and regulations, or (ii) to impose any “clawback”\nor recoupment provisions on the awards.\nIn the event of our dissolution or liquidation, each award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such\naction, unless otherwise determined by the Board.\nClawback or Cancellation of Awards\nThe Board will have full authority to enforce clawback or recoupment of any awards as required by applicable law or any of\nour policies.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\nThe following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of certain awards that may be granted under the\nA&R Directors Plan. This summary is intended solely for general information and does not take into account various\nconsiderations that may apply in light of individual circumstances, nor does it consider the tax consequences that may\napply to an individual under applicable foreign, state and local tax laws.\n• Stock Options. A participant will not recognize taxable income at the time an option is granted. A participant will\nrecognize ordinary income upon exercise of a nonqualified stock option equal to the excess of the fair market value of\nthe Shares purchased over their purchase price.\n48 2024 Proxy Statement\nCorporate Governance Matters\n• Restricted Stock. Unless a participant makes an election to accelerate recognition of the income under Section 83(b) of\nthe Code, the participant will not recognize income at the time restricted stock is granted. When the restrictions lapse,\nthe participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the common stock as of that date. If the\nparticipant files an election under Section 83(b) of the Code within 30 days after the date of grant, the participant will\nrecognize ordinary income as of the date of grant equal to the fair market value of the common stock as of that date.\nAny future appreciation in the Shares will be taxable to the participant at capital gains rates. However, if the restricted\nstock award is later forfeited, the participant will not be able to recover the tax previously paid pursuant to their\nSection 83(b) election.\n• RSUs. A participant does not recognize income at the time an RSU is granted. When the RSUs vest and are settled for\ncash or stock, the participant generally will be required to recognize as income an amount equal to the amount of cash\nreceived or the fair market value of the Shares on the date of settlement. Any gain or loss recognized upon a\nsubsequent sale or exchange of the stock (if settled in stock) is treated as capital gain or loss.\nTax Consequences to the Company\nTo the extent that a participant recognizes ordinary income in the circumstances described above, the Company or the\nsubsidiary for which the participant performs services generally will be entitled to a corresponding compensation\ndeduction.\nNew Plan Benefits\nFuture awards under the A&R Directors Plan will depend on changes to our Director Compensation Policy in the future, the\nnumber of directors, and our stock price, among other factors. As a result, at this time it is not possible to determine\nfuture awards to be made under the A&R Directors Plan. Please see Proposal 4 for the New Plan Benefits table, which\nreflects awards granted under the Original Directors Plan during the 2023 year as a reference point.\nVoting Standard\nIn order to pass, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual\nMeeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast.\nCitizens Financial Group 49\nCorporate Governance Matters\nExecutive Officers\nOur highly experienced and talented executive officers, who are designated by, and serve at the discretion of, our Board,\nhave nearly 30 years of banking experience on average, and provide strong leadership to deliver on our overall business\nobjectives. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers.

Following that vote, the\nBoard affirmed shareholders’ recommendation and continued holding say-on-pay advisory votes on an annual basis.\nWith this item, shareholders may submit an advisory vote on the compensation of our CEO and other named executive\nofficers listed in the 2023 Summary Compensation Table. We encourage shareholders to review the complete description of\nour executive compensation program provided in this Proxy Statement, including the Compensation Discussion and\nAnalysis, compensation tables, and accompanying narrative, which describe the ways we seek to align the interests of our\nexecutives with those of our shareholders.\nWe ask our shareholders to vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting.\nRESOLVED, that the Company’s shareholders approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of the\nCompany’s named executive officers in the 2023 Summary Compensation Table, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of\nRegulation S-K (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and\naccompanying narrative).\nAlthough the vote on this proposal is advisory and therefore non-binding, the Compensation and HR Committee carefully\nconsiders the results of this vote when making future decisions regarding executive compensation and related disclosure.\nVoting Standard\nIn order to pass, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast at the Annual Meeting.

McCree III Vice Chair and Head of Commercial Banking\nBrendan Coughlin Vice Chair and Head of Consumer Banking\nMalcolm Griggs Former Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer\nExecutive Compensation Overview\nThe Compensation and HR Committee has designed and administered an executive compensation program that has a\ndemonstrated history of maintaining appropriate alignment between executive compensation and Company performance,\nconsiders and has been responsive to shareholder feedback, and is supported by effective corporate governance and risk\nmanagement. Our executive compensation program has strong shareholder support, with our say-on-pay proposal\nreceiving over 93% support from shareholders in April 2023.\nPay Mix\nMore than 80% of our NEOs’ total compensation is at-risk variable compensation, as illustrated below along with the\nportion of pay delivered in cash, RSUs, and PSUs for the 2023 performance year. At least 50% of long-term awards are\ngranted in the form of performance awards with a three-year performance period, which increases to nearly two-thirds for\nour CEO, CFO, and the Heads of our Consumer and Commercial businesses.\nChief Executive Officer Other NEO Average\nCitizens Financial Group 55\nCompensation Matters\nElement of Pay Key Characteristics\nBase Salary Base salaries are intended to compensate executives fairly for the\npositions held and are subject to change if, among other reasons,\nexecutives’ responsibilities change materially or there are changes in the\ncompetitive market environment.\nVariable Compensation Granted partially in cash to recognize annual progress toward long-term\nobjectives and partially in RSUs and PSUs. RSUs and PSUs are intended to\ntie executive pay to the interests of shareholders by driving achievement\nof long-term objectives and providing a retention incentive for executives.\nHow We Make Compensation Decisions\nExecutive compensation is determined by the Compensation and HR Committee following a comprehensive evaluation of\nCompany and individual performance from a variety of perspectives – financial, customer, strategic, human capital, and\nrisk. As part of its process, the Compensation and HR Committee specifically considers the risk performance of each\nexecutive as assessed annually by our Chief Risk Officer. In addition, compensation decisions are informed by peer data,\ncompensation history, input from the Compensation and HR Committee’s independent consultant, feedback from each of\nthe CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer regarding executives other than themselves, and shareholder feedback.\nOnce all of those factors have been considered, the Compensation and HR Committee exercises structured discretion to\nmake executive compensation decisions that are aligned with performance, from both qualitative and quantitative\nperspectives. Maintaining a discretionary program also mitigates the risk of disproportionate focus on certain elements of\nperformance and allows the Compensation and HR Committee to be nimble in its decision-making to ensure continued\nalignment of executive compensation with Company performance and shareholders' interests.\nNEO 2023 Performance Year Compensation\nThe below table reflects how the Compensation and HR Committee views the direct compensation earned by each of our\nNEOs for performance year 2023. The amounts below differ from those reported in the 2023 Summary Compensation Table\ndue to the nature of SEC reporting rules. Most notably, the table below includes equity awards granted in March 2024 for\n2023 performance (as opposed to equity awards granted in March 2023 for 2022 performance).

The\nportion of Mr. Griggs' variable compensation that would have otherwise been granted in PSUs was granted in additional RSUs. Mr.\nGriggs did not receive any cash payment or other benefits in connection with his retirement from the Company on February 16, 2024.\n56 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\nPay and Performance Alignment\nThe Company has grown in size and scope and has made strong progress relative to our strategic plan. 2023 was a highly\nchallenging year given macroeconomic conditions and bank failures, which resulted in heightened scrutiny for regional\nbanks. Under Mr. Van Saun's leadership, during 2023 the senior management team effectively pivoted to items within\nmanagement's control, including maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, execution of several balance sheet\noptimization initiatives, and the launch of Citizens Private Bank. As a result, the Company emerged from 2023 in an even\nstronger position for long-term growth.\nDespite strong execution of the Company's long-term strategic plan under Mr. Van Saun's leadership during 2023, the\nCompensation and HR Committee understands the importance of aligning executive pay decisions with key financial\noutcomes. As can be seen below, CEO pay decisions by the Compensation and HR Committee during the past several years\nhave been aligned with our key financial metrics, Diluted EPS and ROTCE.\nAsset Size (billions) n CEO Total Direct Comp (millions) – ROTCE* – Diluted EPS*\n* Results are presented on an Underlying basis, as applicable. See Appendix A for more information on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nand Reconciliations. Unless otherwise noted, references to balance sheet items above are on a period-end basis and any comparisons\nare on a year-over-year basis versus 2022. For information on how we define Diluted EPS and ROTCE, see page 60.\nThe Compensation and HR Committee is also conscious of stock price performance when evaluating performance and\ndetermining pay. Company one-year Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") was down 11%. Ultimately, the Compensation and\nHR Committee delivered 2023 total compensation to Mr. Van Saun which was down 17% year-over-year, and which\nrepresented a 33% reduction in variable cash compensation year-over-year.\nCFG 1-Year TSR 11%\nCEO Total\n17% YoY\nCompensation\nCEO Variable Cash\n33% YoY\nCompensation\nCitizens Financial Group 57\nCompensation Matters\nCompensation Governance Practices\nWe believe our pay practices demonstrate our commitment to alignment with shareholders’ interests and our dedication\nto maintaining a compensation program supported by strong corporate governance.

Encourage the creation of long-term value and align the rewards received by executives with\nreturns to shareholders and long-term business objectives as well as short-term progress toward those objectives.\n• Attract & Retain Talent. Attract, retain, motivate, and reward high-caliber executives to deliver long-term\nbusiness performance.\n• Support Stakeholders. Sustain a culture where colleagues recognize the importance of serving customers, fellow\ncolleagues and their communities well, and are rewarded for superior performance.\n• Discourage Excess Risk Taking. Promote a culture of risk management and accountability through compensation design\nand related governance processes, as well as the consideration of risk performance in evaluating performance and\ndetermining pay.\nElements of Our Compensation Program\nOur executive compensation program is composed of base salary, variable compensation (including short-term and\nlong-term awards), and other benefits.\nElement of Pay Objective Key Characteristics\nBase Salary To attract and retain talented Base salaries are intended to compensate executives fairly for\nexecutives who can effectively lead the the positions held.

We provide certain\nlimited perquisites to our NEOs, which are described in further\ndetail in “—Other Compensation and Benefits— Perquisites and\nOther Benefits.”\nVariable Compensation Mix\nThe Compensation and HR Committee believes that our variable compensation mix delivers a meaningful portion of NEOs’\nvariable compensation in the form of long-term equity awards (65-75%). At least 50% of long-term awards are granted in\nthe form of performance awards with a three-year performance period, which increases to nearly two-thirds for our CEO,\nCFO, and the Heads of our Consumer and Commercial businesses, in line with regulatory and shareholder expectations.\nThe Compensation and HR Committee made changes to the variable compensation mix in effect for the 2023 performance\nyear for senior leaders. For all senior leaders (including NEOs and other Executive Committee members), the amount of\nvariable compensation paid in cash was reduced by 5% for performance year 2023; that 5% was instead allocated evenly\namong additional RSUs and PSUs.\nThe below reflects the elements of our variable compensation program (PSUs, RSUs, and cash bonuses) and the key design\nfeatures of each element.\nCEO, CFO, Heads of Businesses Other Executive Committee Members(1)\n(1) Related to his retirement, Mr. Griggs received a different variable pay mix in 2023 that provided for additional RSUs in lieu of PSUs.\nCitizens Financial Group 59\nCompensation Matters\nElement Key Design Features\nPerformance Stock Vesting Date: 3rd anniversary of grant\nUnits\nPerformance Period: 3 years\nCore Performance Metrics:\n• Cumulative Diluted Earnings Per Share (50%)\n• Average Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (50%)\nModifier Metric:\n• Awards include a TSR modifier in addition to the core metrics, first introduced for awards\ngranted in 2020 as a +/-10% modifier.

We define “Diluted EPS” as\nnet income divided by weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, as reported on an Underlying basis\nconsistent with our external earnings reporting.*\n• ROTCE: Return on average tangible common equity measures profitability by showing how much profit we generate (net\nincome) with the money our shareholders have invested. We define “ROTCE” as net income available to common\nshareholders divided by average common equity excluding average goodwill (net of related deferred tax liabilities) and\naverage other intangible assets, as reported on an Underlying basis consistent with our external earnings reporting.*\nROTCE targets for 2023 awards contemplate adjusted Other Comprehensive Income (\"OCI\") because the related\nadjustments help to neutralize movement solely related to the rate curve.\n* See Appendix A for information on Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations and their calculation or reconciliation to GAAP\nfinancial measures.\nPSUs granted in 2023 have a +/- 20% TSR modifier, with the payout percentage calculated based on the core metrics\nmultiplied by 120% if our TSR during the performance period is in the top quartile of our peer group or by 80% if our TSR is\nin the bottom quartile of our peer group, subject to a maximum payout of 150% of target (including application of the\nmodifier). Information regarding our peer group is discussed below in “—Our Compensation-Setting Process—\nCompensation Peer Group.”\n60 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\nTargets for Diluted EPS and ROTCE for 2023 PSU awards were set by the Compensation and HR Committee, together with\nmanagement in February 2023. When setting the targets, the following factors were considered:\n• Historic performance\n• Market conditions\n• The competitive landscape\n• Analyst expectations\n• Internal goals for the performance period\n• Information provided by the Compensation and HR Committee’s independent compensation consultant\n• Calibration to align with our publicly announced guidance range\nOur Compensation-Setting Process\nImportance of Structured Discretion\nExecutive compensation is determined by the Compensation and HR Committee in its discretion following a\ncomprehensive evaluation of Company and individual performance from a variety of perspectives – financial, customer,\nstrategic, human capital, and risk. Maintaining a discretionary program instead of applying a formula allows various\ndimensions of performance to be considered both from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. This mitigates the risk of\ndisproportionate focus on certain elements of performance and allows the Compensation and HR Committee to be nimble\nin its decision-making to ensure continued alignment of executive compensation with Company performance and\nshareholders' interests.\nCitizens Financial Group 61\nCompensation Matters\nOverview of Process\nThe below graphic illustrates the Compensation and HR Committee’s process for evaluating executive performance and\ndetermining appropriate compensation.\nEvaluate Review of Consider CEO\nIndividual Review Compensation and CHRO Consider Input\nEvaluate Performance History and\nCompensation Feedback from\nCompany (Including Target\nRelative to (Other Than Compensation\nPerformance Review of Risk Compensation\nRating Assigned Market Data (Target for CEO Relating to Consultant\nby CRO) Only) Themselves)\nFinal Decision\nOnce all inputs are reviewed, the Compensation and HR Committee makes total compensation decisions based on its members'\njudgment, which are consistent with company performance and aligned with shareholder outcomes.\nRole of Peer Group\nWe seek to maintain a competitive level and mix of pay for our executives. As part of our process, we review the level and\nmix of compensation paid to executives in similar positions at our peer companies. Although the Compensation and HR\nCommittee refers to market data as a reference point in making compensation decisions and to understand whether our\npay practices remain competitive, we do not benchmark a specific percentile for executive compensation.\nThe Compensation and HR Committee reviews the compensation peer group annually in consultation with its\ncompensation consultant, with the Compensation and HR Committee making any adjustments to the peer group based on\nthe advice of management and its compensation consultant. The peer group consists of companies with which the\nCompany competes for talent, customers, and shareholder investments, and which are generally similar in size and\nbusiness mix.\nDuring the Compensation and HR Committee’s 2023 review of our peer group, it was determined that the below peer group,\nwhich aligns with our financial peer group, continues to be appropriate for the Company and will continue in effect until\nthe next annual review.\nComerica Corporation KeyCorp Regions Financial Corporation\nFifth Third Bancorp M&T Bank Corporation Truist Financial\nHuntington Bancshares PNC Financial Services Group U.S. Bancorp\nThe below chart represents the Company's position relative to companies in our peer group with regard to asset size as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and total revenue during the 2023 fiscal year.\n62 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\nRole of Compensation Consultant\nThe Compensation and HR Committee retained Compensation Advisory Partners (\"CAP\") to provide guidance and advice on\ncompensation-related matters during 2023.

The\nCompensation and HR Committee does not engage CAP for any additional services outside of executive and director\ncompensation consulting, and they are not separately engaged by management for any services. In connection with CAP’s\nretention and on an annual basis, the Compensation and HR Committee conducts an assessment of potential conflicts of\ninterest, considering various factors including the six factors mandated by the NYSE rules, and no conflicts of interest\nrelating to its services have been identified. In addition, management retains AON McLagan to provide market\ncompensation data. Input from CAP and market data provided by AON McLagan are each referenced by the Compensation\nand HR Committee when making executive compensation decisions.\nShareholder Feedback\nWe value shareholder feedback on our compensation program and share all feedback\nreceived with the Compensation and HR Committee. Any feedback received is given\nsignificant weight during the ongoing review of our program and related disclosure.\nOur compensation program has generally had strong shareholder support. Following\nlower support in April 2022 (approximately 80% support vs. approximately 90% or higher\nsupport in all prior years), the Company held discussions with certain shareholders to\nunderstand how we could improve support going forward. Feedback from our\nshareholders was that although our pay decisions have been aligned with performance\nand they are generally supportive of our program, they would like to see additional\ndisclosure linking specific performance outcomes to our pay decisions. As a result of\nthose conversations, we made several enhancements to our compensation disclosure and\nrestored say-on-pay support to over 93% in April 2023. This supplemental engagement\nOur April 2023 say-on-pay\nwas in addition to our general shareholder outreach program that occurs annually.\nproposal received over\nAdditional detail regarding our shareholder outreach program and actions taken over the 93% support\npast several years in response to shareholder feedback is included in \"Board Engagement\n—Shareholder Engagement and Responsiveness.\"\nEvaluating Performance and Determining Compensation\n2023 Company Performance\nAt meetings held in December 2023 and January 2024, the Compensation and HR Committee reviewed the Company’s 2023\nperformance, including financial as well as other aspects of performance. The below summarizes the key items discussed\nand considered by the Compensation and HR Committee in evaluating Company performance and determining pay.\nFinancial Performance\nOutcomes on the below core financial metrics were specifically considered by the Compensation and HR Committee.\nParticular consideration was given to ROTCE, Diluted EPS, and Efficiency Ratio, which are metrics the Compensation and HR\nCommittee has been monitoring closely since our initial public offering. Macroeconomic headwinds related to bank\nfailures and other external conditions proved to be difficult challenges during 2023. The Company missed budget for each\nof these core metrics.\nCitizens Financial Group 63\nCompensation Matters\nFY 2023 vs. FY 2023 vs.\nMetric* FY 2023 FY 2022 FY 2022 Budget\nROTCE 13.53% 16.41% -288 bps -412 bps\nDiluted EPS $3.88 $4.84 -20% -26%\nEfficiency Ratio 60.81% 57.51% +330 bps +526 bps\nPre-Provision Net Revenue ($MMs) $3,223 $3,422 -6% -18%\n* Results are presented on an Underlying basis, as applicable. See Appendix A for more information on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nand Reconciliations. Unless otherwise noted, references to balance sheet items above are on a period-end basis and any comparisons\nare on a year-over-year basis versus 2022.\nStock Price Performance\nAlthough Company TSR underperformed the peer group and KBW Nasdaq Bank index on 1-year and 3-year time horizons, it\nhas outperformed peers and the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index over the last 5 years and since our initial public offering.\nCompany 1-year TSR was down 11% and the Compensation and HR Committee was conscious of stock price performance\nwhen evaluating performance and determining pay, particularly for Mr. Van Saun. Ultimately the Compensation and HR\nCommittee delivered total compensation to Mr. Van Saun which was down 17% year-over-year, and which represented a\n33% reduction in variable cash compensation year-over-year following changes made to our executive pay mix for 2023. In\nthe aggregate, NEOs excluding Mr. Van Saun were down 5% year-over-year in total compensation and down 21% year-over-\nyear in variable cash compensation.\nTotal Shareholder Return\n1-Year 3-Year 5-Year Since CFG IPO\nCitizens -10.9% 5.7% 39.8% 95.5%\nPeer Group* -0.6% 11.1% 33.5% 78.4%\nKBW Nasdaq Bank Index -0.9% 7.8% 31.6% 70.2%\n* Market capitalization weighted average TSR as of year-end 2023.\nOther Key Outcomes\nIn addition to considering financial and stock price performance, the Compensation and HR Committee also considered\nthe following performance outcomes in evaluating performance and determining pay. Many of the below outcomes will be\nkey to positioning the bank for strong long-term growth.\n• Maintained solid capital and liquidity positions, with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.6% as of year-end 2023,\nwhich is third amongst our nine regional bank peers.\n• Exceptional execution of a broad range of business and balance sheet strategies throughout the year.\n• Launch of Citizens Private Bank, including hiring 150+ Private Bankers.\n• Delivered on our Tapping our Potential (\"TOP\") 8 Program efficiency commitment, which achieved pre-tax run-rate\nbenefit of approximately $115 million as of year-end 2023.\n• Strong integration of recent acquisitions and strong performance in new markets, with growth in the New York City\nmetro region exceeding internal expectations.\n• Attracted, retained, and continued to develop top talent across the organization, with several senior level executives\nhired and the continued expansion of resources available to colleagues for training and development.\n• Continued dedication to colleagues. All-time high colleague participation rate of 87% in our organizational health survey\nduring our inaugural year using a new platform, with questions on topics of inclusivity among the highest scoring. In\naddition, the Company did not increase colleague medical costs for 2023 and provided each colleague a paid\n\"wellness day\".\n64 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\nThe Compensation and HR Committee also discusses items that have not met expectations. More specifically, it discussed\nthat the bank had an increased number of technology challenges during 2023 and, though the bank has proven resilient,\nthese led to a temporary setback in Consumer's customer experience scores.\nDecision Making\nIn arriving at NEO compensation decisions, the Compensation and HR Committee placed significant weight on Company\nperformance, in particular 2023 results for ROTCE, Diluted EPS and Efficiency Ratio, which are key tenets of our long-term\nstrategic plan. Several additional key outcomes were considered as well as items for which outcomes were below\nexpectations, described above in “—Evaluating Performance and Determining 2023 Compensation—2023 Company\nPerformance.” Company TSR performance was also considered, although it is not a primary factor in determining pay.\nWith Company performance in mind, the Compensation and HR Committee then evaluated each NEO’s individual\nperformance. See “2023 Compensation Decisions—NEO 2023 Performance Year Compensation,\" which reflects key\nachievements for each NEO that were considered by the Compensation and HR Committee. The CEO and CHRO each offered\nfeedback regarding the performance of executives other than themselves. The evaluation of individual performance\nincluded performance of the division managed by each NEO and its contribution to the Company’s overall success,\nincluding performance during the most recently ended year and in driving momentum toward longer-term goals. In\naddition, the effectiveness of each NEO’s leadership was also considered. For 2023, the exceptional leadership required to\nnavigate the Company through the heightened scrutiny resulting from bank failures was considered.\nAlthough the Company does not formally benchmark against a specified percentile of peer compensation, the\nCompensation and HR Committee believes NEO compensation levels should be appropriately positioned relative to peers\nbased on the increased size and complexity of the bank and commensurate with the strength and experience of our senior\nleadership team and at an appropriate level to retain and motivate them. The Compensation and HR Committee also\nconsidered input from its independent compensation consultant, CAP, on executive pay levels in the market.\nPerformance Outcome for 2021 PSUs\nOn February 14, 2024, the Compensation and HR Committee approved a final payout percentage of 135% of target for the\nPSUs granted in 2021 relating to the 2020 performance year (“2021 PSU Awards”).\nHalf of each 2021 PSU Award was earned based on achievement of pre-established Diluted EPS goals and half was earned\nbased on achievement of pre-established ROTCE goals during the performance period of 2021-2023, subject to the\napplication of a +/- 10% TSR modifier based on TSR performance relative to the Company's peer group. Maximum payout\nlevel for these awards was 150% of target.\nBased on Company ROTCE and EPS results during the performance period as compared to the targets established for these\nawards in February 2021 when the grants were approved, these awards would have paid out at 150% without application of\nthe TSR modifier. However, Company TSR relative to the peer group during the performance period was at the 22nd\npercentile. Because this outcome was below the 25th percentile for our peer group, the modifier was applied and resulted\nin a final payout of 135% of target.\nThe below table reflects the ROTCE and Diluted EPS thresholds, targets, and results for the 2021 PSU Awards in addition to\nthe underlying ROTCE and EPS results during the performance period. The ROTCE and Diluted EPS targets were established\nin February 2021 during the pandemic when there was a lot of uncertainty and are consistent with consensus estimates at\nthat time.\n2021 PSU Award Targets 2021-2023 % Earned % Earned After\nUnderlying Based on Application of TSR\nMetric Threshold Target Maximum Results(1) Core Metrics Modifier\n3-Year Average ROTCE 8.59% 11.20% 13.23% 15.31% 150% 135%\n3-Year Cumulative Diluted EPS $8.64 $11.77 $14.05 $14.06 150% (150% * 0.9%)\n(1) PSU assessments in prior proxy statements used Non-GAAP results for 2020 and 2021 that differ from the Non-GAAP results used in\nthis assessment.

We submit our executive\ncompensation to an annual say-on-pay vote\nin order to ensure timely feedback\nfrom shareholders.\nShareholder engagement. We proactively engage\nwith key shareholders to elicit their feedback on\nvarious topics, including executive compensation.\nIndependent compensation consultant. The\nCompensation and HR Committee engages an\nindependent compensation consultant, who is not\notherwise engaged by management.\n70 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\nClawback and Forfeiture Process\nThe Company maintains a firm-wide process through which events (referred to as “Trigger Events”) are reviewed to\ndetermine whether they should have an impact on a colleague’s compensation from previous years or for the current year.\nThis process applies to all our colleagues, including our NEOs. The Accountability Review Panel (“ARP”) consists of the\ndirect reports to our CEO, with our Chief Risk Officer serving as chair, and meets on a regular basis to consider whether\nspecific Trigger Events should result in compensation adjustments for involved colleagues. Trigger Events include not only\nfinancial restatements, but also events having a material impact on the Company that have arisen as a result of certain\ncolleague behavior, including failure to consider risk adequately. Potential actions by the ARP include current-year\ncompensation adjustments, forfeiture of unvested awards, or clawback.\nEffective as of December 1, 2023, the Company adopted the Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Clawback Policy (the \"Clawback\nPolicy\"). Under the Clawback Policy, the Company is required to recover reasonably promptly, the amount of erroneously\nawarded incentive-based compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement\ndue to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under securities laws. The\nClawback Policy is in addition to the ARP process described above, pursuant to which a broader set of consequences may\nbe imposed under a broader set of circumstances.\nExecutive and Director Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines\nThe Company maintains stock ownership and retention guidelines in order to align further the long-term interests of our\nexecutives and directors with those of our shareholders. Our stock ownership guidelines require that our executives and\nnon-employee directors hold shares having an aggregate value equal to a multiple of annual base salary or cash retainer,\nas applicable, as reflected below.\nPosition Multiple of Salary\nChief Executive Officer 6x salary\nExecutive Committee members (including NEOs) 3x salary\nOther Executive Officers 1x salary\nNon-employee Directors 5x cash retainer\nShares that count for purposes of the ownership guidelines include the following: (i) shares owned directly and indirectly\n(including shares purchased on the open market, shares obtained through option exercises or the vesting or settlement of\nrestricted stock, RSUs, or PSUs (as applicable), or shares otherwise owned directly or held through a broker in individual\nbrokerage accounts); (ii) shares owned indirectly through a trust of which the executive or director is a beneficial owner\nand shares held in a trust for an immediate family member, provided the executive or director retains investment control;\n(iii) shares or awards for which receipt has been deferred (including shares held through a 401(k) plan maintained by the\nCompany, shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, unvested RSUs and any shares or units held through\na deferred compensation plan maintained by the Company); and (iv) restricted stock and unvested RSUs that may only be\nsettled in shares and that are subject to time-based vesting conditions only. Unexercised options (whether vested or\nunvested), performance awards (including performance-based restricted stock and performance-based units), and\nunvested RSUs that may only be settled in cash would not count towards the satisfaction of these guidelines.\nExecutives and directors have five years from the date they become subject to these guidelines to reach their ownership\nrequirements. In addition, executives are required to hold 50% of the net shares acquired as a result of settlement of\ncompensatory awards until they are in compliance with the applicable ownership requirement. For directors, their RSU\nawards are subject to mandatory deferral of settlement until they cease to serve on the board and, accordingly, cannot be\nsold during their service.

The Compensation and HR Committee has\ndelegated the authority to make off-cycle equity grants under the Citizens Financial Group, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Incentive\nPlan (\"2014 Omnibus Plan\") to participants other than our executives to the Equity Committee of the Board, which is\ncomprised of our Chairman and CEO, subject to limits designated by the Compensation and HR Committee.\nTax Deductibility of Compensation\nUnder Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Section 162(m)\"), a public company generally may not deduct\ncompensation in excess of $1 million paid to its CEO and other covered officers. The Company does not specifically\nconsider this limitation in determining executive compensation.\nCompensation and HR Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNone of the members of the Compensation and HR Committee who served during 2023 are current or former officers or\nemployees of the Company or any of our subsidiaries.

Mr. Van Saun elected to defer 50% of the cash portion of his 2023 variable compensation ($1,048,500 out of $2,097,000)\npursuant to the CFG Voluntary Executive Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, which is discussed in the narrative following the\n2023 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table.\n(3) Amounts in this column for 2023 reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of RSUs and PSUs granted in March 2023 as part of 2022\nperformance year compensation. The fair value of awards has been calculated in accordance with FASB ASC 718, using the valuation\nmethodology and assumptions set forth in Note 18 to the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\n31, 2023, which are hereby incorporated by reference. For PSUs granted in 2023, the amounts above were calculated based on the\nprobable outcome of the performance conditions as of the service inception date, and represent the value of the target number of\nunits granted consistent with the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the service period determined as of\nthe service inception date under FASB ASC 718. Maximum payout level for our annual 2023 PSUs is 150% of target. At the maximum\npayout level, these values for Mr. Van Saun would be $7,132,822, for Mr. Woods would be $2,787,566, for Mr. McCree would be $2,787,566,\nfor Mr. Coughlin would be $1,944,397, and for Mr. Griggs would be $917,676. For a breakdown of all awards granted during 2023, see the\n2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table.\n(4) The only NEO eligible to participate in our Pension Plan is Mr. Coughlin. During the period of January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023, the\npension value for Mr. Coughlin increased by $8,727; this includes an increase of $3,970 due to changes in assumptions underlying the\npresent value calculations and an increase of $4,757 due to the effect of Mr. Coughlin being one year closer to his assumed retirement\nage. See commentary following the 2023 Pension Benefits table for more details on the assumptions used to determine the present\nvalue.\nCitizens Financial Group 73\nCompensation Matters\n(5) The below table reflects 2023 amounts included as “All Other Compensation” for each NEO. For Mr. Van Saun, the “Other” column in\nthe below table includes the value attributable to personal use of the Company car ($16,960) and financial planning services\n($24,000). The amount in the \"Other\" column for Mr. Woods reflects the value of financial planning services and for Mr. McCree reflects\nthe cost of parking near our Boston office. The cost associated with personal use of the Company car by Mr. Van Saun has been\ncalculated based on variable vehicle costs (including maintenance, fuel, and tolls), variable driver costs (overtime and bonus), and the\npercentage of miles driven for personal versus business use. The cost associated with personal use of the Company aircraft by Mr.\nVan Saun has been calculated based on hourly variable costs to operate the aircraft (including fuel, warranty costs, landing fees,\nmechanical expenses, and private passenger terminal fees) as well as crew travel and other expenses, using average 2022 hourly\naircraft variable costs and crew expense rates. In addition, on two occasions during 2023 Mr. Van Saun’s spouse accompanied him on\na business trip on the Company aircraft; however, no amounts are included below related to those trips because there was no\nincremental cost to the Company.\nCharitable\n401(k) Company Matching Personal Use\nContribution Contribution of Aircraft Other Total\nName ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\nBruce Van Saun 18,150 50,000 36,224 40,960 145,334\nJohn F.

Therefore, an eligible colleague’s actual years\nof service may be more than such colleague’s years of credited service under the Pension Plan.\n(3) For Mr. Coughlin, the present value of accumulated benefits on December 31, 2023 was calculated using the same actuarial\nassumptions used by the Company for GAAP financial reporting purposes, except where different assumptions are required. The\nfollowing are the key assumptions used: (i) a discount rate of 5.30%; (ii) a retirement age of 62, as required (the earliest unreduced\nretirement age under the Pension Plan); (iii) a mortality assumption reflecting generational mortality improvement using Scale\nMP-2021 for males; and (iv) no pre-retirement decrements, as required.\nWe sponsor the Pension Plan, which is a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that is qualified under Section\n401(a) of the Code. The Pension Plan was closed to new hires and re-hires effective January 1, 2009 and benefit accruals for\nall participants were frozen effective December 31, 2012. Regular full-time and part-time colleagues of the Company who\nwere hired before January 1, 2009 and completed one year of service were eligible for benefits under the Pension Plan.\nThe benefit under the Pension Plan for colleagues is currently calculated using a formula based on a colleague’s “average\ngross compensation” (defined under the Pension Plan as a participant’s average eligible compensation during five years of\nemployment (whether or not consecutive) prior to December 31, 2012 yielding the highest average), subject to limitations\nimposed by the Internal Revenue Service. Eligible compensation generally includes all taxable compensation, other than\ncertain equity-based and non-recurring amounts. The formula generally provides for a benefit of 1% of average gross\ncompensation multiplied by each year of the participant’s credited service, with such benefit percentage varying\ndepending on the colleague’s hire date and retirement date, as specified under the Pension Plan. Benefits under the\nPension Plan are generally payable in the form of a monthly annuity, though benefits under the Pension Plan may be\nreceived as a lump sum payment.\nA participant’s pension benefit under the Pension Plan vests in full upon the earlier of completion of five years of service\nor the attainment of normal retirement date. Normal retirement date is the later of attainment of age 65 or the fifth\nanniversary of the date the participant commenced participation in the Pension Plan. Participants may begin receiving full\nretirement benefits on the first day of the month coincident with or immediately following the normal retirement date and\nmay be eligible for reduced benefits if retiring after attainment of age 55 with a minimum of five years of vesting service.\nParticipants who retire after attainment of age 55 with a minimum of twenty years of vesting service are eligible to receive\nunreduced retirement benefits, starting at age 62. Mr. Coughlin became a participant in the Pension Plan on September 1,\n2005 and will be eligible to receive unreduced early retirement benefits under the Pension Plan commencing at age 62,\nprovided that he remains actively employed at Citizens through age 55.\nCitizens Financial Group 77\nCompensation Matters\n2023 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation\nExecutive Aggregate Aggregate\nContributions in Earnings in Balance at\nLast FY Last FY Last FYE\nName ($) ($)(2) ($)\nBruce Van Saun(1) 1,048,500 3,233,642 22,425,524\nJohn F.

During 2023, Mr. Van Saun was the only NEO who contributed to the plan, and he elected to defer 50% of\nthe cash portion of his 2023 cash variable compensation award.\nPlan eligibility is limited to colleagues who have total compensation equal to or exceeding the Code Section 401(a)(17) limit\nfor the relevant plan year. Participants are permitted to defer between 1% and 80% of their base salary and/or annual\ncash bonus. Participants select the allocation of their accounts among investment indices available under the plan. Our\nBoard has the power to amend the plan at any time, as long as the amount accrued to the date of amendment in any\naccount under the plan is not decreased or otherwise restricted.

Provisions relating to the treatment of Bruce Van Saun’s equity-based awards upon termination of\nemployment (including following a change of control of the Company) are included below in the description of his\nemployment agreement.\nTermination of Employment\nRSU Awards – If a participant’s employment with the Company is terminated by the Company without “cause” (as defined\nin award agreements), or by reason of “disability” or “retirement” (as defined in award agreements), vesting and\nsettlement of awards would continue as originally scheduled subject to the participant not engaging in “detrimental\nactivity” (as defined in award agreements), or “competitive activity” (as defined in award agreements) in the case of\ndisability or retirement, during the remaining vesting period. If a participant voluntarily resigns or is terminated by the\nCompany for cause, unvested awards would be forfeited. All unvested awards would become vested in the event of a\nparticipant's death.\nPSU Awards – In the event of a termination by reason of disability or retirement, awards would continue to vest in\naccordance with the original schedule subject to actual performance and would not be pro-rated based on service,\nprovided the participant does not engage in detrimental activity or competitive activity. In the event of an involuntary\ntermination by the Company of the participant without cause, awards would continue to vest in accordance with the\noriginal schedule subject to actual performance and would not be pro-rated based on service, provided that the\ntermination does not occur prior to the first anniversary of the performance period start date and the participant does not\nengage in detrimental activity; if the termination occurs prior to the first anniversary of the performance period start date,\nawards would be forfeited. If a participant voluntarily resigns or is terminated for cause, unvested awards would be\nforfeited. Awards will become vested at target in the event of a participant's death and would not be subject to pro-ration\nbased on service.\nChange of Control\nIn the event of a “change of control” (as defined in the 2014 Omnibus Plan and summarized below), except as otherwise\nprovided in the applicable award agreement, the Compensation and HR Committee may provide for:\n• continuation or assumption of outstanding awards under the 2014 Omnibus Plan by the Company (if we are the surviving\ncorporation) or by the surviving corporation or its parent;\n• substitution by the surviving corporation or its parent of awards with substantially the same terms and value as such\noutstanding awards under the 2014 Omnibus Plan;\n• acceleration of the vesting (including the lapse of any restrictions, with any performance criteria or conditions deemed\nmet at target) or the right to exercise outstanding awards immediately prior to the date of the change of control and the\nexpiration of awards not timely exercised by the date determined by the Compensation and HR Committee; or\n• in the case of outstanding stock options and stock appreciate rights (\"SARs\"), cancellation in consideration of a payment\nin cash or other consideration equal to the intrinsic value of the award. The Compensation and HR Committee may, in\nits sole discretion, terminate without the payment of any consideration, any stock options or SARs for which the\nexercise or hurdle price is equal to or exceeds the per share value of the consideration to be paid in the change of\ncontrol transaction.\nCitizens Financial Group 79\nCompensation Matters\nUnder the 2014 Omnibus Plan, except as otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, change of control\ngenerally means the occurrence of one or more of the following events:\n• the acquisition of more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding securities (other than by an\nemployee benefit plan or trust maintained by the Company);\n• the replacement of the majority of our directors during any 12-month period;\n• the consummation of our merger or consolidation with another entity (unless our voting securities outstanding\nimmediately before such transaction continue to represent at least 50% of the combined voting power and total fair\nmarket value of the securities of the surviving entity, or if applicable, the ultimate parent thereof, outstanding\nimmediately after such transaction); or\n• the transfer of our assets having an aggregate fair market value of more than 50% of the fair market value of the\nCompany and our subsidiaries immediately before such transfer, but only to the extent that in connection with such\ntransfer or within a reasonable period thereafter, our shareholders receive distributions of cash and/or assets having a\nfair market value that is greater than 50% of the fair market value of the Company and our subsidiaries immediately\nbefore such transfer.\nUpon a change of control, PSUs would be assessed to determine the actual number earned as of the date of the change of\ncontrol and the earned portion would remain subject to the original time-based vesting conditions.\nIf within 12 months or 24 months (starting with 2024 grants) following a change of control the participant’s employment is\nterminated by the Company without cause or the participant resigns for “good reason” (as defined in award agreements),\nRSUs and PSUs would fully vest and be settled immediately following the termination.\nSeverance\nThe cash severance to which our NEOs are entitled in various circumstances is governed by their employment agreements,\nwhich are described below in “—Employment Agreements with Our NEOs.” None of our NEOs’ employment agreements\nprovide for excise tax gross-ups in connection with a change of control.\nIn addition, under our general severance practice, in the event of an involuntarily termination without cause the NEOs\nwould also be entitled to receive benefits under our then-existing health and welfare plans for one month at active\ncolleague rates prior to the start of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (\"COBRA\") continuation\nperiod and would be offered outplacement services for 12 months. We may amend or terminate this practice at any time.\nEmployment Agreements with our NEOs\nThe material terms of the agreements entered into with our NEOs are summarized below.\nEmployment Agreement with Mr. Van Saun\nIn light of UK and European remuneration regulations ceasing to apply to the Company in late 2015, we entered into an\namended employment agreement with Mr. Van Saun on May 5, 2016. The Compensation and HR Committee’s objective\nwas to put into place an arrangement that balanced its former obligations under Mr. Van Saun’s prior agreement and\nachieved the following positive results for the Company: (i) motivates and rewards Mr. Van Saun for the achievement of\nour strategic objectives; (ii) provides additional retentive value; and (iii) aligns terms and conditions more closely with\nUS market practice.\nThis amended agreement had an initial five-year term that was extended automatically for a subsequent two-year term,\nwhich was scheduled to expire on May 5, 2023. In June 2021, a simple addendum to the agreement was entered into\nbetween the Company and Mr. Van Saun which extended the term of the contract beyond its scheduled expiration in\nMay 2023 until terminated by either party. In addition to extending the term of the contract, the addendum also obligates\nthe Company to provide Mr. Van Saun six-months’ notice in the event the Company chooses to terminate his employment\nwithout cause, which is reciprocal to Mr. Van Saun’s obligation to provide six-months’ notice in the event of resignation.\nOtherwise, the terms of the agreement continued in effect with no changes.\n80 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\nPursuant to the agreement, Mr. Van Saun is entitled to receive an annual base salary of $1,487,000 and has a target\ntotal compensation opportunity of $11.5 million, which was most recently increased in June 2022. The form and terms of\nMr. Van Saun’s variable compensation are to be determined annually by the Compensation and HR Committee. In addition,\nMr. Van Saun is eligible to participate in employee benefits available to the Company’s senior executives generally.\nUnder the terms of his agreement, Mr. Van Saun is also entitled to the following payments and benefits upon termination\nof employment in various scenarios, in each case, subject to execution and non-revocation of a release in our favor:\nTermination without Mr. Van Saun would receive a lump sum cash severance payment equal to two times his base\ncause or resignation for salary and a pro-rata portion of his target cash bonus for the year of termination to be paid\ngood reason absent a when cash bonuses are paid to other executives, in each case, subject to an orderly handover\nchange of control of duties. In addition, his outstanding unvested equity awards would continue to vest on their\noriginal schedule, with PSUs subject to actual performance and, in each case, subject to\nMr. Van Saun not engaging in detrimental activity for 12 months post-termination.\nTermination without Mr. Van Saun would receive a lump sum cash severance payment equal to three times the sum\ncause or resignation for of his base salary and his target cash bonus for the year of termination, plus a pro-rata\ngood reason within 24 portion of his target cash bonus for the year of termination. Upon the change of control,\nmonths following a Mr. Van Saun’s PSUs would be earned at target performance level, but not accelerated.\nchange of control Following the subsequent qualifying termination, all of Mr. Van Saun’s outstanding equity\n(\"Qualifying Change of awards would immediately vest and be paid. The agreement also includes a \"net better\nControl Termination\") cutback,\" such that if any payments or benefits to Mr. Van Saun (whether or not under the\nemployment agreement) would be considered parachute payments pursuant to Code\nSection 280G, these payments and benefits would be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid\ntriggering the excise tax under Code Section 4999 unless he would be better off (on an after-\ntax basis) if he received all payments and benefits due and paid all excise and income taxes.\nThe employment agreement does not provide any gross-up for excise taxes.\nResignation without Mr. Van Saun would be required to provide at least six-months’ notice and effectuate an\nGood Reason orderly handover of duties. At the time of termination, if the Company requires Mr. Van Saun\nto work during the notice period, the Company and Mr. Van Saun would mutually agree on how\na pro-rata portion of his variable compensation (excluding performance-based awards) for the\nyear of termination would be payable.\nBecause Mr. Van Saun currently meets the Company’s retirement rule (age plus years of service\nequals or exceeds 65, with a minimum of five years of service), his outstanding unvested equity\nawards would continue to vest on their original schedule, with PSUs subject to actual\nperformance and, in each case, subject to Mr. Van Saun not engaging in competitive activity\nduring the remaining vesting period or specified detrimental activity for 12 months post-\ntermination. In the event that Mr. Van Saun did not retire and became employed by a\nfinancial services company specified in his non-compete provision, his outstanding equity\nawards would be forfeited.\nDeath Mr. Van Saun’s estate would receive his base salary through the end of the month in which\nhis death occurs as well as a pro-rata portion of his target cash bonus. In addition, his\noutstanding equity awards would immediately vest and be paid, with PSUs vesting at\ntarget level.\nDisability Mr. Van Saun would continue to receive his base salary up to the date he becomes eligible for\nlong-term disability benefits under the Company’s plan (currently, six months from the date of\ndisability) and, in addition, his outstanding unvested equity awards would continue to vest on\ntheir original schedule, with PSUs subject to actual performance and, in each case, subject to\nMr. Van Saun not engaging in competitive activity during the remaining vesting period or\nspecified detrimental activity for 12 months post-termination.\nCitizens Financial Group 81\nCompensation Matters\nMr. Van Saun is subject to a perpetual confidentiality covenant and also non-competition and non-solicitation covenants.\nThe non-competition covenant applies for six months post-termination, concurrent with any notice period, in the event of\na termination without cause or resignation for good reason. For this purpose, competitors are defined to include the\nfollowing companies: J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America Corporation, Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Company, U.S. Bancorp,\nRegions Financial Corporation, M&T Bank Corporation, PNC Financial Services Group, Fifth Third Bancorp, Inc., Comerica\nCorporation, KeyCorp, Truist Financial, Capital One Financial Corp., and TD Bank Financial Group. The non-solicitation\ncovenant prohibits solicitation of colleagues as well as customers and prospective clients for 12 months post-termination,\nconcurrent with any notice period, in the event of a termination without cause or resignation for good reason.\nThe agreement includes the following definitions of cause and good reason:\n“Cause” includes: (i) any indictment for, conviction of, plea of guilty or nolo contendere by Mr. Van Saun for the\ncommission of: (a) any felony, (b) any criminal offense within the scope of Section 19 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act,\n12 U.S.C. § 1829; or (c) a misdemeanor involving dishonesty; (ii) if Mr. Van Saun willfully commits a material breach of his\nobligations under his employment agreement or repeats or continues after written warning any material breach of his\nobligations under his employment agreement, or is, in the opinion of the Board, guilty of gross misconduct which brings\nhim or the Company or any of its affiliates into disrepute; (iii) if Mr. Van Saun is guilty of dishonesty in the conduct of his\nduties under his employment agreement, gross incompetence, willful neglect of duty, or of mismanagement of his financial\naffairs through failure to observe the Company’s rules and procedures for the operation of bank accounts and/or\nborrowing; (iv) if Mr. Van Saun commits any act of bankruptcy or takes advantage of any statute for the time being in force\noffering relief to insolvent debtors; or (v) if, as a result of any default on the part of Mr. Van Saun, he is prohibited by law\nfrom acting as an officer of the Company or any of its affiliates.\n“Good Reason” includes a material breach of the employment agreement by the Company, or a substantial diminution or\nother substantial adverse change, not consented to by Mr. Van Saun, in the nature or scope of his responsibilities,\nauthorities, powers, functions or duties or in his base salary, except that removal of the role of Chairman of the Company\nfrom his duties shall not amount to good reason.\nEmployment Agreements with Other NEOs\nEach of Messrs. Woods, McCree and Coughlin is party to an employment agreement with the Company, as was Mr. Griggs\nprior to his retirement on February 16, 2024. These agreements generally provide for the terms of each executive’s\ncompensation arrangement, including salary and variable compensation, vacation, and eligibility for other health and\nwelfare benefits. Under each executive’s agreement, the executive is subject to a notice period with regard to his intent to\nresign (120 days for Messrs. Woods, McCree, and Coughlin and 90 days for Mr. Griggs). In addition, each of the agreements\ncontains covenants regarding the non-solicitation of customers and colleagues that apply for 12 months following a\ntermination of employment for any reason.\nThe agreements provide that the executives are entitled to a minimum payment of 26 weeks of base salary in the event\nthey are made redundant or are terminated by the Company without “cause” (as defined in the agreements) by the\nCompany, subject to the execution and non-revocation of a release in favor of the Company. This level of severance is\nconsistent with severance available to all executives. In addition, the agreements each provide for enhanced, double\ntrigger severance in the event of a qualifying termination following a change of control. In the event of a termination by\nthe Company without cause or resignation by the executive with “good reason” (as defined in the agreements) within 24\nmonths following a change of control, each of Messrs. Woods, McCree, Coughlin, and Griggs would receive severance\nconsisting of: (i) two times the sum of current base salary and average cash bonus received during the prior three years,\nplus (ii) a pro-rata cash bonus for the year in which termination occurs, also based on the average cash bonus during the\nprior three years.\n82 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\nThe agreements include the following definitions of cause and good reason:\n“Cause” includes (i) any conviction (including a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or entry into a pre-trial diversion\nprogram) for the commission of a felony or any conviction of any criminal offense within the scope of Section 19 of the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1829; (ii) an act of gross misconduct, fraud, embezzlement, theft or material\ndishonesty with the executive’s duties or in the course of employment with the Company or an affiliate; (iii) failure on\nthe part of executive to perform his employment duties in any material respect, which is not cured to the reasonable\nsatisfaction of the Company within 30 days after the executive receives written notice of such failure; (iv) the executive’s\nviolation of the provisions of his employment agreement relating to non-solicitation, confidentiality, ownership of\nmaterials, duty to return Company property or intellectual property rights; or (v) the executive makes any material false or\ndisparaging comments about the Company or any Company affiliate, or any Company or Company affiliate employee,\nofficer, or director, or engages in any such activity which in the opinion of the Company is not consistent with providing an\norderly handover of the executive’s responsibilities.\n“Good Reason” includes: (i) a material diminution in the executive’s authority, duties, or responsibilities; (ii) a material\ndiminution in the executive’s base salary other than a general reduction in base salary that affects all similarly\nsituated colleagues; or (iii) a relocation of the executive’s principal place of employment by more than 50 miles from his\ncurrent principal place of employment, unless the new principal place of employment is closer to the executive’s\nhome address.\nCitizens Financial Group 83\nCompensation Matters\nPotential Payments Table\nThe following table summarizes estimated payments and benefits that would have been provided to our NEOs pursuant\nto their employment agreements, our severance practice, and the terms of outstanding awards in connection with a\ntermination of employment under various scenarios or a change of control, assuming such event occurred on\nDecember 31, 2023.\nFor a summary of the material terms of the outstanding equity awards, the severance to which NEOs would be entitled,\nand the terms and conditions of our NEOs’ employment agreements, see “—Equity Awards”, “—Severance” and “—\nEmployment Agreements with Our NEOs” above.\nVoluntary Change of Change of\nTermination Control Control Only\nVoluntary with Good Not for Cause For Cause Qualifying (No Related\nTermination Reason Termination Termination Termination Termination) Death Disability Retirement\nName ($)(15) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\nBruce Van Saun\nCash Payment 4,403,700 (4) 5,477,250 (5) 5,477,250 (5) — 14,474,000 (6) — 2,503,250 (7) 743,500 (8) 2,097,000 (9)\nEquity Awards (1) — 13,794,558 (10) 13,794,558 (10) — 13,794,558 (10) — 13,794,558 (10) 13,794,558 (10) 20,085,558 (11)\nHealth Benefits (2) — 1,118 1,118 — 1,118 — — — —\nOutplacement (3) — 7,284 7,284 — 7,284 — — — —\nServices\nTotal 4,403,700 19,280,210 19,280,210 — 28,276,960 — 16,297,808 14,538,058 22,182,558\nJohn F.

In circumstances where PSUs are expected to vest: (i) 2021 PSU awards are reflected\nbased on the actual level of performance assessed by the Compensation and HR Committee in February 2024; and (ii) 2022 and 2023\nPSU awards are reflected at target.\n84 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\n(2) These amounts reflect the cost of COBRA benefit continuation coverage for one month under the plan in which the particular\nexecutive is enrolled, less the monthly active colleague rate for those benefits. This represents the benefit received by the NEOs as a\nresult of receiving coverage at active colleague rates for one month, when they would have otherwise been required to elect COBRA to\nreceive continued coverage.\n(3) These amounts reflect the cost for us to provide outplacement services for executive level colleagues for 12 months under our\noutplacement policy.\n(4) This amount includes a pro-rata portion of Mr. Van Saun’s 2023 variable compensation, excluding performance-based awards.\nBecause the assumed termination date is December 31, 2023, the full award is reflected, based on the amount of his variable\ncompensation and related mix for the 2023 performance year.\n(5) This amount reflects the sum of (i) two times Mr. Van Saun’s base salary and (ii) a pro-rata portion of his target cash bonus for 2023.\nBecause the assumed termination date is December 31, 2023, the full award is reflected, based on the amount of his target variable\ncompensation and related mix for the 2023 performance year.\n(6) This amount reflects (i) three times the sum of Mr. Van Saun’s (a) base salary and (b) target cash bonus for 2023, plus (ii) a pro-rata\nportion of his target cash bonus for 2023. Because the assumed termination date is December 31, 2023, the full award is reflected,\nbased on the amount of his target variable compensation and related mix for the 2023 performance year.\n(7) This amount reflects a pro-rata portion of Mr. Van Saun’s target cash bonus for 2023. Because the assumed termination date is\nDecember 31, 2023, the full award is reflected, based on the amount of his target variable compensation and related mix for the 2023\nperformance year. Although Mr. Van Saun’s estate would also receive continuation of base salary for the month in which his death\noccurs, no salary has been included in this table because a termination date of December 31, 2023 is assumed.\n(8) This amount reflects six months of base salary, which would be paid to Mr. Van Saun prior to his receipt of long-term disability\nbenefits.\n(9) This amount includes a pro-rata portion of Mr. Van Saun’s cash bonus for 2023.

The\nCompensation and HR Committee also reviews our plans annually, including from a risk perspective.\n• Equity compensation awards are subject to potential forfeiture or clawback in connection with the Clawback Policy\nand our Accountability Review Panel process, including as a result of risk-related events.\nCompensation Design That Drives a Culture of Risk Management\n• Executives are awarded a meaningful portion of their variable compensation (65%-75%) in the form of long-term\nequity awards.\n• Nearly two-thirds of long-term awards for our CEO, CFO and Heads of Consumer and Commercial Banking are awarded\nin the form of PSUs that vest following a three-year performance period depending on achievement against pre-\nestablished performance criteria and performance relative to peers. All other members of our executive team receive\n50% of their long-term awards granted in PSUs.\n• Equity compensation awards do not accelerate in the event of retirement or change of control.\nReview of Risk Performance Conducted by our Chief Risk Officer\n• The Chief Risk Officer conducts an annual review of executives’ risk performance.\n• Inputs to this review include a risk performance questionnaire designed by the Chief Risk Officer and completed by\nsecond line of defense Risk partners who have worked closely with the executive, audit results, conduct risk metrics,\nand executives’ self-evaluations against risk objectives.\n• The resulting risk score is taken into consideration by the Compensation and HR Committee in determining\nexecutives’ compensation.\nBased on the Compensation and HR Committee’s most recent review of our compensation policies and practices for all of\nour colleagues, it has concluded that our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material\nadverse impact on the Company.\nDodd-Frank Compensation Disclosure\nCEO Pay Ratio\nSEC rules require us to disclose the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO, Bruce Van Saun, to our median\nemployee’s annual total compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2023:\n• The annual total compensation for Mr. Van Saun as reported in the 2023 Summary Compensation Table was $11,075,271.\n• The annual total compensation of our median employee was $74,287.\n• The resulting ratio of Mr. Van Saun’s annual total compensation to that of our median employee is 149 to 1.\nDuring 2022, Citizens closed the HSBC, Investors Bancorp, Inc., Paladin Advisors, DH Capital, and College Raptor\nacquisitions, resulting in approximately 2,150 employees joining the Company. We have determined that the colleagues\njoining our Company in connection with acquisitions during 2022 changed our population significantly enough to require\nre-identification of a new median employee from our total population, including colleagues joining from acquisitions.\n86 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\nTo identify our median employee, we reviewed our employee population as of November 30, 2023 and the amount of their\ncompensation for the period of January 1, 2023 through November 30, 2023 as would be reported to the Internal Revenue\nService in Box 1, which we determined reasonably reflects the compensation of our employees. We did not annualize the\ncompensation for any of our employees who were only employed for part of the year. In addition, we did not make any\ncost-of-living adjustments in identifying the median employee because all our colleagues are located in the United States.\nThis analysis included all of our part-time and full-time employees as of November 30, 2023.\nOnce we identified our median employee, we calculated and combined all of the elements of this employee’s\ncompensation for the full 2023 year in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.\nPay Versus Performance\nAs required by Section 953(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(v) of\nRegulation S-K, the following disclosure is provided about the relationship between executive compensation and the\nCompany’s performance on select financial metrics. For a complete description regarding the Company’s compensation\nprogram, please see our “Compensation Discussion and Analysis.” Information regarding the total direct compensation\npaid to our executive team for the 2023 performance year can be found in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2023\nCompensation Decisions.”\nAverage\nSummary Average\nValue of Initial Fixed $100\nCompensation Compensation\nInvestment Based On:\nTable Total for Actually Paid\nSummary Non-PEO to Non-PEO Peer Group\nCompensation Compensation Named Named Total Total GAAP Net\nTable Total for Actually Paid Executive Executive Shareholder Shareholder Income Underlying\nYear PEO(1) to PEO(2) Officers(3) Officers(4) Return(5) Return(6) (millions)(7) ROTCE(8)\n2023 $ 11,075,271 $ 8,577,572 $ 3,725,520 $ 2,979,734 $ 98.6 $ 96.7 $ 1,608 13.5%\n2022 $ 11,703,788 $ 10,144,803 $ 3,576,460 $ 3,105,059 $ 110.7 $ 97.5 $ 2,073 16.4%\n2021 $ 12,430,076 $ 19,447,714 $ 3,651,053 $ 5,448,493 $ 127.8 $ 124.1 $ 2,319 16.0%\n2020 $ 14,335,323 $ 3,575,870 $ 4,106,055 $ 1,414,681 $ 93.3 $ 89.7 $ 1,057 7.5%\n(1) These amounts reflect the total compensation reported for Mr. Van Saun (our CEO) for each corresponding year in the “Total” column\nof the Summary Compensation Table.\n(2) These amounts reflect the “compensation actually paid” to Mr. Van Saun, as computed in accordance with Item 402(v) of Regulation\nS-K.

While the Company uses\n88 2024 Proxy Statement\nnumerous financial and non-financial performance measures for the purpose of evaluating performance for the Company’s\ncompensation programs, the Company has determined that Underlying ROTCE is the financial performance measure that, in the\nCompany’s assessment, represents the most important performance measure (that is not otherwise required to be disclosed in the\ntable) used by the Company to link NEO compensation for the most recently completed fiscal year to Company performance.\nThe graph below illustrates the trend in “compensation actually paid” over the last four years to our TSR performance, as\nwell as our TSR relative to the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (\"BKX\").

On February 15, 2024, upon the\nrecommendation of the Compensation and HR Committee, the Board unanimously approved the Amended & Restated\nCitizens Financial Group, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “A&R Omnibus Plan”) and directed that this proposal be\nsubmitted to shareholders for approval. The A&R Omnibus Plan will provide the Company with the continued ability to\ngrant employees equity-based awards following the scheduled expiration of the Original Omnibus Plan.\nUnder this proposal, we are asking shareholders to approve the A&R Omnibus Plan, including a total plan share reserve of\n13.0MM shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Shares” for purposes of this Proposal 4), which is 2.8% of\ncommon stock outstanding as of the record date. The A&R Omnibus Plan will become effective upon shareholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were 39,532,535 Shares remaining for future grants under the Original Omnibus Plan.\nFollowing approval of this A&R Omnibus Plan by shareholders, Shares in excess of the 13.0MM requested that remain\navailable for future awards and are not subject to previously granted outstanding awards will be immediately removed\nfrom the plan reserve and returned to unallocated Shares.\nThe ability to grant equity-based awards to employees is crucial to advance our long-term success. These awards provide\ncrucial retentive value for colleagues and align the interests of award recipients, most notably including our senior\nexecutives, with returns to shareholders. If the A&R Omnibus Plan is not approved by shareholders, we would not be able\nto grant equity-based awards to employees following the expiration of the Original Omnibus Plan, which could jeopardize\nour ability to attract, retain, and motivate our senior executives and to align their interests with those of our shareholders.\nShare Plan Reserve\nThe A&R Omnibus Plan reflects a proposed Share plan reserve of 13.0MM Shares. In determining the size of this reserve,\nthe Compensation and HR Committee worked with its independent compensation consultant and considered, among other\nthings, burn rate, historical and expected grant practices over the next several years, the number of currently outstanding\nequity-based awards, shareholder guidelines regarding dilution, and our stock price and its volatility. The closing price of\nour common stock on the NYSE on the record date was $30.74.\nKey fact about the A&R Omnibus Plan Share reserve size:\n• Represents 2.8% of our common stock outstanding as of the record date.\n• Represents a -67.1% reduction in size of the Share reserve remaining for future grants under the Original Omnibus Plan\nas of December 31, 2023.\n• We estimate that the Shares requested under the A&R Omnibus Plan will be sufficient to provide awards for\napproximately five years, based on several factors including a planned expansion of the population of colleagues\nreceiving equity awards. See additional information below.\n• When taking into account outstanding awards under all equity plans and the Share reserves proposed for the A&R\nOmnibus Plan, A&R Directors Plan, and A&R ESPP, fully diluted overhang and basic diluted overhang are 5.6% and 5.9%,\nrespectively. See additional information below.\nCitizens Financial Group 91\nCompensation Matters\nAs noted above, based on our historic and anticipated future grant practices, including a planned expansion of the\npopulation of colleagues who receive equity awards as part of their compensation, we estimate that the Shares requested\nunder the A&R Omnibus Plan will be sufficient to provide awards for approximately five years. However, it is possible it\nmay last for a period that is shorter or longer depending on various factors, including: our stock price; the number of\nemployees receiving equity awards; pay mix approved annually by the Compensation and HR Committee; regulatory\nguidance regarding incentive compensation; and any necessary changes in anticipated grant volume in light of competitor\ncompensation levels, recruitment activity, and/or necessary retention efforts.\nPotential Dilutive Impact\nThe below provides a summary of the equity awards outstanding under all of our equity plans as of December 31, 2023.\nThis includes awards under the Original Omnibus Plan, Original Directors Plan, and under plans that strictly govern awards\nassumed in connection with some prior acquisitions (the JMP Group LLC Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan, the\nInvestors Bancorp, Inc. 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, and the Investors Bancorp, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, collectively\nreferred to as the “Acquisition Plans”).\nBelow reflects a calculation of the total diluted effect (\"Overhang\") of all equity plans, including the plans proposed for\napproval as part of Proposals 2, 4 and 5. Overhang has been calculated as follows:\n(a) Original Omnibus Plan - Outstanding full value awards 4,276,472\n(b) Original Directors Plan - Outstanding full value awards 291,522\n(c) Acquisition Plans - Outstanding full value awards 24,172\n(d) Acquisition Plans - Outstanding stock options 608,027\n- Weighted average exercise price of outstanding stock options $31.68\n- Weighted average remaining term of outstanding stock options (years) 1.3\n(e) Total shares outstanding under original plans and Acquisition Plans (a+b+c+d) 5,200,193\n(f) A&R Omnibus Plan - Shares requested (Proposal 4) 13,000,000\n(g) A&R Directors Plan - Shares requested (see Proposal 2) 750,000\n(h) A&R ESPP - Shares requested (see Proposal 5) 8,000,000\n(i) Total shares requested under A&R Omnibus Plan, A&R Directors Plan, and A&R ESPP (f+g+h) 21,750,000\n(j) Total shares outstanding and requested (e+i) 26,950,193\n(k) Common Shares Outstanding as of February 28, 2024 (record date) 458,429,001\nFully Diluted Overhang (j/(j+k))(1) 5.6 %\nBasic Diluted Overhang (j/k) 5.9 %\n(1) In computing the sum of (j) plus (k) for this calculation, 18,168 restricted shares included in both (j) and (k) are only counted once to\nprevent duplication.\n92 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\nHistoric Burn Rate\nThe below table reflects burn rate information regarding awards granted under the Original Omnibus Plan, Original\nDirectors Plan, and the Citizens Financial Group, Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"Original ESPP\") during last\nthree calendar years.\n2023 2022 2021\n(a) Original Omnibus Plan - Time-based restricted stock units 1,998,548 1,633,270 941,850\n(b) Original Omnibus Plan - Performance-based restricted stock units 505,555 163,646 432,284\n(c) Original Omnibus Plan - Total full value awards granted (a+b) 2,504,103 1,796,916 1,374,134\n(d) Original Directors Plan - Total full value awards granted 71,131 47,436 43,236\n(e) Original ESPP - Total shares purchased 912,581 644,365 476,948\n(f) Grand Total Granted (c+d+e) 3,487,815 2,488,717 1,894,318\n(g) Weighted Average Shares of Common Stock Outstanding as of\nApplicable Fiscal Year-End 475,089,384 475,959,815 425,669,451\nUnadjusted Burn Rate (f/g) 0.73% 0.52% 0.45%\n3-Year Average Unadjusted Burn Rate 0.57%\nPlan Governance Features\nWhat We Do\nAdministered by an Independent The A&R Omnibus Plan is administered by the Compensation and HR Committee.\nCommittee Each member of that committee is an independent non-employee director meeting\nthe independence requirements of the NYSE’s listing standards.\nReasonable Share Reserve The proposed Share plan reserve consists of 13.0MM Shares, which has been\ndetermined following thoughtful consideration of all relevant factors. This\nrepresents 2.8% of Shares outstanding as of our record date and a -67.1% reduction\nof the Shares remaining for new grants under our Original Omnibus Plan as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nRequire Shareholder Approval for The proposed Share plan reserve is a fixed number of Shares (subject to adjustment\nAdditional Shares (i.e., No as provided in the terms of the A&R Omnibus Plan), and may not be increased\n“Evergreen” Provisions) without shareholder approval.\nConservative Recycling Provisions Shares withheld to satisfy taxes or used to pay the exercise price for stock options\nor SARs do not become available for future awards. However, when awards granted\nunder the A&R Omnibus Plan expire or are forfeited, cancelled, or are settled in\ncash, the Shares reserved for those awards are generally returned to the Share plan\nreserve and become available for future awards.\nMinimum Vesting Provisions The A&R Omnibus Plan provides that no portion of awards may vest before the one-\nyear anniversary of the grant date. This is subject to a 5% carve-out and does not\nrestrict the Compensation and HR Committee’s ability to provide for accelerated\nvesting in limited circumstances, as detailed below.\nClawback Provision Awards are subject to the Clawback Policy or as otherwise required by law, or any\nadditional Company policy or arrangement, such as the Company’s Accountability\nReview Panel process.\nCitizens Financial Group 93\nCompensation Matters\nWhat We Don’t Do\nNo Discounted Stock Options or Any stock options or SARs granted under the A&R Omnibus Plan must generally\nSARs have an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of a Share on\nthe grant date.\nNo Stock Option or SAR Repricing The A&R Omnibus Plan prohibits the repricing of stock options or SARs without the\napproval of shareholders. This restriction applies to both direct repricing (lowering\nthe exercise price of a stock option or SAR) and indirect repricing (canceling an\noutstanding stock option or SAR to grant a replacement award with a lower exercise\nprice or exchanging for cash).\nNo Dividends on Unvested Awards No dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid on unvested full-value awards.\nInstead, such amounts are accumulated and then paid as the Shares underlying the\naward become vested. There are no dividends or dividend equivalents paid on stock\noptions or SARs.\nNo “Liberal” Change of Control The definition of “change of control” in the plan is not considered “liberal”; a\nDefinition change of control of the Company must actually occur.\nA&R Omnibus Plan Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal features of the A&R Omnibus Plan. This summary is not a complete description\nof all provisions of the A&R Omnibus Plan and is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the plan, which is attached\nto this Proxy Statement as Appendix C.\nPurpose\nThe Compensation and HR Committee and the Board believe that it is in the best interests of the Company and its\nshareholders to maintain a compensation program which includes equity-based awards. The purpose of the A&R Omnibus\nPlan and awards granted under such plan is to attract, retain and motivate employees and other service providers to\ncontribute to our long-term success, thereby furthering the best interests of the Company and our shareholders.\nPlan Duration\nThe A&R Omnibus Plan will become effective as of shareholder approval and will expire on the ten-year anniversary of its\neffective date. The plan will expire sooner if, prior to the end of the ten-year term, the maximum number of Shares\navailable for issuance under the A&R Omnibus Plan has been issued or our Board terminates the plan.\nAuthorized Shares and Award Limits\nSubject to adjustment (as described below) and except for any substitute awards, 13.0MM Shares are proposed to be\nreserved under the A&R Omnibus Plan. Detailed information is provided above in \"Share Plan Reserve\" regarding the size\nof that proposed Share plan reserve and related considerations.\nShares that are subject to outstanding awards that are forfeited, expire, terminate, otherwise lapse or are settled for cash,\nin whole or in part, without the delivery of the Shares will again be available for issuance under the A&R Omnibus Plan.\nShares used to satisfy withholding taxes or to satisfy the exercise price of a stock option or SAR, as well as any Shares\nrepurchased by us on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options will not become available\nfor issuance under the A&R Omnibus Plan. The number of Shares subject to the A&R Omnibus Plan may not be increased\nby the Compensation and HR Committee without shareholder approval.\nSubject to adjustment (as described below), the maximum number of Shares that may be granted to any single individual\nunder the A&R Omnibus Plan during any calendar year is as follows: (i) stock options and SARs that relate to no more than\n1,000,000 Shares; (ii) restricted stock and RSUs that relate to no more than 1,000,000 Shares; (iii) Share-based performance\nawards and other Share-based awards that relate to no more than 1,000,000 Shares; (iv) cash awards that relate to no\nmore than $15,000,000; and (v) cash-based performance awards denominated in cash that relate to no more than\n$15,000,000.\nPlan Administration\nThe A&R Omnibus Plan will be administered by the Compensation and HR Committee, which is comprised entirely of\nnon-employee directors who are independent under the NYSE’s listing standards. The Compensation and HR Committee\nwill have the broad authority to administer the A&R Omnibus Plan, including, but not limited to, designating participants,\n94 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\ndetermining the type or types of awards to be granted to participants and the number of Shares to be covered by such\nawards, establishing the terms and conditions of any awards, including the circumstances around which awards may be\nsettled, exercised in cash or any combination thereof and amending terms or conditions of outstanding awards. The\nCompensation and HR Committee also has the authority to interpret the A&R Omnibus Plan and all award agreements,\ncorrect any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the A&R Omnibus Plan and to make any other\ndetermination or take any other actions deemed necessary or desirable to administer the A&R Omnibus Plan.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may, in its sole discretion, grant awards and administer the A&R Omnibus Plan\nfrom time to time in which case, the Board will have all of the authority and responsibility granted to the Compensation\nand HR Committee.\nTo the extent not inconsistent with applicable law and our Compensation and HR Committee’s charter, our Compensation\nand HR Committee may delegate to a committee of one or more directors or to one or more of our officers the authority to\ngrant awards under the A&R Omnibus Plan. Pursuant to this provision, our Compensation and HR Committee’s current\npractice is to delegate to our Equity Committee of the Board (comprised of our Chief Executive Officer, in his capacity as a\nBoard member) the authority to determine and make individual grants to our employees who are not subject to Section 16\nof the Exchange Act, within certain limits specified in the Equity Committee’s charter.\nEligible Participants\nEmployees, consultants and other individuals who provide services to us or any of our subsidiaries are eligible to be\nselected by the Compensation and HR Committee for an award under the A&R Omnibus Plan. Non-employee directors will\nnot receive awards under the A&R Omnibus Plan; rather, their awards will be granted under the A&R Directors Plan\n(subject to approval by shareholders), which is exclusively dedicated to awards for non-employee directors. As of the\nrecord date, approximately 18,000 individuals would have been eligible to receive awards under the A&R Omnibus Plan.\nTypes of Awards\nThe A&R Omnibus Plan provides for grants of stock options, SARs, restricted stock, RSUs, performance awards, or other\ncash-based awards or share-based awards. The Compensation and HR Committee will determine the terms and conditions\nof awards granted under the A&R Omnibus Plan.\n• Stock Options. Stock options provide the right to purchase Shares at a future date at a specified exercise price, which\nmay not be less than the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant (generally the closing price on the NYSE for\nthat date), except in the case of substitute awards. Stock options granted under the plan will not be exercisable more\nthan ten years from the grant date. No dividends or dividend equivalents will be issued in connection with stock\noptions. The Compensation and HR Committee shall determine when stock options will become exercisable and the\nmethod for payment of the exercise price. Stock options may be granted as an incentive stock options or nonqualified\nstock options, provided that incentive stock options meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Code. Stock options\nwill not provide for the grant of the same number of options as the number of Shares used to pay the exercise price of\nsuch stock options or Shares used to pay withholding taxes.\n• SARs. SARs represent the right to receive the excess of the fair market value (calculated as of the exercise date) of\nshares of our common stock over the exercise price of the award. The exercise price of a SAR may not be less than the\nfair market value of a Share on the date of grant (generally the closing price on the NYSE for that date), except in the\ncase of substitute awards. SARs granted under the plan will not be exercisable more than ten years from the grant date.\nSARs may be tandem SARs that are granted in connection with stock options, or they may be independent of other\nawards. No dividends or dividend equivalents will be issued in connection with SARs. The Compensation and HR\nCommittee shall determine when SARs will become exercisable and the method for payment of the exercise price.\n• Restricted Stock. Restricted stock is an award of Shares that is nontransferable and may be subject to a substantial risk\nof forfeiture until specific conditions established by the Compensation and HR Committee are met. During the period of\nrestriction, participants holding Shares have voting rights with respect to such Shares. Dividends accrued with respect to\nawards of restricted stock will only be distributed as the award becomes vested, in the form determined by the\nCompensation and HR Committee.\n• RSUs. RSUs are awards denominated in Shares and are settled in cash, Shares, or a combination thereof, based on the\nfair market value of the number of vested RSUs at the time of settlement. The terms and conditions of RSUs are\nestablished by the Compensation and HR Committee. Dividends or dividend equivalents accrued with respect to an RSU\naward will only be distributed as the RSUs become settled, in the form determined by the Compensation and HR\nCommittee.\n• Performance Awards. Performance awards may be denominated in cash, Shares or a combination thereof, and are\nsettled in cash, Shares, other awards or any combination thereof following the end of the relevant performance period.\nPerformance awards may be earned upon the satisfaction of performance conditions specified by our Compensation\nCitizens Financial Group 95\nCompensation Matters\nand HR Committee. The Committee and HR Committee may establish such business criteria and other measures of\nperformance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance conditions, which may include quantitative\nand/or qualitative conditions. Performance criteria may be measured on an absolute (e.g., plan or budget), relative\nbasis (e.g., measured against a group of companies, a financial market index or other indices), may be established on a\ncorporate-wide basis or with respect to one or more business units, divisions, subsidiaries, business segments, or\nspecific individuals, may be based on a ratio or separate calculation of any performance criteria and may be made\nrelative to an index or one or more of the performance goals themselves. Performance measures may vary from award\nto award and participant to participant, in the sole discretion of the Compensation and HR Committee. In the event the\nCompensation and HR Committee specifies in an award agreement whether a grant of a performance award would\nentitle the participant to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, any dividends or dividend equivalents accrued with\nrespect to performance awards will only be distributed as the award becomes vested or settled, as applicable, and will\nbe contingent on the achievement of the applicable performance conditions.\n• Other Cash-Based or Share-Based Awards. The Compensation and HR Committee is authorized to also grant other\ncash-based awards (either independently or as an element of or supplement to any other awards) as well as other\nShare-based awards. The terms and conditions of any such awards would be determined by the Compensation and HR\nCommittee.\nAdjustments\nIn the event of any dividend or other distribution, recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger,\nconsolidation, separation, rights offering, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of our Shares or other\nsecurities, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase our Shares or other securities, issuance of our Shares pursuant\nto the anti-dilution provisions of our securities, or other similar corporate transaction or event affecting our Shares, the\nCompensation and HR Committee may determine that an adjustment is appropriate to prevent dilution or enlargement of\nthe benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the A&R Omnibus Plan. In that case, the\nCompensation and HR Committee will, subject to compliance with the Code, adjust equitably any or all of: (i) the number\nand type of Shares or other securities that thereafter may be made the subject of awards, including the aggregate and\nindividual limits of the A&R Omnibus Plan; (ii) the number and type of Shares or other securities subject to outstanding\nawards; and (iii) the grant, purchase or exercise price for any award or, if deemed appropriate, make provision for a cash\npayment to the holder of an outstanding award.\nIn addition, our Compensation and HR Committee is authorized to adjust the terms and conditions of, and the criteria\nincluded in, outstanding awards in recognition of any such events affecting us or our financial statements, or of changes in\napplicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, if the Compensation and HR Committee determines that such\nadjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to\nbe made available under the A&R Omnibus Plan.\nProhibition on Repricing\nSubject to the adjustment provision summarized above, the Compensation and HR Committee may not directly or\nindirectly, through cancellation and exchange for cash or other awards, regrant, or through any other method, reduce, or\nhave the effect of reducing, the exercise price of any award established at the time of grant without approval of our\nshareholders.\nMinimum Vesting Period\nAwards granted under the plan will have a minimum vesting period, as applicable, of one year from the date of grant,\nsubject to a carve-out applicable to 5% of the Share plan reserve. In addition, notwithstanding this restriction, the\nCompensation and HR Committee may provide for earlier vesting upon a participant’s termination by reason of death or\ndisability, or upon a “change of control” (as defined in the A&R Omnibus Plan).\nTermination of Service and Change of Control\nThe Compensation and HR Committee will determine the effect of a termination of employment or service on outstanding\nawards, including whether the awards will vest, become exercisable, settle or be forfeited. The treatment of an award in\nthose circumstances will be set forth in the related award agreement.\nIn the event of a change of control, except as otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, our Compensation\nand HR Committee may provide for:\n• continuation or assumption of outstanding awards under the A&R Omnibus Plan by us (if we are the surviving\ncorporation) or by the surviving corporation or its parent;\n96 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\n• substitution by the surviving corporation or its parent of awards with substantially the same terms and value for such\noutstanding awards under the A&R Omnibus Plan;\n• acceleration of the vesting (including the lapse of any restrictions, with any performance criteria or conditions deemed\nmet at target) or the right to exercise outstanding awards immediately prior to or as of the date of the change of control\nand the expiration of awards not timely exercised by the date determined by our Compensation and HR Committee; or\n• in the case of stock options and SARs, cancellation in consideration of a payment in cash or other consideration equal\nto the intrinsic value of the award. The Compensation and HR Committee may, in its sole discretion, terminate, without\nthe payment of any consideration, any stock options or SARs for which the exercise price is equal to or exceeds the per\nshare value of the consideration to be paid in the change of control transaction.\nUnder the A&R Omnibus Plan, except as otherwise provided in a participant’s award agreement, change of control\ngenerally means the occurrence of one or more of the following events:\n• the acquisition of more than 50% of the combined voting power of our outstanding securities entitled to vote in the\nelection of directors (other than by an employee benefit plan or trust maintained by us);\n• the replacement of the majority of our directors during any consecutive 12-month period;\n• the consummation of a merger or consolidation with another entity (unless our voting securities outstanding\nimmediately before such transaction continue to represent at least 50% of the combined voting power and total fair\nmarket value of the securities of us or the surviving entity, or if applicable, the ultimate parent thereof, outstanding\nimmediately after such transaction); or\n• the sale, lease, exchange or transfer of our assets having an aggregate fair market value of more than 50% of the fair\nmarket value of us and our subsidiaries immediately before such transaction, but only to the extent that in connection\nwith such transaction or within a reasonable period thereafter, our shareholders receive distributions of cash and/or\nassets having a fair market value that is greater than 50% of the fair market value of us and our subsidiaries\nimmediately before such transfer.\nAmendment and Termination\nThe Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the A&R Omnibus Plan, subject to approval by our\nshareholders if required by applicable law or the rules of the NYSE. Our Compensation and HR Committee may also amend,\nalter, suspend, discontinue or terminate, or waive any conditions or rights under any outstanding award. However, subject\nto the adjustment and change of control provisions (each summarized above), any such actions by the Compensation and\nHR Committee with respect to the A&R Omnibus Plan overall or to any award granted under the plan that would materially\nadversely affect the rights of a holder of an outstanding award may not be taken without the holder’s consent, except (i) to\nthe extent that such action is taken to cause the A&R Omnibus Plan to comply with applicable law, stock market or\nexchange rules and regulations, or accounting or tax rules and regulations, or (ii) to impose any “clawback” or recoupment\nprovisions on the awards.\nIn the event of our dissolution or liquidation, each award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such\naction, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation and HR Committee.\nClawback or Cancellation of Awards\nAwards are subject to the Clawback Policy and any additional Company policy or arrangement requiring clawback or\nforfeiture of awards granted under the A&R Omnibus Plan, such as the Company’s Accountability Review Panel process, or\nas otherwise required by law.\nSection 409A\nThe A&R Omnibus Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. If any provision of the A&R Omnibus Plan or\nany term or condition of any award would otherwise frustrate or conflict with this intent, the provision, term or condition\nwill be interpreted and deemed amended. If an award is subject to Section 409A, payments, including those made upon\ntermination, are to be made in accordance with Section 409A and will be treated as separate for the purposes of Section\n409A. If necessary to prevent an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, delivery of cash or shares for\nnonqualified deferred compensation at a time following a plan participant’s termination of employment with the Company\nwill be delayed for six months following such participant’s termination of employment.\nTax Withholding\nWe will have the right to deduct from any payment to be made pursuant to the A&R Omnibus Plan, or to otherwise require,\nprior to the issuance or delivery of any Shares or the payment of any cash thereunder, payment by the participant of, any\nfederal, state or local taxes required by law to be withheld. Upon the vesting of a restricted stock award (or other award\nCitizens Financial Group 97\nCompensation Matters\nthat is taxable upon vesting), or upon making an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, a participant is required to pay\nall required withholding to us. Any statutorily required withholding obligation with regard to any participant may be\nsatisfied, by reducing the number of Shares otherwise deliverable or by delivering Shares already owned.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\nThe following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of certain awards that may be granted under the\nA&R Omnibus Plan. This summary is intended solely for general information and does not take into account various\nconsiderations that may apply in light of individual circumstances, nor does it consider the tax consequences that may\napply to an individual under applicable foreign, state and local tax laws.\n• Stock Options. A participant will not recognize income at the time an option is granted. A participant will recognize\nordinary income (and will be subject to income tax withholding) upon exercise of a nonqualified stock option equal to\nthe excess of the fair market value of the Shares purchased over their exercise price. A participant will not recognize\nincome (except for purposes of the alternative minimum tax) upon the exercise of an incentive stock option. If the\nShares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option are held for at least two years from the date the option was\ngranted and one year from the date of exercise, any gain or loss arising from a subsequent disposition of those Shares\nwill be taxed as long-term capital gain or loss in the year of such disposition. If, however, such Shares are disposed of\nwithin two years from the date the option was granted or within one year from the date of exercise, then in the year of\nsuch disposition, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the lesser of (i) the amount realized upon that\ndisposition and (ii) the excess of the fair market value of those Shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price.\n• SARs. A participant will not recognize income at the time SARs are granted. When SARs are exercised, the participant will\nrecognize ordinary income (and will be subject to income tax withholding) in an amount equal to the aggregate amount\nof any cash received or the fair market value of the Shares, as applicable.\n• Restricted Stock. Unless a participant makes an election to accelerate recognition of income under Section 83(b) of the\nCode, the participant will not recognize income at the time restricted stock is granted. When the restrictions lapse, the\nparticipant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the Shares as of that date. If the participant\nfiles an election under Section 83(b) of the Code within 30 days after the date of grant, the participant will recognize\nordinary income as of the date of grant equal to the fair market value of the Shares on such grant date. Any future\nappreciation in the Shares will be taxable to the participant at capital gains rates. However, if the restricted stock award\nis later forfeited, the participant will not be able to recover the tax previously paid pursuant to their Section 83(b)\nelection.\n• RSUs. A participant does not recognize income at the time an RSU is granted. When the RSUs vest and are settled for\ncash or stock, the participant generally will be required to recognize as ordinary income an amount equal to the cash\nreceived or the fair market value of the Shares, as applicable, on the date of settlement. Any gain or loss recognized\nupon a subsequent sale or exchange of the Shares (if settled in Shares) is treated as capital gain or loss.\n• Performance Awards. A participant does not recognize income at the time a performance award is granted, whether\ndenominated in Shares or cash. Upon settlement following the Compensation and HR Committee’s assessment of\nperformance, the participant generally will be required to recognize as ordinary income equal to the amount of cash\nreceived and/or the fair market value of any Shares received on the date of payment or settlement, as applicable. Any\ngain or loss recognized upon a subsequent sale or exchange of the Shares (if settled in Shares) is treated as capital gain\nor loss.\nTax Consequences to the Company\nTo the extent that a participant recognizes ordinary income in the circumstances described above, we or one of our\nsubsidiaries for which the participant performs services generally will be entitled to a corresponding compensation\ndeduction. However, company deductions also may be limited by Section 162(m) of the Code. Under Section 162(m),\ncompanies may not deduct compensation to a “covered employee” (as defined under Section 162(m)), to the extent that\nthe compensation paid to the covered employee in such year exceeds $1,000,000. As a result, awards granted to a covered\nemployee under the A&R Omnibus Plan generally will not be deductible by the Company to the extent that the total\ncompensation paid to that individual for the applicable year exceeds $1,000,000.\nNew Plan Benefits\nFuture awards under the A&R Omnibus Plan are subject to the discretion of the Compensation and HR Committee and, as a\nresult, at this time it is not possible to determine future awards to be made under the A&R Omnibus Plan. As a reference\npoint, the below table summarizes awards granted under the Original Omnibus Plan and Original Directors Plan during\n98 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\n2023 including the impact of final performance award assessments, as well as Share purchases under the Original ESPP\nduring 2023.\nOriginal Omnibus Plan Original Directors Plan Original ESPP\nDollar Value Number of Dollar Value Number of Dollar Value Number of\nName and Position ($) Units ($) Units ($) Units\nBruce Van Saun 7,658,403 180,649 — — — —\nJohn F.

Although equity-based awards granted under the Investors Plans were converted into Company\nawards and assumed in connection with the Investors acquisition in 2022, we do not intend to grant any awards under the Investors\nPlans. As of December 31, 2023, 393,426 stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $38.35 and 18,509 restricted shares\nwere outstanding under the Investors Plans.\n(2) Excludes securities subject to the JMP Group LLC Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan (“JMP Plan”). Although equity-based\nawards granted under the JMP Plan were converted into Company awards and assumed in connection with the JMP acquisition in 2021,\nwe do not intend to grant any awards under the JMP Plan.

On February 15, 2024, upon the recommendation of the Compensation and HR\nCommittee, the Board approved the Amended and Restated Citizens Financial Group, Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Purchase\nPlan (the “A&R ESPP”) and directed that this proposal be submitted to shareholders for approval. The A&R ESPP will\nbecome effective on July 1, 2024, subject to approval by our shareholders.\nUnder this proposal, we are asking shareholders to approve the A&R ESPP, including a total plan share reserve of 8.0MM\nshares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Shares” for purposes of this Proposal 5), which is 1.7% of common\nstock outstanding as of the record date. It should be noted that 2,991,009 Shares remained available under the Original\nESPP as of December 31, 2023. Any remaining available Shares under the Original ESPP as of the effective date of the A&R\nESPP will carry forward into the A&R ESPP within the total plan reserve of 8.0MM Shares.\nIf shareholders do not approve this proposal, the last offering period of the Original ESPP will occur in the second quarter\nof 2024. If approved, the A&R ESPP will continue to provide an opportunity for eligible colleagues to purchase our Shares\nat a discounted price through payroll deductions. We believe it is important to provide an opportunity for broad-based\nemployee stock ownership through an employee stock purchase plan. When employees become shareholders, they are\nfurther incentivized to work toward our continued success and their long-term interests align with those of shareholders.\nThe A&R ESPP is intended to be an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code.\nShare Plan Reserve\nThe A&R ESPP reflects a proposed Share plan reserve of 8.0MM Shares, which represents approximately 1.7% of our\ncommon stock outstanding as of the record date. We believe this Share plan reserve will last for approximately eight\nyears; however, it is possible it may last for a period that is shorter or longer depending on various factors, including\nemployee participation levels and our stock price.\nIn determining the proposed Share plan reserve for the A&R ESPP, the Committee and HR Committee considered a number\nof factors, including historical purchases under the Original ESPP, Company stock price, and the percentage of our\noutstanding Shares represented by the Share reserve.\nA&R ESPP Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal features of the A&R ESPP. This summary is not a complete description of the\nA&R ESPP and is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the plan, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as\nAppendix D.\nAmendment and Termination\nThe A&R ESPP will become effective on July 1, 2024, subject to approval by our shareholders, and will continue in effect\nuntil all Shares reserved for issuance under the A&R ESPP have been issued to participants, unless terminated earlier by\nthe Board.\nThe Board may alter, suspend, discontinue, terminate or amend the A&R ESPP at any time and for any reason, which may\nbe subject to approval by our shareholders if required by applicable law; provided however, that the Board may not\nCitizens Financial Group 101\nCompensation Matters\nincrease the number of Shares reserved under the A&R ESPP without shareholder approval. In addition, no alteration,\nsuspension, discontinuation, termination or amendment of the A&R ESPP that would adversely affect the rights of any\nparticipant can be made without the consent of such impacted participant.\nPlan Administration\nThe A&R ESPP will be administered by the Compensation and HR Committee, which is comprised entirely of non-employee\ndirectors who are independent under the NYSE’s listing standards. The Compensation and HR Committee will have the\nbroad authority to, among other powers, designate participants, adopt rules and regulations for the administration of the\nA&R ESPP, enforce the terms of the A&R ESPP and construe, interpret and apply the terms of the A&R ESPP.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may, in its sole discretion, administer the A&R ESPP from time to time, in which\ncase, the Board will have all of the authority and responsibility granted to the Compensation and HR Committee.\nEligible Participants\nIn order to further the stated purpose of the A&R ESPP, eligible participants include any of our, or our designated\nsubsidiaries’, full or part time employees whose customary employment is: (1) at least 20 hours per week; and (2) is for\nmore than five months in any calendar year; provided, that such employees also satisfy any additional criteria that the\nCompensation and HR Committee may determine from time to time. Eligible employees become participants in the A&R\nESPP by enrolling through the online system of our stock administrator during the enrollment window preceding the next\noffering period, unless a later date is determined by the Compensation and HR Committee.\nOnce an employee becomes a participant, participation continues for all subsequent offerings in the same manner and to\nthe same extent as the prior offering, until a participant discontinues payroll deductions. Employees who participated in\nthe Original ESPP will continue to participate in the A&R ESPP pursuant to the same elections, until the participant\nmodifies his or her elections in accordance with the plan. As of the record date, approximately 18,000 employees would\nhave been eligible to participate in the A&R ESPP, and approximately 4,000 employees were participating in the Original\nESPP.\nOffering Period\nEach calendar quarter is an offering period, with purchases occurring on the last day of each calendar quarter\n(the “Exercise Date”). The initial offering period under the A&R ESPP is expected to occur July 1, 2024 through\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nPurchase Price\nThe purchase price per share under the A&R ESPP will be equal to 90% of the “fair market value” (as defined in the A&R\nESPP) of a Share on the Exercise Date. The fair market value of a Share will equal the closing price on such date as\nreported by the principal exchange on which such stock is listed and traded; if the Exercise Date occurs on a day that is a\nnon-trading day, the closing price on the last preceding trading day will be used. The closing price of our common stock on\nthe NYSE on the record date was $30.74.\nShares of our common stock purchased under the plan are issued to a brokerage account administered by the stock\nadministrator; participants may not transfer Shares purchased under the plan to a different brokerage account.\nContributions to the Plan\nParticipants authorize contributions to the plan at the time of enrollment, which are made through regular payroll\ndeductions. Between 1% to 10% of base salary and/or commissions may be contributed to the A&R ESPP by participants.\nContribution percentages may not be changed during an offering period, other than in connection with a complete\nwithdrawal from the plan. However, a participant may change his or her contribution percentage for a future offering\nduring the enrollment window for the next occurring offering period.\nGrant of Option\nOn the enrollment date for each offering period, each participant will be granted an option to purchase a number of\nShares on the applicable Exercise Date, subject to the other limitations set forth in the A&R ESPP; provided that, no\nparticipant may purchase more than 5,000 Shares in a single offering period. The participant’s option to purchase Shares\nwill be exercised automatically on the Exercise Date of an offering period by purchasing the maximum number of Shares\nsubject to such option which may be purchased at the purchase price with the funds in the participant’s account, unless\nsuch participant has otherwise withdrawn. Only the participant may exercise the option to purchase Shares pursuant to\nthe A&R ESPP during the participant’s lifetime.\n102 2024 Proxy Statement\nCompensation Matters\nThe stock administrator will hold the Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the option until the Shares are distributed\nto the participant. Shares will be delivered as soon as reasonably practicable upon termination or receipt of such a\nrequest from a participant. Shares received upon exercise of an option will be entitled to receive dividends on the same\nbasis as other outstanding Shares.\nPurchase Limitations\nParticipants may not purchase more than $25,000 worth of Shares (valued at the time each option is granted) in any\ncalendar year under the A&R ESPP and all other employee stock purchase plans maintained by us, our parent or\nsubsidiaries. In addition, if immediately after grant, a participant would own stock possessing 5% or more of the total\ncombined voting power or value of all classes of our stock or stock of our parent or subsidiary, such participant may not\nparticipate in the plan for such offering period.\nIf, on a given Exercise Date, the Shares with respect to which options to be exercised exceed the Shares then available\nunder the Share plan reserve, the Compensation and HR Committee will make a pro-rata allocation of the remaining\nShares that are available for purchase in as uniform a manner as reasonably practicable and equitable. In such event, we\nwill provide notice to each participant on the reduction in number of Shares such participant is permitted to purchase.\nWithdrawing from the Plan\nA participant may withdraw all of the payroll deductions credited to his or her account for the applicable offering period\nby withdrawing from the plan through the online portal provided by the stock administrator. This must occur at least five\ndays prior to the Exercise Date for the applicable offering period. Following this withdrawal, all of the participants'\naccumulated payroll deductions will be paid to the participant as soon as reasonably practicable. A participant may also\nwithdraw from the plan by specifying that their contribution percentage for the next occurring offering period will be 0%,\nin which case they will be withdrawn from the plan after the purchase occurring at the end of the current offering period.\nIn the event of the termination on or before the Exercise Date of a participant, he or she will be deemed to have elected to\nwithdraw from the A&R ESPP and the participant (or in the event of the participant’s death, his or her beneficiary) will\nreceive any funds in the participant’s account as soon as reasonably practicable following the withdrawal. A participant\nwho is on a leave of absence may remain in the A&R ESPP for any offering periods that commenced prior to the beginning\nof such leave of absence. If a participant remains on a leave of absence when the subsequent offering period begins, the\nparticipant will be withdrawn from the A&R ESPP at that time and will need to re-enroll upon return from the leave of\nabsence.\nTransferability\nNeither the amounts credited to a participant’s account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option to purchase\nShares under the A&R ESPP may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way, other than by will\nor the laws of descent and distribution. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition will be\nwithout effect, except that we will treat such act as an election to withdraw funds.\nAdjustments\nIn the event of any merger, reorganization, consolidation, recapitalization, dividend or distribution, stock split, reverse\nstock split, spin-off or similar transaction or other change in corporate structure affecting Shares or their value, the\nCompensation and HR Committee shall make adjustments and other substitutions it deems equitable or appropriate,\nincluding, but not limited to, changes to the number and type of Shares that may be issued under the A&R ESPP, the\nnumber and type of Shares subject to outstanding options, and the purchase price with respect to any outstanding\noptions.\nIn addition, in the event any of the transactions described above, any unusual or nonrecurring transaction or events\naffecting us, or any changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, the Compensation and HR Committee\nis authorized to provide for any of the following, as determined in its sole discretion: (i) either the replacement or\ntermination of outstanding options in exchange for cash; (ii) the assumption or substitution of outstanding options by the\nsuccessor or survivor corporation or parent or subsidiary thereof, if any, with appropriate adjustments; (iii) the adjustment\nin the number and type of Shares subject to outstanding options and/or the terms and condition of outstanding options\nand those that may be granted in the future; (iv) the earlier termination of an offering period and establishment of a new\nExercise Date immediately prior to the corporate transaction; or (v) the termination of all outstanding options. Except as\nexpressly provided in the plan or pursuant to action of the Compensation and HR Committee, no issuance by us of Shares,\nshall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof, shall be made with respect to, the number of Shares subject to an\noption or the grant or Exercise Price of any option.\nCitizens Financial Group 103\nCompensation Matters\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences\nThe following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax relating to Shares of common stock purchased under the A&R\nESPP. This summary is intended solely for general information and does not take into account various considerations that\nmay apply in light of individual circumstances, nor does it consider the tax consequences that may apply to an individual\nunder applicable foreign, state and local tax laws. Further, the rules governing employee stock purchase plans are highly\ntechnical and their application may vary in individual circumstances.\nUnder the Code, we are deemed to grant employees an “option” on the first day of each offering period, and the employee\nis deemed to exercise the option on the last day of the offering period. A participant will not recognize income at the time\nof the grant of an option or upon the exercise date. Also, we may not take a deduction in connection with either the grant\nof an option or the issuance of Shares upon exercise of an option. If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of Shares\nacquired under the plan more than two years after the exercise date (the “required holding period”) or in the event of the\nparticipant’s death, the participant will recognize ordinary income in the year of such sale or disposition equal to the\nlesser of (a) the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Shares on the date of disposition or the participant’s death\nover the amount the participant paid for the Shares, or (b) 10% of the fair market value of the Shares as of the exercise\ndate. In addition, a participant will recognize a capital gain equal to the excess, if any, of the proceeds from the disposition\nover the sum of the purchase price paid by the participant for the Shares and the amount of ordinary income the\nparticipant recognizes. If the proceeds from disposition of the Shares are less than the purchase price paid by the\nparticipant, the participant will be entitled to a long-term capital loss. We are entitled to take a deduction if the\nparticipant dies or disposes of the Shares after the required holding period.\nIf Shares acquired under the A&R ESPP are held less than the required holding period, the excess of the fair market value\nof the Shares as of the exercise date over the price the participant paid for the Shares will be treated as ordinary income\nto the participant at the time of disposition of the Shares. In addition, the participant will recognize capital gain equal to\nthe excess, if any, of the proceeds from sale over the fair market value of the Shares as of the Exercise Date. If the\nproceeds from disposition of the Shares are less than the fair market value of the Shares as of the Exercise Date, the\nparticipant will recognize a capital loss equal to the amount of such difference. We are entitled to take a deduction for\nfederal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income a participant recognizes upon disposition of the\nShares prior to expiration of the required holding period.\nNew Plan Benefits\nParticipation in an employee stock purchase plan is voluntary and each eligible employee will make his or her own\ndecision regarding whether to participate and how much to contribute to the A&R ESPP. It is therefore not possible to\ndetermine the benefits or amounts that will be received in the future by individual employees or groups of employees\nunder the A&R ESPP. Please see Proposal 4 for the New Plan Benefits table, reflecting the number of Shares purchased\nunder the Original ESPP during 2023.\nVoting Standard\nIn order to pass, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual\nMeeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast.\n104 2024 Proxy Statement\nAudit Matters\nPROPOSAL\nRatify the Appointment of our\n6\nIndependent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\nRatify the Appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) as our Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm for the 2024 fiscal year\nThe Board recommends a vote FOR Deloitte\nThe Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte, an independent registered public accounting firm, as the independent\nauditor to perform an integrated audit of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. Deloitte served as our\nindependent auditor for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and has served as our independent auditor since\nbecoming a public company in 2014 and prior to that as a privately held company since 2000.\nThe Audit Committee periodically considers the rotation of the external auditor to ensure independence. In determining\nwhether to retain Deloitte, the Audit Committee considered, among other things, the firm’s independence, objectivity,\nprofessional skepticism, qualifications, expertise and performance on the Company’s audit which is evaluated annually.\nThe Audit Committee has oversight of the audit firm fee negotiation process and is responsible for approving audit fees. It\nalso oversees the rotation of the lead audit partner as mandated by SEC requirements and is directly involved in the\nselection of a new lead audit partner. A new lead audit partner was identified in 2020 and was formally appointed to the\nrole in February 2022.\nThe Board believes that the reappointment of Deloitte as the independent registered public accounting firm for the 2024\nfiscal year is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Neither our Bylaws nor other governing documents\nor law require shareholder ratification of the selection of Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm.\nHowever, the Board believes that obtaining shareholder ratification of the appointment is a sound corporate governance\npractice. If the shareholders do not vote in favor of Deloitte, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment and in\ndoing so, assess the impact of changing the auditor and the appropriate timing for doing so. The Audit Committee may\nretain Deloitte or hire another firm without resubmitting the matter for shareholders to approve. The Audit Committee\nretains the discretion at any time to appoint a different independent auditor.\nRepresentatives of Deloitte are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, available to respond to appropriate\nquestions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire.\nVoting Standard\nIn order to pass, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual\nMeeting. Abstentions will not be counted as votes cast.\nCitizens Financial Group 105\nAudit Matters\nAudit Committee Report\nThe purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight of (i) the integrity of the financial statements of\nthe Company, (ii) the appointment, compensation, retention and evaluation of the qualifications, independence and\nperformance of the Company’s independent external auditor, (iii) the performance of the Company’s internal audit\nfunction, and (iv) compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements.\nThe Audit Committee operates pursuant to a Charter that was last amended and restated by the Board on\nFebruary 16, 2023. As set forth in the Charter, management of the Company is primarily responsible for the adequacy and\neffectiveness of the Company’s financial reporting process, systems of internal accounting and financial controls. Deloitte,\nthe Company’s independent auditor for 2023, is responsible for expressing opinions on the conformity of the Company’s\naudited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and on the effectiveness of the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nIn this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and Deloitte the audited financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte the matters that are required to be discussed under the applicable\nrequirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) standards, including critical audit matters\nthat arose during the year, and SEC and NYSE requirements. Deloitte has provided to the Audit Committee the written\ndisclosures and the PCAOB-required letter regarding the independent accountant’s communications with the Audit\nCommittee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte their independence giving\nconsideration to the provision of audit and non-audit services and fees paid to the firm.\nBased on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited\nfinancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 be included in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nfor filing with the SEC. This report is provided by the following independent directors, who comprise the Audit Committee:\nWendy A. Watson (Chair) Robert Leary\nLee Alexander Terrance J. Lillis\nChristine M. Cumming\nFebruary 14, 2024\nPre-approval of Independent Auditor Services\nThe Audit Committee approves in advance all audit, audit-related, tax, and other services performed by the independent\nauditors. The Audit Committee pre-approves specific categories of services up to pre-established fee thresholds. Unless\nthe type of service has previously been pre-approved, the Audit Committee must approve that specific service before\nthe independent auditors may perform it. In addition, separate approval is required if the amount of fees for any\npre-approved category of service exceeds the fee thresholds established by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee\nmay delegate to the Chair or any independent member of the Audit Committee pre-approval authority with respect to\npermitted services, provided that the member must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next\nscheduled meeting. All fees described below were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.\nIndependent Registered Public Accounting Firm Fees\nThe following table presents fees paid by the Company for services performed by its independent registered public\naccounting firm, Deloitte, and its affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n2023 2022\nAudit fees $ 6,977,000 $ 6,823,000\nAudit-related fees(1) 1,118,279 925,433\nTax fees(2) 562,023 831,840\nAll other fees — —\nTotal $ 8,657,302 $ 8,580,273\n(1) Includes required compliance services associated with several of the Company’s lending programs (e.g., Ginnie Mae, Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (HUD), Uniform Single Attestation Program (USAP) and the Family Education Loan Program) and Statement on Standards\nfor Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 reports for the Company’s cash management and investment management clients, and\nservices provided in conjunction with the Company’s 401k and Pension audits.\n(2) Includes aggregate fees billed for tax services, including tax compliance, planning and consulting.\n106 2024 Proxy Statement\nOther Items\nSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners\nand Management\nThe following tables indicate information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock by:\n• each person whom we know to own beneficially more than 5% of our common stock;\n• each of the directors, nominees and named executive officers individually; and\n• all directors, nominees and executive officers as a group.\nIn accordance with SEC rules, beneficial ownership includes sole or shared voting or investment power with respect to\nsecurities and includes the shares issuable pursuant to restricted stock units and performance stock units that will\nbecome vested within 60 days of the date of determination.

For director nominations\nand proposals of other business, pursuant to Article 2, Section 2.10(a) of our Bylaws, a shareholder’s notice to the\nCorporate Secretary shall set forth as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate for election or\nre-election as a director, the information required pursuant to Article 2, Section 2.10(a)(iii)(A) thereof.\nAny shareholder notice shall also set forth the information required, pursuant to Article 2, Section 2.10(a)(iii)(C) of our\nBylaws, as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or\nproposal is made.

Shareholders receiving the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials can\naccess this Proxy Statement, our fiscal 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our 2023 Annual Review at\nwww.edocumentview.com/CFG. Requests for copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K may also be directed to Investor\nRelations, Citizens Financial Group, Inc., 600 Washington Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut 06901.\nHouseholding of Annual Disclosure Documents\nIn some cases, shareholders holding their shares in a brokerage or bank account who share the same surname and\naddress and have not given contrary instructions receive only one copy of our annual report and proxy statement.

In this context, forward-looking statements\noften address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words\nsuch as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends” “plans,” “goals” “targets,” “initiatives,” “potentially,”\n“probably,” “projects,” “outlook” “guidance” or similar expressions of future conditional verbs such as “may,” “will,”\n“should,” “would,” or “could”. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees,\nuncertain. Uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our\nforward-looking statements. These or other uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different\nfrom those expressed in our forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these\nforward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future\nperformance. More information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in\nthe forward-looking statements can be found under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 as filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nInformation Not Incorporated by Reference\nInformation contained on or accessible through our website at citizensbank.com is not and shall not be deemed to be a\npart of this Proxy Statement by reference or otherwise incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC, except to\nthe extent we specifically incorporate such information by reference.\nBY ORDER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\nRobin S. Elkowitz\nExecutive Vice President,\nDeputy General Counsel and Secretary\nStamford, Connecticut\nMarch 11, 2024\nCitizens Financial Group 111\nQuestions and Answers about the Proxy\nMaterials and the Annual Meeting\nThis proxy statement and proxy card are furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at our Annual\nMeeting, which will be held on April 25, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time at the Company’s headquarters located at One\nCitizens Plaza, Providence, Rhode Island 02903. If circumstances warrant, we may announce alternative arrangements for\nthe Annual Meeting, including changing the meeting format, time, date or location. In the event of such a change, we will\nannounce the decision in advance and provide details on how to participate via a press release available on our website\nand filed with the SEC as additional proxy materials.\nWhy am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card?\nYou have received these proxy materials because our Board of Directors is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the\nAnnual Meeting. This Proxy Statement describes matters on which we would like you to vote at our Annual Meeting. It also\ngives you information on these matters so that you can make an informed decision.\nBecause you own shares of our common stock, our Board of Directors has made this Proxy Statement and proxy card\navailable to you on the Internet, in addition to delivering printed versions of this Proxy Statement and proxy card to\ncertain shareholders by mail.\nWhen you vote by using the Internet or (if you received your proxy card by mail) by signing and returning the proxy card,\nyou appoint each of Bruce Van Saun, Polly N. Klane and Robin S. Elkowitz or any of them (each with full power of\nsubstitution) as your representatives at the Annual Meeting. They will vote your shares at the Annual Meeting as you have\ninstructed them or, if an issue that is not on the proxy card comes up for vote, in accordance with their best judgment.\nThis way, your shares will be voted whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual\nMeeting, we encourage you to vote in advance by using the Internet or (if you received your proxy card by mail) by signing\nand returning your proxy card. If you vote by using the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card.\nWhy did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail instead of a printed set of proxy materials?\nPursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, we are permitted to furnish our proxy materials over the Internet to our\nshareholders by delivering a Notice in the mail. If you received a Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the\nproxy materials in the mail. Instead, the Notice instructs you on how to access and review the proxy statement and annual\nreport over the Internet. The Notice also instructs you on how to electronically access and review all of the important\ninformation contained in this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report and how you may submit your proxy over the\nInternet. If you received a Notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should\nfollow the instructions for requesting these materials contained in the Notice.\nShareholders who receive a printed set of proxy materials will not receive the Notice but may still access our proxy\nmaterials and submit their proxies over the Internet by following the instructions provided on their proxy card.\nWho is entitled to vote?\nHolders of our common stock at the close of business on February 28, 2024 (the record date) are entitled to vote. In\naccordance with Delaware law, a list of shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting will be available for ten days before\nthe meeting at our principal place of business located at One Citizens Plaza, Providence, Rhode Island 02903, between the\nhours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.\nHow many votes is each share of common stock entitled to?\nHolders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share. As of February 28, 2024, there were 458,399,351 shares of our\ncommon stock outstanding and entitled to vote.\n112 2024 Proxy Statement\nQuestions and Answers about the Proxy Materials and the Annual Meeting\nWhat is the difference between a shareholder of record and a “street name” holder?\nMany of our shareholders hold their shares through a broker, bank or other intermediary rather than directly in their own\nname. As summarized below, there are some differences between shares held of record and those owned beneficially.\nShareholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company’s transfer agent,\nComputershare, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the shareholder of record, and these proxy materials are\nbeing sent directly to you by the Company. As the shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy\ndirectly to certain officers of Citizens Financial Group, Inc. or to vote at the Annual Meeting. The Company has enclosed or\nsent a proxy card for you to use. You may also vote by using the Internet or by telephone, as described below under the\nheading “How do I vote?”.\nBeneficial Owner or “Street Name” Holder. If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or other intermediary, like\nmany of our shareholders, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, and these proxy\nmaterials were forwarded to you by that organization. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker,\nbank or other intermediary how to vote your shares, and you are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting.\nIf you do not wish to vote at the Annual Meeting, or you will not be attending, you may vote by proxy. You may vote by\nproxy by completing, signing and returning the voting instruction form or by using the Internet or by telephone, as\ndescribed below under the heading “How do I vote?”. The method you use to vote will not limit your right to vote at the\nAnnual Meeting if you decide to attend the meeting.\nHow do I vote?\nAs described below, shareholders of record may vote by using the Internet, by telephone, or (if you received a proxy card\nby mail) by mail. Shareholders also may attend the meeting and vote. If you hold shares in street name through a bank or\nbroker or other intermediary, please refer to your proxy card, Notice or other information forwarded by your bank or\nbroker to see which voting options are available to you.\n• You may vote by using the Internet. The address of the website for Internet voting can be found on your proxy card or\nNotice. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 24, 2024.\nEasy-to-follow instructions allow you to vote your shares and confirm that your instructions have been properly\nrecorded. If you plan to vote your shares at the meeting, please see below for further instructions.\n• You may vote by telephone. Dial the number listed on your proxy card, Notice or other information forwarded by your\nbank or broker. You will need the control number included on your proxy card, Notice or other information forwarded\nby your bank or broker.\n• You may vote by mail. If you received a proxy card by mail and choose to vote by mail, simply mark your proxy card,\ndate and sign it, and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided.\n• You may vote at the meeting. Shareholders may also attend the meeting and vote.\nWhat if I change my mind after I return my proxy?\nYou may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the polls close at the Annual Meeting. You may do\nthis by:\n• submitting a subsequent proxy by using the Internet, telephone or by mail with a later date;\n• sending written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary, Citizens Financial Group, Inc., 600 Washington\nBoulevard, Stamford, Connecticut 06901; or\n• voting at the Annual Meeting.\nIf you hold shares through a bank, broker or other intermediary, please refer to your proxy card, Notice or other\ninformation forwarded by your bank, broker or other intermediary to see how you can revoke your proxy and change\nyour vote.\nAttendance at the meeting will not by itself revoke a proxy.\nHow many votes do you need to hold the Annual Meeting?\nThe presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the total voting power of all outstanding securities\nentitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum. If a quorum is present, we can hold the Annual Meeting\nand conduct business.\nCitizens Financial Group 113\nQuestions and Answers about the Proxy Materials and the Annual Meeting\nOn what items am I voting?\nYou are being asked to vote on six items:\n1. the election of each of the thirteen director nominees nominated by the Board and named in the proxy statement to\nserve until the 2025 annual meeting or until their successors are duly elected and qualified;\n2. approve the Amended & Restated 2014 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan to provide the Company with the\ncontinued ability to grant non-employee directors equity-based compensation following the upcoming expiration of\nthe current plan;\n3. advisory vote to approve the Company’s executive compensation, commonly referred to as a “say-on- pay” vote;\n4. approve the Amended & Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan to provide the Company with the continued ability to\ngrant employees equity-based awards following the upcoming expiration of the current plan;\n5. approve the Amended & Restated 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to provide the Company with the continued\nability to allow employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through an employee stock purchase\nplan following the upcoming expiration of the current plan; and\n6. ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the\n2024 fiscal year.\nNo cumulative voting rights are authorized, and dissenters’ rights are not applicable to these matters.\nHow does the board of directors recommend that I vote?\nThe Board recommends that you vote as follows:\n1. FOR the thirteen director nominees;\n2. FOR the approval of the Amended & Restated 2014 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan;\n3. FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the Company’s executive compensation;\n4. FOR the approval of the Amended & Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan;\n5. FOR the approval of the Amended & Restated 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan; and\n6. FOR the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm.\nHow may I vote in the election of directors, and how many votes must the nominees receive to be elected?\nWith respect to the election of directors, you may:\n• vote FOR the thirteen nominees for director;\n• vote FOR any of the nominees for director and vote AGAINST or ABSTAIN from voting on the other nominees for director;\n• vote AGAINST the thirteen nominees for director; or\n• ABSTAIN from voting on all of the nominees for director.\nOur Bylaws provide for the election of directors by an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting\nby the shareholders who are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote in an uncontested election. This means\neach of the thirteen individuals nominated for election to the Board of Directors must receive more votes cast “FOR” than\n“AGAINST” (among votes properly cast, electronically or by proxy) to be elected. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not\nconsidered votes cast for the foregoing purpose and will have no effect on the election of nominees. If the election of\ndirectors is a contested election, then the directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast.\nWhat happens if a nominee does not receive a majority of “FOR” votes?\nIf a nominee does not receive a majority of “FOR” votes, he or she shall tender to the Board, via the Chair of the\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee, his or her resignation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee will consider the resignation and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the\ntendered resignation no later than 60 days following the date of the Annual Meeting in accordance with the specific\nrequirements outlined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\nWhat happens if a nominee is unable to stand for election?\nIf a nominee is unable to stand for election, the Board may either:\n114 2024 Proxy Statement\nQuestions and Answers about the Proxy Materials and the Annual Meeting\n• reduce the number of directors that serve on the Board; or\n• designate a substitute nominee.\nIf the Board designates a substitute nominee, shares represented by proxies voted for the nominee who is unable to stand\nfor election will be voted for the substitute nominee.\nHow may I cast my vote for the proposal to approve the Amended & Restated 2014 Non-Employee Directors Compensation\nPlan, and how many votes must this proposal receive in order to pass?\nWith respect to this proposal, you may:\n• vote FOR the approval of the Amended & Restated 2014 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan;\n• vote AGAINST the approval of the Amended & Restated 2014 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan; or\n• ABSTAIN from voting on the proposal.\nIn order to pass, the proposal must receive an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting.\nAbstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose and will have no effect.\nHow may I cast my advisory vote for the proposal to approve the Company’s executive compensation?\nWith respect to this proposal, you may:\n• vote FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the Company’s executive compensation;\n• vote AGAINST the approval, on an advisory basis, of the Company’s executive compensation; or\n• ABSTAIN from voting on the proposal.\nIn order to pass, the proposal must receive an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. In\naccordance with applicable law, this vote is “advisory,” meaning it will serve as a recommendation to the Board but will\nnot be binding. The Compensation and HR Committee will carefully consider the outcome of this vote when determining\nfuture executive compensation arrangements. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the\nforegoing purpose and will have no effect.\nHow may I cast my vote for the proposal to approve the Amended & Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan, and how many\nvotes must this proposal receive in order to pass?\nWith respect to this proposal, you may:\n• vote FOR the approval of the Amended & Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan;\n• vote AGAINST the approval of the Amended & Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan; or\n• ABSTAIN from voting on the proposal.\nIn order to pass, the proposal must receive an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting.\nAbstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose and will have no effect.\nHow may I cast my vote for the proposal to approve the Amended & Restated 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and how\nmany votes must this proposal receive in order to pass?\nWith respect to this proposal, you may:\n• vote FOR the approval of the Amended & Restated 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan;\n• vote AGAINST the approval of the Amended & Restated 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan; or\n• ABSTAIN from voting on the proposal.\nIn order to pass, the proposal must receive an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting.\nAbstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast for the foregoing purpose and will have no effect.\nHow may I vote for the proposal to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, and how\nmany votes must this proposal receive to pass?\nWith respect to this proposal, you may:\n• vote FOR the ratification of the accounting firm;\n• vote AGAINST the ratification of the accounting firm; or\nCitizens Financial Group 115\nQuestions and Answers about the Proxy Materials and the Annual Meeting\n• ABSTAIN from voting on the proposal.\nIn order to pass, the proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting.\nAbstentions will not be counted as votes cast.\nWhat happens if I sign and return my proxy card but do not provide voting instructions?\nIf you return a signed card but do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted as follows:\n1. FOR the thirteen director nominees;\n2. FOR the approval of the Amended & Restated 2014 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan;\n3. FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the Company’s executive compensation;\n4. FOR the approval of the Amended & Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan;\n5. FOR the approval of the Amended & Restated 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan; and\n6. FOR the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm.\nWill my shares be voted if I do not vote by using the Internet, telephone or by signing and returning my proxy card?\nIf you do not vote by using the Internet, telephone or (if you received a proxy card by mail) by signing and returning your\nproxy card, then your shares will not be voted and will not count in deciding the matters presented for shareholder\nconsideration at the Annual Meeting.\nIf your shares are held in street name through a bank or broker or other intermediary and you do not provide voting\ninstructions before the Annual Meeting, your bank or broker may vote your shares under certain limited circumstances in\naccordance with the NYSE rules that govern banks and brokers. These circumstances include voting your shares on\n“routine matters,” such as the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accountants described\nin this Proxy Statement. With respect to the proposal to ratify the appointment of our independent registered public\naccounting firm, if you do not vote your shares, your bank or broker may vote your shares on your behalf or leave your\nshares unvoted.\nThe election of directors, the advisory vote to approve the Company’s executive compensation, and the votes to approve\nthe Amended & Restated 2014 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan, Amended & Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive\nPlan and Amended & Restated 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, are not considered routine matters under the NYSE\nrules relating to voting by banks and brokers. When a proposal is not a routine matter and the brokerage firm has not\nreceived voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares with respect to that proposal, the brokerage firm\ncannot vote the shares on that proposal. This is called a “broker non-vote.” Broker non-votes that are represented at the\nAnnual Meeting will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum, but not for determining the number of shares\nvoted for or against the non-routine matter.\nWe encourage you to provide instructions to your bank or brokerage firm by voting your proxy. This action ensures your\nshares will be voted at the meeting in accordance with your wishes.\nWho bears the cost of the proxy materials?\nThe Company pays for preparing, printing and mailing this Proxy Statement, the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the\n2023 Annual Review. Officers and employees of the Company may solicit the return of proxies but will not receive\nadditional compensation for those efforts. The Company will request that brokers, banks, custodians, nominees and other\nfiduciaries send proxy materials to all beneficial owners and upon request will reimburse them for their expenses.\nSolicitation may be made by mail, telephone or other means.\nCan I receive future proxy materials and annual reports electronically?\nYes. Instead of receiving future paper copies in the mail, you can elect to receive our future annual reports and proxy\nmaterials electronically. Opting to receive your proxy materials electronically will save us the cost of producing and\nmailing documents to your home or business and will reduce the environmental impact of our annual meetings. If you are\na shareholder of record and wish to enroll in the electronic proxy delivery service for future meetings, you may do so by\ngoing to the website provided on your proxy card and following the prompts.\n116 2024 Proxy Statement\nAppendix A—Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nand Reconciliations\nThis document contains non-GAAP financial measures denoted as “Underlying” results. Underlying results for any given\nreporting period exclude certain items that may occur in that period which management does not consider indicative of\nour on-going financial performance. Where there is a reference to Underlying results in that paragraph, all measures that\nfollow are on the same basis, when applicable. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information\nto investors because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating\ndecisions. In addition, we believe our Underlying results in any given reporting period reflect our on-going financial\nperformance in that period and, accordingly, are useful to consider in addition to our GAAP financial results. We further\nbelieve the presentation of Underlying results increases comparability of period-to-period results.\nThe following reconciliation tables provide computations and more information on the computation of our non-GAAP\nfinancial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nOther companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that may be calculated differently from the way we\ncalculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used\nby such companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP financial measures, but to\nconsider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as\nanalytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results reported under GAAP.\nNon-GAAP financial measures and

Restricted Stock and RSUs. The Committee is authorized to grant Awards of Restricted Stock and RSUs to\nParticipants with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions, in either case not\ninconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine:\n(a) Subject to Section 12(i), a Participant’s electronic account hosted by the stock plan administrator shall specify the\nvesting schedule and, with respect to RSUs, the delivery schedule (which may include deferred delivery later than the\nvesting date). Shares of Restricted Stock and RSUs shall be subject to the rights and restrictions set forth in the applicable\nAward Agreement as the Committee may deem appropriate.\n(b) The Committee shall specify in the applicable Award Agreement that any or all dividends, dividend equivalents or\nother distributions, as applicable, paid on Awards of Restricted Stock or RSUs prior to vesting or settlement, as applicable,\nbe paid either in cash or in additional Shares and shall provide that such amounts will only be distributed if the related\nRestricted Stock or RSUs become vested or settled, as applicable; provided, further, that dividends, dividend equivalents or\nother distributions, as applicable, on Awards of Restricted Stock and RSUs with restrictions that lapse as a result of the\nachievement of performance conditions shall be deferred until and paid contingent upon the achievement of the\napplicable performance conditions.\nCitizens Financial Group 135\nAppendix C — Amended & Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan\n(c) Any Share of Restricted Stock granted under the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may\ndeem appropriate, including book-entry registration or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates.

In\naddition, the Committee may specify that any other Award shall constitute a Performance Award by conditioning the right\nof a Participant to exercise the Award or have it settled, and the timing thereof, upon achievement or satisfaction of such\nperformance conditions as may be specified by the Committee. The Committee may use such business criteria and other\nmeasures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance conditions, which may include\nquantitative performance conditions and/or qualitative performance conditions, as determined in the Committee’s\ndiscretion. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the performance goals to be achieved during any Performance Period,\nthe length of any Performance Period, and the amount of any Performance Award granted shall be determined by\nthe Committee.\n(b) Performance criteria may be measured on an absolute (e.g., plan or budget) or relative basis, may be established\non a corporate-wide basis or with respect to one or more business units, divisions, subsidiaries, business segments, or\nspecific individuals, may be based on a ratio or separate calculation of any performance criteria and may be made relative\nto an index or one or more of the performance goals themselves. Relative performance may be measured against a group\nof peer companies, a financial market index or other acceptable objective and quantifiable indices, subject to Applicable\nLaw. If the Committee determines that a change in the business, operations, corporate structure or capital structure of the\nCompany, or the manner in which the Company conducts its business, or other events or circumstances render the\nperformance objectives unsuitable, the Committee may modify the performance objectives or the related minimum\nacceptable level of achievement, in whole or in part, as the Committee deems appropriate and equitable. Performance\nmeasures may vary from Performance Award to Performance Award and from Participant to Participant, and may be\nestablished on a stand-alone basis, in tandem or in the alternative. The Committee shall have the power to impose such\nother restrictions on Awards as it may deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that such Awards satisfy all requirements\nof any Applicable Law or accounting rules and regulations.\n(c) Settlement of Performance Awards shall be in cash, Shares, other Awards, other property, net settlement, or any\ncombination thereof, as determined in the discretion of the Committee. The Committee shall specify the circumstances in\nwhich, and the extent to which, Performance Awards shall be paid or forfeited in the event of a Participant’s Termination\nof Service.\n(d) The Committee shall specify in the applicable Award Agreement whether the Performance Award entitles the\nparticipant to receive dividends, dividend equivalents, or other distributions. If so, the Committee shall specify in the\napplicable Award Agreement that any or all dividends, dividend equivalents or other distributions, as applicable, be paid\neither in cash or in additional Shares and must provide that such dividends or dividend equivalents will only be\ndistributed if the related Performance Awards vests or is settled, as applicable; provided, further, that any dividends,\ndividend equivalents or other distributions, as applicable, shall be deferred until and paid contingent upon the\nachievement of the applicable performance conditions.\n(e) Performance Awards shall be settled only after the end of the relevant Performance Period. The Committee\nmay, in its discretion, increase or reduce the amount of a settlement otherwise to be made in connection with a\nPerformance Award.\n136 2024 Proxy Statement\nAppendix C — Amended & Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nSection 10.

Effect of Termination of Service or a Change of Control on Awards.\n(a) The Committee may provide, by rule or regulation or in any applicable Award Agreement, or may determine in any\nindividual case, the circumstances in which, and the extent to which, an Award may be exercised, settled, vested, paid or\nforfeited in the event of the Participant’s Termination of Service prior to the end of a Performance Period or vesting,\nexercise or settlement of such Award.\n(b) In the event of a Change of Control, except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, the Committee may\nprovide for: (i) continuation or assumption of such outstanding Awards under the Plan by the Company (if it is the surviving\ncorporation) or by the surviving corporation or its parent; (ii) substitution by the surviving corporation or its parent of\nawards with substantially the same terms and value for such outstanding Awards (in the case of an Option or SAR Award,\nthe Intrinsic Value at grant of such Substitute Award shall equal the Intrinsic Value of the Award); (iii) acceleration of the\nvesting (including the lapse of any restrictions, with any performance criteria or other performance conditions deemed\nmet at target) or right to exercise such outstanding Awards immediately prior to or as of the date of the Change of Control,\nand the expiration of such outstanding Awards to the extent not timely exercised by the date of the Change of Control or\nother date thereafter designated by the Committee; or (iv) in the case of an Option or SAR Award, cancellation in\nconsideration of a payment in cash or other consideration to the Participant who holds such Award in an amount equal to\nthe Intrinsic Value of such Award (which may be equal to but not less than zero), which, if in excess of zero, shall be\npayable upon the effective date of such Change of Control.\n(c) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a Change of Control, the Committee may, in its sole discretion,\nterminate any Option or SAR Awards for which the Exercise Price is equal to or exceeds the per Share value of the\nconsideration to be paid in the Change of Control transaction without payment of consideration therefor.\nSection 12.

Awards\ngranted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards, or in addition to or in tandem with awards granted under any other\nplan of the Company, may be granted either at the same time as or at a different time from the grant of such other Awards\nor awards.\n(c) Subject to the terms of the Plan, payments or transfers to be made by the Company upon the grant, exercise or\nsettlement of an Award may be made in the form of cash, Shares, other Awards, other property, net settlement, or any\ncombination thereof, as determined by the Committee in its discretion at the time of grant, and may be made in a single\npayment or transfer, in installments or on a deferred basis, in each case in accordance with rules and procedures\nestablished by the Committee and Applicable Law. Such rules and procedures may include provisions for the payment or\ncrediting of reasonable interest on installment or deferred payments or the grant or crediting of dividend equivalents in\nrespect of installment or deferred payments.\n(d) Except as may be permitted by the Committee (except with respect to Incentive Stock Options) or as specifically\nprovided in an Award Agreement, (i) no Award and no right under any Award shall be assignable, alienable, saleable or\ntransferable by a Participant otherwise than by will or pursuant to Section 12(e) and (ii) during a Participant’s lifetime, each\nAward, and each right under any Award, shall be exercisable only by such Participant or, if permissible under Applicable\nLaw, by such Participant’s guardian or legal representative.

Notwithstanding\nany provision herein to the contrary, 5% of the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan shall not\nbe subject to the minimum vesting period described in the preceding sentence.\nSection 13. Amendments and Terminations.\n(a) Amendment or Termination of the Plan. Except to the extent prohibited by Applicable Law and unless otherwise\nexpressly provided in the Plan, the Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan or any portion\nthereof at any time; provided, however, that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation or termination\nshall be made without (i) shareholder approval if such approval is required by Applicable Law (including the rules of the\nstock market or exchange, if any, on which the Shares are principally quoted or traded) or (ii) subject to Section 5(c) and\nSection 11, the consent of the affected Participant, if such action would materially adversely affect the rights of such\nParticipant under any outstanding Award, except (x) to the extent any such amendment, alteration, suspension,\ndiscontinuance or termination is made to cause the Plan to comply with Applicable Law or accounting rules and\nregulations or (y) to impose any “clawback” or recoupment provisions on any Awards in accordance with Section 17.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, the Committee may amend the Plan, or create sub-plans, in such\nmanner as may be necessary to enable the Plan to achieve its stated purposes in any jurisdiction in a tax-efficient manner\nand in compliance with local rules and regulations.\n(b) Dissolution or Liquidation.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in Section 5(c), no action shall directly or\nindirectly, through cancellation and exchange for cash or other Awards, regrant, or any other method, reduce, or have the\neffect of reducing, Exercise Price of any Award established at the time of grant thereof without approval of the Company’s\nshareholders.\n138 2024 Proxy Statement\nAppendix C — Amended & Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nSection 14. Miscellaneous.\n(a) No Employee, Consultant, Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the\nPlan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of employees, Participants or holders or Beneficiaries of\nAwards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each recipient. Any\nAward granted under the Plan shall be a one-time Award and does not constitute a promise of future grants. The Company,\nin its sole discretion, maintains the right to make available future grants under the Plan.\n(b) The grant of an Award does not, and shall not be construed as, giving a Participant the right to be retained in the\nemploy of, or to continue to provide services to, the Company or any Subsidiary. The receipt of any Award under the Plan is\nnot intended to confer any rights on the receiving Participant except as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement.\n(c) Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or continuing in effect other or\nadditional compensation arrangements, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in\nspecific cases.\n(d) The Company shall have the right to deduct from any payment to be made pursuant to the Plan, or to otherwise\nrequire, prior to the issuance or delivery of any Shares or the payment of any cash thereunder, payment by the Participant\nof, any federal, state or local taxes required by law to be withheld. Upon the vesting of Restricted Stock (or other Award\nthat is taxable upon vesting), or upon making an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, a Participant shall pay all\nrequired withholding to the Company. Any statutorily required withholding obligation with regard to any Participant may\nbe satisfied, by reducing the number of Shares otherwise deliverable or by delivering Shares already owned. The Company\nmay round up to a whole number of Shares required to satisfy required withholding obligations, in which case the value of\nthe fractional share representing the value over withheld shall be paid in cash to the Participant.\n(e) If any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or\nunenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any Person or Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any\nApplicable Law, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to Applicable Law, or if it cannot be so\nconstrued or deemed amended without, in the sole determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the\nPlan or the Award Agreement, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, Person or Award, and the remainder\nof the Plan and any such Award Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n(f) Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a\nfiduciary relationship between the Company and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires\na right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any\nunsecured general creditor of the Company.\n(g) No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall\ndetermine whether cash or other securities shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares, or whether such\nfractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.\n(h) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if authorized but previously unissued Shares are\nissued under the Plan, such Shares shall not be issued for a consideration that is less than permitted under applicable law.\nSection 15. Effective Date of the Plan. The Plan shall be effective as of April 25, 2024, subject to approval of the Plan by the\nCompany’s shareholders.\nSection 16. Term of the Plan.

However, unless otherwise expressly\nprovided in the Plan or in an applicable Award Agreement, any Award theretofore granted may extend beyond such date,\nand the authority of the Committee to amend, alter, adjust, suspend, discontinue or terminate any such Award, or to waive\nany conditions or rights under any such Award, and the authority of the Board to amend the Plan, shall extend beyond\nsuch date.\nSection 17. Cancellation or “Clawback” of Awards. The Committee, or a delegate thereof, shall have full authority to\nenforce the Citizens Financial Group, Inc. Clawback Policy (the “Clawback Policy”) with respect to any Award to which the\nClawback Policy applies as well as to enforce any additional Company policy or arrangement requiring clawback or\nforfeiture of Awards granted under this Plan, including as a result of the Accountability Review Panel Procedure, or as\notherwise required under Applicable Law. For the sake of clarity, such enforcement may require the forfeiture of unvested\nawards or in the case of clawback, the cancellation or reimbursement of any Awards granted to a Participant or any Shares\nissued or cash received upon vesting, exercise or settlement of any such Awards or sale of Shares underlying such Awards.\nCitizens Financial Group 139\nAppendix C — Amended & Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nSection 18. Section 409A of the Code. Although the Company does not guarantee to a Participant the particular tax\ntreatment of any Award, the Plan and all Awards thereunder are intended to comply with or be exempt from the\nrequirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and the provisions of the Plan and any Award\nAgreement shall be interpreted in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan shall\nbe operated accordingly. If any provision of the Plan or any term or condition of any Award would otherwise frustrate or\nconflict with this intent, the provision, term or condition shall be interpreted and deemed amended so as to avoid this\nconflict. Notwithstanding anything else in the Plan, if the Board or Committee considers a Participant to be a “specified\nemployee” under Section 409A of the Code at the time of such Participant’s “separation from service” (as defined in\nSection 409A of the Code), and the amount thereunder is “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code,\nany distribution that otherwise would be made to such Participant with respect to an Award as a result of such “separation\nfrom service” shall not be made until the date that is six months after such “separation from service,” except to the extent\nthat earlier distribution would not result in such Participant’s incurring interest or additional tax under Section 409A of the\nCode. If the Award includes a “series of installment payments” (within the meaning of Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) of the\nTreasury Regulations), the Participant’s right to the series of installment payments shall be treated as a right to a series of\nseparate payments and not as a right to a single payment and if the Award includes “dividend equivalents” (within the\nmeaning of Section 1.409A-3(e) of the Treasury Regulations), the Participant’s right to the dividend equivalents shall be\ntreated separately from the right to other amounts under the Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the\nCompany be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses that may be incurred by the\nParticipant on account of non-compliance with Section 409A of the Code.\nSection 19. Successors and Assigns. The terms of the Plan shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company\nand any successor entity, including any successor entity contemplated by Section 11.\nSection 20. Governing Law. The Plan and each Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,\nwithout application of the conflicts of law principles thereof, except to the extent Delaware law is preempted by federal\nlaw.\nSection 21. Dispute Resolution.\n(a) Except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company and\neach Participant agree to waive their rights to seek remedies in court, including but not limited to rights to a trial by jury.\nEach Participant hereby irrevocably waives the right to initiate or participate in any class or collective action with respect\nto any claim against the Company or any of its affiliates arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Plan. The\nCompany and each Participant agree that any dispute between or among them and/or their affiliates arising out of,\nrelating to or in connection with this Plan will be resolved in accordance with a confidential two-step dispute resolution\nprocedure involving: (a) Step One: non-binding mediation, and (b) Step Two: binding arbitration under the Federal\nArbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et. seq., or state law, whichever is applicable. Any such mediation or arbitration hereunder shall\nbe under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its then current AAA Employment\nArbitration Rules. No arbitration shall be initiated or take place with respect to a given dispute if the parties have\nsuccessfully achieved a mutually agreed to resolution of the dispute as a result of the Step One mediation. The mediation\nsession(s) and, if necessary, the arbitration hearing shall be held in the city/location selected by the Company in its sole\ndiscretion. The arbitration (if the dispute is not resolved by mediation) will be conducted by a single AAA arbitrator,\nselected by the Company in its sole discretion. Any award rendered by the arbitrator, including with respect to\nresponsibility for AAA charges (including the costs of the mediator and arbitrator), will be final and binding, and judgment\nmay be entered on it in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the unlikely event the AAA refuses to accept jurisdiction\nover a dispute, the Company and each Grantee agree to submit to JAMS mediation and arbitration applying the JAMS\nequivalent of the AAA Employment Arbitration Rules. If AAA and JAMS refuse to accept jurisdiction, the parties may litigate\nin a court of competent jurisdiction.\n(b) If the Company concludes that, but for this provision multiple single plaintiff arbitration claims filed could have\nbeen brought as a class and/or collective action in state or federal court, and AAA’s combined administrative fees for\nthose cases exceed $50,000, then the Company shall have the right to forego the use of AAA.

The\nCompany and each Participant agree that any dispute between or among them and/or their affiliates arising out of,\nrelating to or in connection with this Plan will be resolved in accordance with a confidential two-step dispute resolution\nprocedure involving: (a) Step One: non-binding mediation, and (b) Step Two: binding arbitration under the Federal\nArbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et. seq., or state law, whichever is applicable. Any such mediation or arbitration hereunder shall\nbe under the auspices of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its then current AAA Employment\nArbitration Rules.

In that event, the parties shall\nmeet and confer to select a mutually agreeable arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, then each\nparty shall select five (5) arbitrators to place on a list. Arbitrators placed on the list must be licensed to practice law in any\nstate (or have previously been licensed and have always been and remain in good standing with their respective bar\nassociations) and who have previously served as a neutral arbitrator for at least one dispute involving an employment\nmatter. Each side shall alternate in striking an arbitrator from the list, with the last remaining arbitrator selected to\nadjudicate the matter.
