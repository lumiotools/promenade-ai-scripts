The supplier’s capabilities include the delivery of critical items such as vehicle lifts, fluid installation systems, paint booths, and automotive service accessories. In addition, the Company is looking to collaborate with a specialized custom equipment fabricator within the Ras Al-Khaimah Economic Zone (RAKEZ) to procure tools designed for its operations, including body carts and assembly aids. These potential collaborations underscore Faraday Future’s commitment to leveraging local expertise and resources to enhance operational agility, with an emphasis on efficiency and sustainable supply chain practices. \n\nFF is currently in the quoting stage with key suppliers to finalize equipment procurement. \n\n“Engaging with local suppliers is a crucial part of our strategy to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability,” said Matthias Aydt, Global CEO of Faraday Future. “Our focus on regional partnerships in Ras Al-Khaimah not only supports the local economy but also ensures that our manufacturing processes remain agile and responsive to our growth needs.” \n\nThe Company previously announced a co-investment agreement with Master Investment Group. This collaboration is for the development of the Company's future headquarters in Ras Al-Khaimah. Master Investment Group aims to commence construction in Ras Al-Khaimah by early 2025 and the Company aims to occupy the premises by late 2025 or early 2026. \n\n**ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE**\n\nFaraday Future is the pioneer of the Ultimate AI TechLuxury ultra spire market in the intelligent EV era, and the disruptor of the traditional ultra-luxury car civilization epitomized by Ferrari and Maybach. FF is not just an EV Company, but also a software-driven intelligent internet Company. Ultimately FF aims to become a User Company by offering a shared intelligent mobility ecosystem.

(Nasdaq: FFIE) (“FF”, “Faraday Future”, or “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n**RESULTS FOR FOURTH QUARTER 2022 AND FULL YEAR 2022**\n\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, were $451.0 million compared to $354.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Operating expenses for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022, were $83.9 million compared to $121.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The change in operating expenses for the year was primarily due to the increase in engineering, design, and testing (“ED&T”) costs. The improvement in operating expenses for fourth quarter 2022 in comparison to fourth quarter 2021 is primarily due to timing as significant ED&T costs were incurred in the first 9 months of the year.\n\nNet loss was $552.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net loss of $516.5 million in the prior-year period. The increase is primarily due to the increase in ED&T costs and the increase of changes in fair value measurement of certain notes payable and warrant liabilities measured at fair value in 2022, partially offset by an increase in loss on extinguishment of related party notes payable, notes payable, and vendor payables in trust, net, primarily recorded as part of the conversion of certain notes payables in connection with the closing of the business combination with Property Solutions Acquisition Corp consummated on July 21, 2021, which resulted in a loss of $94.7 million in 2021.\n\nNet loss for the three months ended December 31, 2022, was $153.9 million compared to $84.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to the increase in changes in fair value measurement of certain notes payable and warrant liabilities measured at fair value in 2022 and a gain at settlement of related party notes payable, notes payable and vendor payables in trust, net recorded for forgiveness of the Company’s Payroll Protection Loan principal of $9.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021, with no comparable activity in the current period.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $383.1 million compared to $339.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Capital expenditures were $123.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $6.7 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $966.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Company ended the quarter with approximately $18.5 million in cash and restricted cash. The cash position was $37.5 million, including restricted cash of $2.1 million as of March 3, 2023.\n\n“We have come a long way towards making the FF 91 Futurist available to our customers, and I am proud of the dedication and commitment shown by our team to achieve all major milestones,” stated Xuefeng (“XF”) Chen, Global CEO of Faraday Future. “Securing the necessary funding commitments to begin production and delivery of this vehicle is a major game changer for us.
