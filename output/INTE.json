In this Code, references to the “Company” mean Integral Acquisition Corporation 1 and, in\nappropriate context, the Company’s subsidiaries, if any.\nII. HONEST, ETHICAL AND FAIR CONDUCT\nEach person owes a duty to the Company to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest, fair and candid. Deceit,\ndishonesty and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity. Service to the Company should never be subordinated to personal gain or\nadvantage.\nEach person must:\n• Act with integrity, including being honest and candid while still maintaining the confidentiality of the Company’s information where\nrequired or when in the Company’s interests;\n• Observe all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;\n• Comply with the requirements of applicable accounting and auditing standards, as well as Company policies, in order to maintain a high\nstandard of accuracy and completeness in the Company’s financial records and other business-related information and data;\n• Adhere to a high standard of business ethics and not seek competitive advantage through unlawful or unethical business practices;\n• Deal fairly with the Company’s customers, suppliers, competitors and employees;\n• Refrain from taking advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of\nmaterial facts or any other unfair-dealing practice;\n• Protect the assets of the Company and ensure their proper use;\n• Subject to, and except as permitted by, the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as it may be amended from time\nto time (the “Charter”), not (i) take for themselves corporate or business opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate\nproperty, information or position, (ii) use corporate property, information or position for personal gain or (iii) compete with the Company;\nand\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001850262/000119312521265513/d162934de... 10/31/2021\nEX-14 Page 2of 4\n• Avoid conflicts of interest, wherever possible, except as may be allowed under guidelines or resolutions approved by the Board (or the\nappropriate committee of the Board), as disclosed in the Company’s public filings with the SEC or as permitted by the Charter. Anything\nthat would be a conflict for a person subject to this Code also will be a conflict for a member of his or her immediate family or any other\nclose relative. Examples of conflict of interest situations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• any significant ownership interest in any supplier or customer;\n• any consulting or employment relationship with any supplier or customer;\n• the receipt of any money, non-nominal gifts or excessive entertainment from any entity with which the Company has current or\nprospective business dealings;\n• selling anything to the Company or buying anything from the Company, except on the same terms and conditions as comparable\nofficers or directors are permitted to so purchase or sell;\n• any other financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) involving the\nCompany; and\n• any other circumstance, event, relationship or situation in which the personal interest of a person subject to this Code interferes — or\neven appears to interfere — with the interests of the Company as a whole.\nIII. DISCLOSURE\nThe Company strives to ensure that the contents of and the disclosures in the reports and documents that the Company files with the SEC and\nother public communications shall be full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable in accordance with applicable disclosure standards, including\nstandards of materiality, where appropriate. Each person must:\n• not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or outside the Company,\nincluding to the Company’s independent registered public accountants, governmental regulators, self-regulating organizations and other\ngovernmental officials, as appropriate; and\n• in relation to his or her area of responsibility, properly review and critically analyze proposed disclosure for accuracy and completeness.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company and each subsidiary of the Company (or\npersons performing similar functions), and each other person that typically is involved in the financial reporting of the Company, must familiarize\nhimself or herself with the disclosure requirements applicable to the Company as well as the business and financial operations of the Company.\nEach person must promptly bring to the attention of the Chairperson of the Board (the “Chairperson”) any information he or she may have\nconcerning (a) significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal and/or disclosure controls that could adversely affect the Company’s ability\nto record, process, summarize and report financial data or (b) any fraud that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the\nCompany’s financial reporting, disclosures or internal controls.\nIV. COMPLIANCE\nIt is the Company’s obligation and policy to comply with all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. It is the personal responsibility\nof each person to, and each person must, adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations, including those relating\nto accounting and auditing matters.\nV.

Any person who becomes aware of any existing or potential breach of this Code is required to notify the Chairperson\npromptly. Failure to do so is, in and of itself, a breach of this Code.\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001850262/000119312521265513/d162934de... 10/31/2021\nEX-14 Page 3of 4\nSpecifically, each person must:\n• Notify the Chairperson promptly of any existing or potential violation of this Code; and\n• Not retaliate against any other person for reports of potential violations that are made in good faith.\nThe Company will follow the following procedures in investigating and enforcing this Code and in reporting on this Code:\n• The Board will take all appropriate action to investigate any breaches reported to it; and\n• Upon determination by the Board that a breach has occurred, the Board (by majority decision) will take or authorize such disciplinary or\npreventive action as it deems appropriate, after consultation with the Company’s internal or external legal counsel, up to and including\ndismissal or, in the event of criminal or other serious violations of law, notification of the SEC or other appropriate law enforcement\nauthorities.\nNo person following the above procedure shall, as a result of following such procedure, be subject by the Company or any officer or employee\nthereof to discharge, demotion suspension, threat, harassment or, in any manner, discrimination against such person in terms and conditions of\nemployment.\nVI.

In lieu of filing a Current Report on Form 8-K to report any such\nwaivers or amendments, the Company may provide such information on its website and keep such information on the website for at least 12 months and\ndisclose the website address as well as any intention to provide such disclosures in this manner in its most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA “waiver” means the approval by the Board of a material departure from a provision of this Code. An “implicit waiver” means the Company’s\nfailure to take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a provision of this Code that has been made known to an\nexecutive officer of the Company. An “amendment” means any amendment to this Code other than minor technical, administrative or other\nnon-substantive amendments hereto.\nAll persons should note that it is not the Company’s intention to grant or to permit waivers from the requirements of this Code. The Company\nexpects full compliance with this Code.\nVII.

Unrecorded or “off\nthe books” funds or assets should not be maintained unless permitted by applicable law or regulation. Records should always be retained or destroyed\naccording to the Company’s record retention policies. In accordance with those policies, in the event of litigation or governmental investigation, please\nconsult the Board or the Company’s internal or external legal counsel.\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001850262/000119312521265513/d162934de... 10/31/2021\nEX-14 Page 4of 4\nIX. IMPROPER INFLUENCE ON CONDUCT OF AUDITS\nNo director, officer or employee, or any other person acting under the direction thereof, shall directly or indirectly take any action to coerce,\nmanipulate, mislead or fraudulently influence any public or certified public accountant engaged in the performance of an audit or review of the financial\nstatements of the Company or take any action that such person knows or should know that if successful could result in rendering the Company’s\nfinancial statements materially misleading. Any person who believes such improper influence is being exerted should report such action to such person’s\nsupervisor, or if that is impractical under the circumstances, to any of the Company’s directors.\nTypes of conduct that could constitute improper influence include, but are not limited to, directly or indirectly:\n• Offering or paying bribes or other financial incentives, including future employment or contracts for non-audit services;\n• Providing an auditor with an inaccurate or misleading legal analysis;\n• Threatening to cancel or canceling existing non-audit or audit engagements if the auditor objects to the Company’s accounting;\n• Seeking to have a partner removed from the audit engagement because the partner objects to the Company’s accounting;\n• Blackmailing; and\n• Making physical threats.\nX.

These requirements apply both to Company\nemployees and agents, such as third-party sales representatives, no matter where they are doing business. If you are authorized to engage agents, you are\nresponsible for ensuring they are reputable and for obtaining a written agreement to uphold the Company’s standards in this area.\nXI. VIOLATIONS\nViolation of this Code is grounds for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Such action is in addition to any civil or\ncriminal liability that might be imposed by any court or regulatory agency.\nXII. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES\nAny other policy or procedure set out by the Company in writing or made generally known to employees, officers or directors of the Company\nprior to the effective date hereof or hereafter are separate requirements and remain in full force and effect.\nXIII.INQUIRIES\nAll inquiries and questions in relation to this Code or its applicability to particular people or situations should be addressed to the Chairperson, or\nsuch other compliance officer as shall be designated from time to time by the Board.\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001850262/000119312521265513/d162934de... 10/31/2021"

Life has also become harder for companies that want to raise capital, stay independent, and offer a liquidity event to their shareholders.\n\nI believe that special purpose acquisition companies, or
