(Nasdaq: JSPR) (Jasper), a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on development of briquilimab, a novel antibody therapy targeting c-Kit (CD117) to address mast cell driven diseases such as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU) and asthma, is presenting data from preclinical studies evaluating briquilimab at the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) Annual Scientific Meeting, taking place October 24-28, 2024, in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n“We are pleased to present promising preclinical results from multiple studies at ACAAI this year,” said Wendy Pang, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Research and Translational Medicine. “Both the in-vitro data and the non-human primate data generated in these studies provide further support for the pharmacodynamics of briquilimab, particularly its ability to bind c-Kit and drive mast cell depletion with relatively high potency.”\n\n**Details of the presentations are as follows:**\n\n**Abstract Title:** Briquilimab is Well-Tolerated and Effectively Depletes Tissue Resident Mast Cells in Non-Human Primates**Abstract ID:** 8271**ePoster ID:** R056 **Presentation Date / Time:** Friday, October 25, 2024; 3:45 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. EDT**Location:** Exhibit Hall A\n\n**Abstract Title:** Briquilimab Potently Inhibits Stem Cell Factor (SCF)/c-Kit Signaling, and Mast Cell (MC) Degranulation and Survival**Abstract ID:** 8282**ePoster ID:** R058 **Presentation Date / Time:** Friday, October 25, 2024; 4:15 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. EDT**Location:** Exhibit Hall A\n\n**Abstract Title:** Briquilimab Potently Blocks Stem Cell Factor (SCF)/c-Kit Signaling in Primary Human Mast Cells**Abstract ID:** 8298**ePoster ID:** R059 **Presentation Date / Time:** Friday, October 25, 2024; 4:30 p.m. - 4:45 p.m. EDT**Location:** Exhibit Hall A\n\nCopies of the presentations will be available on the ACAAI website as well as the [Events & News – Events](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eXoO4ovaLfVdV-OgVjrzvLe8jsu7dE5PwqF3J7dgChj9gDBzXjCBHpn2a6BRtXjgCXwYTdd_17sQ8P8wPR8fFuLeIJzM62XxdjaV8UfBZjaQlufjiUZi4za22fT7lnc_n2SfgqYxwZby8Hqm9gVF5w==) page on the Jasper Therapeutics IR website.\n\n**About Briquilimab** Briquilimab is a targeted aglycosylated monoclonal antibody that blocks stem cell factor from binding to the cell-surface receptor c-Kit, also known as CD117, thereby inhibiting signaling through the receptor. This inhibition disrupts the critical survival signal, leading to the depletion of the mast cells via apoptosis which removes the underlying source of the inflammatory response in mast cell driven diseases such as chronic urticaria. Jasper is currently conducting clinical studies of briquilimab as a treatment in patients with CSU or with CIndU and is initiating a clinical study in patients with asthma. Briquilimab is also currently in clinical studies as a treatment for patients with LR-MDS and as a conditioning agent for cell therapies for rare diseases. To date, briquilimab has a demonstrated efficacy and safety profile in more than 160 dosed participants and healthy volunteers, with clinical outcomes in CIndU, and as a conditioning agent in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), Fanconi anemia (FA), and sickle cell disease (SCD).\n\n**About Jasper** Jasper is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing briquilimab, a monoclonal antibody targeting c-Kit (CD117) as a therapeutic for chronic mast and stem cell diseases such as chronic urticaria, asthma and lower to intermediate risk MDS and as a conditioning agent for stem cell transplants for rare diseases such as SCD, FA and SCID. To date, briquilimab has a demonstrated efficacy and safety profile in more than 160 dosed participants and healthy volunteers, with clinical outcomes in CIndU and as a conditioning agent in SCID, AML, MDS, FA, and SCD.
