(the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: STCN) today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. \n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nDue to the previously disclosed application of pushdown accounting, the Company's consolidated financial statements include a black line division between the two distinct periods to indicate the application of two different bases of accounting, which may not be comparable, between the periods presented. The pre-exchange period through April 30, 2023, is referred to as the \"Predecessor\" period. The post-exchange period, May 1, 2023, and onward, includes the impact of pushdown accounting and is referred to as the \"Successor\" period. \n\nAs it relates to the results of operations, while the Successor period and the Predecessor period are distinct reporting periods, the effects of the change of control for financial statement purposes did not have a material impact on the comparability of our results of operations between the periods, unless otherwise noted related to the impact from pushdown accounting. \n\n**Successor** |  **Successor** |  **Successor** |  **Predecessor** |  **Combined-**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**Three Months Ended July 31,** |  **Three Months Ended July 31,** |  **Fiscal Year Ended July 31,** |  **August 1, 2022 to April 30,** |  **Period from August 1, 2022 through July 31,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2023**  \n**(in thousands)**  \nNet revenue  |  $  |  45,868  |  $  |  40,804  |  $  |  174,109  |  $  |  148,283  |  $  |  189,087   \nNet income  |  6,537  |  8,149  |  87,980  |  7,460  |  15,609   \nNet income attributable to common stockholders  |  $  |  6,006  |  $  |  7,612  |  $  |  85,845  |  $  |  5,867  |  $  |  13,480   \nAdjusted EBITDA* |  $  |  4,282  |  $  |  10,560  |  $  |  16,374  |  $  |  17,146  |  $  |  27,706   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin* |  9.3  |  %  |  25.9  |  %  |  9.4  |  %  |  11.6  |  %  |  14.7  |  %   \nNet cash provided by operating activities  |  $  |  6,420  |  $  |  8,523  |  $  |  21,848  |  $  |  9,000  |  $  |  17,523   \nAdditions to property and equipment  |  (1,054  |  )  |  (807  |  )  |  (3,965  |  )  |  (1,311  |  )  |  (2,118  |  )   \nFree cash flow* |  $  |  5,366  |  $  |  7,716  |  $  |  17,883  |  $  |  7,689  |  $  |  15,405   \n  \n* See reconciliations of these non-GAAP measurements to the most directly comparable GAAP measures included in the financial tables.

References herein to the “fiscal year ended July 31, 2023” combine the operational results for the August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 Predecessor period and the May 1 to July 31, 2023 Successor period to enhance the comparability of such information to the current fiscal year. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on the results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. \n\n**Three Months Ended** **July 31 ,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **Fav (Unfav) ($)** |  **% Change**  \n**(unaudited, $ in thousands)**  \nNet revenue  |  $  |  45,868  |  $  |  40,804  |  $  |  5,064  |  12.4  |  %   \nCost of revenue  |  (33,214  |  )  |  (29,749  |  )  |  (3,465  |  )  |  (11.6  |  )%   \nGross profit  |  12,654  |  11,055  |  1,599  |  14.5  |  %   \nGross profit margin  |  27.6  |  %  |  27.1  |  %  |  —  |  50  |  bpts   \nSelling, general and administrative  |  (10,808  |  )  |  (8,523  |  )  |  (2,285  |  )  |  (26.8  |  )%   \nAmortization  |  (893  |  )  |  (911  |  )  |  18  |  2.0  |  %   \nInterest expense  |  (257  |  )  |  (265  |  )  |  8  |  3.0  |  %   \nOther gains, net (including interest income)  |  5,753  |  6,395  |  (642  |  )  |  (10.0  |  )%   \nTotal costs and expenses  |  (39,419  |  )  |  (33,053  |  )  |  (6,366  |  )  |  19.3  |  %   \nIncome before income taxes  |  6,449  |  7,751  |  (1,302  |  )  |  (16.8  |  )%   \nIncome tax benefit  |  88  |  398  |  (310  |  )  |  (77.9  |  )%   \nNet income  |  $  |  6,537  |  $  |  8,149  |  $  |  (1,612  |  )  |  (19.8  |  )%   \n**Fiscal Year Ended** **July 31 ,**  \n---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **Fav (Unfav) ($)** |  **% Change**  \n**(unaudited, $ in thousands)**  \nNet revenue  |  $  |  174,109  |  $  |  189,087  |  $  |  (14,978  |  )  |  (7.9  |  )%   \nCost of revenue  |  (125,616  |  )  |  (137,780  |  )  |  12,164  |  8.8  |  %   \nGross profit  |  48,493  |  51,307  |  (2,814  |  )  |  (5.5  |  )%   \nGross profit margin  |  27.9  |  %  |  27.1  |  %  |  —  |  80  |  bpts   \nSelling, general and administrative  |  (37,478  |  )  |  (41,986  |  )  |  4,508  |  10.7  |  %   \nAmortization  |  (3,554  |  )  |  (911  |  )  |  (2,643  |  )  |  (290.1  |  )%   \nInterest expense  |  (996  |  )  |  (2,853  |  )  |  1,857  |  65.1  |  %   \nOther gains, net (including interest income)  |  14,492  |  11,284  |  3,208  |  28.4  |  %   \nTotal costs and expenses  |  (153,152  |  )  |  (172,246  |  )  |  19,094  |  11.1  |  %   \nIncome before income taxes  |  20,957  |  16,841  |  4,116  |  24.4  |  %   \nIncome tax benefit (expense)  |  67,023  |  (1,232  |  )  |  68,255  |  5540.2  |  %   \nNet income  |  $  |  87,980  |  $  |  15,609  |  $  |  72,371  |  463.6  |  %   \n  \n**Net Revenue**\n\nNet revenue for the fourth quarter increased $5.1 million, or 12.4%, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase in net revenue was primarily driven by higher volumes, favorable pricing mix and new program starts associated with clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets. \n\nNet revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 decreased by approximately $15.0 million, or 7.9%, as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, primarily driven by lower volumes related to clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets, partially offset by new business revenue from new clients in the consumer electronics market. \n\n**Cost of Revenue**\n\nCost of revenue for the fourth quarter increased $3.5 million, or 11.6%, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $2.5 million increase in materials procured on behalf of clients as a result of higher sales volume for clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets. \n\nCost of revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 decreased $12.2 million, or 8.8%, as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, primarily due to a $12.6 million decrease in materials procured on behalf of clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets. \n\n**Gross Profit**\n\nThe Company's gross profit increased by $1.6 million, or 14.5%, as compared to the same period in the prior year, and the Company's gross margin percentage increased by 50 basis points to 27.6%, as compared to 27.1% for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable pricing mix for clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets. \n\nThe Company's gross profit decreased by $2.8 million, or 5.5%, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 primarily due to lower sales volume discussed above. The gross profit percentage for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 increased 80 basis points to 27.9% from 27.1% for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, primarily due to changes in customer sales mix. \n\n**Selling, General and Administrative**\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses for the fourth quarter increased $2.3 million, or 26.8%, as compared to the same period in the prior year. SG&A expenses for ModusLink Corporation (\"Supply Chain\") increased by $1.4 million due to partial recovery of previously reserved bad debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 that did not reoccur in the current year quarter and other miscellaneous expenses, none of which are individually significant. Corporate-level activity increased by $0.9 million, primarily driven by an increase in mergers and acquisition related expenses. \n\nSG&A expenses for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 decreased by approximately $4.5 million or 10.7%, as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, primarily due to Corporate-level activity. Corporate-level activity decreased by $5.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in legal and other professional fees related to the Exchange Transaction which closed in May 2023. This activity was partially offset by an increase in mergers and acquisitions related expenses during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. \n\n**Amortization Expense**\n\nAmortization expense is related to the recognition of intangible assets in connection with the application of pushdown accounting as a result of the Exchange Transaction, which closed on May 1, 2023. Amortization expense for the fourth quarter remained relatively flat as compared to the same period in the prior year. \n\nAmortization expense for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 increased $2.6 million or 290.1% as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The increase is due to a full years' worth of amortization being recognized for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, as compared to only three months' worth of amortization recognized for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. \n\n**Interest Expense**\n\nTotal interest expense for the fourth quarter remained relatively flat as compared to the same period in the prior year. \n\nTotal interest expense for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 decreased $1.9 million or 65.1% as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, primarily due to the cessation of the amortization of the discount on the 7.50% Senior Convertible Note due 2024 (the \"SPHG Note\") as of May 1, 2023, the date of the Exchange Transaction. \n\n**Other Gains, Net (including Interest Income):**\n\nOther gains, net for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $5.8 million and $6.4 million. Other gains, net for the three months ended July 31, 2024 included: (1) $3.3 million interest income, primarily earned on money market funds; (2) $1.3 million grant income; and (3) $0.9 million net gains on investments. Other gains, net for the three months ended July 31, 2023 included: (1) $5.1 million realized gains on the disposition of the Aerojet shares received in the Exchange Transaction, and (2) $0.7 million of interest income received on money market funds. \n\nOther gains, net for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 and the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 were $14.5 million and $11.3 million, respectively. Other gains, net for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 included: (1) $13.7 million interest income, primarily earned on money market funds, (2) $1.4 million grant income, and (3) $0.4 million sublease income. This activity was partially offset by (1) $0.6 million net losses on investments and (2) $0.4 million net unrealized loss on the fair value remeasurement of the SPHG Note. Other gains, net for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 included: (1) $5.1 million realized gains on the disposition of the Aerojet shares received in the Exchange Transaction, (2) $2.3 million gain from proceeds received from the sale of an investment, (3) $1.6 million interest income, primarily earned on money market funds, (4) $1.4 million settlement with a client, and (5) $1.0 million sublease income. This activity was partially offset by $0.5 million unrealized loss on the fair value remeasurement of the SPHG Note. \n\n**Income Tax Benefit (Expense)**\n\nIncome tax benefit for the fourth quarter was $0.1 million, as compared to $0.4 million for the same period in the prior year. The change in income tax benefit for the three months ended July 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to the mix of earnings from our U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. \n\nIncome tax benefit for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 was approximately $67.0 million, as compared to $1.2 million income tax expense for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The favorable change in income tax is due to the Company's release of a portion of its valuation allowance for certain pre-existing Company deferred tax assets. The release resulted in a non-cash adjustment to income tax benefit of $73.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, which increased from the income tax benefit of $71.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to an increase in taxable income that resulted in more NOLs being utilized before their expiration at fiscal year end. \n\n**Net Income**\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter decreased $1.6 million, or 19.8%, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net income is primarily due to unfavorable changes within non-operating expenses, such as the decrease in other gains, net of $0.6 million and $0.3 million unfavorable change in income tax benefit. See above explanations for further details. \n\nNet income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024 increased $72.4 million, or 463.6%, as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The increase in net income is primarily due to the non-cash, significant income tax benefit accounting adjustment booked during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024. See above for further details. \n\n**Additions to Property and Equipment (Capital Expenditures)**\n\nCapital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $1.1 million, or 2.3% of net revenue, as compared to $0.8 million, or 2.0% of net revenue, for the same period in the prior year. Capital expenditures increased to $4.0 million, or 2.3% of net revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, from $2.1 million, or 1.1% of net revenue, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $6.3 million, or 59.5%, for the fourth quarter as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher operating expenses of $3.6 million and lower realized gains of $3.4 million due to the $5.1 million gain on the disposition of the Aerojet shares received in the Exchange Transaction in the prior year period that did not reoccur in the current year quarter, partially offset by higher gross profit of $1.6 million. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $11.3 million, or 40.9%, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, primarily due to lower realized foreign exchange gains of $3.4 million, lower realized gains of $3.2 million due to the $5.1 million gain on the disposition of the Aerojet shares received in the Exchange Transaction in the prior year period that did not reoccur in the current year, and a $2.8 million decrease in gross profit driven by lower sales volume. \n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of July 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $248.6 million and ModusLink Corporation (\"ModusLink\") had readily available borrowing capacity of $11.9 million under its revolving credit facility with Umpqua Bank. \n\nAs of July 31, 2024, total debt outstanding was $12.9 million, which was the fair value of the SPHG Note due September 1, 2024. The SPHG Note matured on September 1, 2024 and the Company paid off the outstanding principal and accrued interest for the SPHG Note upon its maturity. \n\n**About Steel Connect, Inc.**\n\nSteel Connect, Inc. is a holding company whose wholly-owned subsidiary, ModusLink Corporation, serves the supply chain management market. \n\nModusLink is an end-to-end global supply chain solutions and e-commerce provider serving clients in markets such as consumer electronics, telecommunications, computing and storage, software and content, consumer packaged goods, medical devices, retail and luxury, and connected devices.

to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Net Debt, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures, to assess its performance. EBITDA represents earnings before interest income, interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization of intangible assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding net charges related to interest income, interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation, amortization, strategic consulting and other related professional fees, executive severance and employee retention, restructuring and restructuring-related expense, share-based compensation, loss (gain) on sale of long-lived assets, unrealized foreign exchange losses, net, and other non-cash gains, net. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property and equipment, and defines Net Debt as the sum of total debt, excluding reductions for unamortized discounts and issuance costs, less cash and cash equivalents. \n\nWe believe that providing these non-GAAP measurements to investors is useful, as these measures provide important supplemental information of our performance to investors and permit investors and management to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These measures provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period-to-period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operating results of our business. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our Board of Directors, determining a component of certain incentive compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance, determining compliance with certain covenants in the Company's credit facilities, and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our core business. We use Free Cash Flow to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a useful measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of ongoing operations, and similar to the use of Net Debt, assists management with its capital planning and financing considerations. \n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist in providing an enhanced understanding of our underlying operational measures to manage our core businesses, to evaluate performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. Further, we believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies \n\nSome of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA include: \n\n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; \n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; \n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n  * although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and \n  * other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. \n\n\n\nIn addition, Net Debt assumes the Company's cash and cash equivalents can be used to reduce outstanding debt without restriction, while Free Cash Flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and excludes the Company's remaining investing activities and financing activities, including the requirement for principal payments on the Company's outstanding indebtedness. \n\nSee reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures included in the financial tables of this release. \n\n**Net Operating Loss Carryforwards**\n\nThe Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Protective Amendment”) includes provisions designed to protect the tax benefits of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards by preventing certain transfers of our securities that could result in an \"ownership change\" (as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code). The Protective Amendment generally restricts any direct or indirect transfer if the effect would be to (i) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder from less than 4.99 percent to 4.99 percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding or (ii) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder owning or deemed to own 4.99 percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding. Pursuant to the Protective Amendment, any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of the Protective Amendment would be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee (or, in the case of an indirect transfer, the ownership of the direct owner of the shares would terminate simultaneously with the transfer), and the purported transferee (or in the case of any indirect transfer, the direct owner) would not be recognized as the owner of the shares owned in violation of the Protective Amendment (the \"excess stock\") for any purpose, including for purposes of voting and receiving dividends or other distributions in respect of such shares, or in the case of options, receiving shares in respect of their exercise. For further discussion of the Protective Amendment, please see the Company's filings with the SEC. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: STCN) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended April 30, 2024. \n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nDuring the current quarter, the Company booked a $71.5 million non-cash accounting adjustment to net income as a result of a release of a portion of its valuation allowance for certain pre-existing Company deferred tax assets. The release resulted in a one-time non-cash adjustment to income tax benefit of $71.5 million for the quarter ended April 30, 2024. This adjustment to net income has no cash impact and is not expected to reoccur. \n\nDue to the previously disclosed application of pushdown accounting, the Company's consolidated financial statements include a black line division between the two distinct periods to indicate the application of two different bases of accounting, which may not be comparable, between the periods presented. The pre-exchange period through April 30, 2023, is referred to as the \"Predecessor\" period. The post-exchange period, May 1, 2023, and onward, includes the impact of pushdown accounting and is referred to as the \"Successor\" period. \n\nAs it relates to the results of operations, while the Successor period and the Predecessor period are distinct reporting periods, the effects of the change of control for financial statement purposes did not have a material impact on the comparability of our results of operations between the periods, unless otherwise noted related to the impact from pushdown accounting. \n\n**Successor** |  **Predecessor** |  **Successor** |  **Predecessor**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Three Months Ended April 30,** |  **Three Months Ended April 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended April 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended April 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(in thousands)**  \nNet revenue  |  $  |  43,855  |  $  |  46,142  |  $  |  128,240  |  $  |  148,283   \nNet income  |  71,660  |  3,029  |  81,442  |  7,460   \nAdjusted EBITDA* |  $  |  4,451  |  $  |  5,233  |  $  |  11,908  |  $  |  17,145   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin* |  10.1  |  %  |  11.3  |  %  |  9.3  |  %  |  11.6  |  %   \nNet cash provided by operating activities  |  8,767  |  (588  |  )  |  15,428  |  9,000   \nAdditions to property and equipment  |  (1,211  |  )  |  (445  |  )  |  (2,911  |  )  |  (1,311  |  )   \nFree cash flow* |  $  |  7,556  |  $  |  (1,033  |  )  |  $  |  12,517  |  $  |  7,689   \n*  |  See reconciliations of these non-GAAP measurements to the most directly comparable GAAP measures included in the financial tables.

This decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by lower volumes and loss of programs associated with existing clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets, offset partially by new business revenue with a client in the consumer electronics market. \n\nNet revenue for the nine months ended April 30, 2024 decreased $20.0 million, or 13.5%, as compared to the nine months ended April 30, 2023. This decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by lower volumes associated with existing clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets, partially offset by new business revenue with a client in the consumer electronics market. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on net revenues for the three and nine month periods ended April 30, 2024 and 2023. \n\n**Cost of Revenue**\n\nTotal cost of revenue decreased by $2.4 million, or 7.2%, for the third quarter, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. This was primarily driven by a decrease in cost of materials procured on behalf of our clients of $2.3 million as a result of lower sales volumes associated with existing clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets. \n\nTotal cost of revenue decreased by $15.6 million, or 14.5%, for the nine months ended April 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended April 30, 2023. This was primarily driven by a decrease in cost of materials procured on behalf of our clients of $15.1 million as a result of lower sales volumes associated with existing clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets, along with a decrease in payroll, benefits and labor in support of customers in the consumer electronics market. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on cost of revenues for the three and nine month periods ended April 30, 2024 and 2023. \n\n**Gross Profit Margin**\n\nGross profit remained relatively flat in the third quarter as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit percentage increased 170 basis points to 29.7% from 28.0% in the third quarter as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a decrease in cost of materials as discussed above. \n\nGross profit decreased $4.4 million or 11.0% in the nine months ended April 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended April 30, 2023, primarily driven by lower sales volume discussed above. The gross profit percentage increased 80 basis points to 27.9% from 27.1%, primarily due to changes in customer sales mix. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on the Company's gross margin for the three and nine month periods ended April 30, 2024 and 2023. \n\n**Selling, General and Administrative**\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses during the third quarter decreased by approximately $3.5 million, or 27.5%, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year due to Corporate-level activity, driven by a decrease in legal fees and board fees, partially offset by an increase in expenses related to mergers and acquisitions activity. \n\nSG&A expenses decreased by approximately $6.8 million, or 20.3%, during the nine months ended April 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended April 30, 2023. SG&A expenses for ModusLink Corporation (\"Supply Chain\") decreased by $0.8 million primarily due to bad debt expense recorded for a client in the consumer products industry during the nine months ended April 30, 2023 that did not reoccur during the nine months ended April 30, 2024. Corporate-level activity decreased by $6.0 million, primarily due to a decrease in legal and other professional fees, offset partially by an increase in expenses related to mergers and acquisitions activity. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on SG&A expenses for the three and nine month periods ended April 30, 2024 and 2023. \n\n**Amortization Expense**\n\nAmortization expense of $0.9 million and $2.7 million for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2024, respectively, was driven by the recognition of intangible assets in connection with the application of pushdown accounting discussed above. \n\n**Interest Expense**\n\nInterest expense during the three and nine months ended April 30, 2024 decreased $0.7 million and $1.8 million, respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended April 30, 2023, primarily due to the cessation of the amortization of the discount on the 7.50% Convertible Senior Note due September 1, 2024 (the “SPHG Note”) as of May 1, 2023 in connection with the application of pushdown accounting discussed above. \n\n**Other Gains, Net**\n\nOther gains, net are primarily composed of investment gains (losses), fair value remeasurement gains (losses), foreign exchange gains (losses), interest income, and sublease income. \n\nThe Company recorded $1.1 million to Other gains, net for the three months ended April 30, 2024, driven by $3.7 million interest income, primarily due to interest earned on money market funds, offset by $2.1 million of net realized and unrealized losses recognized on investments, and $0.6 million in foreign exchange losses. The Company recorded $4.5 million to Other gains, net, for the three months ended April 30, 2023 primarily due to: (1) $1.9 million gain from proceeds received from the sale of an investment, (2) $1.4 million gain due to settlement with a client, (3) $0.5 million interest income, and (4) $0.3 million foreign exchange gains. \n\nThe Company recorded $8.7 million to Other gains, net for the nine months ended April 30, 2024, due to $10.4 million interest income primarily earned on money market funds. This activity was partially offset by $1.5 million of net realized and unrealized losses recognized on investments, and $0.4 million unrealized losses recognized as a result of the fair value remeasurement of the SPHG Note. The Company recorded $4.9 million to Other gains, net, for the nine months ended April 30, 2023, primarily due to: (1) $1.9 million gain from proceeds received from the sale of an investment, (2) $1.4 million gain due to settlement with a client, (3) $0.9 million interest income, and (4) $0.8 million sublease income. These gains were partially offset by $0.5 million foreign exchange losses. \n\n**Income Tax Benefit (Expense)**\n\nDuring the third quarter, the Company recorded income tax benefit of approximately $67.8 million as compared to $0.9 million income tax expense for the same period in the prior fiscal year. During the nine months ended April 30, 2024, the Company recorded income tax benefit of approximately $66.9 million as compared to $1.6 million income tax expense for the nine months ended April 30, 2023. The favorable change in income tax for both periods is due to the Company's release of a portion of its valuation allowance for certain pre-existing Company deferred tax assets. The release resulted in a one-time non-cash adjustment to income tax benefit of $71.5 million for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2024. \n\n**Net Income**\n\nNet income for the third quarter increased $68.6 million as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, and increased $74.0 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended April 30, 2023. The increase in net income for both periods is due primarily to the one-time non-cash, significant income tax benefit accounting adjustment booked during the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**Additions to Property and Equipment (Capital Expenditures)**\n\nCapital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $1.2 million, or 2.8% of net revenue, as compared to $0.4 million, or 1.0% of net revenue, for the same period in the prior fiscal year. \n\nCapital expenditures for the nine months ended April 30, 2024 totaled $2.9 million, or 2.3% of net revenue, as compared to $1.3 million, or 0.9% of net revenue, for the nine months ended April 30, 2023. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $0.8 million, or 14.9%, for the third quarter as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to lower strategic consulting and other related professional fees. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $5.2 million, or 30.5%, for the nine months ended April 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended April 30, 2023, primarily due to lower strategic consulting and other related professional fees. \n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of April 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $269.2 million and ModusLink had readily available borrowing capacity of $11.9 million under its revolving credit facility with Umpqua Bank. \n\nAs of April 30, 2024, the fair value of outstanding debt was $12.9 million, which was comprised of $12.9 million principal outstanding on the SPHG Note. \n\n**About Steel Connect, Inc.**\n\nSteel Connect, Inc. is a holding company whose wholly-owned subsidiary, ModusLink Corporation, serves the supply chain management market. \n\nModusLink is an end-to-end global supply chain solutions and e-commerce provider serving clients in markets such as consumer electronics, communications, computing, medical devices, software and retail.

with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Net Cash (Debt), all of which are non-GAAP financial measures, to assess its performance. EBITDA represents earnings (losses) before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding net charges related to interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, amortization, strategic consulting and other related professional fees, executive severance and employee retention, restructuring and restructuring-related expense, share-based compensation, (gain) loss on sale of long-lived assets, impairment of long-lived assets, unrealized foreign exchange (gains) losses, net, and other non-cash (gains) losses, net. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less additions to property and equipment, and defines Net Cash (Debt) as the sum of total debt, excluding reductions for unamortized discounts and issuance costs, less cash and cash equivalents. \n\nWe believe that providing these non-GAAP measurements to investors is useful, as these measures provide important supplemental information of our performance to investors and permit investors and management to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These measures provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period-to-period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operating results of our business. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our Board of Directors, determining a component of certain incentive compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance, determining compliance with certain covenants in the Company's credit facilities, and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our core business. We use Free Cash Flow to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a useful measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of ongoing operations, and similar to the use of Net Cash (Debt), assists management with its capital planning and financing considerations. \n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist in providing an enhanced understanding of our underlying operational measures to manage our core businesses, to evaluate performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. Further, we believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. \n\nSome of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA include: \n\n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; \n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; \n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n  * although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and \n  * other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. \n\n\n\nIn addition, Net Cash (Debt) assumes the Company's cash and cash equivalents can be used to reduce outstanding debt without restriction, while Free Cash Flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and excludes the Company's remaining investing activities and financing activities, including the requirement for principal payments on the Company's outstanding indebtedness. \n\nSee reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures included in the financial tables of this release. \n\n**Net Operating Loss Carryforwards**\n\nThe Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Protective Amendment”) and Amended Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the “Tax Plan”) includes provisions designed to protect the tax benefits of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards by preventing certain transfers of our securities that could result in an \"ownership change\" (as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code). The Protective Amendment generally restricts any direct or indirect transfer if the effect would be to (i) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder from less than 4.99 percent to 4.99 percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding or (ii) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder owning or deemed to own 4.99 percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding. Pursuant to the Protective Amendment, any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of the Protective Amendment would be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee (or, in the case of an indirect transfer, the ownership of the direct owner of the shares would terminate simultaneously with the transfer), and the purported transferee (or in the case of any indirect transfer, the direct owner) would not be recognized as the owner of the shares owned in violation of the Protective Amendment (the \"excess stock\") for any purpose, including for purposes of voting and receiving dividends or other distributions in respect of such shares, or in the case of options, receiving shares in respect of their exercise. Pursuant to the Tax Plan and subject to certain exceptions, if a stockholder (or group) becomes a 4.99-percent stockholder after adoption of the Tax Plan, certain rights attached to each outstanding share of our common stock would generally become exercisable and entitle stockholders (other than the new 4.99-percent stockholder or group) to purchase additional shares of the Company at a significant discount, resulting in substantial dilution in the economic interest and voting power of the new 4.99-percent stockholder (or group). In addition, under certain circumstances in which the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination after a non-exempt stockholder (or group) becomes a new 4.99-percent stockholder, each holder of a right (other than the new 4.99-percent stockholder or group) would then be entitled to purchase shares of the acquiring company's common stock at a discount. For further discussion of the Company's tax benefits preservation plan, please see the Company's filings with the SEC. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: STCN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2024. \n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nThe financial information and discussion that follows below are for the Company's operations. \n\nDue to the application of pushdown accounting in connection with the exchange transaction (\"Exchange Transaction\") on May 1, 2023 with Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (“Steel Partners”), the Company’s consolidated financial statements include a black line division between the two distinct periods to indicate the application of two different bases of accounting, which may not be comparable, between the periods presented. The pre-exchange period through April 30, 2023, is referred to as the \"Predecessor\" period. The post-exchange period, May 1, 2023, and onward, includes the impact of pushdown accounting and is referred to as the \"Successor\" period. \n\nAs it relates to the results of operations, while the Successor period and the Predecessor period are distinct reporting periods, the effects of the change of control for financial statement purposes did not have a material impact on the comparability of our results of operations between the periods, unless otherwise noted related to the impact from pushdown accounting. \n\n**Successor** |  **Predecessor** |  **Successor** |  **Predecessor**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Three Months Ended January 31,** |  **Three Months Ended January 31,** |  **Six Months Ended January 31,** |  **Six Months Ended January 31,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**(in thousands)**  \nNet revenue  |  $  |  43,045  |  $  |  50,781  |  $  |  84,386  |  $  |  102,140   \nNet income (loss)  |  5,346  |  (526  |  )  |  9,782  |  4,431   \nNet income (loss) available to common stockholders  |  $  |  4,809  |  $  |  (1,063  |  )  |  $  |  8,709  |  $  |  3,357   \nAdjusted EBITDA* |  $  |  3,701  |  $  |  4,631  |  $  |  7,458  |  $  |  11,912   \nAdjusted EBITDA margin* |  8.6  |  %  |  9.1  |  %  |  8.8  |  %  |  11.7  |  %   \nNet cash provided by operating activities  |  78  |  1,336  |  6,661  |  9,588   \nAdditions to property and equipment  |  (1,148  |  )  |  (318  |  )  |  (1,700  |  )  |  (866  |  )   \nFree cash flow* |  $  |  (1,070  |  )  |  $  |  1,018  |  $  |  4,961  |  $  |  8,722   \n*  | See reconciliations of these non-GAAP measurements to the most directly comparable GAAP measures included in the financial tables.

This decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by lower volumes associated with existing clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets, offset partially by new business revenue and new program starts with clients in the consumer electronics market. \n\nNet revenue for the six months ended January 31, 2024 decreased $17.8 million, or 17.4%, as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2023. This decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by lower volumes associated with existing clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets, partially offset by new business revenue and new program starts with clients in the consumer electronics market. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on net revenues for the three and six month periods ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\n**Cost of Revenue**\n\nTotal cost of revenue decreased by $6.0 million or 16.0% for the second quarter, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. This was primarily driven by a decrease in materials procured on behalf of our clients of $6.9 million as a result of lower sales volumes associated with existing clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets. The decrease in cost of materials was partially offset by increases in labor costs for new business revenue in the consumer electronics market. \n\nTotal cost of revenue decreased by $13.2 million or 17.7% for the six months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2023. This was primarily driven by a decrease in materials procured on behalf of our clients of $12.8 million as a result of lower sales volumes associated with clients in the computing and consumer electronics markets. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on cost of revenues for the three and six month periods ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\n**Gross Profit Margin**\n\nGross profit decreased $1.7 million or 13.1% in the second quarter as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the lower sales volume discussed above. Gross profit percentage increased 70 basis points to 26.4% from 25.7% in the second quarter as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to changes in customer sales mix. \n\nGross profit decreased $4.5 million or 16.5% in the six months ended January 31, 2024 as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2023, primarily driven by lower sales volume discussed above. The gross profit percentage remained relatively unchanged from the prior period. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on the Company's gross margin for the three and six month periods ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\n**Selling, General and Administrative**\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses during the second quarter decreased by approximately $1.7 million or 16.5% as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year due to Corporate-level activity, which decreased by $1.4 million primarily due to a decrease in legal and other professional fees. \n\nSG&A expenses decreased by approximately $3.3 million or 15.9% during the six months ended January 31, 2024 as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2023. SG&A expenses for ModusLink Corporation (\"Supply Chain\") decreased by $0.8 million primarily due to bad debt expense recorded for a client in the consumer products industry during the six months ended January 31, 2023 that did not reoccur during the six months ended January 31, 2024. Corporate-level activity decreased by $2.5 million, primarily due to a decrease in legal and other professional fees. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on SG&A expenses for the three and six month periods ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n\n**Amortization Expense**\n\nAmortization expense of $0.9 million and $1.8 million for the three and six months ended January 31, 2024, respectively, was driven by the recognition of intangible assets in connection with the application of pushdown accounting as a result of the Exchange Transaction. As the Exchange Transaction closed on May 1, 2023, there was no activity for the three and six month periods ended January 31, 2023. \n\n**Interest Expense**\n\nInterest expense during the three and six months ended January 31, 2024 decreased $0.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, as compared to the three and six months ended January 31, 2023, primarily due to the cessation of the amortization of the discount on the 7.50% Convertible Senior Note due September 1, 2024 (the “SPHG Note”) as of May 1, 2023, the date of the Exchange Transaction. \n\n**Other Gains (Losses), Net**\n\nOther gains, net are primarily composed of investment gains (losses), fair value remeasurement gains (losses), foreign exchange gains (losses), interest income, and sublease income. \n\nThe Company recorded $4.1 million to Other gains, net for the three months ended January 31, 2024, primarily due to: (1) $3.5 million interest income earned on money market funds and (2) $1.0 million of net realized and unrealized gains recognized on investments in equity securities. This activity was partially offset by $0.6 million in unrealized losses recognized as a result of the fair value remeasurement of the SPHG Note at January 31, 2024. The Company recorded $2.6 million to Other losses, net, for the three months ended January 31, 2023 primarily due to $3.3 million in foreign exchange net losses. \n\nThe Company recorded $7.6 million to Other gains, net for the six months ended January 31, 2024, primarily due to: (1) $6.7 million interest income earned on money market funds and (2) $0.6 million of net realized and unrealized gains recognized on investments in equity securities. This activity was offset partially by $0.4 million unrealized losses recognized as a result of the fair value remeasurement of the SPHG Note. The Company recorded $0.4 million to Other gains, net, for the six months ended January 31, 2023, primarily due to (1) $0.6 million sublease income and (2) $0.5 million interest income earned on money market funds. This activity was offset partially by $0.8 million foreign exchange net losses. \n\n**Income Tax (Expense) Benefit**\n\nDuring the second quarter, the Company recorded income tax expense of approximately $0.2 million as compared to a $0.3 million income tax benefit for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The change in income tax expense is primarily due to higher taxable income in foreign jurisdictions, as compared to the prior fiscal year. \n\nDuring the six months ended January 31, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of approximately $0.9 million as compared to $0.8 million for the six months ended January 31, 2023. The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to higher taxable income in foreign jurisdictions for the six months ended January 31, 2024 as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2023. \n\n**Net Income**\n\nNet income for the second quarter increased $5.9 million, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. The increase in net income is largely driven by the $6.7 million favorable change in activity recorded to Other gains (losses), net. Refer to above explanations for further details. \n\nNet income for the six months ended January 31, 2024 increased $5.4 million, as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2023. The increase in net income is primarily due to the $7.2 million favorable change in activity recorded in Other gains, net. Lower SG&A expenses also contributed to the increase in net income, offset partially by lower gross profits. Refer to above explanations for further details. \n\n**Additions to Property and Equipment (Capital Expenditures)**\n\nCapital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $1.1 million, or 2.7% of net revenue, as compared to $0.3 million, or 0.6% of net revenue, for the same period in the prior fiscal year. \n\nCapital expenditures for the six months ended January 31, 2024 totaled $1.7 million, or 2.0% of net revenue, as compared to $0.9 million, or 0.8% of net revenue, for the six months ended January 31, 2023. \n\n**Adjusted EBITDA**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $0.9 million, or 20.1%, for the second quarter as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to lower operational net income. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $4.5 million, or 37.4%, for the six months ended January 31, 2024 as compared to the six months ended January 31, 2023, primarily due to due to lower operational net income. \n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of January 31, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $276.4 million and ModusLink had readily available borrowing capacity of $11.9 million under its revolving credit facility with Umpqua Bank. \n\nAs of January 31, 2024, the fair value of outstanding debt was $12.9 million, which was comprised of $12.9 million principal outstanding on the SPHG Note. \n\n**About Steel Connect, Inc.**\n\nSteel Connect, Inc. is a holding company whose wholly-owned subsidiary, ModusLink Corporation, serves the supply chain management market. \n\nModusLink is an end-to-end global supply chain solutions and e-commerce provider serving clients in markets such as consumer electronics, communications, computing, medical devices, software and retail.

the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and Net Cash (Debt), all of which are non-GAAP financial measures, to assess its performance. EBITDA represents earnings (losses) before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding net charges related to interest income, interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, amortization, strategic consulting and other related professional fees, executive severance and employee retention, restructuring and restructuring-related expense, share-based compensation, (gain) loss on sale of long-lived assets, impairment of long-lived assets, unrealized foreign exchange (gains) losses, net, and other non-cash (gains) losses, net. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less additions to property and equipment, and defines Net Cash (Debt) as the sum of total debt, excluding reductions for unamortized discounts and issuance costs, less cash and cash equivalents. \n\nWe believe that providing these non-GAAP measurements to investors is useful, as these measures provide important supplemental information of our performance to investors and permit investors and management to evaluate the operating performance of our business. These measures provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding our operating results as they exclude certain items whose fluctuation from period-to-period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operating results of our business. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our Board of Directors, determining a component of certain incentive compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance, determining compliance with certain covenants in the Company's credit facilities, and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our core business. We use Free Cash Flow to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a useful measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of ongoing operations, and similar to the use of Net Cash (Debt), assists management with its capital planning and financing considerations. \n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures assist in providing an enhanced understanding of our underlying operational measures to manage our core businesses, to evaluate performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. Further, we believe that these non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. \n\nSome of the limitations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA include: \n\n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; \n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; \n  * EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical capital expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \n  * although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and \n  * other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. \n\n\n\nIn addition, Net Cash (Debt) assumes the Company's cash and cash equivalents can be used to reduce outstanding debt without restriction, while Free Cash Flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures and excludes the Company's remaining investing activities and financing activities, including the requirement for principal payments on the Company's outstanding indebtedness. \n\nSee reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures included in the financial tables of this release. \n\n**Net Operating Loss Carryforwards**\n\nThe Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Protective Amendment”) and Amended Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the “Tax Plan”) includes provisions designed to protect the tax benefits of the Company's net operating loss carryforwards by preventing certain transfers of our securities that could result in an \"ownership change\" (as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code). The Protective Amendment generally restricts any direct or indirect transfer if the effect would be to (i) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder from less than 4.99 percent to 4.99 percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding or (ii) increase the direct, indirect or constructive ownership of any stockholder owning or deemed to own 4.99 percent or more of the shares of common stock then outstanding. Pursuant to the Protective Amendment, any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of the Protective Amendment would be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee (or, in the case of an indirect transfer, the ownership of the direct owner of the shares would terminate simultaneously with the transfer), and the purported transferee (or in the case of any indirect transfer, the direct owner) would not be recognized as the owner of the shares owned in violation of the Protective Amendment (the \"excess stock\") for any purpose, including for purposes of voting and receiving dividends or other distributions in respect of such shares, or in the case of options, receiving shares in respect of their exercise. Pursuant to the Tax Plan and subject to certain exceptions, if a stockholder (or group) becomes a 4.99-percent stockholder after adoption of the Tax Plan, certain rights attached to each outstanding share of our common stock would generally become exercisable and entitle stockholders (other than the new 4.99-percent stockholder or group) to purchase additional shares of the Company at a significant discount, resulting in substantial dilution in the economic interest and voting power of the new 4.99-percent stockholder (or group). In addition, under certain circumstances in which the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination after an non-exempt stockholder (or group) becomes a new 4.99-percent stockholder, each holder of a right (other than the new 4.99-percent stockholder or group) would then be entitled to purchase shares of the acquiring company's common stock at a discount. For further discussion of the Company's tax benefits preservation plan, please see the Company's filings with the SEC. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Amends Tax Benefits Preservation Plan\n\n[PDF Version](/node/18546/pdf)\n\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 8, 2024-- Steel Connect, Inc. (the “**Company** ”) (Nasdaq: STCN), today announced that its Board of Directors (the “**Board** ”) further amended its tax benefits preservation plan, dated as of January 19, 2018, as amended on January 8, 2021 (the “**Plan** ”), to extend the term of the Plan from January 8, 2024 to January 8, 2027 (subject to earlier expiration, as described below). \n\nThe Company has significant net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes and believes that its ability to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes (collectively, “**Tax Benefits** ”) would be substantially limited if the Company undergoes an “ownership change” (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code). The Plan is intended to prevent an “ownership change” of the Company that would impair the Company’s ability to utilize its Tax Benefits. \n\nPursuant to the Plan and subject to certain exceptions, if a stockholder (or group) becomes a 4.99 percent stockholder, the rights issued under the Plan (the “**Rights** ”) would generally become exercisable and entitle stockholders (other than the 4.99-percent stockholder or group) to purchase additional shares of the Company’s common stock at a significant discount, resulting in substantial dilution in the economic interest and voting power of the 4.99-percent stockholder (or group). In addition, under certain circumstances in which the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination after a non-exempt stockholder (or group) becomes a 4.99 percent stockholder, each holder of a Right (other than the 4.99-percent stockholder or group) would then be entitled to purchase shares of the acquiring company’s common stock at a discount. \n\nThe Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date (as defined in the Plan) and, pursuant to the amendment, will expire at the earliest of (i) 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the date that the votes of the stockholders of the Company, with respect to the Company’s next annual meeting of stockholders are certified (which the annual meeting shall be held no later than 11:59 P.M., New York City time, on January 8, 2025), unless the continuation of the Plan is approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy and actually voted at such meeting of stockholders (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) duly held in accordance with the Company’s Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws and applicable law (in which case clause (ii) will govern); (ii) 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on January 8, 2027; (iii) the time at which the Rights are redeemed or exchanged as provided in the Plan, and (iv) the time at which the Board determines that the Plan is no longer necessary or desirable for the preservation of Tax Benefits. \n\nThe Company has not materially amended the Plan other than with respect to the expiration date. Additional details regarding the Plan were described in a current report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on January 8, 2024. \n\n**About Steel Connect, Inc.**\n\nSteel Connect, Inc. is a holding company with a wholly owned subsidiary, ModusLink Corporation, which serves the supply chain management markets. \n\n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20240108405276r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108405276/en/>\n\nJennifer Golembeske 212-520-2300 \n\nSource: Steel Connect, Inc.\n\n![Steel Connect, Inc.](/sites/g/files/knoqqb53561/themes/site/nir_pid2757/client/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n### Menu\n\n### Resource & Links\n\n### Email Alerts\n\n#### Sign up to receive email alerts for investor-related company news and updates.\n\n[Sign Up Now](/shareholder-services/email-alerts)\n\n[Close menu](#mm-0)\n\n[Close menu](#mm-0)\n"
