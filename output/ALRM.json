(Nasdaq: ALRM), the leading platform for the intelligently connected property, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. Alarm.com also provided its financial outlook for SaaS and license revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024 and increased its guidance for the full year of 2024. \n\n** Third Quarter ** **2024 Financial Results as Compared to Third Quarter 2023**\n\n  * SaaS and license revenue increased 9.8% to $159.3 million, compared to $145.0 million. \n  * Total revenue increased 8.4% to $240.5 million, compared to $221.9 million. \n  * GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders increased 87.9% to $36.7 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to $19.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share. \n  * Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA(*) increased 20.6% to $50.0 million, compared to $41.4 million. \n  * Non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders(*) increased 14.9% to $35.2 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared to $30.6 million, or $0.56 per diluted share. \n\n\n\n** Balance Sheet and Cash Flow **\n\n  * Total cash and cash equivalents increased to $1.17 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to $697.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the May 2024 issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2029 in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers, or the 2029 Notes, resulting in proceeds of $485.2 million, net of $14.8 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs, and to a lesser extent, positive cash flows. \n    * In connection with the offering of the 2029 Notes, Alarm.com used $63.1 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Notes to pay the cost of privately negotiated capped call transactions to cover the number of shares of Alarm.com's common stock initially underlying the 2029 Notes. Alarm.com also used $75.0 million to repurchase 1,117,068 shares of its common stock at a per share price of $67.14 concurrently with the pricing of the 2029 Notes. \n  * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flows from operations was $150.2 million, compared to $96.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-GAAP free cash flow(*) was $142.3 million, compared to $90.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. \n\n\n\n(*) Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures are set forth at the end of this press release. \n\n** Recent Business Highlights **\n\n  * **OpenEye Launches New Line of Cloud Cameras:** OpenEye’s new all-in-one video camera solution provides a cost-effective and flexible option for commercial integrators to quickly deploy advanced video analytics capabilities.

We have included non-GAAP measures in this press release because they are financial, operating or liquidity measures used by our management to (i) understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and generate future operating plans, (ii) make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions and (iii) provide useful information to management about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. We also use non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure under our executive bonus plan. Further, we believe that these non-GAAP measures of our financial results provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, business trends and financial condition. While we believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors and management in analyzing our financial performance, non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts and transactions that are included in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures do not serve as an alternative to GAAP nor do we consider our non-GAAP measures in isolation. Accordingly, we present non-GAAP financial measures only in connection with GAAP results. We urge investors to consider non-GAAP measures only in conjunction with our GAAP financials and to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are included in this press release. \n\nWe consider non-GAAP free cash flow to be a liquidity measure, which we define as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. \n\nWith respect to our expectations under “Financial Outlook” above, reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures. In particular, non-ordinary course litigation expense, acquisition-related expense and tax windfall adjustments can have unpredictable fluctuations based on unforeseen activity that is out of our control and/or cannot reasonably be predicted. We expect the above charges to have a significant and potentially highly variable impact on our future GAAP financial results. \n\nWe exclude one or more of the following items from non-GAAP financial and operating measures: \n\n_Interest expense_ : We record interest expense primarily related to the January 2021 issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026, or the 2026 Notes, and the 2029 Notes. We exclude interest expense in calculating our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. For non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders per share, basic and diluted, we do not exclude interest expense other than the interest expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes as discussed below. \n\n_Interest income and certain activity within_ _other expense, net_ : We exclude interest income as well as certain activity within other expense, net including gains, losses or impairments on investments without readily determinable fair values and other assets, gains on settlement fees as well as losses on the early extinguishment of the debt, when applicable, from our non-GAAP financial measures because we do not consider it part of our ongoing results of operations. \n\n_Provision for income taxes_ : We exclude the impact related to our provision for income taxes from our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA calculation. We do not consider this tax adjustment to be part of our ongoing results of operations. \n\n_Amortization expense_ : GAAP requires that operating expenses include the amortization of acquired intangible assets, which principally include acquired customer relationships, developed technology and trade names. We exclude amortization of intangibles from our non-GAAP financial measures because we do not consider amortization expense when we evaluate our ongoing business operations, nor do we factor amortization expense into our evaluation of potential acquisitions, or our measurement of the performance of those acquisitions. We believe that the exclusion of amortization expense enables the comparison of our performance to other companies in our industry as other companies may be more or less acquisitive than we are and therefore, amortization expense may vary significantly by company based on their acquisition history. Although we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. \n\n_Depreciation expense_ : We record depreciation primarily for investments in property and equipment. We exclude depreciation in calculating non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because we do not consider depreciation when we evaluate our ongoing business operations. For non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders per share, basic and diluted, we do not exclude depreciation. \n\n_Amortization of debt issuance costs_ : We record amortization of debt issuance costs related to the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes as interest expense. We exclude amortization of debt issuance costs from our non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders per share, basic and diluted, because we believe that the exclusion of this non-cash interest expense will provide for more meaningful information about our financial performance. \n\n_Stock-based compensation expense_ : We exclude stock-based compensation expense, which relates to restricted stock units and other forms of equity incentives primarily awarded to employees of Alarm.com, because they are non-cash charges that we do not consider when assessing the operating performance of our business. Additionally, the determination of stock-based compensation expense can be calculated using various methodologies and is dependent upon subjective assumptions and other factors that vary on a company-by-company basis. Therefore, we believe that excluding stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP financial measures improves the comparability of our results to the results of other companies in our industry. \n\n_Acquisition-related expense_ : Included in operating expenses are incremental costs directly related to business and asset acquisitions as well as changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, when applicable. We exclude acquisition-related expense from our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that the exclusion of this expense allows us to better provide meaningful information about our operating performance, facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results, improves the comparability of our results to the results of other companies in our industry, and ultimately, we believe helps investors better understand the acquisition-related expense and the effects of the transaction on our results of operations. \n\n_Litigation expense_ : We exclude non-ordinary course litigation expense because we do not consider legal costs and settlement fees incurred and received in litigation and litigation-related matters of non-ordinary course lawsuits and other disputes, particularly costs incurred in ongoing intellectual property litigation, to be indicative of our core operating performance. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses, including those expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements. \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nAlarm.com’s indoor gunshot detection solution has been developed by SDS, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alarm.com that focuses on gunshot detection. It uses dual-authentication sensors to detect gunshots through a combination of infrared and acoustic sensing elements. Advanced microphones listen for gunshot blasts, while the infrared sensing elements identify the distinct muzzle flashes that accompany gunfire, thereby increasing accuracy and reducing the risk of false alerts. \n\nUpon detection of gunshots, one or more signals are forwarded to Alarm.com's cloud-based management platform. A central station is alerted within seconds, reducing response times when seconds matter most. When the sensor is paired with Alarm.com or other leading security video cameras, emergency personnel can also arrive on the scene with knowledge of the shooter's physical description and a more accurate understanding of the event. Gunshot events appear in the account’s activity history as well as in recorded clip history and can be accessed by monitoring station agents to help speed emergency response. \n\nThe SDS sensor is one of the only gunshot technologies that is SAFETY Act Certified by the Department of Homeland Security. With built-in privacy measures, the sensor's microphones are tuned to capture only the distinctive sound of a gunshot, not other noises such as loud voices or a locker slamming. Event data is processed onboard the device and is not recorded or shared. SDS sensors have been in operation at sensitive commercial, educational, religious and governmental sites in North America for more than five years. \n\n“Gun violence is a rising problem that is unfortunately not going away anytime soon, but we’re proud to offer the industry’s most reliable gunshot detection solution,” said James Reno, Vice President of Commercial Sales for Alarm.com. “Our service providers can now provide organizations of all sizes gunshot detection that’s 99.99% accurate—the same proven technology used by the largest enterprises and major airports in the country—to increase preparedness and protect against gun violence.” \n\nSDS Powered by Alarm.com is the newest addition to the Alarm.com for Business suite of comprehensive security solutions, which also includes intrusion security, video surveillance, access control, fleet management and more. \n\n“This SSI MVP award recognizes the value gunshot detection brings to our service provider network, their business customers and the general public—and also underscores the value of a fully unified platform,” said Brian Lohse, General Manager, Alarm.com for Business. “Rather than use standalone systems with siloed event information, organizations and communities can benefit from the increased response speed that results from emergency personnel being able to access critical information about active shooter events all in a single interface. We are proud of our innovation in this space and look forward to delivering this life-saving technology to schools, religious facilities and businesses.” \n\nIn addition to the indoor gunshot solution, Alarm.com is also the recipient of a second 2024 MVP Award for the Remote Video Monitoring (RVM) Console, a powerful new system that enables central station operators to offer round-the-clock concierge video monitoring and proactive defense services to customers with Alarm.com Video Analytics cameras. \n\nMVP Awards recognize the best technologies, products and solutions that keep people and properties safe. The independent panel of judges evaluated each entry based on design and technological innovation. \n\nAlarm.com-powered systems are professionally installed, monitored, and customized for each customer and property.

We have included non-GAAP measures in this press release because\nthey are financial, operating or liquidity measures used by our management to (i) understand and evaluate our core operating\nperformance and trends and generate future operating plans, (ii) make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and\ninvestments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions and (iii) provide useful information to\nmanagement about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. We also use non-GAAP\nadjusted EBITDA as a performance measure under our executive bonus plan. Further, we believe that these non-GAAP\nmeasures of our financial results provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of\noperations, business trends and financial condition. While we believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides useful\ninformation to investors and management in analyzing our financial performance, non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations\nin that they do not reflect all of the amounts and transactions that are included in our financial statements prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures do not serve as an alternative to GAAP nor do we consider our non-GAAP\nmeasures in isolation. Accordingly, we present non-GAAP financial measures only in connection with GAAP results. We urge\ninvestors to consider non-GAAP measures only in conjunction with our GAAP financials and to review the reconciliation of our\nnon-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are included in this press\nrelease.\n2\nWe consider non-GAAP free cash flow to be a liquidity measure, which we define as cash flows from operating activities less\npurchases of property and equipment.\nWith respect to our expectations under “Financial Outlook” above, reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP\nadjusted net income attributable to common stockholders guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available\nwithout unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the\ncharges excluded from these non-GAAP measures. In particular, non-ordinary course litigation expense, acquisition-related\nexpense and tax windfall adjustments can have unpredictable fluctuations based on unforeseen activity that is out of our control\nand/or cannot reasonably be predicted. We expect the above charges to have a significant and potentially highly variable impact\non our future GAAP financial results.\nWe exclude one or more of the following items from non-GAAP financial and operating measures:\nInterest expense: We record interest expense primarily related to the January 2021 issuance of $500.0 million aggregate\nprincipal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026, or the 2026 Notes, and the 2029 Notes. We exclude\ninterest expense in calculating our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. For non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted net\nincome attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders per share,\nbasic and diluted, we do not exclude interest expense other than the interest expense related to the amortization of debt\nissuance costs related to the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes as discussed below.\nInterest income and certain activity within other expense, net: We exclude interest income as well as certain activity within other\nexpense, net including gains, losses or impairments on investments without readily determinable fair values and other assets,\ngains on settlement fees as well as losses on the early extinguishment of the debt, when applicable, from our non-GAAP\nfinancial measures because we do not consider it part of our ongoing results of operations.\nProvision for income taxes: We exclude the impact related to our provision for income taxes from our non-GAAP adjusted\nEBITDA calculation. We do not consider this tax adjustment to be part of our ongoing results of operations.\nAmortization expense: GAAP requires that operating expenses include the amortization of acquired intangible assets, which\nprincipally include acquired customer relationships, developed technology and trade names. We exclude amortization of\nintangibles from our non-GAAP financial measures because we do not consider amortization expense when we evaluate our\nongoing business operations, nor do we factor amortization expense into our evaluation of potential acquisitions, or our\nmeasurement of the performance of those acquisitions. We believe that the exclusion of amortization expense enables the\ncomparison of our performance to other companies in our industry as other companies may be more or less acquisitive than we\nare and therefore, amortization expense may vary significantly by company based on their acquisition history. Although we\nexclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is\nimportant for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to\nrevenue generation.\nDepreciation expense: We record depreciation primarily for investments in property and equipment. We exclude depreciation in\ncalculating non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because we do not consider depreciation when we evaluate our ongoing business\noperations. For non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders and non-\nGAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders per share, basic and diluted, we do not exclude depreciation.\nAmortization of debt issuance costs: We record amortization of debt issuance costs related to the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes as\ninterest expense. We exclude amortization of debt issuance costs from our non-GAAP adjusted net income, non-GAAP adjusted\nnet income attributable to common stockholders and non-GAAP adjusted net income attributable to common stockholders per\nshare, basic and diluted, because we believe that the exclusion of this non-cash interest expense will provide for more\nmeaningful information about our financial performance.\nStock-based compensation expense: We exclude stock-based compensation expense, which relates to restricted stock units and\nother forms of equity incentives primarily awarded to employees of Alarm.com, because they are non-cash charges that we do\nnot consider when assessing the operating performance of our business. Additionally, the determination of stock-based\ncompensation expense can be calculated using various methodologies and is dependent upon subjective assumptions and other\nfactors that vary on a company-by-company basis. Therefore, we believe that excluding stock-based compensation expense\nfrom our non-GAAP financial measures improves the comparability of our results to the results of other companies in our\nindustry.\nAcquisition-related expense: Included in operating expenses are incremental costs directly related to business and asset\nacquisitions as well as changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, when applicable. We exclude acquisition-\nrelated expense from our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that the exclusion of this expense allows us to\nbetter provide meaningful information about our operating performance, facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results,\nimproves the comparability of our results to the results of other companies in our industry, and ultimately, we believe helps\ninvestors better understand the acquisition-related expense and the effects of the transaction on our results of operations.\n3\nLitigation expense: We exclude non-ordinary course litigation expense because we do not consider legal costs and settlement\nfees incurred and received in litigation and litigation-related matters of non-ordinary course lawsuits and other disputes,\nparticularly costs incurred in ongoing intellectual property litigation, to be indicative of our core operating performance. We do not\nadjust for ordinary course legal expenses, including those expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual\nproperty portfolio and license agreements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n1995.

the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nNote 1. Organization\nAlarm.com Holdings, Inc. (referred to herein as Alarm.com, the Company, or we) is the leading platform for the intelligently connected property. Our cloud-\nbased platform offers an expansive suite of Internet of Things, or IoT, solutions addressing opportunities in the residential, multi-family, small business and\nenterprise commercial markets.

Our fiscal year ends on\nDecember 31.\nNote 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned and controlled\nsubsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States, or GAAP, for interim financial information and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.\nAccordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for annual financial statements. They should be read together with our\naudited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed\nwith the SEC on February 22, 2024, or the Annual Report. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 was derived from our audited\nfinancial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements.\nIn the opinion of management, these condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of\nthe results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the periods presented. However, the global economy, credit markets and financial markets have\nand may continue to experience significant volatility as a result of significant worldwide events, including public health crises, and geopolitical upheaval, such as\nRussia’s incursion into Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and regional adversaries, disruptions to global supply chains, rising interest rates, risk of\nrecession and inflation (collectively, the Macroeconomic Conditions). These Macroeconomic Conditions have and may continue to create supply chain\ndisruptions, inventory disruptions, and fluctuations in economic growth, including fluctuations in employment rates, inflation, energy prices and consumer\nsentiment. It remains difficult to assess or predict the ultimate duration and economic impact of the Macroeconomic Conditions. The results of operations for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for our entire fiscal year ending December\n31, 2024, which is increasingly true in periods of extreme uncertainty, such as the uncertainty caused by the Macroeconomic Conditions. Prolonged uncertainties\ncould cause further economic slowdown or cause other unpredictable events, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or\nfinancial condition.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.\nAs of the date of issuance of these financial statements, we are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require us to update our estimates,\nassumptions and judgments or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. However, our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually\nevaluated based on available information and experience and may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Because of the use of\nestimates inherent in the financial reporting process and in light of the continuing uncertainty arising from the Macroeconomic Conditions, actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates and any such differences may be material. Estimates are used when accounting for revenue recognition, allowances for credit losses,\nallowance for hardware returns, estimates of obsolete inventory, long-term incentive compensation, the lease term and incremental borrowing rates for leases,\nstock-based compensation, income taxes, legal reserves, goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nOther than those disclosed herein, there have been no other material changes to our significant accounting policies during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from those disclosed in our Annual Report.\n8\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) — (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nCapped Call Transactions\nOn May 31, 2024, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2029 in a private placement to\nqualified institutional buyers, or the 2029 Notes. In connection with the offering of the 2029 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions\nwith one of the initial purchasers and certain other financial institutions, at a cost of $63.1 million. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary\nadjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the 2029 Notes, the number of shares of our common stock initially underlying the 2029 Notes. As the\ncapped call options are both legally detachable and separately exercisable from the 2029 Notes, we account for the capped call options separately from the\n2029 Notes. The capped call options are indexed to our own common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity. As such, the premiums paid for the capped call\noptions were included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The capped call transactions will not be\nremeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification.\nWe elected to integrate the capped call options with the 2029 Notes for federal income tax purposes pursuant to applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations.\nAccordingly, the $63.1 million cost of the purchased capped calls will be deductible for income tax purposes. The original issue discount is accreted over the\nterm of the 2029 Notes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAdopted\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not adopt any new accounting pronouncements.\nNot Yet Adopted\nOn November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280),” which revises the\ndisclosure requirements about a public entity’s reportable segments and a reportable segment’s expenses. This amendment requires a public entity to (i)\ndisclose significant segment expense that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment\nprofit or loss, (ii) disclose an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition and (iii) provide annual disclosures\nabout a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required by Topic 280 in interim periods. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning\nafter December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. This amendment is required to\nbe applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. We expect this amendment to increase the amount of disclosures we provide within Note 18 related to\nsegment expenses in the annual reporting period ending December 31, 2024 and interim reporting periods thereafter.\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740),\" which requires additional annual disclosures regarding specific\ncategories in the income tax rate reconciliation as well additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. This amendment also\nrequires annual disclosures regarding the amount of income taxes paid, including income taxes paid disaggregated by (i) federal, state and foreign taxes as well\nas (ii) individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid is equal to or greater than five percent of total income taxes paid. Additionally, this amendment requires\nannual disclosures for income from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign as well as\nincome tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between federal, state and foreign. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2024, and early adoption is permitted. This amendment should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are currently\nassessing the impact this pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nOn November 5, 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \"Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures\n(Subtopic 220-40),\" which requires more detailed information about the types of expenses included in certain expense captions presented on the consolidated\nstatements of operations, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization and depletion. Additionally, this amendment\nrequires the disclosure of a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively\nand the disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and, on an annual basis, an entity's definition of selling expenses. The amendment is effective for\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. This\namendment should be applied either on a prospective basis or a retrospective basis to any or all prior periods presented. We are currently assessing the impact\nthis pronouncement will have on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\n9\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) — (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nNote 3. Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nContract Assets\nOur assets related to costs incurred to obtain a contract consist of capitalized commission costs and upfront payments made to customers. The current\nportion of capitalized commission costs and upfront payments made to customers is included in other current assets within our condensed consolidated balance\nsheets. The non-current portion of capitalized commission costs and upfront payments made to customers is reflected in other assets within our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets.

Historically, we have not experienced write-offs\nfor uncollectible accounts or sales returns that have differed significantly from our estimates.\n10\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) — (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the accounts receivable and notes receivable amortized cost basis (see Note 8)\nto present the net amount expected to be collected. We estimate the allowance balance by applying the loss-rate method using relevant available information\nfrom internal and external sources, including historical write-off activity, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss\nexperience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for changes in economic\nconditions, such as changes in unemployment rates. We use projected economic conditions over a period no more than twelve months based on data from\nexternal sources. For periods beyond the twelve-month reasonable and supportable forecast period, we revert to historical loss information immediately.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured on a pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist. When assessing whether to measure certain financial\nassets on a pooled basis, we considered various risk characteristics, including the financial asset type, size and the historical or expected credit loss pattern.\nExpected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the financial assets and we adjust the term for expected prepayments when appropriate.\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a reduction to credit loss expense for accounts receivable and notes receivable of $0.1 million\nand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded credit loss expense for accounts receivable and notes receivable of $4.1 million, in general\nand administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded\ncredit loss expense for accounts receivable and notes receivable of $0.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in general and administrative expense in our\ncondensed consolidated statements of operations. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications because extension and\nrenewal options are unconditionally cancelable by us. Write-offs of the amortized cost basis are recorded to the allowance for credit losses. Any subsequent\nrecoveries of previously written off balances are recorded as a reduction to credit loss expense.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Accounts Receivable\nWe identified the following two portfolio segments for our accounts receivable: (i) outstanding accounts receivable balances within Alarm.com and certain\nsubsidiaries and (ii) outstanding accounts receivable balances within all other subsidiaries. There were no changes to our portfolio segments for our accounts\nreceivable during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and no changes to our policies or practices that influenced our estimate of expected\ncredit losses for accounts receivable. Additionally, there were no significant changes in the amount of accounts receivable write-offs during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, as compared to historical periods.\nThe changes in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable are as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAlarm.com Alarm.com Alarm.com Alarm.com\nand Certain All Other and Certain All Other and Certain All Other and Certain All Other\nSubsidiaries Subsidiaries Subsidiaries Subsidiaries Subsidiaries Subsidiaries Subsidiaries Subsidiaries\nBeginning of period\nbalance $ (3,677) $ (89) $ (2,968) $ (191) $ (3,723) $ (141) $ (2,755) $ (80)\n(Provision for) / recovery\nof expected credit\nlosses (103) (70) (820) 15 (491) (39) (1,307) (115)\nWrite-offs 90 2 89 19 524 23 363 38\nEnd of period balance $ (3,690) $ (157) $ (3,699) $ (157) $ (3,690) $ (157) $ (3,699) $ (157)\nNote 5.

The inventory write-down was the result of a lower of cost or net realizable value adjustment for\nfinished goods.\nNote 6. Acquisitions\nAsset Acquisition\nOn April 21, 2023, Alarm.com Incorporated, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired certain assets of Vintra, Inc., or Vintra. Substantially all of the\nacquired assets consisted of developed technology. We believe the acquisition of the developed technology will expand Alarm.com's learning program and\naccelerate deployment of advanced video analytics solutions for the Alarm.com and OpenEye platforms.\nIn consideration for the purchase of the acquired assets, we paid $5.5 million in cash on April 21, 2023, after deducting $0.3 million related to the settlement\nof an outstanding loan issued to Vintra during March 2023 and $1.0 million related to an agreed holdback provision. The holdback was paid during the third\nquarter of 2024. Additionally, we incurred $0.4 million in direct transaction costs related to legal fees during 2023 that were capitalized as a component of the\nconsideration transferred. The $7.1 million purchase price consideration allocated to developed technology was recorded as an intangible asset at the time of the\nasset acquisition and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of five years. The remaining $0.1 million purchase price\nconsideration was allocated to property and equipment.\nAcquisition of a Business - EBS\nOn January 18, 2023, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of EBS Spółka z\nograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, or EBS, an international producer of universal smart communicator devices, headquartered in Warsaw, Poland. We believe this\nacquisition will assist in the continued expansion of our international operations as well as benefit our supply chain operations.\nIn consideration for the purchase of EBS, we paid $9.8 million in cash on January 18, 2023, after deducting $2.2 million related to agreed holdback\nprovisions. An earn-out up to an additional $2.5 million is payable if certain performance targets are met, which was initially recorded at the acquisition date fair\nvalue of $2.0 million. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination within our Alarm.com segment. The purchase price allocation was finalized\nduring the third quarter of 2023. The overall impacts to our condensed consolidated financial statements were not considered material during the year of the\nacquisition.\nNote 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\nThe changes in goodwill by reportable segment are outlined below (in thousands):\nAlarm.com Other Total\nBalance as of January 1, 2024 $ 154,498 $ — $ 154,498\nForeign currency translation adjustment 171 — 171\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 154,669 $ — $ 154,669\nThe following table reflects changes in the net carrying amount of the components of intangible assets (in thousands):\nCapitalized\nSoftware\nCustomer Developed Development\nRelationships Technology Trade Name Costs Other Total\nBalance as of January 1, 2024 $ 39,294 $ 37,174 $ 1,217 $ 879 $ — $ 78,564\nIntangible assets acquired — — — — 46 46\nCapitalized software development\ncosts — — — 1,260 — 1,260\nAmortization (7,131) (5,956) (599) (140) — (13,826)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 32,163 $ 31,218 $ 618 $ 1,999 $ 46 $ 66,044\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid less than $0.1 million for the purchase of domain names. We recorded $4.4 million and $13.8\nmillion of amortization related to our intangible assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to $5.6 million and\n$14.9 million for the same periods in the prior year. There were no impairments of long-lived intangible assets during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\n12\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) — (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, $0.3 million of fully amortized developed technology intangible assets previously acquired were written-off in\nthe Alarm.com segment as the technology was no longer in use.\nThe following tables reflect the weighted average remaining life and carrying value of finite-lived intangible assets (in thousands, except weighted-average\nremaining life):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nWeighted-\nGross Net Average\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying Remaining Life\nAmount Amortization Value (in years)\nCustomer relationships $ 128,280 $ (96,117) $ 32,163 5.5\nDeveloped technology 69,731 (38,513) 31,218 4.0\nTrade name 4,474 (3,856) 618 2.9\nCapitalized software development costs 2,142 (143) 1,999 3.5\nOther 46 — 46 5.0\nTotal intangible assets $ 204,673 $ (138,629) $ 66,044 4.7\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted-\nGross Net Average\nCarrying Accumulated Carrying Remaining Life\nAmount Amortization Value (in years)\nCustomer relationships $ 128,280 $ (88,986) $ 39,294 6.2\nDeveloped technology 70,061 (32,887) 37,174 4.7\nTrade name 4,474 (3,257) 1,217 2.6\nCapitalized software development costs 882 (3) 879 3.3\nTotal intangible assets $ 203,697 $ (125,133) $ 78,564 5.4\nNote 8. Other Assets\nLoan to a Distribution Partner\nIn December 2022, we amended a subordinated credit agreement with the affiliated entity of one of our distribution partners, or the Affiliate. The amended\nsubordinated credit agreement with the Affiliate matures on June 18, 2027 and interest on the outstanding principal balance accrues at a rate of 12.0% per\nannum and is payable in kind. In March 2024, the Affiliate was in default on a loan arrangement with one of its third party secured lenders. Based on this\ninformation from the Affiliate, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded a credit loss expense of $4.0 million in general and administrative\nexpense and recorded a reduction to our interest income of $0.5 million related to the reversal of payable in kind interest associated with the subordinated credit\nagreement. We placed this loan in nonaccrual status and recorded a full allowance for credit losses for this note receivable as of March 31, 2024. During the\nthree months ended June 30, 2024, we wrote off the entire $4.0 million outstanding note receivable balance and reversed the previously recorded allowance for\ncredit losses. As of December 31, 2023, $4.5 million of the notes receivable balance related to the subordinated credit agreement was included in other assets in\nour condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $0.7 million and $2.0 million of revenue from the distribution partner associated\nwith this loan, respectively, as compared to $0.9 million and $2.5 million for the same periods in the prior year.\n13\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) — (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nLoan to a Service Provider Partner\nIn July 2020, we entered into a loan agreement with a service provider partner, under which we agreed to loan the service provider partner up to $2.5\nmillion, collateralized by the assets of the service provider partner. Interest on the outstanding principal accrues at a rate per annum equal to 9.0% and monthly\ninterest and principal payments began in April 2021. The maturity date of the loan is July 24, 2025. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $1.0\nmillion of principal was outstanding from the service provider partner under the loan agreement.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized less than $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of revenue from\nthe service provider partner associated with this loan.\nLoan to a Technology Partner\nIn June 2022, we entered into a convertible promissory note with a technology partner, under which we agreed to loan the technology partner $1.5 million.\nInterest on the outstanding principal accrues at a rate per annum equal to 6.5%, starting one year from the effective date of the loan. Interest and principal\npayments are due on the maturity date of the loan, which is June 27, 2029, unless the loan is converted prior to the maturity date, which may occur upon a\nqualified financing event, as defined in the convertible promissory note, upon a sale of the technology partner or upon our election on the maturity date of the\nloan. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $1.5 million of principal was outstanding from the technology partner under the convertible promissory\nnote.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not record any revenue from the technology partner associated with this\nconvertible promissory note.\nInvestment in a Hardware Supplier\nIn October 2018, we entered into a subordinate convertible promissory note with one of our hardware suppliers. In July 2019, we converted the outstanding\nnotes receivable balance of $5.6 million into 9,520,832 shares of Series B preferred stock in the hardware supplier. We concluded that the $5.6 million equity\ninvestment, which is included in the Alarm.com segment, does not meet the criteria for consolidation and will be accounted for using the measurement\nalternative. Under the alternative, we measure investments without readily determinable fair values at cost, less impairment, adjusted for observable price\nchanges from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investment in the hardware\nsupplier was $5.6 million.\nInvestments in Technology Partners\nIn February 2021, we paid $5.0 million in cash to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock from a technology partner as part of a financing\nround that included other investors. The $5.0 million equity investment, which is included in the Alarm.com segment, does not meet the criteria for consolidation\nand is accounted for using the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, we measure investments without readily determinable fair values\nat cost, less impairment, adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, our investment in the technology partner was $5.7 million.\nIn December 2022, we paid $5.1 million in cash to another technology partner to purchase 4,231,717 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock. The $5.1 million\nequity investment, which is included in the Alarm.com segment, does not meet the criteria for consolidation and is accounted for using the measurement\nalternative.

We previously disclosed a hardware financing receivable portfolio segment;\nhowever, there has been no activity within that portfolio segment since 2022. There were no changes to our policies or practices involving the issuance of notes\nreceivable, customer acquisitions or any other factors that influenced our estimate of expected credit losses for notes receivable during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\nWe do not accrue interest on notes receivable that are considered impaired or are 90 days or greater past due based on their contractual payment terms.\nNotes receivable that are 90 days or greater past due are placed on nonaccrual status. Notes receivable may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if, in\nmanagement’s opinion, a timely collection of the full principal and interest becomes uncertain. After a note receivable has been placed on nonaccrual status,\ninterest will be recognized when cash is received. A note receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer’s delinquent balances of principal\nand interest have been settled, and collection of all remaining contractual amounts due is reasonably assured. We have elected not to measure an allowance for\ncredit losses for accrued interest receivables. We write-off any accrued interest on notes receivable\n14\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) — (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nthat are considered impaired or are 90 days or greater past due based on their contractual payment terms by reversing interest income.

As of December 31, 2023, $675.6 million of our money\nmarket accounts was included in cash and cash equivalents and $4.1 million was included in other assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Our\nassets from money market accounts are valued using quoted prices in active markets. Our equity securities with readily determinable fair value represent our\ninvestments in publicly traded companies, which are valued using quoted prices in active markets. During the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, we recorded an unrealized loss on equity securities of $0.2 million. Our investments in public entities are recorded at fair value within other current assets\nin our condensed consolidated balance sheets and changes in fair value of the investments are recorded within other expense, net within our condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. See Note 12 for the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our convertible senior notes as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023.\nThe contingent consideration liability consists of the potential earn-out payment related to our acquisition of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital\nstock of EBS on January 18, 2023. The earn-out payment is contingent on the satisfaction of certain performance targets related to the integration of EBS's\nhardware into the Alarm.com platform by December 31, 2025 and has a maximum potential payment of up to $2.5 million. We account for the contingent\nconsideration using fair value and established a liability for the future earn-out payment based on an estimation of the probability of the future achievement of the\nperformance targets. The contingent consideration liability was valued with Level 3 unobservable inputs, including the probability of expected achievement of the\nperformance targets. At January 18, 2023, the fair value of the liability was $2.0 million. At each reporting date until December 31, 2025, or the achievement of\nthe performance targets, we will remeasure the liability, using the same valuation approach. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability is included\nwithin accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities as well as other liabilities within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Changes in\nfair value resulting from information that existed subsequent to the acquisition date are recorded in general and administrative expense in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the contingent consideration liability did not materially\nchange from the acquisition date fair value of $2.0 million as there were minor changes in the expected probability of achievement for the performance targets.\nThe unobservable inputs used in the valuation as of September 30, 2024 included a weighted average expected achievement percentage of 89.5%, weighted by\nthe\n16\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) — (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\npotential payout of the performance targets, including a range of 80.0% to 99.0%. The valuation also included a weighted average discount rate of 5.5%,\nweighted by the probability of achievement of the performance targets at various dates, including a range of 5.3% to 5.6%. Selecting another probability of\nexpected achievement or discount rate within an acceptable range would not result in a significant change to the fair value of the contingent consideration\nliability.\nWe monitor the availability of observable market data to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy.\nChanges in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another.\nThere were no transfers into or out of Level 3 or reclassifications between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nNote 10. Leases\nAs of September 30, 2024, we leased office space, data centers and office equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates\nthrough 2034. In August 2014, we signed a lease for office space in Tysons, Virginia, where we relocated our corporate headquarters to in February 2016. We\nhave subsequently entered into amendments to this lease to provide us with additional office space as well as tenant improvement allowances. In August 2024,\nwe entered into an amendment to the lease for our corporate headquarters, which extends the term of our existing leased office space to 2034 and includes two\nsuccessive five-year renewal options.

Based on the closing price of our\ncommon stock of $54.67 on the last trading day of the quarter, the if-converted value of the 2029 Notes did not exceed the principal amount of $500.0 million as\nof September 30, 2024.\nThe net carrying amount of the liability component of the 2029 Notes is as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n2024 2023\nPrincipal $ 500,000 $ —\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (13,910) —\nNet carrying amount $ 486,090 $ —\nInterest expense related to the 2029 Notes is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest expense $ 2,812 $ — $ 3,750 $ —\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 694 — 924 —\nTotal interest expense $ 3,506 $ — $ 4,674 $ —\nCapped Call – 2029 Notes\nIn connection with the offering of the 2029 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one of the initial purchasers and certain\nother financial institutions, at a cost of $63.1 million. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments substantially similar to those\napplicable to the 2029 Notes, the number of shares of our common stock initially underlying the 2029 Notes. The cap price of the capped call transactions is\ninitially $134.28 per share of our common stock, which represents a premium of 100% over the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select\nMarket on May 28, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. The exercise price is $87.28 per share of\ncommon stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments that mirror corresponding adjustments for the 2029 Notes.\nWe elected to integrate the capped call options with the 2029 Notes for federal income tax purposes pursuant to applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations.\nAccordingly, the $63.1 million cost of the purchased capped calls will be deductible for income tax purposes. The original issue discount is accreted over the\nterm of the 2029 Notes.\nThe capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon any conversion of the 2029 Notes\nand/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2029 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction\nand/or offset subject to a cap. As the capped call options are both legally detachable and separately exercisable from the 2029 Notes, we account for the capped\ncall options separately from the 2029 Notes. The capped call options are indexed to our own common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity. As such, the\npremiums paid for the capped call options were included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The\ncapped call transactions will not be remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIndemnification Agreements\nWe have various agreements that may obligate us to indemnify the other party to the agreement with respect to certain matters. Generally, these\nindemnification provisions are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business. Although we cannot predict the maximum potential amount of future\npayments that may become due under these indemnification agreements, we do not believe any potential liability that might arise from such indemnity provisions\nis probable or material.\n21\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) — (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nLegal Proceedings\nOn January 10, 2022, EcoFactor, Inc., or EcoFactor, filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, alleging Alarm.com’s products and\nservices directly and indirectly infringe five U.S. patents owned by EcoFactor. EcoFactor is seeking a permanent injunction, enhanced damages and attorneys'\nfees. EcoFactor had previously asserted two of the same patents against us in an October 2019 complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC.\nIn July 2021, the ITC found in favor of Alarm.com. EcoFactor appealed the decision but withdrew its appeal in December 2021. We moved to dismiss the Oregon\ncase for failure to state a claim on March 28, 2022. Three of the asserted patents are in ex parte reexamination proceedings at the PTO, and ex parte\nreexamination of a fourth patent concluded on August 23, 2023 after the claims were amended. On April 18, 2022, all claims of a fifth patent were found\nunpatentable by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, in an inter partes review, and all claims were canceled on February 1, 2024. On April 18,\n2022, the district court stayed the case at the request of the parties pending the disposition of PTAB and other proceedings involving the asserted patents.\nShould EcoFactor prevail in its lawsuit we could be required to pay damages and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, we could be enjoined from\nmaking, using and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us, and we could be required to pay\nongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to EcoFactor’s claims,\nthe outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty and any of these outcomes could result in an adverse effect on our business. Based on\ncurrently available information, we have determined a loss is not probable or reasonably estimable at this time.\nOn July 22, 2021, Causam Enterprises, Inc., or Causam, filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, alleging that Alarm.com’s\nsmart thermostats infringe four U.S. patents owned by Causam. Causam is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys’\nfees. We have not yet responded to the complaint. On September 3, 2021, the court issued an order staying the lawsuit until the ITC investigation described\nbelow is finally resolved.\nOn July 28, 2021, Causam filed a complaint with the ITC naming Alarm.com Incorporated, Alarm.com Holdings, Inc., and EnergyHub, Inc., among others, as\nproposed respondents. The complaint alleges infringement of the same four patents Causam asserted in district court. Causam is seeking a permanent limited\nexclusion order and permanent cease and desist order. On August 27, 2021, the ITC instituted an investigation into Causam’s allegations naming Alarm.com\nIncorporated, Alarm.com Holdings, Inc., EnergyHub Inc. and others as respondents. We answered the complaint on October 4, 2021. Among other things, we\nasserted defenses based on non-infringement and invalidity of the patents in question. An evidentiary hearing in the investigation was held from June 28, 2022\nthrough July 1, 2022. On February 16, 2023, the ITC issued a final decision in favor of Alarm.com and EnergyHub. Causam filed an appeal of the ITC decision\non April 14, 2023. Causam did not appeal the ITC decision with respect to Alarm.com and EnergyHub.\nShould Causam prevail in its district court lawsuit we could be required to pay damages and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, we could be\nenjoined from making, using and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us, and we could be\nrequired to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to\nCausam’s claims, the outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any of these outcomes could result in an adverse effect on our\nbusiness. Based on currently available information, we have determined a loss is not probable or reasonably estimable at this time.\nIn addition to the matters described above, we may be required to provide indemnification to certain of our service provider partners for certain claims\nregarding our solutions. For example, we incur costs associated with the indemnification of our service provider Central Security Group – Nationwide, Inc. (d/b/a\nAlert 360), or CSG, in an ongoing patent litigation. In 2018, Ubiquitous Connectivity, LP, or Ubiquitous, brought suit against CSG in U.S. District Court, Northern\nDistrict of Oklahoma, alleging infringement of two U.S. patents. The case was stayed by agreement of the parties for several years while the patents in suit were\nchallenged before the PTAB. In January 2021, the PTAB deemed 42 out of 46 claims of the two asserted patents unpatentable. Ubiquitous appealed a portion of\nthe PTAB’s findings to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB’s ruling on August 8, 2023. As a result,\nonly four patent claims remain at issue and the Northern District of Oklahoma case is no longer stayed. The case is currently in the discovery and claim\nconstruction phase. A claim construction hearing is scheduled for December 12, 2024. A hearing on dispositive motions, including for summary judgment, is\nscheduled for April 15, 2026. A trial is scheduled for July 6, 2026.\nShould Ubiquitous prevail on its infringement claims, we could be required to indemnify CSG for damages in the form of a reasonable royalty or of\nUbiquitous’s lost profits. CSG could be enjoined from making, using, and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling our technology is not\nmade available or if we are unable to design around such patents, and we could be required to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such\na license is made available to us. The outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty. Based on currently available information, we have\ndetermined a loss is not probable or reasonably estimable at this time.\n22\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) — (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nWe may also be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be\npredicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOther than the preceding matters, we are not a party to any lawsuit or proceeding that, in the opinion of management, is reasonably possible or probable of\nhaving a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We reserve for contingent liabilities based on ASC 450,\n\"Contingencies,\" when it is determined that a liability, inclusive of defense costs, is probable and reasonably estimable. Litigation is subject to many factors that\nare difficult to predict, so there can be no assurance that, in the event of a material unfavorable result in one or more claims, we will not incur material costs.\nNote 13. Stockholders' Equity\nStock Repurchase Programs\nOn February 15, 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program, effective February 23, 2023, under which we were authorized to\npurchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the two-year period ending February 23, 2025.\nOn May 24, 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock in connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, the cancellation\nof the balance under the stock repurchase program ending February 23, 2025 and also authorized a stock repurchase program, effective May 31, 2024, under\nwhich we are authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the two-year period ending May 31, 2026.\nThe full repurchase balance for this program of $100.0 million was available as of September 30, 2024. No shares were repurchased under our stock\nrepurchase program during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1,117,068 shares were\nrepurchased for $75.0 million under our stock repurchase program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 105,285 and 239,540 shares\nof our common stock were repurchased for $6.2 million and $12.9 million, respectively, under our stock repurchase program that was subsequently canceled\neffective May 31, 2024.\nAs of January 1, 2023, we are subject to a 1.0% excise tax on the value of net corporate stock repurchases under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. When\napplicable, the excise tax will be included as part of the cost basis of shares acquired and is presented within stockholders’ equity in the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nShares Withheld\nAs permitted under the terms of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, in 2021 the Compensation Committee authorized the withholding of shares of common\nstock in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards issued to employees to satisfy applicable tax withholding requirements. These withheld\nshares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program. No payments of tax withholdings were made related to\nvesting of restricted stock units during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We paid $3.4 million of tax withholdings related to vesting of restricted stock\nunits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. No tax withholdings related to the vesting of restricted stock units were paid during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. We also utilized the sell-to-cover method in which shares of our restricted stock unit awards were sold into the market on\nbehalf of the employee upon vesting to cover tax withholding liabilities. We may utilize either the withholding method or sell-to-cover method in the future.\n23\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) — (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nNote 14.

We use the\nif-converted method when calculating the dilutive impact of the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes on net income per share. As a result, we included 3,396,950 shares\nrelated to the 2026 Notes within the weighted average shares outstanding when calculating the diluted net income per share for each of the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

In the event of conversion of the 2029 Notes, shares delivered to us under the capped call will\noffset the dilutive effect of the shares that we would issue under the 2029 Notes.

Significant Service Providers and Distributors\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our 10 largest revenue service provider partners or distributors accounted for 46% and 47%\nof our consolidated revenue, respectively, as compared to 49% and 50% for the same periods in the prior year. One of our service provider partners within the\nAlarm.com segment individually represented greater than 15% but not more than 20% of our revenue for each of the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023.\nOne service provider partner in the Alarm.com segment represented more than 10% of accounts receivable as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023.\nNote 17. Income Taxes\nFor purposes of interim reporting, our annual effective income tax rate is estimated in accordance with ASC 740-270, \"Interim Reporting.\" This rate is\napplied to the pre-tax book income of the entities expected to be benefited during the year. Discrete items that impact the tax provision are recorded in the period\nincurred.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $6.7 million and $10.3 million, respectively, resulting\nin an effective income tax rate of 15.6% and 10.1% for those periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a provision for\nincome taxes of $4.0 million and $9.3 million, respectively, resulting in an effective income tax rate of 17.0% and 15.8% for those periods. For the three months\nended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate was below the 21.0% statutory rate primarily due to 2024 research and development tax credits claimed, the\nforeign derived intangible income deduction and a favorable true-up adjustment of our 2023 income tax provision estimate and amended prior year state income\ntax returns, partially offset by the impact of state taxes, foreign withholding taxes and other nondeductible expenses. For the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, our effective tax rate was below the 21.0% statutory rate primarily due to a favorable true-up adjustment of our 2023 income tax provision estimate, the\nforeign derived intangible income deduction, 2024 research and development tax credits claimed, the release of an unrecognized tax benefit liability due to the\nclosure of the 2018 and 2019 Internal Revenue Service federal income tax examination and tax windfall benefits from employee stock-based compensation,\npartially offset by the impact of state taxes, federal estimated tax payment interest expense and other nondeductible expenses. For the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, our effective tax rate was below the 21.0% statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits claimed, the foreign\nderived intangible income deduction and a favorable true-up adjustment of our 2022 income tax provision estimate, partially offset by the impact of state taxes,\nforeign withholding taxes and a stock-based compensation tax shortfall. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our effective tax rate was below the\n21.0% statutory rate primarily due to research and development tax credits claimed and the foreign derived intangible income deduction, partially offset by an\nunfavorable true-up adjustment of our 2022 income tax provision estimate associated with research and development tax credits, the impact of state taxes,\nforeign withholding taxes, other nondeductible expenses and a stock-based compensation tax shortfall.\nWe recognize a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that some portion, or\nall, of net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our valuation allowance for state research and development tax credit carryforwards and net deferred tax\nassets of our EBS subsidiary was $3.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and increased to $4.2 million as of September 30, 2024.\nWe apply guidance for uncertainty in income taxes that requires the application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of\nuncertain tax positions. If the recognition threshold is met, this guidance permits us to recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit\nthat, in our judgment, is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. We recorded a net increase to the unrecognized tax benefits liability of less than\n$0.1 million primarily due to a liability for research and development tax credits claimed, partially offset by the closure of the 2018 and 2019 Internal Revenue\nService federal income tax return examination and the release of a state unrecognized tax benefit liability due to the statute of limitations expiration during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded a net increase to the unrecognized tax benefits liability of $1.1 million primarily for research and\ndevelopment tax credits claimed during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nOur condensed consolidated balance sheets included an accrual for total interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits of $0.8 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nOur tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported\nin our tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. On October 13, 2021, the Internal Revenue Service\ncommenced an examination of our federal income tax return for 2018 and on August 12, 2022, the Internal Revenue Service expanded the examination to\ninclude our federal income tax return for 2019. On January 25, 2024, the Internal Revenue Service notified us that the income tax examination of our 2018 and\n2019 federal income tax returns has been closed. As a result, we paid $0.6 million in additional federal taxes, including interest,\n26\nALARM.COM HOLDINGS, INC.\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) — (Continued)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\nduring the three months ended June 30, 2024, and recognized a net income tax benefit of $1.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have material undistributed foreign earnings. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability on the undistributed\nearnings from our foreign subsidiaries, as such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.\nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted in the United States which, among other provisions, includes a minimum 15.0% tax on\ncompanies that have a three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income of more than $1.0 billion and a 1.0% excise tax on the value of net\ncorporate stock repurchases. Both provisions became effective on January 1, 2023 and the provisions did not have a material impact on our financial condition\nor results of operations for the periods presented.\nNote 18.

Our cloud-based platform offers an expansive suite of Internet of Things, or IoT,\nsolutions addressing opportunities in the residential, multi-family, small business and enterprise commercial markets. Alarm.com’s solutions include security,\nvideo and video analytics, energy management, access control, electric utility grid management, indoor gunshot detection, water management, health and\nwellness and data-rich emergency response. During 2023, our platforms processed more than 325 billion data points generated by over 150 million connected\ndevices. We believe this scale of subscribers, connected devices and data operations makes us the leader in the connected property market.\nOur solutions are delivered through an established network of trusted service providers, who are experts at selling, installing and supporting our solutions.\nWe primarily generate SaaS and license revenue through our service provider partners, who resell these services and pay us monthly fees. These service\nprovider contracts typically have an initial term of one year, with subsequent renewal terms of one year. Our service provider partners have indicated that they\ntypically have three to five-year service contracts with residential and commercial property owners who use our solutions. We also generate hardware and other\nrevenue, primarily from our service provider partners and distributors. Our hardware sales include connected devices that enable our services, such as video\ncameras, video recorders, gunshot detection sensors, gateway modules and smart thermostats. We believe our network of service providers and the length of\nour service relationships with residential and commercial property owners, combined with our robust SaaS platforms and over 20 years of operating experience,\ncontribute to a compelling business model.\nOur solutions are designed to make both residential and commercial properties safer, smarter and more efficient. Our technology platforms support property\nowners who subscribe to our services, the hardware partners who manufacture devices that integrate with our platforms and the service provider partners who\ninstall and maintain our solutions.\nThe Alarm.com platform enables our service provider partners to deploy our interactive security, video monitoring, intelligent automation, access control,\nenergy management and wellness solutions as stand-alone offerings or as combined solutions to address the needs of a broad range of customers.\nHighlights of Third Quarter Results\nWe primarily generate SaaS and license revenue, our largest source of revenue, through our service provider partners who resell our services and pay us\nmonthly fees. Our service provider partners sell, install and support Alarm.com solutions that enable residential and commercial property owners to intelligently\nsecure, connect, control and automate their properties. Our subscribers consist of all of the properties maintained by those residential and commercial property\nowners to which we are delivering at least one of our solutions. We derive a portion of our revenue from licensing our intellectual property to third parties\n30\non a per customer basis. SaaS and license revenue represented 66% and 67% of our revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, as compared to 65% and 64% in the same periods in the prior year.\nWe also generate SaaS and license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers on a per subscriber basis for access to our non-hosted\nsoftware platform, or Software platform. The non-hosted software for interactive security, automation and related solutions is typically deployed and operated by\nthe service provider in its own network operations center. Software license revenue represented 2% of our revenue during each of the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, as compared to 3% in the same periods in the prior year.\nWe also generate revenue from the sale of many types of hardware, including video cameras, video recorders, cellular radio modules, smart thermostats,\nimage sensors, gunshot detection sensors and other peripherals, that enable our solutions. Our hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the\nsale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the right to use our video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in\nexchange for a one-time license fee. Additionally, our hardware and other revenue includes our revenue from the sale of licenses that provide our customers the\nright to use our gunshot detection solution in exchange for license fees. Hardware and other revenue represented 34% and 33% of our revenue during the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 35% and 36% in the same periods in the prior year. We typically expect hardware\nand other revenue to fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nHighlights of our financial performance for the periods covered in this Quarterly Report include:\n• SaaS and license revenue increased 10% to $159.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $145.0 million during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. SaaS and license revenue increased 11% to $465.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from\n$420.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Included in SaaS and license revenue was software license revenue, which decreased to\n$5.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $5.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Software license\nrevenue decreased to $15.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $17.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n• Total revenue increased 8% to $240.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from $221.9 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Total revenue increased 6% to $697.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $655.4 million in the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\n• Net income increased to $36.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $19.4 million during the three months\nended September 30, 2023. Net income increased to $92.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $49.2 million in the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income attributable to common stockholders increased to $36.7 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, as compared to $19.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income attributable to common\nstockholders increased to $93.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $49.7 million in the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\n• Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance, increased to $50.0 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 from $41.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA increased to $129.9 million in\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 from $108.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nPlease see Non-GAAP Measures below in this section of this Quarterly Report for a discussion of the limitations of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA (a non-\nGAAP measure) and a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from net income, the most directly comparable measurement in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n31\nRecent Developments\nIn August 2024, we entered into an amendment to the lease for our corporate headquarters, which extends the term of our existing leased office space to\n2034 and includes two successive five-year renewal options. Additionally, the amendment provides for additional office space, parking spaces and tenant\nimprovement allowances.\nThe global economy, credit markets and financial markets have and may continue to experience significant volatility as a result of the Macroeconomic\nConditions. These Macroeconomic Conditions have and may continue to create supply chain disruptions, inventory disruptions, and fluctuations in economic\ngrowth, including fluctuations in employment rates, inflation, energy prices and consumer sentiment. It remains difficult to assess or predict the ultimate duration\nand economic impact of the Macroeconomic Conditions. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily\nindicative of the results that can be expected for our entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, which is increasingly true in periods of extreme uncertainty,\nsuch as the uncertainty caused by the Macroeconomic Conditions. Prolonged uncertainty with respect to the Macroeconomic Conditions could cause further\neconomic slowdown or cause other unpredictable events, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOther Business Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. Our\nother business metrics may be calculated in a manner different from the way similar business metrics used by other companies are calculated and include the\nfollowing (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSaaS and license revenue $ 159,276 $ 145,027 $ 465,547 $ 420,853\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA 49,976 41,435 129,853 108,383\nTwelve Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nSaaS and license revenue renewal rate 95 % 93 %\nSaaS and License Revenue\nSaaS and license revenue is a GAAP measure that we use to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance. We believe SaaS and\nlicense revenue is an indicator of the productivity of our existing service provider partners and their ability to activate and maintain subscribers using our\nintelligently connected property solutions, our ability to add new service provider partners reselling our solutions, the demand for our intelligently connected\nproperty solutions and the pace at which the market for these solutions is growing.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents our net income before interest expense, interest income, certain activity within other\nexpense, net, provision for income taxes, amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense, legal costs\nand settlement fees incurred and received in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual\nproperty litigation. We do not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation\nexpense; amortization of debt issuance costs for the January 20, 2021 issuance of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due\nJanuary 15, 2026, or the 2026 Notes, included in interest expense; amortization of debt issuance costs for the May 31, 2024 issuance of $500.0 million\naggregate principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2029, or the 2029 Notes, included in interest expense; and stock-based compensation\nexpense related to restricted stock units and other forms of equity compensation, including, but not limited to, the sale of common stock. We do not adjust for\nordinary course legal expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements.\nWe record interest expense primarily related to our 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes. We exclude interest expense in calculating non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA\nbecause we believe the exclusion of interest expense will provide for more meaningful information about our financial performance. We exclude interest income\nand certain activity within other expense, net including gains, losses or impairments on investments without readily determinable fair values and other assets,\ngains on settlement fees and losses on the early extinguishment of debt, when applicable, from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because we do not consider it part\nof our ongoing results of operations. We exclude the impact related to our provision for income taxes from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because we do not\nconsider this tax adjustment to be part of our ongoing results of operations.\n32\nGAAP requires that operating expenses include the amortization of acquired intangible assets, which principally include acquired customer relationships,\ndeveloped technology and trade names. We exclude amortization of intangibles from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because we do not consider amortization\nexpense when we evaluate our ongoing business operations, nor do we factor amortization expense into our evaluation of potential acquisitions, or our\nmeasurement of the performance of those acquisitions. We believe the exclusion of amortization expense enables the comparison of our performance to other\ncompanies in our industry as other companies may be more or less acquisitive than we are, and therefore, amortization expense may vary significantly by\ncompany based on their acquisition history. Although we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, management\nbelieves that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue\ngeneration.\nWe record depreciation primarily for investments in property and equipment. We exclude depreciation in calculating non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because\nwe do not consider depreciation when we evaluate our ongoing business operations.\nWe exclude stock-based compensation expense, which relates to restricted stock units and other forms of equity incentives primarily awarded to employees\nof Alarm.com, because they are non-cash charges that we do not consider when assessing the operating performance of our business. Additionally, the\ndetermination of stock-based compensation expense can be calculated using various methodologies and is dependent upon subjective assumptions and other\nfactors that vary on a company-by-company basis. Therefore, we believe excluding stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA\nimproves the comparability of our results to the results of other companies in our industry.\nIncluded in operating expenses are incremental costs directly related to business and asset acquisitions as well as changes in the fair value of contingent\nconsideration liabilities, when applicable. We exclude acquisition-related expense from non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA because we believe the exclusion of this\nexpense allows us to better provide meaningful information about our operating performance, facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results, improves\nthe comparability of our results to the results of other companies in our industry, and ultimately, we believe helps investors better understand the acquisition-\nrelated expense and the effects of the transaction on our results of operations.\nWe exclude non-ordinary course litigation expense because we do not consider legal costs and settlement fees incurred and received in litigation and\nlitigation-related matters of non-ordinary course lawsuits and other disputes, particularly costs incurred in ongoing intellectual property litigation, to be indicative\nof our core operating performance. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses, including those expenses resulting from maintaining and enforcing our\nintellectual property portfolio and license agreements.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is a key measure our management uses to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends to generate\nfuture operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital, and to make investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new\nmarkets for our solutions. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA facilitates comparisons of our operating\nperformance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related adjustments and certain historical legal expenses, excludes items\nthat we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP\nand should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please see Non-GAAP Measures\nin this section for a discussion of the limitations of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from net income, the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP measurement, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nSaaS and License Revenue Renewal Rate\nOur SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is an operating metric. We measure our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate on a trailing 12-month basis by\ndividing (a) the total SaaS and license revenue recognized during the trailing 12-month period from our subscribers on our Alarm.com platform who were\nsubscribers on the first day of the period, by (b) total SaaS and license revenue we would have recognized during the period from those same subscribers\nassuming no terminations, or service level upgrades or downgrades. The SaaS and license revenue renewal rate represents both residential and commercial\nproperties. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is expressed as an annualized percentage and it is calculated across our entire subscriber base on the\nAlarm.com platform excluding subscribers of service providers that may use one of our other platforms as a substitute for the Alarm.com platform. Our service\nprovider partners have indicated that they typically have three to five-year service contracts with residential and commercial property owners who use our\nsolutions. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate includes subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term\nduring the measurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the\nmeasurement period, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service provider partners. We believe our\nSaaS and license revenue renewal rate allows us to measure our ability to retain and grow our SaaS and license revenue and serves as an indicator of the\nlifetime value of our subscriber base.\n33\nComponents of Operating Results\nOur fiscal year ends on December 31. The key elements of our operating results include:\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from three primary sources: the sale of cloud-based SaaS services on our integrated Alarm.com platform, the sale of licenses and\nservices on the Software platform and the sale of hardware products. We sell our platform and hardware solutions to service provider partners that resell our\nsolutions and hardware to residential and commercial property owners, who are the service provider partners’ customers.\nSaaS and License Revenue. We generate the majority of our SaaS and license revenue primarily from monthly fees charged to our service provider\npartners on a per subscriber basis for access to our cloud-based intelligently connected property platform and related solutions. Our fees per subscriber vary\nbased upon the service plan and features utilized.\nWe offer multiple service level packages for our platform solutions including a range of solutions and a range of a la carte add-ons for additional\nfeatures. The fee paid by our service provider partners each month for the delivery of our solutions is based on the combination of packages and add-ons\nenabled for each subscriber. We utilize tiered pricing plans where our service provider partners may receive prospective pricing discounts driven by volume.\nWe also generate SaaS and license revenue from the fees paid to us when we license our intellectual property to third parties for use of our patents. In\naddition, in certain markets, our EnergyHub subsidiary sells its demand response service for an annual service fee, with pricing based on the number of\nsubscribers or amount of aggregate electricity demand made available for a utility’s or market’s control.\nSoftware License Revenue. Our SaaS and license revenue also includes our software license revenue from monthly fees charged to service providers on a\nper subscriber basis for access to our Software platform. The non-hosted software for interactive security, automation and related solutions is typically deployed\nand operated by the service provider in its own network operations center. Our agreements for the Software platform solution typically include software and\nservices, such as post-contract customer support, or PCS. Software license revenue included in SaaS and license revenue is expected to continue to decline\nover time as we transition subscribers to our cloud-based hosted platform.\nHardware and Other Revenue. We generate hardware and other revenue primarily from the sale of video cameras, video recorders, smart thermostats and\ncellular radio modules that provide access to our cloud-based platforms and, to a lesser extent, the sale of other devices, including image sensors, gunshot\ndetection sensors and peripherals. We primarily transfer hardware to our customers upon delivery to the customer, which corresponds with the time at which the\ncustomer obtains control of the hardware. We record a reserve against revenue for hardware returns based on historical returns.\nOur hardware and other revenue also includes our revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses that provide our customers in the commercial market the\nright to use our video surveillance software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee. Additionally, our hardware and other revenue\nincludes our revenue from the sale of licenses that provide our customers the right to use our indoor gunshot detection solution in exchange for license fees.\nHardware and other revenue may also include activation fees charged to some of our service provider partners for activation of a new subscriber account on our\nplatforms, as well as fees paid by service provider partners for our marketing services. The decision whether to charge an activation fee is based in part on the\nexpected number of subscribers to be added by our service provider partners and as a result, many of our largest service provider partners do not pay an\nactivation fee.\nOur revenue, and in particular our hardware revenue, has in the past and may in the future be negatively affected by the Macroeconomic Conditions and\ntheir related impacts. It remains difficult to assess or predict the ultimate duration and economic impact of the Macroeconomic Conditions.\n34\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of SaaS and license revenue primarily includes the amounts paid to wireless network providers and, to a lesser extent, the costs of running our\nnetwork operations centers which are expensed as incurred, as well as patent and royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers\nand amounts paid to distributed energy resource providers. Our cost of SaaS and license revenue also includes our cost of software license revenue, which\nprimarily includes the payroll and payroll-related costs of the department dedicated to providing service exclusively to those service providers that host the\nSoftware platform. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had 76 and 77 employees who manufacture hardware for our suite of IoT solutions, respectively. Our\ncost of hardware and other revenue primarily includes cost of raw materials, tooling, freight shipments and amounts paid to our third-party manufacturer for\nproduction and fulfillment of our cellular radio modules and image sensors, and procurement costs for our video cameras, video recorders, smart thermostats\nand gunshot detection sensors, which we purchase from an original equipment manufacturer, and other devices. Cost of hardware and other revenue also\nincludes material costs and labor cost related to our employees who manufacture hardware for our suite of IoT solutions. Additionally, our cost of hardware and\nother revenue includes royalty costs in connection with technology licensed from third-party providers.\nWe record the cost of SaaS and license revenue as expenses are incurred, which corresponds to the delivery period of our services to our subscribers. We\nrecord the cost of hardware and other revenue primarily when the hardware and other services are delivered to the service provider partner, which occurs when\ncontrol of the hardware and other services transfers to the service provider partner. Our cost of revenue excludes amortization and depreciation shown in\noperating expenses.\nSince 2019, the U.S. government has implemented and imposed significant changes to U.S. trade policy with respect to China. Tariffs have subjected\ncertain Alarm.com products manufactured overseas to additional import duties of up to 25%. The amount of the import tariff and the number of products subject\nto tariffs have changed numerous times based on action by the U.S. government. Less than one-third of the hardware products that we sell to our service\nprovider partners are imported from China and could be subject to increased tariffs. While the additional import duties resulted in an increase to our cost of\nhardware revenue, these import duties had a modest impact on hardware revenue margins. If tariffs are increased or are expanded to apply to more of our\nproducts, such actions may increase our cost of hardware revenue and reduce our hardware revenue margins in the future. We continue to monitor the changes\nin tariffs.\nWe currently expect our hardware revenue margins in 2024 to approximate the hardware revenue margins from 2023.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, general and administrative, research and development and amortization and depreciation\nexpenses. Salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation, benefits and other personnel related costs are the most significant components of each of these\nexpense categories, excluding amortization and depreciation. We include stock-based compensation expense in connection with the grant of restricted stock\nunits and other forms of equity compensation, including equity compensation with performance conditions, in the applicable operating expense category based\non the respective equity award recipient’s function (sales and marketing, general and administrative or research and development). We grew from 1,986\nemployees as of September 30, 2023 to 2,055 employees as of September 30, 2024, and grew from 2,033 employees as of June 30, 2024.

Additional\nexpenses included in this category are legal costs, including those that are incurred to defend and license our intellectual property, as well as non-personnel\ncosts, such as travel related expenses, rent, subcontracting and professional fees, audit fees, tax services, and insurance expenses.

Interest expense in 2024 is expected to increase as compared\nto 2023 due to the issuance of the 2029 Notes.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, our notes receivable and our restricted cash. Interest income in 2024\nwill depend, in part, on our use of cash and fluctuations in interest rates.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net primarily consists of non-operating and miscellaneous expense and income.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes as well as foreign income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many\ntransactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether\nadditional taxes will be due. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate was below the 21.0% statutory rate primarily due to 2024\nresearch and development tax credits claimed, the foreign derived intangible income deduction and a favorable true-up adjustment of our 2023 income tax\nprovision estimate and amended prior year state income tax returns, partially offset by the impact of state taxes, foreign withholding taxes and other\nnondeductible expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our effective tax rate was below the 21.0% statutory rate primarily due to a favorable\ntrue-up adjustment of our 2023 income tax provision estimate, the foreign derived intangible income deduction, 2024 research and development tax credits\nclaimed, the release of an unrecognized tax benefit liability due to the closure of the 2018 and 2019 Internal Revenue Service federal income tax examination\nand tax windfall benefits from employee stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of state taxes, federal estimated tax payment interest expense\nand other nondeductible expenses. We recognize stock-based compensation tax shortfalls and excess tax windfall benefits on a discrete basis during the\nquarter in which they occur, and we anticipate our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price as well as the vesting and\nexercises of various forms of equity compensation under our equity incentive plans each period, including restricted stock units and stock options.\n36\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited selected condensed consolidated statements of operations (in thousands) and data as a percentage of revenue\nfor the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue:\nSaaS and license revenue $ 159,276 66 % $ 145,027 65 % $ 465,547 67 % $ 420,853 64 %\nHardware and other revenue 81,221 34 76,827 35 232,040 33 234,592 36\nTotal revenue 240,497 100 221,854 100 697,587 100 655,445 100\nCost of revenue(1):\nCost of SaaS and license revenue 23,099 10 21,917 10 65,621 10 63,076 10\nCost of hardware and other revenue 61,649 25 59,488 27 176,924 25 180,868 27\nTotal cost of revenue 84,748 35 81,405 37 242,545 35 243,944 37\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing(2) 27,010 11 23,861 11 80,301 11 74,278 11\nGeneral and administrative(2) 25,712 11 31,455 14 81,112 12 88,753 14\nResearch and development(2) 62,221 26 61,014 27 193,907 28 183,840 28\nAmortization and depreciation 7,612 3 7,948 4 22,029 3 23,481 4\nTotal operating expenses 122,555 51 124,278 56 377,349 54 370,352 57\nOperating income 33,194 14 16,171 7 77,693 11 41,149 6\nInterest expense (4,315) (2) (906) — (7,079) (1) (2,601) —\nInterest income 14,384 6 8,493 4 33,780 5 21,092 3\nOther expense, net (89) — (435) — (1,665) — (1,214) —\nIncome before income taxes 43,174 18 23,323 11 102,729 15 58,426 9\nProvision for income taxes 6,718 3 3,972 2 10,349 2 9,257 1\nNet income $ 36,456 15 % $ 19,351 9 % $ 92,380 13 % $ 49,169 8 %\n_______________\n(1) Excludes amortization and depreciation shown in operating expenses below.\n(2) Operating expenses include stock-based compensation expense as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nStock-based compensation expense data: 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCost of hardware and other revenue $ — $ 3 $ 2 $ 3\nSales and marketing 545 854 2,024 2,778\nGeneral and administrative 3,077 3,260 9,561 9,873\nResearch and development 5,572 7,689 20,088 23,769\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 9,194 $ 11,806 $ 31,675 $ 36,423\nThe following table sets forth the components of cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nComponents of cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue:\nCost of SaaS and license revenue as a percentage of SaaS and license\nrevenue 15 % 15 % 14 % 15 %\nCost of hardware and other revenue as a percentage of hardware and other\nrevenue 76 77 76 77\nTotal cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue 35 % 37 % 35 % 37 %\n37\nComparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 to September 30, 2023\nThe following tables in this section set forth our selected condensed consolidated statements of operations (in thousands), data for the percentage change\nand data as a percentage of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nRevenue\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nRevenue\nSaaS and license revenue $ 159,276 $ 145,027 10 % $ 465,547 $ 420,853 11 %\nHardware and other revenue 81,221 76,827 6 232,040 234,592 (1)\nTotal revenue $ 240,497 $ 221,854 8 % $ 697,587 $ 655,445 6 %\nThe $18.6 million increase in total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily\nthe result of a $14.2 million, or 10%, increase in our SaaS and license revenue, and a $4.4 million, or 6%, increase in our hardware and other revenue.

The increase in interest\nincome was partially offset by a $0.5 million reduction to interest income for the reversal of payable in kind interest associated with a subordinated credit\nagreement with an affiliated entity of one of our distribution partners during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which did not occur during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023.\nOther Expense, Net\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nOther expense, net $ (89) $ (435) (80)% $ (1,665) $ (1,214) 37 %\n% of total revenue — % — % — % — %\nOther expense, net decreased $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased $0.5 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to changes in non-operating and miscellaneous expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n% %\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nProvision for income taxes $ 6,718 $ 3,972 69 % $ 10,349 $ 9,257 12 %\n% of total revenue 3 % 2 % 2 % 1 %\nThe provision for income taxes increased by $2.7 million and $1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as\ncompared to the same periods in the prior year. Our effective tax rate was 15.6% and 10.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nrespectively, as compared to 17.0% and 15.8% for the same periods in the prior year. The increase in the provision for income taxes for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in the prior year was primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes. The increase in the\nprovision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year was also due to the increase in\nincome before income taxes, partially offset by a favorable true-up adjustment of our 2023 income tax provision estimate as compared to an unfavorable true-up\nadjustment of our 2022 income tax provision estimate and the release of an unrecognized tax benefit liability due to the closure of the 2018 and 2019 Internal\nRevenue Service federal income tax examination during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which did not occur during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nSegment Information\nWe have two reportable segments: Alarm.com and Other. Our Alarm.com segment represents our cloud-based and Software platforms for the intelligently\nconnected property and related solutions that contributed 92% and 93% of our revenue, net of intersegment eliminations, for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 93% and 94% for the same periods in the prior year. Our Other segment is focused on researching,\ndeveloping and offering residential and commercial automation solutions and energy management products and services in adjacent markets. The consolidated\nsubsidiaries that make up our Other segment are in the investment stage and have incurred significant operating expenses relative to their revenue.\nOur Alarm.com segment increased from 1,778 employees as of September 30, 2023 to 1,815 employees as of September 30, 2024 and increased from\n1,801 employees as of June 30, 2024. Our Other segment increased from 208 employees as of September 30, 2023 to 240 employees as of September 30,\n2024 and increased from 232 employees as of June 30, 2024. Inter-segment revenue includes sales of hardware between our segments.\n42\nThe following table presents our revenue, inter-segment revenue and operating expenses by segment (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nSaaS and SaaS and\nlicense Hardware and Operating license Hardware and Operating\nrevenue other revenue expenses revenue other revenue expenses\nAlarm.com $ 141,319 $ 80,597 $ 108,614 $ 130,711 $ 76,336 $ 111,477\nOther 17,957 1,610 13,941 14,316 1,685 12,921\nIntersegment Alarm.com — (817) — — (1,021) (120)\nIntersegment Other — (169) — — (173) —\nTotal $ 159,276 $ 81,221 $ 122,555 $ 145,027 $ 76,827 $ 124,278\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nSaaS and SaaS and\nlicense Hardware and Operating license Hardware and Operating\nrevenue other revenue expenses revenue other revenue expenses\nAlarm.com $ 420,032 $ 230,424 $ 335,037 $ 384,116 $ 232,464 $ 333,684\nOther 45,515 4,472 42,312 36,737 5,263 37,028\nIntersegment Alarm.com — (2,362) — — (2,678) (360)\nIntersegment Other — (494) — — (457) —\nTotal $ 465,547 $ 232,040 $ 377,349 $ 420,853 $ 234,592 $ 370,352\nOur SaaS and license revenue for the Alarm.com segment included software license revenue of $5.0 million and $15.4 million for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to $5.7 million and $17.8 million for the same periods in the prior year. There was no software license\nrevenue recorded for the Other segment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue, costs and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our\nestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the use of estimates\ninherent in the financial reporting process in light of the continuing uncertainty arising from the Macroeconomic Conditions, actual results could differ from those\nestimates and any such differences may be material. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial\nstatement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. Except as disclosed in Note 2 of our notes to the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements, there were no other material changes to our use of estimates or other critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of our condensed consolidated financial statements for information related to recently issued accounting standards.\n43\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nThe following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, net and working capital, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,170,605 $ 696,983\nAccounts receivable, net 120,977 130,626\nWorking capital 1,249,846 781,443\nWe define working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. Our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 are available for working\ncapital purposes. Our investment policy defines allowable investments and establishes guidelines relating to credit quality, diversification and maturities of our\ninvestments to preserve capital, maintain liquidity and limit the amount of credit risk exposure. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were\nprimarily held in money market accounts.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $1.17 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity\nfrom the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. To date, we have principally financed our operations through cash generated by\noperating activities and through private and public equity and debt financings. We mitigate the risk of loss for our cash and cash equivalents by depositing funds\nwith a number of reputable financial institutions and monitoring both the risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 amended Internal Revenue Code Section 174, or Section 174, to eliminate the option to immediately\ndeduct research and development expenditures in the year incurred, requiring these expenditures to be capitalized and amortized over five years for domestic\nexpenditures and over 15 years for foreign expenditures. While we calculated the 2022 federal and state cash tax increase from Section 174 to be $38.1 million,\nwe did not pay this additional cash tax liability as part of our 2022 estimated tax payments due to the possible deferral, modification or repeal of Section 174. The\nadditional 2022 federal cash tax liability was included in current income taxes payable as of December 31, 2022, and was paid in February 2023. The increased\n2022 state tax liability was paid in April 2023 in the amount of $7.5 million. We calculated the 2023 federal and state cash tax increase from Section 174 to be\n$43.5 million, which we paid in April 2024. The Section 174 impact on 2024 cash flows from operating activities will depend on, among other factors, our 2024\noperating results and the level of 2024 research and development activity. Based on information currently available to us, we estimate the increased 2024\nSection 174 federal and state cash tax payable for our 2024 taxable income to be in the range of $33.0 million to $38.0 million if the requirement to capitalize\nand amortize research and development expenditures is not deferred, modified or repealed. This estimate is based on the limited information that is currently\navailable and is subject to change. While the largest impact will be to cash flow from operating activities, the impact for domestic research and development\nexpenditures would continue over the five-year amortization period, but would decrease over that period and is expected to be immaterial beginning in year six.\nOn January 31, 2024, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 7024, which, among other provisions, would retroactively change the effective date of\nthe requirement to capitalize Section 174 domestic research and development expenditures from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2026. Foreign research and\ndevelopment expenditures would continue to be capitalized and amortized over 15 years as of January 1, 2022. If the bill is passed by the Senate and signed\ninto law by the President as currently drafted, the bill would allow us to receive a partial refund of the 2022 and 2023 Section 174 federal income tax paid, the\namount and timing of which cannot be estimated at this time. Any state impact would depend on the relevant individual state laws.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our future cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating\ncash needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the final three months of fiscal year 2024, we expect our capital expenditure requirements to be between $1.0\nmillion and $3.0 million, primarily related to the continued build out of our leased and owned office space as well as purchases of computer software and\nequipment. Maturities of lease liabilities for our various office, data center and equipment leases as of September 30, 2024 are as follows: $3.3 million for the\nremainder of 2024, $12.7 million in 2025, $11.3 million in 2026, $11.6 million in 2027, $11.3 million in 2028 and $54.5 million in 2029 and thereafter.\nOur future working capital, capital expenditure and cash requirements will depend on many factors, including the impact of the Macroeconomic Conditions\non the economy and our operations, the rate of our revenue growth, the amount and timing of our investments in human resources and capital equipment, future\nacquisitions and investments, and the timing and extent of our introduction of new solutions and platform and solution enhancements. As the impact of the\nMacroeconomic Conditions on the\n44\neconomy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. To the extent our cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating\nactivities are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to borrow additional funds or raise funds from public or private equity or debt financings. If we\nraise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, such indebtedness would likely have rights that are senior to holders of our equity securities and\ncould contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing would be dilutive to our current stockholders.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were no material changes in our cash requirements from those disclosed in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our Annual Report, other than the $500.0 million issuance of the 2029 Notes on May 31, 2024, and\nthe additional rent payments from the amendment to the lease for our corporate headquarters executed in August 2024. See “Convertible Senior Notes – 2029\nNotes” below for further details on our 2029 Notes and see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" above for the maturities of lease liabilities.\nConvertible Senior Notes - 2029 Notes\nOn May 31, 2024, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2029 in a private placement to\nqualified institutional buyers, or the 2029 Notes. The terms of the 2029 Notes are governed by an Indenture, or the 2029 Indenture, by and between Alarm.com\nHoldings, Inc. and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that bear interest at a rate of\n2.25% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024, and the principal amount of the\n2029 Notes will not accrete. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes of $485.2 million, net of $14.8 million of transaction fees and other debt\nissuance costs.\nWe may redeem for cash, all or any portion of the 2029 Notes (subject to the partial redemption limitation described below), at our option, on or after June 7,\n2027, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding,\nthe redemption date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price for the 2029 Notes then in effect for at\nleast 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and\nincluding, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. If we redeem less than all the 2029 Notes, at least $75.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the relevant redemption notice date. No sinking\nfund is provided for the 2029 Notes.\nThe 2029 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January\n1, 2029, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2024 (and\nonly during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of\n30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the\nconversion price for the 2029 Notes on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period immediately after any ten consecutive trading day\nperiod in which, for each trading day of that period, the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes for such trading day was less than 98% of the\nproduct of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the 2029 Notes on each such trading day; (3) if we call any or all of the\n2029 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with\nrespect to the 2029 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as set forth in the 2029 Indenture.\nOn or after January 1, 2029, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2029 Notes,\nholders of the 2029 Notes may convert all or any portion of their 2029 Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, we may\nsatisfy our conversion obligation by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our\ncommon stock, at our election. It is our current intent to settle the principal amount of the 2029 Notes with cash. The initial conversion rate for the 2029 Notes is\n11.4571 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $87.28 per share of our\ncommon stock, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the 2029 Indenture. In addition, following certain corporate\nevents that occur prior to the maturity date of the 2029 Notes or if we deliver a notice of redemption in respect of some or all of the 2029 Notes, we will, under\ncertain circumstances, increase the conversion rate of the 2029 Notes for a holder who elects to convert its 2029 Notes (or any portion thereof) in connection\nwith such a corporate event or convert its 2029 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption during the related redemption period (as defined in the 2029\nIndenture), as the case may be.\nIf we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the 2029 Indenture), subject to certain exceptions and except as described in the 2029 Indenture,\nholders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2029 Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal\namount of the 2029 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe 2029 Indenture includes customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the 2029 Notes may\n45\nbe declared immediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving us after which the 2029 Notes\nbecome automatically due and payable.\nWe used $63.1 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions described below and used $75.0 million to\nrepurchase 1,117,068 shares of our common stock concurrently with the pricing of the 2029 Notes, which was separately authorized by our board of directors.\nWe are using the remaining net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions or strategic\ninvestments in complementary businesses or technologies, other repurchases of our common stock, repurchases of our 2026 Notes and for working capital,\noperating expenses and capital expenditures.\nCapped Call – 2029 Notes\nIn connection with the offering of the 2029 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one of the initial purchasers and certain\nother financial institutions, at a cost of $63.1 million. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments substantially similar to those\napplicable to the 2029 Notes, the number of shares of our common stock initially underlying the 2029 Notes. The cap price of the capped call transactions is\ninitially $134.28 per share of our common stock, which represents a premium of 100% over the closing price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select\nMarket on May 28, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. The exercise price is $87.28 per share of\ncommon stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments that mirror corresponding adjustments for the 2029 Notes.\nSources of Liquidity\nOn January 20, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026 in a private placement to\nqualified institutional buyers and received proceeds of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. The 2026 Notes are\ndiscussed in more detail above in Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nOn May 31, 2024, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2029 in a private placement to\nqualified institutional buyers and received proceeds of $485.2 million, net of $14.8 million of transaction fees and other debt issuance costs. The 2029 Notes are\ndiscussed in more detail above under \"Convertible Senior Notes - 2029 Notes.\"\nDividends\nWe did not declare or pay dividends during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. We cannot provide any assurance that we will\ndeclare or pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings, if any, for use in the\noperation and expansion of our business and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of future cash dividends, if any, will\nbe at the discretion of the board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, current and anticipated\ncash needs, the requirements of current or then-existing debt instruments and other factors the board of directors deems relevant.\nStock Repurchase Programs\nOn February 15, 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program, effective February 23, 2023, under which we were authorized to\npurchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the two-year period ending February 23, 2025.\nOn May 24, 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock in connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, the cancellation\nof the balance under the stock repurchase program ending February 23, 2025 and also authorized a stock repurchase program, effective May 31, 2024, under\nwhich we are authorized to purchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the two-year period ending May 31, 2026.\nThe full repurchase balance for this program of $100.0 million was available as of September 30, 2024. No shares were repurchased under our stock\nrepurchase program during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1,117,068 shares were\nrepurchased for $75.0 million under our stock repurchase program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, 105,285 and 239,540 shares\nof our common stock were repurchased for $6.2 million and $12.9 million under our stock repurchase program that was subsequently canceled effective May 31,\n2024.\nAs of January 1, 2023, we are subject to a 1.0% excise tax on the value of net corporate stock repurchases under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. When\napplicable, the excise tax will be included as part of the cost basis of shares acquired and\n46\nis presented within stockholders’ equity in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nShares Withheld\nAs permitted under the terms of the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, in 2021 the Compensation Committee authorized the withholding of shares of common\nstock in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards issued to employees to satisfy applicable tax withholding requirements. These withheld\nshares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program. No payments of tax withholdings were made related to\nvesting of restricted stock units during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We paid $3.4 million of tax withholdings related to vesting of restricted stock\nunits during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. No tax withholdings related to the vesting of restricted stock units were paid during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. We also utilized the sell-to-cover method in which shares of our restricted stock unit awards were sold into the market on\nbehalf of the employee upon vesting to cover tax withholding liabilities. We may utilize either the withholding method or sell-to-cover method in the future.\nHistorical Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nCash flows from operating activities $ 150,153 $ 96,093\nCash flows used in investing activities (16,553) (21,735)\nCash flows from / (used in) financing activities 344,286 (15,245)\nOperating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities have typically been generated from our net income and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly\nfrom accounts receivable and inventory, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as amortization and depreciation, deferred income taxes and stock-based\ncompensation.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flows from operating activities were $150.2 million, compared to $96.1 million for the same period in\nthe prior year. This $54.1 million increase in cash flows from operating activities was due to a $43.2 million increase in net income, a $7.1 million increase in non-\ncash and other reconciling items and a $3.8 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities.\nThe $7.1 million increase in non-cash and other reconciling items was primarily due to a $9.9 million change in deferred income taxes, which was primarily\ndriven by the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenditures under Section 174, as well as a $4.0 million increase in the provision for\ncredit losses on notes receivable related to a loan we provided to an affiliated entity of one of our distribution partners. These increases in non-cash and other\nreconciling items were partially offset by a $4.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared\nto the same period in the prior year as well as a $1.2 million inventory write-down during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 that did not occur during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024. The $3.8 million increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $18.4 million change in\ninventory resulting from a decrease in purchased inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior year,\npartially offset by a $6.9 million reimbursement of previously capitalized upfront payments to a customer received during the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 that did not occur during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as well as differences in the timing of disbursements.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities typically include acquisitions, capital expenditures, investments in unconsolidated entities, notes receivable issued to companies with\nofferings complementary to ours and proceeds from the repayment of those notes receivable. Our capital expenditures have primarily been for general business\nuse, including leasehold improvements as we have expanded our office space to accommodate our growth in headcount, computer equipment used internally\nand expansion of our network operations centers.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flows used in investing activities were $16.6 million, compared to $21.7 million for the same period in\nthe prior year. The $5.1 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily due to the $9.7 million paid to purchase 100% of the issued and\noutstanding shares of capital stock of EBS Spółka z ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, or EBS, net of cash acquired, and the $5.9 million paid to purchase certain\nassets from Vintra, Inc., or Vintra, including direct transaction costs, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which did not occur during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was partially offset by a $6.9 million increase in purchases of\ninvestments in unconsolidated entities, a $2.5 million increase in purchases of equipment as well\n47\nas a $0.8 million increase in payments related to capitalized software development costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the\nsame period in the prior year.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated by financing activities includes proceeds from the 2026 Notes, 2029 Notes and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from\nemployee stock option exercises and from our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in financing activities includes repurchases of common stock,\nrepayments of debt, payments of debt issuance costs and purchases of capped calls related to the 2029 Notes.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flows from financing activities were $344.3 million, compared to cash flows used in financing activities\nof $15.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The $359.5 million increase in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to $485.2 million in\nproceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes, net of issuances costs paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which did not occur during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases in cash flows from financing activities were partially offset by a $62.1 million increase in purchases of\nshares of our common stock and $63.1 million purchases of capped calls related to the 2029 Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which\ndid not occur during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nWe define non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as our net income before interest expense, interest income, certain activity within other expense, net, provision for\nincome taxes, amortization and depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense, legal costs and settlement fees incurred\nand received in connection with non-ordinary course litigation and other disputes, particularly costs involved in ongoing intellectual property litigation. We do not\nconsider these items to be indicative of our core operating performance. The non-cash items include amortization and depreciation expense, amortization of debt\nissuance costs for the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes included in interest expense, stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units and other\nforms of equity compensation, including, but not limited to, the sale of common stock. We do not adjust for ordinary course legal expenses resulting from\nmaintaining and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and license agreements. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance\nwith GAAP. See the table below for a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated\nand presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe have included non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in this report because it is a key measure our management uses to understand and evaluate our core\noperating performance and trends, to generate future operating plans, to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and to make investments in\ninitiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our solutions. We also use non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a\nperformance measure under our executive bonus plan. Further, we believe the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA\nfacilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of acquisition-related expense and certain\nhistorical legal expenses, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance. Accordingly, we believe non-GAAP adjusted\nEBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and\nboard of directors.\nOur use of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our\nfinancial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) although amortization and depreciation are non-cash charges, the assets being\namortized and depreciated may have to be replaced in the future, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for\nsuch replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our\nworking capital needs; (c) non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (d) non-GAAP adjusted\nEBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may\ncalculate non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n48\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures,\nnet income and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from net income, the most directly\ncomparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA:\nNet income $ 36,456 $ 19,351 $ 92,380 $ 49,169\nAdjustments:\nInterest expense, interest income and certain activity within other\nexpense, net (10,069) (7,587) (26,701) (18,491)\nProvision for income taxes 6,718 3,972 10,349 9,257\nAmortization and depreciation expense 7,612 7,948 22,029 23,481\nStock-based compensation expense 9,194 11,806 31,675 36,423\nAcquisition-related expense 61 (4) 105 576\nLitigation expense 4 5,949 16 7,968\nTotal adjustments 13,520 22,084 37,473 59,214\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA $ 49,976 $ 41,435 $ 129,853 $ 108,383\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk\nexposure is primarily the result of inflation and foreign exchange rates.\nThe uncertainty that exists with respect to the economic impact of the Macroeconomic Conditions continues to create significant volatility in the financial\nmarkets subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nMarket Risk\nOn January 20, 2021, we issued the 2026 Notes. On May 31, 2024, we issued the 2029 Notes. We carry these instruments at face value less unamortized\nissuance costs. However, the fair values of the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes fluctuate when the market price of our common stock fluctuates.\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs become subject to\nsignificant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nBecause substantially all of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, we do not believe our exposure to foreign currency\nexchange risk is material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses becomes\ndenominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars, we may not be able to effectively manage this risk, and our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected by translation and by transactional foreign currency conversions.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain \"disclosure controls and procedures,\" as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or\nthe Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange\nAct is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that\nsuch information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate\nto allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,\ncan provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship\nof possible controls and procedures.\n49\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls\nand procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during our most\nrecent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nHowever, our management does not expect our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control\nsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered\nrelative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues\nand instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that\nbreakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of\ntwo or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the\nlikelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over\ntime, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of\nthe inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n50\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn January 10, 2022, EcoFactor, Inc., or EcoFactor, filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, alleging Alarm.com’s products and\nservices directly and indirectly infringe five U.S. patents owned by EcoFactor. EcoFactor is seeking a permanent injunction, enhanced damages and attorneys'\nfees. EcoFactor had previously asserted two of the same patents against us in an October 2019 complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC.\nIn July 2021, the ITC found in favor of Alarm.com. EcoFactor appealed the decision but withdrew its appeal in December 2021. We moved to dismiss the Oregon\ncase for failure to state a claim on March 28, 2022. Three of the asserted patents are in ex parte reexamination proceedings at the PTO, and ex parte\nreexamination of a fourth patent concluded on August 23, 2023 after the claims were amended. On April 18, 2022, all claims of a fifth patent were found\nunpatentable by the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, in an inter partes review, and all claims were canceled on February 1, 2024. On April 18,\n2022, the district court stayed the case at the request of the parties pending the disposition of PTAB and other proceedings involving the asserted patents.\nShould EcoFactor prevail in its lawsuit we could be required to pay damages and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, we could be enjoined from\nmaking, using and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us, and we could be required to pay\nongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to EcoFactor’s claims,\nthe outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty and any of these outcomes could result in an adverse effect on our business.\nOn July 22, 2021, Causam Enterprises, Inc., or Causam, filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, alleging that Alarm.com’s\nsmart thermostats infringe four U.S. patents owned by Causam. Causam is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys’\nfees. We have not yet responded to the complaint. On September 3, 2021, the court issued an order staying the lawsuit until the ITC investigation described\nbelow is finally resolved.\nOn July 28, 2021, Causam filed a complaint with the ITC naming Alarm.com Incorporated, Alarm.com Holdings, Inc., and EnergyHub, Inc., among others, as\nproposed respondents. The complaint alleges infringement of the same four patents Causam asserted in district court. Causam is seeking a permanent limited\nexclusion order and permanent cease and desist order. On August 27, 2021, the ITC instituted an investigation into Causam’s allegations naming Alarm.com\nIncorporated, Alarm.com Holdings, Inc., EnergyHub Inc. and others as respondents. We answered the complaint on October 4, 2021. Among other things, we\nasserted defenses based on non-infringement and invalidity of the patents in question. An evidentiary hearing in the investigation was held from June 28, 2022\nthrough July 1, 2022. On February 16, 2023, the ITC issued a final decision in favor of Alarm.com and EnergyHub. Causam filed an appeal of the ITC decision\non April 14, 2023. Causam did not appeal the ITC decision with respect to Alarm.com and EnergyHub.\nShould Causam prevail in its district court lawsuit we could be required to pay damages and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, we could be\nenjoined from making, using and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us, and we could be\nrequired to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to\nCausam’s claims, the outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any of these outcomes could result in an adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nIn addition to the matters described above, we may be required to provide indemnification to certain of our service provider partners for certain claims\nregarding our solutions. For example, we incurred costs associated with the indemnification of our service provider Central Security Group – Nationwide, Inc.\n(d/b/a Alert 360), or CSG, in an ongoing patent litigation. In 2018, Ubiquitous Connectivity, LP, or Ubiquitous, brought suit against CSG in U.S. District Court,\nNorthern District of Oklahoma, alleging infringement of two U.S. patents. The case was stayed by agreement of the parties for several years while the patents in\nsuit were challenged before the PTAB. In January 2021, the PTAB deemed 42 out of 46 claims of the two asserted patents unpatentable. Ubiquitous appealed a\nportion of the PTAB’s findings to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB’s ruling on August 8, 2023. As\na result, only four patent claims remain at issue and the Northern District of Oklahoma case is no longer stayed. The case is currently in the discovery and claim\nconstruction phase. A claim construction hearing is scheduled for December 12, 2024. A hearing on dispositive motions, including for summary judgment, is\nscheduled for April 15, 2026. A trial is scheduled for July 6, 2026.\nShould Ubiquitous prevail on its infringement claims, we could be required to indemnify CSG for damages in the form of a reasonable royalty or of\nUbiquitous’s lost profits. CSG could be enjoined from making, using, and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling our technology is not\nmade available or if we are unable to design around such patents, and we could be required to pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such\na license is made available to us. The outcome of these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty.\nWe may also be a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be\npredicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these ordinary course matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRegardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse\n51\nimpact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. For a description of our legal proceedings, see\nNote 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information\ncontained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, or Quarterly Report, as well as our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.\nAny of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and cause the trading\nprice of our common stock to decline.\nSummary of Risks Affecting Our Business\nAny of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and cause the\ntrading price of our common stock to decline:\n• Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate and may be negatively affected by the Macroeconomic\nConditions.\n• Our actual operating results may differ significantly from any guidance provided. If our actual results of operations fall below the expectations of\ninvestors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\n• We may not sustain our growth rate and we may not be able to manage any future growth effectively.\n• We sell security and life safety solutions and if these solutions fail for any reason, we could be subject to liability and our business, reputation and\nresults of operations could suffer.\n• Failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including information relating to our service provider partners, subscribers\nand employees, could expose us to liability and adversely affect us.\n• The markets in which we participate are highly competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, broadband and security\nservice providers and other managed service providers, are actively targeting the home and business automation, security monitoring, video monitoring\nand energy management markets.\n• We rely on our service provider network to acquire additional subscribers, and the inability of our service providers to attract additional subscribers or\nretain their current subscribers could adversely affect our operating results.\n• We receive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of service provider partners, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders\nfrom one or more of our major service provider partners would result in decreased revenue and profitability.\n• We have relatively limited visibility regarding the consumers that ultimately purchase our solutions, and we often rely on information from third-party\nservice providers to help us manage our business. We operate in an evolving connected home market. If the connected property market does not grow\nas we expect or if a significant number of our target consumers choose to adopt point products that control discrete functions rather than our connected\nproperty solutions, we may not be able to achieve sustained growth or our business may decline.\n• We benefit from integration of our solutions with third-party platform providers. If developers of third-party platform providers choose not to partner with\nus, or are acquired by our competitors, our integrated solutions platform, business and results of operations may be harmed.\n• Our strategy includes pursuing acquisitions, and our potential inability to successfully consummate acquisitions or integrate newly-acquired\ntechnologies, assets or businesses may harm our financial results.\n• If we are unable to adapt to technological change, including maintaining compatibility with a wide range of devices, as well as changes in access to\nwireless networks through which we provide our wireless alarm, notification and intelligent automation services, our ability to remain competitive could\nbe impaired and we may need to incur significant capital expenditures to update our technology.\n• We operate in a regulated industry and our business, operations and service provider partners are subject to various foreign, U.S. federal, state and\nlocal laws and regulations, including relating to consumer protection, licensing, Internet and data privacy, tax, tariff, import/export restrictions or other\ntrade barriers. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could harm our business and we may incur significant expenditures related to\ncompliance efforts.\n• We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings where a negative outcome could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, cash flows and results of operations.\n• Assertions by third parties that we are infringing their intellectual property subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses that\ncould harm our business and results of operations.\n• We depend on our suppliers. The loss of any key supplier or the inability of a key supplier to deliver their products to us on time or at the contracted\nprice would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\n52\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from any guidance provided.\nOur guidance, including forward-looking statements, is prepared by management and is qualified by, and subject to, a number of assumptions and estimates\nthat, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Many of\nthese uncertainties and contingencies are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which\nwill change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are\nnot intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize\nor will vary significantly from actual results. In particular, guidance relating to the anticipated results of operations of an acquired business is inherently more\nspeculative in nature than other guidance as management will, necessarily, be less familiar with the business, procedures and operations of the acquired\nbusiness. Similarly, guidance offered in periods of extreme uncertainty, such as the uncertainty caused by the Macroeconomic Conditions, is inherently more\nspeculative in nature than guidance offered in periods of relative stability. Accordingly, any guidance with respect to our projected financial performance is\nnecessarily only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date the guidance is given. Actual results will vary from the guidance and the\nvariations may be material. Investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data will diminish the farther in the future that the data is\nforecasted.\nActual operating results may be different from our guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged\nto put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it. In addition, the market price of our common stock may reflect various market assumptions\nas to the accuracy of our guidance. If our actual results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common\nstock could decline substantially.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations\nof investors or securities analysts, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results, including the levels of our revenue, gross margin, cash flow and deferred revenue, may fluctuate as a result of a variety of\nfactors, including adverse Macroeconomic Conditions, the product mix that we sell, the relative sales related to our platforms and solutions and other factors\nwhich are outside of our control. If our quarterly revenue or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our\ncommon stock could decline substantially. Fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including:\n• the portion of our revenue attributable to SaaS and license versus hardware and other sales;\n• our ability to manage the businesses we have acquired, and to integrate and manage any future acquisitions of businesses;\n• fluctuations in demand, including due to seasonality or broader economic factors, for our platforms and solutions;\n• changes in pricing by us in response to competitive pricing actions;\n• our ability to increase, retain and incentivize the service provider partners that market, sell, install and support our platforms and solutions;\n• the ability of our hardware vendors to continue to manufacture high-quality products and to supply sufficient components and products to meet our\ndemands;\n• the timing and success of introductions of new solutions, products or upgrades by us or our competitors and the entrance of new competitors;\n• changes in our business and pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n• the ability to accurately forecast revenue as we generally rely upon our service provider partner network to generate new revenue;\n• our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs of the hardware we purchase;\n• changes in U.S. trade policies, including new or potential tariffs or penalties on imported products;\n• competition, including entry into the industry by new competitors and new offerings by existing competitors;\n53\n• issues related to introductions of new or improved products such as supply chain disruptions or shortages of prior generation products or short-term\ndecreased demand for next generation products;\n• perceived or actual problems with the security, privacy, integrity, reliability, quality or compatibility of our solutions, including those related to security\nbreaches in our systems, our subscribers’ systems, unscheduled downtime, or outages;\n• the amount and timing of expenditures, including those related to expanding our operations, including through acquisitions, increasing research and\ndevelopment, introducing new solutions or paying litigation expenses;\n• the ability to effectively manage growth within existing and new markets domestically and abroad;\n• changes in the payment terms for our platforms and solutions;\n• collectibility of receivables due from service provider partners and other third parties;\n• the strength of regional, national and global economies; and\n• the impact of natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, power outages, floods, epidemics, pandemics and public health crises, and other\ncatastrophic events or man-made problems such as terrorism, civil unrest and actual or threatened armed conflict, or global or regional economic,\npolitical and social conditions.\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results may be particularly pronounced in the current economic environment. Due to the foregoing factors and the\nother risks discussed in this Quarterly Report, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future\nperformance. For the same reason, you should not consider our recent revenue growth and changes in non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA or results of one quarter as\nindicative of our future performance. See the \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section of Item 2. \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations\" for a discussion of the limitations of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from net income, the\nmost directly comparable GAAP measurement, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nDownturns in general economic and market conditions and reductions in spending may reduce demand for our platforms and solutions, which could\nharm our revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur revenue, results of operations and cash flows depend on the overall demand for our platforms and solutions. Negative Macroeconomic Conditions in\nthe general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from inflation, changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and\ncredit market fluctuations, energy costs, international trade relations and other geopolitical tensions, the availability and cost of credit, rising interest rates and\nthe global housing and mortgage markets could cause a decrease in consumer discretionary spending and business investment and diminish growth\nexpectations in the U.S. economy and abroad.\nDuring weak economic times, the available pool of service providers may decline as the prospects for home building and home renovation projects diminish,\nwhich may have a corresponding impact on our growth prospects. In addition, there is an increased risk during these periods that an increased percentage of\nour service provider partners will file for bankruptcy protection, which may harm our reputation, revenue, profitability and results of operations. In addition, we\nmay determine that the cost of pursuing any claim may outweigh the recovery potential of such claim. Likewise, consumer bankruptcies can detrimentally affect\nthe business stability of our service provider partners.\nThe current Macroeconomic Conditions have caused significant uncertainty and volatility in global markets, which has and may continue to cause consumer\ndiscretionary spending to decline for an unknown period of time. A prolonged economic slowdown and a material reduction in new home construction and\nrenovation projects may result in diminished sales of our platforms and solutions. Further worsening, broadening or protracted extension of the economic\ndownturn could have a negative impact on our business, revenue, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe sell security and life safety solutions and if our solutions fail for any reason, we could be subject to liability and our business could suffer.\nWe sell security and life safety solutions, which are designed to secure the safety of our subscribers and their residences or commercial properties. If these\nsolutions fail for any reason, including due to defects in our software, a carrier outage, a failure of our network operations centers, a failure on the part of one of\nour service provider partners or user error, some of which have happened from time to time, we could be subject to liability for such failures and our business\ncould suffer.\nOur platforms and solutions may contain undetected defects in the software, infrastructure, third-party components or processes. We continue to follow our\npreviously implemented hybrid return to office plan that includes mandatory in-office workdays and voluntary remote workdays, which may make us more\nvulnerable to cyber-attacks and may create operational or\n54\nother challenges, any of which could harm our systems or our business. Although we have taken precautionary measures to prepare for these threats and\nchallenges, there is no guarantee our precautions will fully protect our systems. We continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more\ninformation and guidance become available. If our platforms or solutions suffer from defects, we could experience harm to our branded reputation, claims by our\nsubscribers or service provider partners or lost revenue during the period required to address the cause of the defects. We have found and may find defects in\nnew, acquired or upgraded solutions, resulting in loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our platforms and solutions, which could harm our business, financial\ncondition, cash flows or results of operations.\nSince solutions that enable our platforms are installed by our service provider partners, if they do not install or maintain such solutions correctly, our\nplatforms and solutions may not function properly. If the improper installation or maintenance of our platforms and solutions leads to service or equipment\nfailures after introduction of, or an upgrade to, our platforms or a solution, we could experience harm to our branded reputation, claims by our subscribers or\nservice provider partners or lost revenue during the period required to address the cause of the problem. Further, we rely on our service provider partners to\nprovide the primary source of support and ongoing service to our subscribers and, if our service provider partners fail to provide an adequate level of support\nand services to our subscribers, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nAny defect in, or disruption to, our platforms and solutions could cause consumers not to purchase additional solutions from us, prevent potential consumers\nfrom purchasing our platforms and solutions or harm our reputation. Although our contracts with our service provider partners limit our liability to our service\nprovider partners for these defects, disruptions or errors, we nonetheless could be subject to litigation for actual or alleged losses to our service provider partners\nor our subscribers, which may require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or arbitration, or to pay significant settlements or damages. Defending\na lawsuit, regardless of its merit, could be costly, divert management's attention and affect our ability to obtain or maintain liability insurance on acceptable terms\nand could harm our business. Although we currently maintain some warranty reserves, we cannot assure you that these warranty reserves will be sufficient to\ncover future liabilities.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, power outages, floods, pandemics and public health crises, natural disasters\nand other catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism, civil unrest and actual or threatened armed conflict, or\nglobal or regional economic, political and social conditions.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood, pandemic, or a public health crisis, or a significant power outage could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The impact of climate change may increase these risks due to changes in weather patterns,\nsuch as increases in storm intensity and frequency, sea-level rise, melting of permafrost and temperature extremes in areas where we conduct our business.\nNatural disasters could affect our hardware vendors, our wireless carriers or our network operations centers. Further, if a natural disaster occurs in a region from\nwhich we derive a significant portion of our revenue, such as metropolitan areas in North America, consumers in that region may delay or forego purchases of\nour platforms and solutions from service providers in the region, which may harm our results of operations for a particular period. In addition, terrorist acts or acts\nof war could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our hardware vendors, service providers, subscribers or the economy as a whole. More\ngenerally, these and other geopolitical, social and economic conditions could result in increased volatility in worldwide financial markets and economies that\ncould harm our sales. Given our concentration of sales during the second and third quarters, any disruption in the business of our hardware vendors, service\nprovider partners or subscribers that impacts sales during the second or third quarter of each year could have a greater impact on our annual results. All of the\naforementioned risks may be augmented if the disaster recovery plans for us, our service provider partners and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. To the\nextent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of orders, or delays in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our platforms and solutions, our\nbusiness, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations would be harmed.\nGeopolitical conditions, including trade disputes and direct or indirect acts of war or terrorism, could have an adverse effect on our operations and\nfinancial results.\nSince we operate on a global basis, our operations could be disrupted by geopolitical conditions, trade disputes, international boycotts and sanctions,\npolitical and social instability, acts of war, terrorist activity or other similar events. From time to time, we could have a large investment in a particular asset type,\na large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. A discrete\nevent impacting a specific asset type, customer, industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.\nFor example, in February 2022 Russia initiated military action against Ukraine. In response, the U.S. and certain other countries imposed sanctions and\nexport controls against Russia, Belarus and certain individuals and entities connected to Russian or Belarusian political, business, and financial organizations,\nand the U.S. and certain other countries could impose further sanctions, trade restrictions, and other retaliatory actions should the conflict continue or worsen. It\nis not possible to predict the broader consequences of the conflict, including related geopolitical tensions, the movement of refugees, and the measures and\nretaliatory actions taken by the U.S. and other countries in respect thereof as well as any counter measures or retaliatory actions by Russia or Belarus in\nresponse, including, for example, potential cyberattacks or the disruption of energy\n55\nexports, which could cause further regional instability and geopolitical shifts and could materially adversely affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional\neconomies and the global economy. In addition, in October 2023, the war between Israel and Hamas began, which has resulted in significant military activities in\nthe region and may further escalate regional instability. The situations remain uncertain, and while it is difficult to predict the full impact of any of the foregoing,\nthe conflicts and actions taken in response to the conflicts could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, reduce our sales and earnings, impair our ability to\nraise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not sustain our growth rate and we may not be able to manage any future growth effectively.\nWe have experienced significant growth and also have substantially expanded our operations in a short period of time. Our revenue increased from $618.0\nmillion in 2020 to $881.7 million in 2023 and increased from $655.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $697.6 million for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024. We do not expect to achieve similar growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our operating results for any prior\nquarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance. If we are unable to maintain expected revenue growth in both absolute dollars\nand as a percentage of prior period revenue, our financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline.\nOur future operating results depend, to a large extent, on our ability to successfully manage any future expansion and growth. To successfully manage our\ngrowth and obligations as a public company, we believe we must effectively, among other things:\n• maintain our relationships with existing service provider partners and add new service provider partners;\n• increase our subscriber base and help our service provider partners maintain and improve their revenue retention rates, while also expanding their\ncross-sell effectiveness;\n• manage our relationships with our hardware vendors and other key suppliers;\n• add, train and integrate sales and marketing personnel;\n• expand our international operations; and\n• continue to implement and improve our administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls.\nWe intend to continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions and other areas to grow our\nbusiness. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these increased investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these\ninvestments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new solutions or enhancements\nto our existing solutions and we may fail to satisfy subscriber and service provider partner requirements, maintain the quality of our solutions, execute on our\nbusiness plan or respond to competitive pressures, which could result in our financial results suffering and a decline in our stock price.\nWe have expanded our business rapidly in recent periods. If we fail to manage the expansion of our operations and infrastructure effectively, we may\nbe unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately.\nWe increased our number of full-time employees from 1,404 as of December 31, 2020 to 2,055 as of September 30, 2024. Our growth has placed, and may\ncontinue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We intend to further expand our overall\nbusiness, service provider partner network, subscriber base, headcount and operations, including by acquiring other businesses. Creating and maintaining a\nglobal organization and managing a geographically dispersed workforce requires substantial management effort and significant additional investment in our\ninfrastructure. We will be required to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting procedures to ensure timely and\naccurate reporting of our operational and financial results and we may not be able to do so effectively. As such, we may be unable to manage our expenses\neffectively in the future, which may negatively impact our gross profit or operating expenses in any particular quarter. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth\nand change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our solutions may suffer, which could negatively affect our brand\nand reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract service provider partners and consumers.\n56\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings where a negative outcome, including an adverse litigation judgment or settlement, could\nexpose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are involved and have been involved in the past in legal proceedings from time to time, including claims directly against us or claims against certain of\nour service provider partners that we have agreed to indemnify. For example, on January 10, 2022, EcoFactor, Inc., or EcoFactor, filed a lawsuit against us\nalleging Alarm.com’s products and services directly and indirectly infringe five U.S. patents owned by EcoFactor. On July 22, 2021, Causam Enterprises, Inc., or\nCausam, filed a lawsuit against us alleging that Alarm.com’s smart thermostats infringe four U.S. patents owned by Causam. See the section of this Quarterly\nReport titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information regarding each of these matters and the other legal proceedings we are involved in. We may not be\nable to accurately assess the risks related to any of these suits, and we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure as the results of any litigation,\ninvestigations and other legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in\ncostly litigation, damage our reputation, require significant amounts of management time and divert significant resource. Companies in our industry have been\nsubject to claims related to patent infringement, regulatory matters, and product liability, as well as contract and employment-related claims. As a result of patent\ninfringement and other intellectual property proceedings, we have, and may be required to seek in the future, licenses under patents or intellectual property\nrights owned by third parties, including open-source software and other commercially available software, which can be costly, or cross-license agreements\nrelating to our and third-party intellectual property. The outcome of legal claims and proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty, and a negative\noutcome could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur business operates in a regulated industry.\nOur business, operations and service provider partners are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local consumer protection laws, licensing regulation\nand other laws and regulations, and to similar laws and regulations in the other countries in which we operate. Our advertising and sales practices and that of\nour U.S. service provider partner network are subject to regulation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, in addition to state consumer protection\nlaws. The FTC and the Federal Communications Commission have issued regulations that place restrictions on, among other things, unsolicited automated\ntelephone calls to residential and wireless telephone subscribers by means of automatic telephone dialing systems and the use of prerecorded or artificial voice\nmessages. If our service provider partners were to take actions in violation of these regulations, such as telemarketing to individuals on the \"Do Not Call\" registry\nor using automatic telephone dialing systems and prerecorded or artificial voice messages, we could be subject to fines, penalties, private actions or\nenforcement actions by government regulators. Although we have taken steps to insulate ourselves from any such wrongful conduct by our service provider\npartners, and to contractually require our service provider partners to comply with these laws and regulations, we have in the past incurred costs to settle alleged\nviolations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and no assurance can be given that we will not be exposed to future liability as result of our\nservice provider partners’ conduct. Further, to the extent that any changes in law or regulation further restrict the lead generation activity of our service provider\npartners, these restrictions could result in a material reduction in subscriber acquisition opportunities, reducing the growth prospects of our business and\nadversely affecting our financial condition and future cash flows. In addition, most states in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the\nmonitored security services industry. Our business relies heavily upon cellular telephone service to communicate signals. Cellular telephone companies are\ncurrently regulated by both federal and state governments. State-level privacy and data security laws in California and various other U.S. states regulate our, and\nour service provider partners’, use, collection, and disclosure of subscribers’ personal information. A number of proposed privacy bills in other U.S. states could\nplace restrictions on how we and our service provider partners use personal information and market to consumers in those states. Other laws and regulations,\nincluding consumer protection laws, laws and regulations governing advertising and sales practices, as well as privacy and data security laws and regulations\napply in the other countries in which we operate. See “Evolving government and industry regulation and changes in applicable laws relating to the Internet and\ndata privacy may increase our expenditures related to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and\nadversely affect our financial condition” below. Furthermore, the SEC adopted expansive rules, which are currently stayed, that require public companies to\ndisclose, among other things, information about the material impact of climate change on their business, as well as information about companies’ governance,\nrisk management and strategy related to climate risk. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate, which could increase costs\nor otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any such applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our\noperating permits and licenses, including in geographic areas where our services have substantial penetration, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Further, if these laws and regulations were to change or if we fail to comply with such laws and\nregulations as they exist today or in the future, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive and many companies, including large technology companies, broadband and security\nservice providers and other managed service providers, are actively targeting the home and business automation, security monitoring, video\nmonitoring and energy management markets. If we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our sales and profitability could be\nadversely affected.\nWe compete in several markets, including security, video, automation, energy management and wellness solutions. The markets in which we participate are\nhighly competitive and competition may intensify in the future.\n57\nOur ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including:\n• our platforms and solutions’ functionality, performance, ease of use and installation, reliability, availability and cost effectiveness relative to that of our\ncompetitors’ products;\n• our success in utilizing new and proprietary technologies to offer solutions and features previously not available in the marketplace;\n• our success in identifying new markets, applications and technologies;\n• our ability to attract and retain service provider partners;\n• our name recognition and reputation;\n• our ability to recruit software engineers and sales and marketing personnel; and\n• our ability to protect our intellectual property.\nConsumers may prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of product performance or features. In the event a\nconsumer decides to evaluate a new home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring, energy management, or wellness solution, the consumer may be\nmore inclined to select one of our competitors whose product offerings are broader than those that we offer. In addition, consumers may prefer to purchase\nproducts that they can install themselves. If there are continuing restrictions on our service providers’ ability to meet with residential and commercial property\nowners in person, our ability to compete will depend on our ability to make our products available for remote installation or to make certain of our products easily\ninstallable by consumers rather than solely by our service providers.\nOur current competitors include providers of other technology platforms for the connected property with interactive security, including Alula (formed following\nthe merger of ipDatatel, LLC and Resolution Products, LLC), Avigilon Corporation, Brivo Inc., Digital Monitoring Products Inc., Eagle Eye Networks Inc.,\nHoneywell International Inc., Resideo Technologies Inc., SecureNet Technologies, LLC, Telular Corporation (acquired by AMETEK, Inc.), United Technologies\nCorporation, and Verkada Inc., which sell solutions to service providers, cable operators, technology retailers and other residential and commercial automation\nproviders. We also compete with interactive, monitored security solutions sold directly to subscribers and may also be sold through our partners, including\ncompanies like Abode Systems, Inc., Arlo Technologies, Inc., Cove Smart, LLC, Scout Security, Inc. and SimpliSafe, Inc. In addition, our service provider\npartners compete with security solutions sold directly to subscribers, as well as managed service providers, such as cable television, telephone and broadband\ncompanies like Comcast Cable Communications, LLC and Rogers Communications, Inc., and providers of point products, including Google Inc.'s Nest Labs, Inc.\nAmazon.com offers Amazon Home Services security packages with bundled equipment and professional installation, and Amazon Key, a security camera and\nsmart lock integration feature. Ring Inc., owned by Amazon.com, offers a connected video doorbell, video cameras and an integrated security system, Ring\nAlarm. Samsung's SmartThings offers a security system and a home automation and awareness hub. Arlo Technologies, Inc. and Wyze Labs, Inc. offers\nconnected video cameras, a connected video doorbell, and smart security devices. Apple Inc. offers a feature that allows some manufacturers’ connected\ndevices and accessories, including video cameras and doorbells, to be controlled through its HomeKit service available in Apple’s iOS operating system.\nAdditionally, Canary and other companies offer all in one video monitoring and awareness devices. In addition, we may compete with other large and small\ntechnology companies that offer control capabilities among their products, applications and services, and have ongoing development efforts to address the\nbroader connected home market.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical,\nsales, marketing, distribution and other resources than we have. We expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets as well as increased\ncompetition, both domestically and internationally, from other established and emerging home automation, security monitoring, video monitoring and automation,\nwellness, and energy management companies as well as large technology companies. In addition, there may be new technologies that are introduced that\nreduce demand for our solutions or make them obsolete. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves\nor with third parties and rapidly acquire significant market share. Increased competition could also result in price reductions and loss of market share, any of\nwhich could result in lower revenue and negatively affect our ability to grow our business.\nAggressive business tactics by our competitors may reduce our revenue.\nIncreased competition in the markets in which we compete may result in aggressive business tactics by our competitors, including:\n• selling at a discount;\n• offering products similar to our platforms and solutions on a bundled basis at no charge;\n58\n• announcing competing products combined with extensive marketing efforts;\n• providing financing incentives to consumers; and\n• asserting intellectual property rights irrespective of the validity of the claims.\nOur service provider partners may switch and offer the products and services of competing companies, which would adversely affect our sales and\nprofitability. Competition from other companies may also adversely affect our negotiations with service provider partners and suppliers, including, in some cases,\nrequiring us to lower our prices. Opportunities to take market share using innovative products, services and sales approaches may also attract new entrants to\nthe field. We may not be able to compete successfully with the offerings and sales tactics of other companies, which could result in the loss of service provider\npartners offering our platforms and solutions and, as a result, our revenue and profitability could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, or if our current or future competitors employ aggressive business tactics,\nincluding those described above, demand for our platforms and solutions could decline, we could experience cancellations of our services to consumers, or we\ncould be required to reduce our prices or increase our expenses.\nThe proper and efficient functioning of our network operations centers and data back-up systems is central to our solutions.\nOur solutions operate with a hosted architecture and we update our solutions regularly while our solutions are operating. If our solutions and/or upgrades fail\nto operate properly, our solutions could stop functioning for a period of time, which could put our users at risk. Our ability to keep our business operating is highly\ndependent on the proper and efficient operation of our network operations centers and data back-up systems, as well as the systems of the third-party\ntechnology providers we use to process certain information, such as video. Although our network operations centers have back-up computer and power\nsystems, if there is a catastrophic event, natural disaster, terrorist attack, security breach or other extraordinary event, we may be unable to provide our\nsubscribers with uninterrupted monitoring service or may be unable to adequately protect confidential information and data from unauthorized access or loss.\nFurthermore, because data back-up systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions (including those due to equipment damage, power outages,\nhuman error, system or software updates, computer viruses, computer hacking, data corruption and a range of other hardware, software and network problems),\nwe cannot guarantee that we will not experience data back-up failures in the future. A significant or large-scale security breach, malfunction or interruption of our\nnetwork operations centers or data back-up systems could adversely affect our ability to keep our operations running efficiently or could result in unauthorized\naccess to or loss of data. If such an event results in unauthorized access to or loss of service provider partner, subscriber, employee or other personally\nidentifiable data subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations, then it could result in substantial fines by U.S. federal and state authorities, foreign\ndata privacy authorities in the European Union, or the EU, Canada, and other countries, and/or private claims by companies or individuals. If a malfunction or\nsecurity breach results in a wider or sustained disruption, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows or\nresults of operations.\nFailure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks, including information relating to our service provider partners,\nsubscribers and employees, could adversely affect us.\nWe are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and, in the\nnormal course of our business, we collect and retain certain information pertaining to our service provider partners, subscribers and employees, including credit\ncard information for many of our service provider partners and certain of our subscribers. If security breaches in connection with the delivery of our solutions\nallow unauthorized third parties to access any of this data or obtain control of our subscribers’ systems, our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows\nand results of operations could be harmed.\nThe legal, regulatory and contractual environment surrounding information security, privacy and credit card fraud is constantly evolving and companies that\ncollect and retain such information are under increasing attack by cyber-criminals around the world. Further, as the regulatory focus on privacy issues continues\nto increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the protection of data and personal information expand and become more complex, these potential\nrisks to our business will intensify. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, fraudulent use or misuse of service provider partner, subscriber, employee or other\npersonally identifiable data, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal\nobligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in loss of confidential information,\ndamage to our reputation, early termination of our service provider partner contracts, litigation, regulatory investigations or actions and other liabilities or actions\nagainst us, including significant fines by U.S. federal and state authorities, foreign data privacy authorities in the EU, Canada, and other countries and private\nclaims by companies and individuals for violation of data privacy and security regulations. To the extent that any such exposure leads to credit card fraud or\nidentity theft, we may experience a general decline in consumer confidence in our business, which may lead to an increase in attrition rates or may make it more\ndifficult to attract new subscribers. If any one of these risks materializes our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially\nand adversely affected.\n59\nIf our security measures are breached, including any breaches caused by cyber-attacks, our reputation may be damaged, we may be exposed to\nsignificant liabilities under U.S. and foreign laws, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nCyber-attacks from computer hackers and cyber criminals and other malicious Internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and perpetrators of\ncyber-attacks may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware, malware, DNS attacks, wireless network attacks, attacks on our cloud networks,\nphishing attempts, social engineering attempts, distributed denial of service attacks and other advanced persistent threats or malicious software programs that\nattack our products and services, our networks and network endpoints or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products, services and networks.\nTechniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a\nresult, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We cannot be certain that advances in cyber-\ncapabilities or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the networks that access our platforms and solutions, and we can\nmake no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address or mitigate the negative effects of cyber-attacks or other security\nbreaches. We continue to follow our previously implemented hybrid return to office plan that includes mandatory in-office workdays and voluntary remote\nworkdays, which may make us more vulnerable to cyber-attacks or other security breaches.\nSecurity breaches of, or sustained attacks against, our networks and infrastructure could create system disruptions and shutdowns that could result in\ndisruptions to our operations or unauthorized access to or loss of our data. If such an event results in unauthorized access to or loss of any data subject to data\nprivacy and security laws and regulations, then we could be subject to substantial fines by U.S. federal and state authorities, foreign data privacy authorities in\nthe EU, Canada, and other countries, and private claims by companies or individuals. A system disruption, shutdown, or loss of data may result in adverse\npublicity and therefore adversely affect the market's perception of the security and reliability of our services. A cyber-attack may cause additional costs, such as\ninvestigative and remediation costs, and the costs of providing individuals and/or data owners with notice of the breach, legal fees and the costs of any additional\nfraud detection activities required by law, a court or a third-party. Additionally, some of our customer contracts require us to indemnify customers from damages\nthey may incur as a result of a breach of our networks and systems. There can be no assurance that the limitation of liability provisions in our contracts for a\nsecurity breach would be enforceable or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. While we maintain\ngeneral liability insurance coverage and coverage for technology errors or omissions, we cannot assure you that such coverage will be available in sufficient\namounts to cover one or more large claims related to a breach, will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all. If any one of these risks materializes,\nour business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition to the core operating environment of Alarm.com, we also have acquired businesses and subsidiaries that in some cases operate data\ninfrastructure that is distinct from the Alarm.com operating environment, and therefore have distinct data security vulnerabilities. The overall management of\ncybersecurity risk involves coordination between Alarm.com and our acquired businesses and subsidiaries, and data security risks in these entities may be\nheightened where the technology platform is less mature than the Alarm.com core platform.\nWe rely on our service provider partner network to acquire additional subscribers, and the inability of our service provider partners to attract\nadditional subscribers or retain their current subscribers could adversely affect our operating results.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is generated through the sales of our platforms and solutions by our service provider partners, who incorporate our solutions\nin certain of the products and packages they sell to their customers, and our service provider partners are responsible for subscriber acquisition, as well as\nproviding customer service and technical support for our platforms and solutions to the subscribers. We provide our service provider partners with specific\ntraining and programs to assist them in selling and providing support for our platforms and solutions, but we cannot assure you that these steps will be effective.\nIn addition, we rely on our service provider partners to sell our platforms and solutions into new markets in the intelligent and connected property space. If our\nservice provider partners are unsuccessful in marketing, selling and supporting our platforms and solutions, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn order for us to maintain our current revenue sources and grow our revenues, we must effectively manage and grow relationships with our service provider\npartners. Recruiting and retaining qualified service provider partners and training them in our technology and solutions requires significant time and resources\nand has been made more challenging by the Macroeconomic Conditions. If we fail to maintain our relationships with existing service provider partners or develop\nrelationships with new service provider partners, our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected. In addition, to execute on our strategy to\nexpand our sales internationally, we must develop, manage and grow relationships with service provider partners that sell into these markets.\nAny of our service provider partners may choose to offer a product from one of our competitors instead of our platforms and solutions, elect to develop their\nown competing solutions or simply discontinue their operations with us. For example, we entered into a Patent Cross License Agreement in November 2013 with\nVivint, pursuant to which we granted a license to use the\n60\nintellectual property associated with our connected home solutions. Under the terms of this and subsequent arrangements, Vivint has transitioned from selling\nour solutions directly to its customers to selling its own home automation product to its new customers. We now generate revenue from a monthly fee charged to\nVivint on a per customer basis from sales of this service provider partner’s product; however, these monthly fees are less on a per customer basis than fees we\nreceive from our SaaS solutions. Therefore, we receive less revenue on a per customer basis from Vivint compared to our SaaS subscriber base, which may\nresult in a lower revenue growth rate. Similarly, we entered into a patent license agreement with ADT LLC, or ADT, pursuant to which we granted a license to use\ncertain Alarm.com intellectual property following the termination or expiration of the initial term of our master service agreement with ADT. Under the terms of the\nlicense, ADT pays us a monthly royalty for each subscriber to its branded residential interactive security, automation and video service offerings that is covered\nby any of our licensed patents and not supported on our platforms. We must also work to expand our network of service provider partners to ensure that we have\nsufficient geographic coverage and technical expertise to address new markets and technologies. While it is difficult to estimate the total number of available\nservice provider partners in our markets, there are a finite number of service provider partners that are able to perform the types of technical installations\nrequired for our platforms and solutions. In the event that we saturate the available service provider pool, or if market or other forces cause the available pool of\nservice providers to decline, it may be increasingly difficult to grow our business. If we are unable to expand our network of service provider partners, our\nbusiness could be harmed.\nAs consumers’ product and service options grow, it is important that we enhance our service provider partner footprint by broadening the expertise of our\nservice provider partners, working with larger and more sophisticated service provider partners and expanding the mainstream solutions our service provider\npartners offer. If we do not succeed in this effort, our current and potential future service provider partners may be unable or unwilling to broaden their offerings\nto include our connected property solutions, resulting in harm to our business.\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of service provider partners, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in,\norders from one or more of our major service provider partners would result in decreased revenue and profitability.\nOur success is highly dependent upon establishing and maintaining successful relationships with a variety of service provider partners. We market and sell\nour platforms and solutions through a channel assisted sales model and we derive substantially all of our revenue from these service provider partners. We\ngenerally enter into agreements with our service provider partners outlining the terms of our relationship, including service provider pricing commitments,\ninstallation, maintenance and support requirements, and our sales registration process for registering potential sales to subscribers. These service provider\ncontracts typically have an initial term of one year, with subsequent renewal terms of one year, and are terminable at the end of the initial term or renewal terms\nwithout cause upon written notice to the other party. In some cases, these contracts provide the service provider partner with the right to terminate prior to the\nexpiration of the term without cause upon 30 days written notice, or, in the case of certain termination events, the right to terminate the contract immediately.\nWhile we have developed a network of service provider partners to sell, install and support our platforms and solutions, we receive a substantial portion of our\nrevenue from a limited number of channel partners and significant customers. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, our 10 largest\nrevenue service provider partners or distributors accounted for 50%, 49% and 47% of our revenue, respectively. ADT represented greater than 15% but not more\nthan 20% of our revenue in 2023, 2022 and 2021. ADT also represented more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023.\nWe amended our master service agreement with ADT, or MSA, to extend the initial term through January 1, 2023, which also includes subsequent renewal\nterms of one year unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal. The amendment to the MSA also provides for the integration of certain third-party\nproducts into the ADT Command and Control software platform which we operate. In connection with the amendment to the MSA, we agreed to provide ADT a\nlicense to use certain Alarm.com intellectual property following the termination or expiration of the initial term of the MSA for which ADT pays us a monthly royalty\nfor each subscriber to its ADT branded residential interactive security, automation and video service offerings that is covered by any of our licensed patents and\nnot enabled by one of our software platforms. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the conditions set forth in the amended agreement. We\ncontinue to generate revenue from each subscriber that is already installed on one of our platforms for the life of that subscriber account but the number of such\nsubscribers would likely decline over time. While we would generate revenue from ADT subscribers not on our platform using service offerings covered by any of\nour licensed patents from the per subscriber royalty fee charged to ADT under the patent license, these monthly fees will be less on a per subscriber basis than\nfees we receive from our SaaS solutions. In addition, even if ADT continues to use other services that we offer, we cannot assure you that the revenue from ADT\nor new accounts added by ADT will reach or exceed historical levels in any future period. We may not be able to offset any unanticipated decline in revenue from\nADT with revenues from new customers or other existing customers. Any negative developments in ADT’s business, or any significant decrease in revenue from\nor loss of ADT as a customer could materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to be dependent upon a limited number of service provider partners for a significant portion of our revenue for the\nforeseeable future and, in some cases, a portion of our revenue attributable to individual service provider partners may increase in the future. The loss of one or\nmore key service provider partners, a reduction in sales through any major service provider partners or the inability or unwillingness of any of our major service\nprovider partners to pay for our platforms and solutions would reduce our revenue and could impair our profitability.\n61\nSubstantially all of the revenues associated with the non-hosted software platform are from a single customer and the loss of this customer could\nharm our operating results.\nIn March 2017, we acquired certain assets related to the Connect business unit of Icontrol Networks, Inc., or Icontrol, and all of the outstanding equity\ninterests of the two subsidiaries through which Icontrol conducted its Piper business, which we refer to in this report as the Acquisition. Historically, ADT has\naccounted for, and continues to account for, substantially all of the revenue of the Connect business unit. In connection with the Acquisition we amended our\nMSA with ADT to cover services provided with respect to the non-hosted software platform, or Software platform. We cannot assure you that ADT will use the\nSoftware platform for its new customers or keep existing customers on the Software platform. In addition, even if ADT continues to use the Software platform, we\ncannot assure you that the revenue from ADT or new accounts added by ADT will reach or exceed historical levels of revenue for the Connect business unit in\nany future period. Any negative developments in ADT’s business, or any significant decrease in revenue from or loss of ADT as a customer could materially and\nadversely harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe have relatively limited visibility regarding the consumers that ultimately purchase our solutions, and we often rely on information from third-party\nservice providers to help us manage our business. If these service providers fail to provide timely or accurate information, our ability to quickly react\nto market changes and effectively manage our business may be harmed.\nWe sell our solutions through service provider partners. These service provider partners work with consumers to design, install, update and maintain their\nconnected home and commercial installations and manage the relationship with our subscribers. While we are able to track orders from service provider partners\nand have access to certain information about the configurations of their Alarm.com systems that we receive through our platforms, we also rely on service\nprovider partners to provide us with information about consumer behavior, product and system feedback, consumer demographics and buying patterns. We use\nthis channel sell-through data, along with other metrics, to forecast our revenue, assess consumer demand for our solution, develop new solutions, adjust pricing\nand make other strategic business decisions. Channel sell-through data is subject to limitations due to collection methods and the third-party nature of the data\nand thus may not be complete or accurate. If we do not receive consumer information on a timely or accurate basis, or if we do not properly interpret this\ninformation, our ability to quickly react to market changes and effectively manage our business may be harmed.\nConsumers may choose to adopt point products that provide control of discrete functions rather than adopting our connected property solutions. If\nwe are unable to increase market awareness of the benefits of our unified solutions, our revenue may not continue to grow, or it may decline.\nMany vendors have emerged, and may continue to emerge, to provide point products with advanced functionality for use in connected properties, such as a\nvideo doorbell or thermostat that can be controlled by an application on a smartphone. We expect more and more consumer electronic and consumer appliance\nproducts to be network-aware and connected — each very likely to have its own smart device (phone or tablet) application. Consumers may be attracted to the\nrelatively low costs of these point products and the ability to expand their connected property control solution over time with minimal upfront costs, despite some\nof the disadvantages of this approach, which may reduce demand for our connected property solutions. If so, our service provider partners may switch and offer\nthe point products and services of competing companies, which would adversely affect our sales and profitability. If a significant number of consumers in our\ntarget market choose to adopt point products rather than our connected property solutions, then our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of\noperations will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve sustained growth or our business may decline.\nMergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our ability to\ncompete effectively and harm our results of operations.\nOur industry is highly fragmented, and we believe it is likely that some of our existing competitors will consolidate or be acquired. In addition, some of our\ncompetitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting\nfirms or other parties. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and lead to\npricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of\nwhich could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our connected property solutions, and the lack of continued market acceptance of our connected property solutions would\nresult in lower revenue.\nOur connected property solutions account for substantially all of our revenue and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. As a result, our revenue\ncould be reduced by:\n• any decline in demand for our connected property solutions;\n• the failure of our connected property solutions to achieve continued market acceptance;\n62\n• the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for, or represent an improvement over, our connected property\nsolutions;\n• technological innovations or new communications standards our connected property solutions do not address; and\n• our inability to release enhanced versions of our connected property solutions on a timely basis.\nWe are vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for Internet-connected devices in general and interactive security systems in particular. If the market for\nconnected home and commercial solutions grows more slowly than anticipated or if demand for connected home and commercial solutions does not grow as\nquickly as anticipated, whether as a result of competition, product obsolescence, technological change, unfavorable economic conditions, uncertain geopolitical\nenvironments, budgetary constraints of our consumers or other factors, we may not be able to continue to increase our revenue and earnings and our stock\nprice would decline.\nA significant decline in our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and\nresults of operations.\nWe generally bill our service provider partners based on the number of subscribers they have on our platforms and the features being utilized by subscribers\non a monthly basis in advance. Subscribers could elect to terminate our services in any given month. If our efforts and our service provider partners’ efforts to\nsatisfy our existing subscribers are not successful, we may not be able to retain them or sell additional functionality to them and, as a result, our revenue and\nability to grow could be adversely affected. We track our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate on an annualized basis, as reflected in the section\nof this Quarterly Report titled \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Other Business Metrics — SaaS and\nLicense Revenue Renewal Rate.\" However, our service provider partners, who resell our services to our subscribers, have indicated that they typically have\nthree to five-year service contracts with residential and commercial property owners who use our solutions. Our SaaS and license revenue renewal rate is\ncalculated across our entire subscriber base, including subscribers whose contract with their service provider reached the end of its contractual term during the\nmeasurement period, as well as subscribers whose contract with their service provider has not reached the end of its contractual term during the measurement\nperiod, and is not intended to estimate the rate at which our subscribers renew their contracts with our service provider partners. As a result, we may not be able\nto accurately predict future trends in renewals and the resulting churn. Subscribers may choose not to renew their contracts for many reasons, including the\nbelief our service is not required for their needs or is otherwise not cost-effective, a desire to reduce discretionary spending, or a belief our competitors’ services\nprovide better value. Additionally, our subscribers may not renew for reasons entirely out of our control, such as moving a residence or the dissolution of their\nbusiness, which is particularly common for small to mid-sized businesses. A significant increase in our churn would have an adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop new solutions, sell our platforms and solutions into new markets or further penetrate our existing markets, our revenue\nmay not grow as expected.\nOur ability to increase sales will depend, in large part, on our ability to enhance and improve our platforms and solutions, introduce new solutions in a timely\nmanner, sell into new markets and further penetrate our existing markets. The success of any enhancement or new solution or service depends on several\nfactors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of enhanced or new solutions, the ability to maintain and develop relationships with\nservice providers, the ability to attract, retain and effectively train sales and marketing personnel and the effectiveness of our marketing programs. Any new\nproduct or service we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, and may not achieve the broad market acceptance\nnecessary to generate significant revenue. Any new markets into which we attempt to sell our platforms and solutions, including new vertical markets and new\ncountries or regions, may not be receptive. Our ability to further penetrate our existing markets depends on the quality, availability and reliability of our platforms\nand solutions and our ability to design our platforms and solutions to meet consumer demand.\nWe benefit from integration of our solutions with third-party platform providers. If these developers choose not to partner with us, or are acquired by\nour competitors, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur solutions are incorporated into the hardware of our third-party platform providers. For example, our hardware platform partners produce control devices\nthat deliver our platform services to subscribers. It may be necessary in the future to renegotiate agreements relating to various aspects of these solutions or\nother third-party solutions. The inability to easily integrate with, or any defects in or disruption in the supply or availability of, any third-party solutions could result\nin increased costs, or in delays in new product releases or updates to our existing solutions until such issues have been resolved, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and future prospects and could damage our reputation. In addition, if these\nthird-party solution providers choose not to partner with us, choose to integrate their solutions with our competitors’ platforms, or are unable or unwilling to\nupdate their solutions, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed. Further, if third-party solution providers that we\npartner with or that we would benefit from partnering with are acquired by our competitors, they may choose not to offer their solutions on our platforms, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\n63\nWe rely on wireless carriers to provide access to wireless networks through which we provide our wireless alarm, notification and intelligent\nautomation services, and any interruption of such access and any significant costs related to such interruption could materially and adversely\nimpact our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operation and reputation.\nWe rely on wireless carriers to provide access to wireless networks for machine-to-machine data transmissions, which are an integral part of our services.\nOur wireless carriers may suspend wireless service to expand, maintain or improve their networks, or may discontinue or sunset older wireless networks as new\ntechnology evolves. For example, certain cellular carriers shut down their 3G and CDMA wireless networks in 2022 which required our subscribers to upgrade to\nalternative and potentially more expensive technologies. See “The technology we employ may become obsolete and we may need to incur significant capital\nexpenditures to update our technology” below. Further, wireless carriers from time to time suffer service outages which range from local to national in scale\nduring which security control panels may be unable to transmit life safety signals to emergency responders. Any such wireless carrier service disruptions could\nmaterially and adversely impact our ability to provide services to our service provider partners and subscribers and result in significant costs, which could\nmaterially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and reputation. In addition, product changes by wireless carriers, price increases or changes\nto existing contract terms or termination of our agreements could also have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and\nresults of operations.\nIf we are unable to adapt to technological change, including maintaining compatibility with a wide range of devices, our ability to remain competitive\ncould be impaired.\nThe market for connected home and commercial solutions is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products and\nevolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new subscribers and increase revenue from existing subscribers will depend in significant part on our ability to\nanticipate changes in industry standards, to continue to enhance our existing solutions or introduce new solutions on a timely basis to keep pace with\ntechnological developments, and to maintain compatibility with a wide range of connected devices in residential and commercial properties. We may change\naspects of our platforms and may utilize open source technology in the future, which may cause difficulties including compatibility, stability and time to market.\nThe success of any enhanced or new product or solution will depend on several factors, including the timely completion and market acceptance of the enhanced\nor new product or solution. Similarly, if any of our competitors implement new technologies before we are able to implement them, those competitors may be\nable to provide more effective products than ours, possibly at lower prices. Any delay or failure in the introduction of new or enhanced solutions could harm our\nbusiness, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe technology we employ may become obsolete and we may need to incur significant capital expenditures to update our technology.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological innovation. Our platforms and solutions interact with the hardware and software technology of systems\nand devices located at our subscribers’ properties and we depend upon cellular, broadband and other telecommunications providers to provide communication\npaths to our subscribers in a timely and efficient manner. We may be required to implement new technologies or adapt existing technologies in response to\nchanging market conditions, consumer preferences or industry standards, which could require significant capital expenditures. The discontinuation of cellular\ncommunication technology, cellular networks or other services by telecommunications service providers can affect our services and require our subscribers to\nupgrade to alternative and potentially more expensive, technologies. For example, certain cellular carriers shut down their 3G and CDMA wireless networks in\n2022. We worked with our service providers to convert or upgrade the equipment of end user accounts reliant upon 3G or CDMA networks, and we incurred\ncosts and may continue to incur costs related to the 3G and CDMA network shutdown. If our service providers are not able to convert or upgrade the equipment\nof their customers who are currently using 3G or CDMA network technology, then those accounts may be terminated with us or we may not be able to bill for\nsuch accounts when such networks are no longer available which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIt is also possible that one or more of our competitors could develop a significant technical advantage that allows them to provide additional or superior\nquality products or services, or to lower their price for similar products or services, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our inability to adapt to\nchanging technologies, market conditions or consumer preferences in a timely manner could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition,\ncash flows or results of operations.\nWe depend on our suppliers. The loss of any key supplier or the inability of a key supplier to deliver their products to us on time or at the contracted\nprice would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur hardware products depend on the availability and quality of components that we procure from third-party suppliers, some of which are supplied by\nsingle or limited source suppliers. Reliance on suppliers generally involves several risks, including increased costs, the possibility of defective parts, and loss of\na supplier due to their ability to effectively manage their own supply chain, ability to obtain a contract on commercially reasonable terms, bankruptcy, or other\nevents, which can adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our platforms and solutions and our profitability. In addition, from time to time we provide\nadvance\n64\npayments or loans to our vendors to, for example, secure procurement of long lead time parts or to provide bridge financing to ensure continuity of operations.\nWe are also dependent on industry supply conditions and subject to supply chain risks, including a shortage of components and reduced control over delivery\nschedules and increases in component costs, which can also adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our platforms and solutions and our profitability.\nThese supply chain risks would be heightened in the event health precautions such as travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders are implemented. In\naddition, limitations on factory capacity, including labor shortages, and delays in shipping times due to the Macroeconomic Conditions have in the past and may\nin the future adversely affect production of and the timing of delivery of components. While the global shortage of semiconductors used in our video, cellular\ncommunicator, and other products has eased, shortages of essential components of our products or significantly increased lead times for obtaining such\ncomponents may lead to delays in our production, and we may be unable to fulfill orders for our hardware products on a timely basis or at all. Even if we are able\nto procure components from alternative sources, we may be required to pay more for them, which could adversely affect our profitability. We are working with our\nsuppliers to secure components and materials to account for the continued longer lead times and limited availability, but we cannot assure you our efforts will be\nsuccessful or that demand for our hardware products will continue at the same level. In addition, global transportation disruptions have led to slower shipping\ntimes generally, while fluctuations in passenger air travel have also led to reduced capacity and increased costs for air freight shipments, which may continue to\nadversely affect the timing and cost of delivery of components, materials and products. Any of these disruptions to our inventory and supply chain could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We have several large hardware suppliers from which we\nprocure hardware on a purchase order basis, including three key suppliers that supplied products and components of our inventory which collectively\nrepresented 41% of our hardware revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (25%, 8% and 8% of hardware revenue, respectively). The failure of\nany of these key suppliers or their subcomponent suppliers to deliver product on time or at the contracted price would materially and adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. We are working with any impacted suppliers and their subcomponent provider to determine\nthe amount and timing of any shortfall and to mitigate risks in this part of our supply chain, but we may not be successful. In addition, we rely on third-party\ntechnology providers for certain critical functions, such as processing and storing video. If our suppliers or technology providers are unable to continue to provide\nagreed upon supply or services, we could experience interruptions in delivery of our platforms and solutions to our service provider partners, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. If we were required to find alternative sources of supply,\nqualification of alternative suppliers and the establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays, loss of sales and/or less profitable sales, any of which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on market awareness and a strong brand, and any failure to develop, maintain, protect and enhance our brand\nwould hurt our ability to retain or attract subscribers.\nWe believe building and maintaining market awareness, brand recognition and goodwill in a cost-effective manner is important to our overall success in\nachieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future solutions and is an important element in attracting new service provider partners and subscribers. An\nimportant part of our business strategy is to increase service provider and consumer awareness of our brand and to provide marketing leadership, services and\nsupport to our service provider partner network. This will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high-quality solutions, and we may not be able to do\nso effectively. While we may choose to engage in a broader marketing campaign to further promote our brand, this effort may not be successful. Our efforts in\ndeveloping our brand may be hindered by the marketing efforts of our competitors and our reliance on our service provider partners and strategic partners to\npromote our brand. If we are unable to cost-effectively maintain and increase awareness of our brand, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of\noperations could be harmed.\nWe operate in the emerging and evolving connected property market, which may develop more slowly or differently than we expect. If the connected\nproperty market does not grow as we expect, or if we cannot expand our platforms and solutions to meet the demands of this market, our revenue\nmay decline, fail to grow or fail to grow at an accelerated rate, and we may incur operating losses.\nThe market for solutions that bring objects and systems not typically connected to the Internet, such as home automation, security monitoring, video\nmonitoring, energy management and wellness solutions, into an Internet-like structure is still developing, and it is uncertain how rapidly or how consistently this\nmarket will continue to develop and the degree to which our platforms and solutions will be accepted into the markets in which we operate. Some consumers\nmay be reluctant or unwilling to use our platforms and solutions for a number of reasons, including satisfaction with traditional solutions, concerns about\nadditional costs, concerns about data privacy and lack of awareness of the benefits of our platforms and solutions. Our ability to expand the sales of our\nplatforms and solutions into new markets depends on several factors, including the awareness of our platforms and solutions, the timely completion, introduction\nand market acceptance of our platforms and solutions, the ability to attract, retain and effectively train sales and marketing personnel, the ability to develop\nrelationships with service providers, the effectiveness of our marketing programs, the costs of our platforms and solutions and the success of our competitors. If\nwe are unsuccessful in developing and marketing our platforms and solutions into new markets, or if consumers do not perceive or value the benefits of our\nplatforms and solutions, the market for our platforms and solutions might not continue to develop or might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which\nwould harm our revenue and growth prospects.\n65\nRisks of liability from our operations are significant.\nThe nature of the solutions we provide, including our interactive security solutions, and new technologies and companies we may acquire, potentially\nexposes us to greater risks of liability for data privacy and security, employee acts or omissions, or technology or system failure than may be inherent in other\nbusinesses. Substantially all of our service provider partner agreements contain provisions limiting our liability to service provider partners and our subscribers in\nan attempt to reduce this risk. However, in the event of litigation with respect to these matters, we cannot assure you that these limitations will be enforced, and\nthe costs of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, in the event of any regulatory investigations or actions against us related to\nthese matters, we could be subject to additional risks and liabilities, including significant fines by U.S. federal and state authorities, foreign data privacy\nauthorities in the EU, Canada, and other countries, in addition to the costs of such investigations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. In\naddition, there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured for these risks. Certain of our insurance policies and the laws of some states may limit or\nprohibit insurance coverage for punitive or certain other types of damages or liability arising from gross negligence.\nOur strategy includes pursuing acquisitions, and our potential inability to successfully integrate newly-acquired technologies, assets or businesses\nmay harm our financial results. Future acquisitions of technologies, assets or businesses which are paid for partially or entirely through the issuance\nof stock or stock rights could dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders.\nWe believe part of our growth will continue to be driven by acquisitions of other companies or their technologies, assets and businesses. For example, on\nApril 21, 2023, we acquired certain assets of Vintra, on January 18, 2023, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of EBS, on\nSeptember 23, 2022, we acquired 85% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Noonlight, Inc., on October 21, 2019, we acquired 85% of the\nissued and outstanding shares of capital stock of PC Open Incorporated, doing business as OpenEye, and on December 14, 2020, we acquired Shooter\nDetection Systems, LLC. Additionally, on December 16, 2021, our EnergyHub subsidiary acquired certain assets of an unrelated third party. Substantially all of\nthe acquired assets consisted of developed technology. These acquisitions and any other acquisitions we may complete in the future will give rise to certain\nrisks, including:\n• incurring higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses;\n• failing to assimilate and integrate the operations and personnel or failing to retain the key personnel of the acquired company or business;\n• failing to retain customers and service providers and other third-party business partners seeking to terminate or renegotiate their relationships with us;\n• failing to integrate the acquired technologies, or incurring significant expense to integrate acquired technologies into our platforms and solutions;\n• disrupting our ongoing business;\n• encountering complexities associated with managing a larger, more complex and growing business;\n• diverting our management’s attention and other company resources;\n• failing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies;\n• incurring significant accounting charges;\n• impairing relationships with employees, service provider partners or subscribers;\n• finding that the acquired technology, asset or business does not further our business strategy, that we overpaid for the technology, asset or business or\nthat we may be required to write off acquired assets or investments partially or entirely;\n• failing to realize the expected synergies of the transaction;\n• being exposed to unforeseen liabilities and contingencies that were not identified prior to acquiring the company; and\n• being unable to generate sufficient revenue and profits from acquisitions to offset the associated acquisition costs.\nFully integrating an acquired technology, asset or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. We may not be successful in\novercoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions. To the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems\nrelated to any such acquisitions, or fail to manage the acquired business or execute our integration and growth strategy in an efficient and effective manner, our\nbusiness, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed. Acquisitions also could impact our financial position and capital\nrequirements, or could\n66\ncause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results of operations. Acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets, which may result in\nfuture impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings. We may incur significant costs in our efforts to engage in strategic transactions and these\nexpenditures may not result in successful acquisitions.\nWe expect that the consideration we might pay for any future acquisitions of technologies, assets or businesses could include stock, rights to purchase\nstock, cash or some combination of the foregoing. If we issue stock or rights to purchase stock in connection with future acquisitions, net income per share and\nthen-existing holders of our common stock may experience dilution.\nWe may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our current business model, which may cause our business to suffer.\nWe may pursue business opportunities that diverge from our current business model, including but not limited to expanding our platforms and solutions and\ninvesting in new and unproven technologies. We can offer no assurance that any such new business opportunities will prove to be successful. Among other\nnegative effects, our pursuit of such business opportunities could reduce operating margins and require more working capital, subject us to additional federal\nstate, and local laws and regulations, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nEvolving government and industry regulation and changes in applicable laws relating to the Internet and data privacy may increase our expenditures\nrelated to compliance efforts or otherwise limit the solutions we can offer, which may harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs Internet commerce continues to evolve, federal, state or foreign agencies have adopted and could in the future adopt regulations covering issues such\nas user privacy and content. We are particularly sensitive to these risks because the Internet is a critical component of our SaaS business model. In addition,\ntaxation of products or services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the\nInternet may be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in\nthe use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based services, which could harm our business.\nOur platforms and solutions enable us to collect, manage and store a wide range of data related to our subscribers’ interactive security, intelligent\nautomation, video monitoring, energy management and wellness systems. A valuable component of our platforms and solutions is our ability to analyze this data\nto present the user with actionable business intelligence. We obtain our data from a variety of sources, including our service provider partners, our subscribers\nand third-party providers. We cannot assure that the data we require for our proprietary data sets will be available from these sources in the future or that the\ncost of such data will not increase. The United States federal government and various state governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection,\ndistribution, storage and use of personal information. Several foreign jurisdictions in which we do business, including the European Union, the United Kingdom,\nCanada and Argentina, among others, have adopted legislation (including directives or regulations) that is more rigorous governing data collection and storage\nthan in the United States.\nOn June 28, 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA\ngoverns the collection, sale and use of California residents’ personal information, and significantly impacts businesses’ handling of personal information and\nprivacy policies and procedures. The CCPA, as well as data privacy laws that have been adopted or proposed in over a dozen other states such as Virginia,\nColorado, Connecticut, Texas and Utah, may limit our ability to use, process and store certain data, which may decrease adoption of our platforms and solutions,\naffect our relationships with service provider partners and our suppliers, increase our costs for compliance, and harm our business, financial condition, cash\nflows and results of operations. Specifically, the CCPA may subject us to regulatory fines by the State of California, individual claims, class actions, and\nincreased commercial liabilities. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, was approved by California voters and became effective as of\nJanuary 1, 2023. The CPRA, among other things, amended the CCPA by creating additional privacy rights for California consumers and additional obligations on\nbusinesses, which could subject us to additional compliance costs as well as potential fines, individual claims, class actions and commercial liabilities. The CPRA\nalso extended the CCPA’s scope to include employees’ and business contacts’ personal information, which may increase our compliance costs, legal costs and\nother costs of doing business.\nEuropean data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, generally restrict the transfer of personal data from Europe,\nincluding the European Economic Area, or EEA, UK and Switzerland, to the United States and most other countries unless the parties to the transfer have\nimplemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal data. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, invalidated the\nEU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, a program for transferring personal data from the EEA to the United States. The ruling also raised questions about whether\none of the primary alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, namely the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, can lawfully be used\nfor transfers from the EEA to the United States or most other countries. While the CJEU did not invalidate the use of SCCs as a valid mechanism for transferring\npersonal data from the EEA to the United States, the CJEU required entities relying on SCCs to, among other things, verify on a case-by-case basis that the\nSCCs provide adequate protection of personal data under European Union, or EU, law by providing, where necessary, additional safeguards to those offered by\nthe existing SCCs. For data transfers to the United States, these additional safeguards must be added to the SCCs in\n67\norder for entities to use SCCs as a valid data transfer mechanism. Furthermore, the CJEU and the European Data Protection Board advised European data\nprotection authorities that they would need to closely examine the laws and practices of countries outside of the EEA where EEA personal data is transferred,\nwith a particular focus on the United States, so data transfers to the United States from the EEA are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny following the CJEU\ndecision.\nWe have historically relied on both the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and SCCs for transferring personal data from the EEA, and as a result of the CJEU ruling, we\nhave transitioned our data transfers covered under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield to be covered under SCCs. In June 2021, the European Commission adopted a\nnew version of the SCCs, which we began using on September 27, 2021. Moreover, the UK data protection regulator developed new SCCs for transferring\npersonal data from the UK that were finalized in March 2022, and we use the new UK SCCs with our current and future customers in the UK. In July 2023, the\nEU-U.S. Privacy Shield was replaced by the Data Privacy Framework, or DPF, and we have been automatically enrolled in this program given our existing EU-\nU.S. Privacy Shield enrollment. We are also enrolled in the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Effective October 12, 2023, organizations participating in the UK\nExtension to the EU-U.S. DPF may receive personal data from the UK and Gibraltar in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF.\nOur work adopting, implementing and complying with the changing legal landscape governing international data transfers slows down our contracting\nprocess and increases our legal and compliance costs (including an increase in exposure to substantial fines under EEA data protection laws, increasing\nrequests from our customers for compliance-related product changes, as well as injunctions against processing or transferring personal data from the EEA),\nwhich could adversely affect our cash flows and financial condition. SCCs with additional safeguards and obligations put in place by EEA data protection\nauthorities or customers may impose new restrictions on our business and could affect our operations in the EEA.\nIn September 2020, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner, or FDPIC, determined that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework\ndoes not provide an adequate level of data protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the U.S. While the FDPIC does not have the authority to invalidate\nthe Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, the FDPIC’s announcement casts serious doubt on the viability of the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield as a valid mechanism for Swiss-\nU.S. data transfers. As a result of the FDPIC decision, we will need to transition any data transfers covered under the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield to be covered\nunder SCCs or the Swiss-U.S. DPF once Switzerland adopts an adequacy decision. For data transfers from Switzerland, Alarm.com will continue to rely upon\nthe SCCs adopted by the European Commission in August 2021 with any necessary modifications required by the regulatory authorities in Switzerland.\nAs a result of these ongoing changes, there will continue to be significant regulatory uncertainty surrounding the validity of data transfers from the EEA, UK\nand Switzerland to the United States. The inability to import personal data from the EEA, UK or Switzerland may require us to increase our data processing\ncapabilities in those jurisdictions at significant expense. Various other non-EU jurisdictions may also choose to impose data localization laws limiting the transfer\nof personal data out of their respective jurisdictions, or our EEA, UK or Swiss service provider partners may require similar contractual restrictions regarding data\nlocalization. Such laws or contractual restrictions may increase our costs for compliance, and harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of\noperations.\nThe EU's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect on May 25, 2018. Prior to May 25, 2018, we updated our existing privacy and data\nsecurity measures to comply with GDPR. As guidance on compliance with GDPR from the EU data protection authorities evolves over time, our privacy or data\nsecurity measures may be deemed or perceived to be in noncompliance with current or future laws and regulations, which may subject us to litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations or other liabilities and could limit the products and services we can offer in certain jurisdictions. Further, in the event of a breach of personal\ninformation that we hold, we may be subject to governmental fines, individual claims, remediation expenses and/or harm to our reputation. Moreover, if future\nlaws, regulations, or court rulings, such as the CJEU’s decision invalidating the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, limit our ability to use and share this data or our ability to\nstore, process and share data over the Internet, demand for our platforms and solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our business, financial\ncondition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed.\nIn Canada, data privacy laws have been subject to recent amendments that have introduced stricter compliance requirements and increased potential\nsanctions. The Province of Quebec enacted extensive amendments to its private-sector data privacy laws in 2021, which will become fully in force as of\nSeptember 2024. Key changes include mandatory breach reporting, elevated consent and transparency requirements, the introduction of individual privacy\nrights such as privacy by default, data portability and the right to be forgotten, privacy impact assessments, and substantial monetary penalties for non-\ncompliance. These changes to Quebec’s data privacy laws may have similar impacts on our business as the CCPA and other privacy law reforms in other\njurisdictions.\nFurthermore, Brazil’s comprehensive privacy law, the General Data Protection Law, or LGPD, took effect on September 18, 2020 and federal regulatory\nenforcement began on August 1, 2021. However, private and state-level enforcement of the law began in September 2020. The LGPD creates a new legal\nframework for the use, processing and storage of Brazilians’ personal data, and it adds significant privacy and security obligations for companies processing\npersonal data in Brazil. The LGPD may limit our and our service providers’ ability to use, process and store certain data, which may decrease adoption of our\nplatforms and solutions, affect our relationships with our service provider partners and suppliers, increase our costs for compliance, and\n68\nharm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, the LGPD may subject us to regulatory fines by the Brazilian Data\nProtection Authority and increased commercial liabilities.\nSince April 2018 we have offered a solution for certain service provider partners who may be subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\nAct of 1996, and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, which regulates the use and disclosure of Protected Health Information, or PHI. As a result, we are\nsubject to HIPAA when PHI is accessed, created, maintained or transmitted through our solution by these service provider partners. We have implemented\nadditional privacy and security policies and procedures, as well as administrative, physical and technical safeguards to enable our solution to be HIPAA-\ncompliant. Additionally, HIPAA compliance has required us to put in place certain agreements with contracting partners and to appoint a Privacy Officer and\nSecurity Officer. If our privacy and security policies or other safeguards for PHI are deemed to be in noncompliance by the United States Department of Health\nand Human Services, or HHS, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities. In the event of a breach of PHI that we hold, we may\nbe subject to governmental fines, individual claims under state privacy laws governing personal health information, remediation expenses and/or harm to our\nreputation. The use of health-related data is coming under increasing regulatory scrutiny in other ways. Several U.S. states, such as Washington, Nevada, and\nConnecticut, have passed health privacy laws, which may increase the risk of regulatory actions or consumer class actions being brought against Alarm.com.\nThese laws may also increase our costs of doing business as well as legal costs, and slow down our contracting process. Moreover, the FTC has brought a\nseries of regulatory enforcement actions relating to companies’ use of health-related data, which may increase our regulatory risk. Furthermore, if future changes\nto HIPAA or state privacy laws governing PHI expand the definition of PHI or put more restrictions on our ability to use, process and store PHI, then HIPAA\ncompliance for our solutions as currently constituted may be costly both financially and in terms of administrative resources. Ongoing compliance efforts may\ntake substantial time and require the assistance of external resources, such as attorneys, information technology, and/or other consultants and advisors.\nLaws and regulations relating to the use of certain video data for training and analytics purposes continue to change. Specifically, the use of facial images\nand other biometric data in the training of video models has been subject to increased scrutiny and in some cases regulatory review. The FTC as well as certain\nstates and individuals have brought legal actions against companies regarding the collection and use of facial and biometric information for product development\nand other purposes. We account for these laws and regulations in our product development cycle, which may impact the scope and timing of the products we\nmake available.\nUse of artificial intelligence in our operations and product offerings could result in reputational or competitive harm, legal or regulatory liability and\nadverse impacts on our results of operations.\nWe have incorporated, and expect to continue to incorporate in the future, artificial intelligence, or AI, solutions into our operations and product offerings,\nand the use of AI involves various risks and challenges that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We currently use AI\nto help improve our business management solutions for service provider partners and advance our data analytics engine. For example, we leverage large\nlanguage models for the Gopher Info feature of our service provider solutions, an AI-powered chat bot assistant for technicians and service providers designed\nto improve service provider efficiency and operations. The development and deployment of AI systems involve inherent technical complexities and uncertainties,\nand our AI systems may encounter unexpected technical difficulties, limitations or errors, including inaccuracies in data processing or flawed algorithms, which\ncould compromise the reliability and effectiveness of our products and services based on AI. In addition, our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI\ninto their products more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively.\nThe use of AI applications, including large language models, has resulted in, and may in the future result in, cybersecurity incidents that implicate the\npersonal data of end users of such applications. Any such cybersecurity incidents related to our use of AI applications could adversely affect our reputation and\nresults of operations. AI also presents emerging ethical issues, and if our use of AI becomes controversial, we may experience brand or reputational harm,\ncompetitive harm, regulatory scrutiny or legal liability.\nThe introduction of AI technologies into our products and services may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation,\nconfidentiality or security risks or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial results. The regulatory landscape governing\nAI technologies is evolving rapidly, and changes in laws, regulations or enforcement practices may impose new compliance requirements, restrict certain AI\napplications or increase our regulatory obligations, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on the performance of our senior management and highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to attract, retain and motivate well-qualified\nemployees, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of senior management and key personnel, including Stephen\nTrundle, our Chief Executive Officer, and our senior information technology managers. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop,\nmotivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. In\naddition, the loss of any of our senior management or key personnel could interrupt our ability to execute our business plan, as such individuals may be difficult\nto replace. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our\n69\nbusiness and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe provide minimum service level commitments to certain of our service provider partners, and our failure to meet them could cause us to issue\ncredits for future services or pay penalties, which could harm our results of operations.\nCertain of our service provider partner agreements currently, and may in the future, provide minimum service level commitments regarding items such as\nuptime, functionality or performance. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments for these service provider partners or suffer extended\nperiods of service unavailability, we are or may be contractually obligated to provide these service provider partners with credits for future services, provide\nservices at no cost or pay other penalties, which could adversely impact our revenue. We have incurred such penalties in the past, which have reduced our\nrevenue. We do not currently have any reserves on our balance sheet for these commitments.\nWe have indemnity obligations to certain of our service provider partners for certain expenses and liabilities, which could force us to incur\nsubstantial costs.\nWe have indemnity obligations to certain of our service provider partners for certain claims regarding our platforms and solutions, including security breach,\nproduct recall, epidemic failure, and product liability claims. As a result, in the case of any such claims against these service provider partners, we could be\nrequired to indemnify them for losses resulting from such claims or to refund amounts they have paid to us. We expect that some of our service provider partners\nmay seek indemnification from us in the event that such claims are brought against them. In addition, we may elect to indemnify service provider partners where\nwe have no contractual obligation to do so and we will evaluate each such request on a case-by-case basis. If a service provider partner elects to invest\nresources in enforcing a claim for indemnification against us, we could incur significant costs disputing it. If we do not succeed in disputing it, we could face\nsubstantial liability. See \"We have indemnity obligations to certain of our service provider partners for certain expenses and liabilities resulting from intellectual\nproperty infringement claims regarding our platforms and solutions, which could force us to incur substantial costs\" below for details on indemnity obligations\nresulting from intellectual property.\nThe incurrence or issuance of debt may impact our financial position and subject us to additional financial and operating restrictions.\nOn January 20, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026 in a private placement to\nqualified institutional buyers, or the 2026 Notes. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction\nfees and other debt issuance costs. We used some of the proceeds to repay the $110.0 million outstanding principal balance under our credit facility and also\nused some of the proceeds to pay accrued interest, fees and expenses related to our credit facility, which was terminated effective January 20, 2021. On May\n31, 2024, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes due June 1, 2029 in a private placement to qualified\ninstitutional buyers, or the 2029 Notes. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes of $485.2 million, net of $14.8 million of transaction fees and\nother debt issuance costs. We used $63.1 million of the net proceeds from the 2029 Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions and used $75.0 million\nto repurchase 1,117,068 shares of our common stock concurrently with the pricing of the 2029 Notes, which was separately authorized by our board of directors.\nWe currently intend to use the remaining net proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes for general corporate purposes, which may include\nacquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies, other repurchases of our common stock, repurchases of our 2026 Notes and\nfor working capital, operating expenses and capital expenditures. We may invest a portion of the proceeds in a portfolio of securities and other investments and\nalthough we plan to follow an established investment policy and seek to minimize the credit risk associated with investments by limiting exposure to any one\nissuer depending on credit quality, we cannot give assurances that the assets in our investment portfolio will not lose value, become impaired or suffer from\nilliquidity.\nOur overall leverage and certain obligations contained in the related documentation could adversely affect our financial health and business and future\noperations by, among other things:\n• making it more difficult to satisfy our obligations, including under the terms of the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes;\n• limiting our ability to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n• limiting our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions and increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic\nand industry conditions;\n• limiting our ability to use our available cash flow to fund future acquisitions, working capital, business activities, and other general corporate\nrequirements; and\n• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain\nadequate liquidity.\n70\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nIn the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and may\ndetermine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. For example, on January 20, 2021, we issued the 2026 Notes\nand on May 31, 2024, we issued the 2029 Notes. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction\nfees and other debt issuance costs. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes of $485.2 million, net of $14.8 million of transaction fees and\nother debt issuance costs. We may require additional capital to respond to the significant uncertainty arising from the Macroeconomic Conditions and we may\nnot be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms\nsatisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be limited. Any debt\nfinancing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which\nmay make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we raise additional funds\nthrough further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution\nin their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of\nour common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or\nsupport our business and to respond to business challenges could be limited. See “Risks Related to our Outstanding Convertible Senior Notes” below for further\ndetails on risks related to the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes.\nGoodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our\nintangible assets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $220.7 million of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are\nrecorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. We review such assets for impairment at least annually. Impairment may result from, among other things,\ndeterioration in performance, adverse market conditions, including adverse market conditions arising from the Macroeconomic Conditions, adverse changes in\napplicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the solutions we offer, challenges to the validity of certain registered\nintellectual property, reduced sales of certain products or services incorporating registered intellectual property, increased attrition and a variety of other factors.\nThe amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to results of operations. Depending on future circumstances, it is possible\nthat we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. Any future determination of impairment of goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets could\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nComprehensive tax reform bills could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nLegislative changes in the U.S. and other countries could increase our tax liability and adversely affect our after-tax profitability. For example, in August\n2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted in the United States which, among other provisions, includes a minimum 15.0% tax on companies that\nhave a three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income of more than $1.0 billion and a 1.0% excise tax on the value of net corporate stock\nrepurchases. Both provisions became effective on January 1, 2023. Current economic and political considerations make additional tax rules in the United States\nand other applicable jurisdictions subject to significant change, and changes in applicable tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application,\nincluding the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our income tax expense and profitability.\nIn addition, there is a continued interest within the European Union, Canada and other jurisdictions to apply new taxes on companies participating in the\ndigital economy. Such tax rule changes could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, deferred tax assets and financial results.\n71\nWe may be subject to additional tax liabilities, which would harm our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income, sales, use, value added and other taxes in the United States and other countries in which we conduct business, which laws and\nrates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales, use, value added or other taxes on our sales may assert that such taxes\nare applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect and remit such taxes in the future. Additionally,\nlongstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are subject to potential evolution. An\noutgrowth of the original Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project is a project undertaken by the more than 130 member countries of the expanded Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy.\"\nFurthermore, the OECD, announced a consensus around further changes in traditional international tax principles to address, among other things, perceived\nchallenges presented by global digital commerce, or Pillar One, and the perceived need for a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%, or Pillar Two. On\nDecember 20, 2021, the OECD released Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax rate of 15% on companies with revenues of at least 750.0\nmillion Euros, which would go into effect in 2024, subject to certain transition rules. While it is uncertain whether the U.S. will enact legislation to adopt the\nminimum tax directive, certain countries in which we operate have adopted such legislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing legislation to\nimplement the minimum tax directive. Under a transitional safe harbor released on July 17, 2023, the undertaxed profits rule top-up tax will be zero for each year\nof the transition period if that jurisdiction has a corporate tax rate of at least 20%. This undertaxed profits safe harbor transition rule will apply to us through our\nyear ending December 31, 2025.\nWhile we do not currently expect the Pillar Two minimum tax directive to have a material impact on our effective tax rate or operations, our analysis is\nongoing as the OECD (and many countries) continue to release additional guidance and implement legislation. To the extent additional changes take place in the\ncountries in which we operate, it is possible that these legislative changes and efforts may increase uncertainty and have an adverse impact on our effective tax\nrates or operations. We will continue to monitor and evaluate new legislation and guidance, which could change our current assessment.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. These determinations are highly complex and require detailed\nanalysis of the available information and applicable statutes and regulatory materials. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and\ncalculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and\nany related litigation could be different from our historical tax practices, provisions and accruals. If we receive an adverse ruling as a result of an audit, or we\nunilaterally determine that we have misinterpreted provisions of the tax regulations to which we are subject, our tax provision, results of operations or cash flows\ncould be harmed. In addition, liabilities associated with taxes are often subject to an extended or indefinite statute of limitations period. Therefore, we may be\nsubject to additional tax liability (including penalties and interest) for a particular year for extended periods of time.\nIf the U.S. insurance industry were to change its practice of providing incentives to homeowners for the use of alarm monitoring services, we could\nexperience a reduction in new subscriber growth or an increase in our subscriber attrition rate.\nIt has been common practice in the U.S. insurance industry to provide a reduction in rates for policies written on residences that have monitored alarm\nsystems. There can be no assurance that insurance companies will continue to offer these rate reductions. If these incentives were reduced or eliminated, new\nhomeowners who otherwise may not feel the need for alarm monitoring services would be removed from our potential subscriber pool, which could hinder the\ngrowth of our business, and existing subscribers may choose to disconnect or not renew their service contracts, which could increase our attrition rates. In either\ncase, our results of operations and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe conduct our business in the United States and in various other countries. We are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign\ngovernmental agencies, including, but not limited to, agencies and regulatory bodies or authorities responsible for monitoring and enforcing product safety and\nconsumer protection laws, data privacy and security laws and regulations, employment and labor laws, workplace safety laws and regulations, environmental\nlaws and regulations, antitrust laws, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S.\nTravel Act, and possibly other anti-bribery laws, including those that comply with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD,\nConvention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions and other international conventions. Anti-corruption laws are\ninterpreted broadly and prohibit our company from authorizing, offering, or providing directly or indirectly improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public\nor private-sector. Certain laws also prohibit us from soliciting or accepting bribes or kickbacks. Our company has direct government interactions and in several\ncases uses third-party representatives, including dealers, for regulatory compliance, sales and other purposes in a variety of countries. These factors increase\nour anti-corruption risk profile. We can be held liable for the corrupt activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we did\nnot explicitly authorize such activity. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with anti-\n72\ncorruption laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents will comply with these laws and policies.\nOur global operations require us to import from and export to several countries, which geographically stretches our compliance obligations. We are also\nsubject to anti-money laundering laws such as the USA PATRIOT Act and may be subject to similar laws in other jurisdictions. Our platforms and solutions are\nsubject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic\nand trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of our platforms and solutions must\nbe made in compliance with these laws and regulations. We may also be subject to import/export laws and regulations in other jurisdictions in which we conduct\nbusiness. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties,\nincluding the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases,\nthe incarceration of responsible employees or managers. In addition, if our service provider partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses\nor authorizations, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required\nlicense, for a particular sale may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. In addition, changes in our\nplatforms or solutions or changes in applicable export or import laws and regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our platforms and\nsolutions in international markets, prevent our service provider partners with international operations from deploying our platforms and solutions or, in some\ncases, prevent the export or import of our platforms and solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import laws\nand regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing laws and regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by\nsuch laws and regulations, could also result in decreased use of our platforms and solutions, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platforms and\nsolutions to existing or potential service provider partners with international operations. Any decreased use of our platforms and solutions or limitation on our\nability to export or sell our platforms and solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, our software contains encryption technologies, certain types of which are subject to U.S. and foreign export control regulations and, in some\nforeign countries, restrictions on importation and/or use. Any failure on our part to comply with encryption or other applicable export control requirements could\nresult in financial penalties or other sanctions under the U.S. export regulations, including restrictions on future export activities, which could harm our business\nand operating results. Regulatory restrictions could impair our access to technologies needed to improve our platforms and solutions and may also limit or\nreduce the demand for our platforms and solutions outside of the United States.\nFurthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions programs prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments\nand persons that are subject to U.S. economic embargoes and trade sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our platforms and solutions from\nbeing shipped or provided to U.S. sanctions targets, our platforms and solutions could be shipped to those targets or provided by third-parties despite such\nprecautions. Any such shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Furthermore, any\nnew embargo or sanctions program, or any change in the countries, governments, persons or activities targeted by such programs, could result in decreased\nuse of our platforms and solutions, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platforms and solutions to existing or potential service provider partners, which\nwould likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nChanges in laws that apply to us could result in increased regulatory requirements and compliance costs which could harm our business, financial condition,\ncash flows and results of operations. For example, the SEC has proposed expansive rules requiring public companies to disclose information about the material\nimpact of climate on their businesses, as well as information about companies’ governance, risk management and strategy related to climate risk. In certain\njurisdictions, regulatory requirements may be more stringent than in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject\nus to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages,\ncivil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain governments or other customers, the loss of export privileges,\nmulti-jurisdictional liability, reputational harm, and other collateral consequences. If any governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in\nany possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially harmed. In addition, responding\nto any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in defense costs and other\nprofessional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe face many risks associated with our international business operations and our plans to expand internationally, which could harm our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe anticipate our efforts to operate and continue to expand our business internationally will entail additional costs and risks as we establish our international\nofferings and develop relationships with service provider partners to market, sell, install, and support our platforms, solutions and brand in other countries.\nRevenue in countries outside of North America accounted for 5% and 4% of our total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively. We have limited experience in selling our platforms and solutions in international markets outside of North America or in conforming to the local\ncultures,\n73\nstandards, or policies necessary to successfully compete in those markets, and we may be required to invest significant resources in order to do so. We may not\nsucceed in these efforts or achieve our consumer acquisition, service provider expansion or other goals. In some international markets, consumer preferences\nand buying behaviors may be different, and we may use business or pricing models that are different from our traditional model to provide our platforms and\nsolutions to consumers in those markets or we may be unsuccessful in implementing the appropriate business model. Our revenue from new foreign markets\nmay not exceed the costs of establishing, marketing, and maintaining our international offerings. In addition, current global instability could have many adverse\nconsequences on our international expansion. These could include sovereign default, liquidity and capital pressures on financial institutions in other parts of the\nworld including the eurozone, reducing the availability of credit and increasing the risk of financial sector failures and the risk of one or more eurozone member\nstates leaving the euro, resulting in the possibility of capital and exchange controls and uncertainty about the impact of contracts and currency exchange rates.\nIn addition, conducting expanded international operations subjects us to additional risks that we do not generally face in our North American markets. These\nrisks include:\n• localization of our solutions, including the addition of foreign languages and adaptation to new local practices, as well as certification, registration and\nother regulatory requirements;\n• lack of experience in other geographic markets;\n• strong local competitors;\n• the cost and burden of complying with, lack of familiarity with, and unexpected changes in, foreign legal and regulatory requirements, including the\ndevelopment of policies and procedures for different countries when requirements under privacy regulations in such countries may conflict or be\ninconsistent with one another;\n• difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n• increased costs due to new or potential tariffs, penalties, trade restrictions and other trade barriers, which may increase our cost of hardware revenue\nand reduce our hardware revenue margins in the future;\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates or restrictions on foreign currency;\n• potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of transfer pricing, value added or other tax systems, double taxation and restrictions\nand/or taxes on the repatriation of earnings;\n• dependence on third parties, including commercial partners with whom we do not have extensive experience;\n• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n• political, social, and economic instability, such as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and regional\nadversaries, terrorist attacks, and security concerns in general; and\n• reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nOperating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. The investment and additional resources required\nto establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nOur software contains encryption technologies, certain types of which are subject to U.S. and foreign export control regulations and, in some foreign\ncountries, restrictions on importation and/or use. Any failure on our part to comply with encryption or other applicable export control requirements could result in\nfinancial penalties or other sanctions under the U.S. export regulations, including restrictions on future export activities, which could harm our business and\noperating results. Regulatory restrictions could impair our access to technologies needed to improve our platforms and solutions and may also limit or reduce the\ndemand for our platforms and solutions outside of the United States.\nEnhanced United States tax, tariff, import/export restrictions, or other trade barriers may have an adverse impact on global economic conditions,\nfinancial markets and our business.\nThere is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, including China, the European\nUnion, Canada, and Mexico, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs and customs duties, and taxes. Since 2019, the U.S. government has implemented\nsignificant changes to U.S. trade policy with respect to China. Tariffs have subjected certain Alarm.com products manufactured overseas to additional import\nduties of up to 25%. The amount of the import tariff and the number of products subject to tariffs have changed numerous times based on action by the U.S.\ngovernment. We are addressing the risks related to these imposed and announced tariffs, which have affected, or have the\n74\npotential to affect, at least some of our imports from China.\nLess than one-third of the hardware products that we sell to our customers are imported from China and could be subject to increased tariffs. Other\nAlarm.com hardware products that are not manufactured in China may contain subcomponents made in China that could also be subject to increased tariffs.\nWhile the additional import duties have resulted in an increase to our cost of hardware revenue, these import duties had a modest impact on hardware revenue\nmargins. If tariffs, trade restrictions, or trade barriers are expanded or interpreted by a court or governmental agency to apply to more of our products, then our\nexposure to future taxes and duties on such imported products and components could be significant and could have a material effect on our financial results. If\nour products are deemed to be subject to additional duties and taxes as determined by a court or governmental agency, we may suffer additional hardware\nrevenue margin erosion or be required to raise our prices on certain imported products. There can be no assurance that we will not experience a disruption in\nour business or harm to our financial condition related to these or other changes in trade practices, and any changes to our operations or our sourcing strategy\nin order to mitigate any such tariff costs could be complicated, time-consuming, and costly. Furthermore, our business may be adversely affected by retaliatory\ntrade measures taken by China and other countries, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Trade barriers, or\nthe perception that any of them could be imposed, may have a negative effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and\nmay significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these nations and the United States. Any of these factors could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn June 17, 2021, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, adopted a proposed rule that would effectively ban in the United States all\ncommunications equipment provided by entities identified on a “Covered List” that it maintains pursuant to the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks\nAct of 2019. The Covered List currently consists of video surveillance and telecommunications equipment produced by five Chinese electronics companies,\nincluding one of our suppliers. Although the proposed rule does not include language regarding retroactive application of the proposed ban, the FCC has asked\nfor comment on whether and under what circumstances it should revoke existing authorizations of communications equipment from companies on the Covered\nList. On November 11, 2021, President Biden signed into law the Secure Equipment Act of 2021 which requires the FCC to adopt rules clarifying that it will no\nlonger review or approve any authorization application for equipment that poses an unacceptable risk to national security. On November 25, 2022, the FCC\nimplemented this directive and adopted rules that prohibit future authorizations of equipment identified on the Covered List. Although the rules apply to future\nauthorizations of equipment, the FCC also adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on future action related to existing\nauthorizations. If the FCC adopts rules that apply retroactively to products already sold, this would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash\nflows and results of operations.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nOur accounting policies are critical to the manner in which we present our results of operations and financial condition. Many of these policies are highly\ncomplex and involve many assumptions, estimates and judgments. A change in accounting standards or practices, in particular with respect to revenue\nrecognition, could harm our operating results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. GAAP rules are subject\nto interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and other various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate\naccounting principles. See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for new accounting pronouncements. Implementation of new accounting\nstandards could have a significant effect on our financial results, and any difficulties in implementing these pronouncements could cause us to fail to meet our\nfinancial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors’ confidence in us.\nOur accounting is becoming more complex, and relies upon estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies. If our accounting is\nerroneous or based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities\nanalysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported\nin the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, and also to comply with many complex requirements and standards. Because of the use of\nestimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material. We devote\nsubstantial resources to compliance with accounting requirements and we base our estimates on our best judgment, historical experience, information derived\nfrom third parties, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. However, various\nfactors are causing our accounting to become complex. Ongoing evolution of our business, and the Macroeconomic Conditions and resulting uncertainty have,\nand any future acquisitions may, compound these complexities. Our operating results may be adversely affected if we make accounting errors or our judgments\nprove to be wrong, assumptions change or actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the\nexpectations of securities analysts and investors or guidance we may have provided, resulting in a decline in our stock price and potential legal claims.\nSignificant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, stock-\nbased compensation, business combinations, and income taxes.\n75\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our proprietary technology is essential to establishing and maintaining our leadership position. We seek to protect our intellectual property\nthrough trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality, non-compete and nondisclosure agreements, patents, trademarks, domain names and other measures, some\nof which afford only limited protection. We also rely on patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property. Despite our efforts\nto protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our technology or to obtain and use information that we regard as\nproprietary. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate or our competitors may independently develop similar or superior technology, or\ndesign around our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of\nthe United States. Intellectual property protections may also be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some countries, which could make it easier for\ncompetitors to capture market share. Our failure or inability to adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could harm our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nTo prevent substantial unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, it may be necessary to prosecute actions for infringement and/or misappropriation\nof our proprietary rights against third parties. See the section of this Quarterly Report titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information on related intellectual\nproperty litigation matters. Any such action could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and management's attention, and we cannot assure\nyou that we will be successful in such action. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater\nresources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon\nor misappropriating our intellectual property.\nAssertions by third parties that we are infringing their intellectual property subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses\nthat could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, and by\nfrequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have been involved with patent litigation suits in the\npast and we may be involved with and subject to similar litigation in the future to defend our intellectual property position. For example, on January 10, 2022,\nEcoFactor filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, alleging Alarm.com’s products and services directly and indirectly infringe five U.S.\npatents owned by EcoFactor. EcoFactor is seeking permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys' fees. See the section of this Quarterly Report titled\n\"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information on this matter. Should EcoFactor prevail in either of its district court lawsuits we could be required to pay damages\nin the amount of EcoFactor’s lost profits and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, we could be enjoined from making, using and selling our solution if\na license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us or we are unable to design around such patents, and we could be required\nto pay ongoing royalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to EcoFactor’s\nclaims, any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nOn July 22, 2021, Causam filed a lawsuit against us in U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, alleging that Alarm.com’s smart thermostats infringe\nfour U.S. patents owned by Causam. Causam is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, enhanced damages and attorneys’ fees. On July 28, 2021,\nCausam filed a complaint with the ITC alleging infringement of the same four patents. Causam is seeking a permanent limited exclusion order and permanent\ncease and desist order. See the section of this Quarterly Report titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information on each of these matters. Should Causam\nprevail in its district court lawsuit we could be required to pay damages and/or a reasonable royalty for sales of our solution, we could be enjoined from making,\nusing and selling our solution if a license or other right to continue selling such elements is not made available to us, and we could be required to pay ongoing\nroyalties and comply with unfavorable terms if such a license is made available to us. While we believe we have valid defenses to Causam’s claims, the outcome\nof these legal claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any of these outcomes could result in an adverse effect on our business.\nEven if we were to prevail in any of these matters, ongoing litigation could continue to be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of our management\nand key personnel from our business operations and dissuade potential customers from purchasing our solution, which would also materially harm our business.\nDuring the course of each of these litigation matters, we anticipate announcements of the results of hearings and motions, and other interim developments\nrelated to the litigation matters at hand. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our common stock may\ndecline.\nWe might not prevail in any intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in such litigation and\nour service provider partner contracts may require us to indemnify them against certain liabilities they may incur as a result of our infringement or alleged\ninfringement of any third-party intellectual property. Defending such claims, regardless of their merit, could be time-consuming and distracting to management,\nresult in costly litigation or settlement, cause development delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, we currently have a\nlimited portfolio of issued patents compared to our larger competitors, and therefore may not be able to effectively utilize our intellectual property portfolio to\nassert defenses or counterclaims in response to patent infringement claims or litigation brought\n76\nagainst us by third parties. Further, litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant products or revenues\nand against which our potential patents provide no deterrence, and many other potential litigants have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources\nto enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Given our platforms and solutions integrate with many\naspects of a property, the risk our platforms and solutions may be subject to these allegations is exacerbated. As we seek to extend our platforms and solutions,\nwe could be constrained by the intellectual property rights of others. If our platforms and solutions exceed the scope of in-bound licenses or violate any third-\nparty proprietary rights, we could be required to withdraw those solutions from the market, re-develop those solutions or seek to obtain licenses from third\nparties, which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Any efforts to re-develop our platforms and solutions, obtain licenses from third parties on\nfavorable terms or license a substitute technology might not be successful and, in any case, might substantially increase our costs and harm our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows and results of operations. If we were compelled to withdraw any of our platforms and solutions from the market, our business,\nfinancial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe have indemnity obligations to certain of our service provider partners for certain expenses and liabilities resulting from intellectual property\ninfringement claims regarding our platforms and solutions, which could force us to incur substantial costs.\nWe have indemnity obligations to certain of our service provider partners for intellectual property infringement claims regarding our platforms and solutions.\nAs a result, in the case of infringement claims against these service provider partners, we could be required to indemnify them for losses resulting from such\nclaims or to refund amounts they have paid to us. We expect that some of our service provider partners may seek indemnification from us in connection with\ninfringement claims brought against them. In addition, we may elect to indemnify service provider partners where we have no contractual obligation to indemnify\nthem and we will evaluate each such request on a case-by-case basis. If a service provider partner elects to invest resources in enforcing a claim for\nindemnification against us, we could incur significant costs disputing it. If we do not succeed in disputing it, we could face substantial liability. See the section of\nthis Quarterly Report titled \"Legal Proceedings\" for additional information regarding this matter and the other legal proceedings we are involved in.\nThe use of open source software in our platforms and solutions may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\nSome of our platforms and solutions use or incorporate software that is subject to one or more open source licenses and we may incorporate open source\nsoftware in the future. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses require a user who\nintends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user's software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user's software. In\naddition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on\npotentially unfavorable terms to us or at no cost.\nThe terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and accordingly there is a risk that\nthose licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our platforms and solutions.\nIn that event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our platforms and solutions, to re-develop our platforms and\nsolutions, to discontinue sales of our platforms and solutions or to release our proprietary software code under the terms of an open source license, any of which\ncould harm our business. Further, given the nature of open source software, it may be more likely that third parties might assert copyright and other intellectual\nproperty infringement claims against us based on our use of these open source software programs. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative\neffect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change\nour solutions.\nAlthough we are not aware of any use of open source software in our platforms and solutions that would require us to disclose all or a portion of the source\ncode underlying our core solutions, it is possible that such use may have inadvertently occurred in deploying our platforms and solutions. Additionally, if a third-\nparty software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our platforms and solutions\nwithout our knowledge, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our platforms and solutions. This could harm our\nintellectual property position as well as our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are related in\ncomplex ways. The market price of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance, resulting in the potential for substantial losses for\nour stockholders, and may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the factors listed below and\nother factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section:\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n77\n• the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n• failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our\ncompany, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n• ratings changes by any securities analysts who follow our company;\n• variance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts;\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, technical innovations, acquisitions or new solutions;\n• changes in the prices of our platforms and solutions;\n• changes in our projected operating and financial results;\n• changes in laws or regulations applicable to our platforms and solutions or marketing techniques, or our industry in general;\n• our involvement in any litigation, including any lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n• repurchases of our common stock under the stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors or our sale of our common stock or other\nsecurities in the future;\n• changes in senior management or key personnel;\n• trading volume of our common stock;\n• changes in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market; and\n• general economic, regulatory and market conditions in the United States and abroad as well as the uncertainty resulting from the current\nMacroeconomic Conditions.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities\nof many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and\nindustry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In\nthe past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the\ntarget of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our market price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market\nprice of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that\nsales, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders, may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options under our equity incentive plans and the shares reserved for future issuance under our\nequity incentive plans, as well as shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock awards, will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject\nto certain legal and contractual limitations. Moreover, some holders of shares of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file\nregistration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders. We have also\nregistered shares of common stock that we may issue under our employee equity incentive plans. Accordingly, these shares may be able to be sold freely in the\npublic market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements. See “Conversion of the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes may dilute the ownership\ninterest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock” below for further details on the risks related to the dilutive impact of the\n2026 Notes and 2029 Notes.\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting. These internal controls may be determined to\nbe not effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe have been and are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. This assessment\n78\nincludes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. During the evaluation and testing\nprocess, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert our internal controls are\neffective and would be required to disclose any material weaknesses identified in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. While we\nhave established certain procedures and control over our financial reporting processes, we cannot assure you that these efforts will prevent restatements of our\nfinancial statements in the future.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is also required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to report on the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. For future reporting periods, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the\nevent it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. We may not be able to remediate any future material\nweaknesses, or to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion.\nIf we are unable to conclude our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to\nexpress an opinion our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial\nreports, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, including\nthe SEC and Nasdaq. Failure to remediate any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to maintain other effective control systems\nrequired of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish negative reports about our business, or cease coverage of our company, our share price and trading volume\ncould decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business.\nWe do not have any control over these analysts. If our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates or one or more of the analysts who cover us\ndowngrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our\ncompany or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on\nappreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development\nof our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and may\nbe subject to any restrictions on paying dividends in any future indebtedness. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price\nappreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our\nstockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or changes\nin our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n• authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock, without further stockholder action and with voting liquidation, dividend and other rights superior\nto our common stock;\n• require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent, and limit the\nability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n• establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons\nfor director nominees; and\n• provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the vote of a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for\nstockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are\nincorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware\ncorporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \"interested\" stockholder for a period of three years following the date on\nwhich the stockholder became an \"interested\" stockholder. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be\n79\nwilling to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you\nwould receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the\nfederal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which\ncould limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nPursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n(1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers\nor other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our\namended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this choice of forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have\njurisdiction to entertain such claims. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring\nany interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. Furthermore, our amended and restated\nbylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the\nUnited States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any claims arising under the Securities Act. The forum selection clause in our\namended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nRisks Related to our Outstanding Convertible Senior Notes\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle cash conversions of the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes or to repurchase the 2026 Notes\nor 2029 Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of\nthe 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes.\nOn January 20, 2021, we issued the 2026 Notes. The terms of the 2026 Notes are governed by an Indenture, or the 2026 Indenture, by and between\nAlarm.com Holdings, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that do not bear regular interest and\nthe principal amount of the 2026 Notes will not accrete. The 2026 Notes may bear special interest under specified circumstances related to our failure to comply\nwith our reporting obligations under the 2026 Indenture. Special interest, if any, will be payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year,\nbeginning on July 15, 2021. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2026 Notes of $484.3 million, net of $15.7 million of transaction fees and other debt\nissuance costs. On May 31, 2024, we issued the 2029 Notes. The terms of the 2029 Notes are governed by an Indenture, or the 2029 Indenture, by and\nbetween Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations that bear\ninterest at a rate of 2.25% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024, and the\nprincipal amount of the 2029 Notes will not accrete. We received proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes of $485.2 million, net of $14.8 million of\ntransaction fees and other debt issuance costs.\nHolders of the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes will have the right, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions, to require us to repurchase all or a portion\nof their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes\nor 2029 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest or interest, if any, as defined in the 2026 Indenture and 2029 Indenture. In addition,\nupon conversion of the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying\ncash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes being converted as\ndefined in the 2026 Indenture and 2029 Indenture. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required\nto make repurchases of 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes being converted. In addition, our\nability to repurchase the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory\nauthority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes at a time when the repurchase is\nrequired by the 2026 Indenture and 2029 Indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes as required by the 2026\nIndenture and 2029 Indenture would constitute a default under the 2026 Indenture and 2029 Indenture. A default under the 2026 Indenture governing the 2026\nNotes or the 2029 Indenture governing the 2029 Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future\nindebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds\nto repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\n80\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes is triggered, holders of 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes will be entitled to convert\nthe 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes, unless\nwe elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share),\nwe would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition,\neven if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal\nof the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nConversion of the 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our\ncommon stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Upon conversion of the 2026 Notes\nor 2029 Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our\ncommon stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, any\nsales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition,\nthe existence of the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes\ncould be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 2026 Notes or 2029 Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of\nour common stock.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the 2029 Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the 2029 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with one of the initial purchasers and certain other financial\ninstitutions, or the Counterparties. The capped call transactions are generally expected to reduce the potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon any\nconversion of the 2029 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2029 Notes, as the case\nmay be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nFrom time to time, the Counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives\nwith respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions (and are likely to do so following any\nconversion of 2029 Notes, any repurchase of the 2029 Notes by us on any fundamental change (as defined in the 2029 Indenture governing the 2029 Notes)\nrepurchase date, any redemption date or any other date on which the 2029 Notes are retired by us). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a\ndecrease in the market price of our common stock or the 2029 Notes.\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the 2029 Notes will depend in part on market\nconditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions, and the capped calls may not operate as planned.\nThe Counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that they might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to\nthe credit risk of the Counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have from time to time resulted in the actual or perceived\nfailure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If one of the Counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an\nunsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that counterparty. Our exposure will depend\non many factors, but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated with increases in the market price or the volatility of our common stock. In\naddition, upon a default by one of the Counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our\ncommon stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the Counterparties.\nIn addition, the capped call transactions are complex and they may not operate as planned. For example, the terms of the capped call transactions may be\nsubject to adjustment, modification, or, in some cases, renegotiation if certain corporate or other transactions occur. Accordingly, these transactions may not\noperate as we intend if we are required to adjust their terms as a result of transactions in the future or upon unanticipated developments that may adversely\naffect the functioning of the capped call transactions.\n81\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\n(c) Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn February 15, 2023, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program, effective February 23, 2023, under which we are authorized to\npurchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the two-year period ending February 23, 2025. On May 24, 2024, our\nboard of directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock in connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, the cancellation of the balance under the\nstock repurchase program ending February 23, 2025 and also authorized a stock repurchase program, effective May 31, 2024, under which we are authorized to\npurchase up to an aggregate of $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock during the two-year period ending May 31, 2026. We utilize our stock\nrepurchase program in an effort to return surplus cash to stockholders efficiently. Our board of directors determines repurchase program amounts through an\nanalysis of projected capital needs to sustain growth as well as to meet other investing and financing criteria. In determining whether to authorize repurchases\nand the size of the repurchase program, our board of directors considers whether we have funds legally available to repurchase shares of common stock and\nvarious alternative uses for our cash and cash equivalents.\nThe stock repurchase program is designed to enable us to make both opportunistic repurchases based on market conditions at management’s discretion\nand consistent repurchases over time. Stock repurchases may be made through a variety of methods, including open-market transactions (including pursuant to\na trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act), privately negotiated transactions, block trades and by any combination of the\nforegoing.\nOur Insider Trading and Trading Window Policy prohibits our directors, officers and other employees from trading in Alarm.com securities while they are\naware of material nonpublic information about Alarm.com, which would include unannounced material stock repurchase plans. The prohibition does not apply to\ntrades made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.\nNo shares were repurchased under our stock repurchase program during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nWe withhold shares of common stock in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards issued to employees to satisfy applicable tax withholding\nrequirements. These withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore, are excluded\nfrom our repurchase activity.\nAs of January 1, 2023, we are subject to a 1.0% excise tax on the value of net corporate stock repurchases under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. When\napplicable, the excise tax will be included as part of the cost basis of shares acquired and is presented within stockholders’ equity in the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets and will be excluded from amounts presented above.\nITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION\nInsider Trading Arrangements\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a‑1(f) under the Exchange Act) adopted,\nmodified or terminated a Rule 10b5‑1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K) or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined\nin Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K).\n82\nITEM 6.

Fourteenth Amendment Expansion Space.\n-2-\n(a) Expansion Space A.\n(i) Landlord hereby leases to Tenant and Tenant hereby leases from Landlord an agreed twenty-one thousand\nfive hundred ninety-nine (21,599) rentable square feet in the aggregate, comprised of an agreed (A) four thousand five hundred fifty-\nfive (4,555) rentable square feet located on the second (2nd) floor (“Suite 250”), (B) five thousand three hundred thirty-six (5,336)\nrentable square feet located on the third (3rd) floor (“Suite 320”), and (C) eleven thousand seven hundred eight (11,708) rentable\nsquare feet located on the sixth floor (“Suites 630/650”), all in the locations depicted on the diagram attached hereto as Attachment\nA (each, a “Suite” and all collectively, the “Expansion Space A”).\n(ii) Possession of each Suite of Expansion Space A will be delivered to Tenant broom clean and free of all\noccupants with the prior occupants’ furniture, furnishings and equipment removed and otherwise in the as-is condition thereof as of\nthe Amendment Date, subject to (1) improvements performed after the Amendment Date by any occupant of the applicable Suite\n(“Post-Execution Occupant Improvements”) for which (x) Landlord cannot withhold consent for the applicable Post-Execution\nOccupant Improvements without breaching the applicable lease and (y) Landlord cannot require the removal of the applicable Post-\nExecution Occupant Improvements and restoration of the affected area by such occupant upon the expiration or earlier termination\nof such occupant’s lease, and (2) ordinary wear and tear (the “Delivery Condition”). The date on which each applicable Suite of\nExpansion Space A is delivered to Tenant in the Delivery Condition shall be the “Delivery Date” therefor. It is hereby acknowledged\nthat Suite 250 and Suite 320 are not occupied as of the Amendment Date, and that Suites 630/650 are occupied as of the Amendment\nDate pursuant to a lease that is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2025 (subject to the terms of the early termination agreement\ntherefor). Landlord has entered into an early termination agreement with the current tenant of Suites 630/650 providing for the\ntermination of the lease upon the full execution and delivery of this Amendment. Accordingly, it is presently anticipated that\npossession of Suite 250 and Suite 320 of Expansion Space A will be delivered to Tenant in the Delivery Condition within two (2)\nbusiness days after the Amendment Date, and it is presently anticipated that possession of Suites 630/650 will be delivered to Tenant\nin the Delivery Condition within two (2) business days after the date that is the later of (A) the Amendment Date, and (B) the date\nSuites 630/650 are vacated by the current tenant thereof. If Landlord does not deliver possession of any Suite of the Expansion\nSpace A to Tenant by the anticipated delivery date therefor (whether resulting from failure of any current occupant to vacate and\nsurrender possession of its premises on the expiration or earlier termination date therefor, or any other cause outside of Landlord’s\nreasonable control), Landlord shall not have any liability whatsoever and neither the Lease nor this Amendment shall be rendered\nvoid or voidable as a result thereof, however, the applicable commencement date for each such Suite of Expansion Space A shall not\noccur until the Delivery Date therefor, in accordance with Paragraph 2(a)(iii) below. Nothing herein contained shall obligate\nLandlord to make any payment to, or commence any litigation (other than applicable eviction proceedings) against, the occupant of\nany Suite in order to entice such occupant to physically vacate and surrender possession of the applicable Suite. If the current tenant\nof Suites 630/650 has not vacated the same within ninety (90) days after the expiration or earlier\n-3-\ntermination of the lease with respect thereto, then Landlord, at its expense (without prejudice to Landlord’s right to seek\nreimbursement from the tenant of Suites 630/650 to the extent permitted by the lease with respect thereto or applicable law), shall\npromptly commence and thereafter diligently pursue eviction proceedings against such tenant.\n(iii) (A) The commencement date for Suite 250 (the “Suite 250 Commencement Date”) shall occur on\nthe Delivery Date for Suite 250, and the term “Lease Year” solely with respect to Suite 250 shall mean a period of twelve (12)\nconsecutive months commencing on the Suite 250 Commencement Date, and each successive twelve (12) month period thereafter;\nprovided, however, that if the Suite 250 Commencement Date is not first day of a month, then the first Lease Year for Suite 250 also\nshall include the period from the Suite 250 Commencement Date to the first day of the following month, and the second Lease Year\nfor Suite 250 shall commence on the first day of the month immediately following the first anniversary of the Suite 250\nCommencement Date. From and after the Suite 250 Commencement Date, Suite 250 shall be subject to all of the terms and\nconditions of the Lease (as modified hereby).\n(B) The commencement date for Suite 320 (the “Suite 320 Commencement Date”) shall occur on the Delivery Date for\nSuite 320, and the term “Lease Year” solely with respect to Suite 320 shall mean a period of twelve (12) consecutive months\ncommencing on the Suite 320 Commencement Date, and each successive twelve (12) month period thereafter; provided, however,\nthat if the Suite 320 Commencement Date is not first day of a month, then the first Lease Year for Suite 320 also shall include the\nperiod from the Suite 320 Commencement Date to the first day of the following month, and the second Lease Year for Suite 320\nshall commence on the first day of the month immediately following the first anniversary of the Suite 320 Commencement Date.\nFrom and after the Suite 320 Commencement Date, Suite 320 shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Lease (as\nmodified hereby).\n(C) The commencement date for Suites 630/650 (the “Suites 630/650 Commencement Date”) shall occur on the\nDelivery Date for Suites 630/650, and the term “Lease Year” solely with respect to Suites 630/650 shall mean a period of twelve\n(12) consecutive months commencing on the Suites 630/650 Commencement Date, and each successive twelve (12) month period\nthereafter; provided, however, that if the Suites 630/650 Commencement Date is not first day of a month, then the first Lease Year\nfor Suites 630/650 also shall include the period from the Suites 630/650 Commencement Date to the first day of the following\nmonth, and the second Lease Year for Suites 630/650 shall commence on the first day of the month immediately following the first\nanniversary of the Suites 630/650 Commencement Date. From and after the Suites 630/650 Commencement Date, Suites 630/650\nshall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Lease (as modified hereby).\n(b) Expansion Space B.\n-4-\n(i) Landlord hereby leases to Tenant and Tenant hereby leases from Landlord an agreed thirty-five thousand\nthree hundred four (35,304) rentable square feet in the aggregate, comprised of an agreed (A) eleven thousand eight hundred eleven\n(11,811) rentable square feet located on the third (3rd) floor (“Suite 300”), and (B) twenty-three thousand four hundred ninety-three\n(23,493) rentable square feet located on the fourth (4th) floor (“Suite 400”), all in the locations depicted on the diagram attached\nhereto as Attachment A hereto (each, also a “Suite” and all collectively, the “Expansion Space B”).\n(ii) Possession of each Suite of Expansion Space B will be delivered to Tenant in the Delivery Condition.\nThe date on which each applicable Suite of Expansion Space B is delivered to Tenant in the Delivery Condition following the\nexpiration or earlier termination of the occupancy agreement therefor (irrespective of any occupancy by Tenant of any such space\nprior thereto by sublease, license or other occupancy agreement between Tenant and the tenant of such space as of the Execution\nDate) shall be the “Delivery Date” therefor. It is hereby acknowledged that Suite 400 is occupied as of the Amendment Date\npursuant to an occupancy agreement that is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2024, and Suite 300 is occupied as of the\nAmendment Date pursuant to an occupancy agreement that is scheduled to expire on January 31, 2026. Landlord may elect, in its\nsole and absolute discretion, to negotiate with the current tenant of Suite 300 an early termination agreement, which agreement (if\nany) shall be on terms satisfactory to Landlord and such current tenant of Suite 300 in each such party’s sole and absolute discretion.\nAccordingly, it is presently anticipated that possession of each of Suite 300 and Suite 400 of Expansion Space B will be delivered to\nTenant in the Delivery Condition within two (2) business days after the later of (A) the date on which the occupancy agreement\ntherefor expires (or is earlier terminated) and (B) the date on which such Suite is vacated by the current occupant thereof; however,\npossession of Suite 400 shall not be delivered before January 1, 2025, and possession of Suite 300 shall not be delivered before\nSeptember 1, 2024, in both cases without Tenant’s prior written consent in its sole and absolute discretion. If Landlord does not\ndeliver possession of either Suite of the Expansion Space B to Tenant by the anticipated delivery date therefor (whether resulting\nfrom failure of any current occupant to vacate and surrender possession of its premises on the expiration or earlier termination date\ntherefor or any other cause outside of Landlord’s reasonable control), Landlord shall not have any liability whatsoever and neither\nthe Lease nor this Amendment shall be rendered void or voidable as a result thereof, however, the applicable commencement date\nfor each such Suite of Expansion Space B shall not occur until the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days after Delivery Date\ntherefor, in accordance with Paragraph 2(b)(iii) below. Nothing herein contained shall obligate Landlord to make any payment to, or\ncommence any litigation (other than applicable eviction proceedings) against, the occupant of any Suite in order to entice such\noccupant to physically vacate and surrender possession of the applicable Suite. If the current tenant of any Suite of Expansion Space\nB has not vacated the same within ninety (90) days after the expiration or earlier termination of the lease with respect thereto, then\nLandlord, at its expense (without prejudice to Landlord’s right to seek reimbursement from the tenant of such Suite to the extent\npermitted by the lease with respect thereto or applicable law), shall promptly commence and thereafter diligently pursue eviction\nproceedings against such tenant.\n-5-\n(iii) (A) The commencement date for Suite 400 (the “Suite 400 Commencement Date”) shall occur on\nthe date that is one hundred twenty (120) days after the Delivery Date for Suite 400, and the term “Lease Year” solely with respect\nto Suite 400 shall mean the Lease Year that is then applicable with respect to the Existing Space commencing on the Suite 400\nCommencement Date and continuing thereafter during the remainder of the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term. For purposes of\nexample only, if the Suite 400 Commencement Date occurs on May 1, 2025, then the first Lease Year for Suite 400 will be a period\nof less than 12 full months, ending on December 31, 2025 (i.e., the last day of the second Lease Year of the Fourteenth Amendment\nExtension Term for the Existing Space), and the annual Base Rent for Suite 400 will escalate on January 1, 2026 (and each January 1\nthereafter). From and after the Suite 400 Commencement Date, Suite 400 shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the\nLease (as modified hereby).\n(B) The commencement date for Suite 300 (the “Suite 300 Commencement Date”) shall occur on the date that is one\nhundred twenty (120) days after the Delivery Date for Suite 300, and the term “Lease Year” solely with respect to Suite 300 shall\nmean the Lease Year that is then applicable with respect to the Existing Space commencing on the Suite 300 Commencement Date\n(in the manner described for purposes of example only in Paragraph 2(b)(iii)(A) above) and continuing thereafter during the\nremainder of the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term.

Term; Renewal Options.\n(a) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease (including the June 30, 2026 previously scheduled\nexpiration date of the Term), the Term hereby is extended for the period (“Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term”) commencing\non January 1, 2024 (“Fourteenth Amendment Extension Commencement Date”), and ending on March 31, 2034 (“Fourteenth\nAmendment Extension Expiration Date”) (both dates inclusive), unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the\nterms and conditions of the Lease (as amended hereby).\n(ii) Further notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, from and after the Fourteenth\nAmendment Extension Commencement Date, the term “Lease Year” with respect to the Existing Space shall mean a period of\ntwelve (12) consecutive months commencing on the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Commencement Date, and each successive\ntwelve (12) month period thereafter (i.e., January 1 through December 31).\n(b) All renewal and extension options contained in the Lease, including without limitation, the extension option contained in\nParagraph 5 of Exhibit F to the Original Lease, hereby are deleted and of no further force and effect. Landlord hereby grants to\nTenant the conditional right, exercisable at Tenant’s option, to renew the Term, solely with respect to the entire Premises, for two (2)\nsuccessive terms of five (5) years each (each, a “Renewal Term”). If exercised, and if the conditions applicable thereto have been\nsatisfied, the first such Renewal Term (the “First Renewal Term”) shall commence immediately following the Fourteenth\nAmendment Extension Expiration Date, and the second Renewal Term (the “Second Renewal Term”) shall commence immediately\nfollowing the end of the First Renewal Term. The rights of renewal herein granted to Tenant shall be subject to, and shall be\nexercised in accordance with, the following terms and conditions:\n(i) Tenant shall exercise its right of renewal with respect to the applicable Renewal Term by giving Landlord\nwritten notice (the “Renewal Option Notice”) of such election not earlier than twenty-four (24) months or later than eighteen (18)\nmonths prior to the expiration of the then-current Term. The parties shall then have thirty (30) days after Landlord’s timely receipt of\nsuch notice (the “Negotiation Period”) in which to agree on the\n-7-\nannual base rent, escalation factor and additional rent which shall be payable during the applicable Renewal Term. The parties shall\nattempt in good faith to agree upon an annual base rent payable for the first year of the Renewal Term which would equal one\nhundred percent (100%) of the applicable fair market rent for renewal transactions taking into account the Market Items (as defined\nbelow). The term “Market Items” shall mean, if then applicable, rent abatements, brokerage commissions and construction\nallowances for standard and above-standard construction; provided, however that consideration shall be given to the savings to\nTenant resulting from its remaining in the Premises (e.g., no moving or related costs). Among the factors to be considered by the\nparties during such negotiations shall be the general office rental market in the office rental market in the Market Area (as defined in\nthe Original Lease) for comparable buildings, and the rents being charged in recent renewals with respect to similar office space in\nmulti-tenanted, multi-story, first-class office buildings comparable to the Building in the Market Area. If during the Negotiation\nPeriod the parties agree on such annual base rent, escalation factor and additional rent, then they shall promptly execute an\namendment to the Lease stating the terms so agreed upon. If during the Negotiation Period the parties are unable, for any reason\nwhatsoever, to agree on such annual base rent, escalation factor and additional rent payable, then within five (5) business days\nthereafter, the parties shall each appoint a real estate broker who shall be licensed in the Commonwealth of Virginia and who\nspecializes in the field of commercial office space leasing in the Market Area, has at least ten (10) years of experience and is\nrecognized within the field as being reputable and ethical. Such two individuals shall each determine, within ten (10) days after their\nappointment, such annual base rent, escalation factor and additional rent. If such individuals do not agree on such items, then the two\nindividuals shall, within five (5) business days, render separate written reports of their determinations and together appoint a third\nsimilarly qualified individual. The third individual shall, within ten (10) days after his or her appointment, select either Landlord’s\nbroker’s determination or Tenant’s broker’s determination (this being the third broker’s sole function) as being closest to the\napplicable fair market annual base rent, escalation factor and additional rent and shall notify the parties of such selection. If Landlord\nor Tenant fails to timely deliver its determination to such third individual, then the other party’s determination of the annual base\nrent, escalation factor and additional rent shall be final and conclusive. The third broker’s decision shall be final and conclusive, and\nbinding on Landlord and Tenant. Landlord and Tenant shall each bear the cost of its broker and shall share equally the cost of the\nthird broker. Upon determination of the annual base rent, escalation factor and additional rent payable pursuant to this Paragraph, the\nparties shall promptly execute an amendment to the Lease stating the rent and additional terms so determined. Any failure of the\nparties to execute such amendment will not affect the validity of the applicable renewal or the rent and additional terms with respect\nthereto as determined in accordance with this Amendment.\n(ii) If any Renewal Option Notice is not given timely, then Tenant’s right of renewal with respect to the\napplicable Renewal Term shall lapse and be of no further force or effect.\n(iii) If there exists an Event of Default by Tenant under the Lease on the date Tenant sends a Renewal\nOption Notice or any time thereafter until a Renewal Term is to\n-8-\ncommence, then, at Landlord’s election, such Renewal Term shall not commence and the Term of the Lease shall expire at the\nexpiration of the then-current Term.\n(iv) If Tenant’s right of renewal with respect to any Renewal Term lapses for any reason, then Tenant’s right\nof renewal with respect to any subsequent Renewal Term shall similarly lapse and be of no further force or effect.\n(v) Tenant’s rights of renewal under this Paragraph may be exercised only by Tenant or an assignee of the\nentire Lease that is an Affiliated Entity or a Permitted Successor pursuant to the terms of Section 9.05 of the Original Lease, and may\nnot be exercised by or for the benefit of any other transferee, sublessee or assignee of Tenant.\n4.

For purposes of example only, if the Suite 400\nCommencement Date occurs on May 1, 2025, then the first escalation of Base Rent for Suite 400 shall occur eight (8) months\nthereafter, on January 1, 2026.\n(vi) Commencing on the Suite 300 Commencement Date and continuing for and with respect to the remainder of the\nFourteenth Amendment Extension Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as annual Base Rent for Suite 300, an amount equal to the\nproduct of (A) the then-escalated Base Rent per rentable square of the Existing Space that is then payable under the Lease (as\namended hereby) on the Suite 300 Commencement Date (without regard to\n-10-\nany abatement or offset applicable thereto), multiplied by (B) the number of rentable square feet in Suite 300. Commencing on the\nfirst day of each Lease Year for the Existing Space thereafter during the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term, the annual Base\nRent for Suite 300 shall be increased by 2.5% of the amount of annual Base Rent payable for Suite 300 during the immediately\npreceding Lease Year (or portion thereof) for the Existing Space (without regard to any abatement or offset applicable thereto) (i.e.,\nthe Base Rent per rentable square foot of Suite 300 shall be the same amount as the Base Rent per rentable square foot of the\nExisting Space, and the Base Rent for Suite 300 shall escalate on the same January 1 date as the Base Rent escalates for the Existing\nSpace), calculated in the manner shown for purposes of example only in clause (v) of this Paragraph 4(a).\n(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Paragraph 4(a) above, provided no Event of Default by Tenant\nexists under the Lease (as amended), Landlord grants to Tenant an abatement of the Base Rent otherwise payable hereunder in the\nfollowing amounts and during the following periods set forth in this Paragraph 5(b) below, it being acknowledged and agreed,\nhowever, that the Base Rent escalation for each portion of the Premises, as required by Paragraph 4(a) above, shall be based on the\nfull and unabated amount of Base Rent payable therefor under the Lease (as amended hereby):\n(i) for the Existing Space, (A) a portion of the Base Rent payable for the Existing Premises in an amount\nequal to (A) twenty-five percent (25%) of each monthly installment of Base Rent payable for the Existing Premises for the period\ncommencing on January 1, 2024 and ending on October 31, 2025 (both dates inclusive), and (B) one hundred percent (100%) of\neach monthly installment of Base Rent payable for the Existing Premises for the period commencing on September 1, 2026 and\nending on January 31, 2027 (both dates inclusive);\n(ii) for Suite 250, one hundred percent (100%) of each monthly installment of Base Rent payable for Suite\n250 for the period commencing on the Suite 250 Commencement Date and ending on the day immediately preceding the fourteenth\n(14th) monthly anniversary of the Suite 250 Commencement Date, both dates inclusive (it being agreed that if no such monthly\nanniversary is possible in any month due to the number of calendar days in such month, the applicable monthly anniversary will be\ndeemed to occur on the last day of such month);\n(iii) for Suite 320, one hundred percent (100%) of each monthly installment of Base Rent payable for Suite\n320 for the period commencing on the Suite 320 Commencement Date and ending on the day immediately preceding the fourteenth\n(14th) monthly anniversary of the Suite 320 Commencement Date, both dates inclusive (it being agreed that if no such monthly\nanniversary is possible in any month due to the number of calendar days in such month, the applicable monthly anniversary will be\ndeemed to occur on the last day of such month);\n-11-\n(iv) for Suites 630/650, one hundred percent (100%) of each monthly installment of Base Rent payable for\nSuites 630/650 for the period commencing on the Suites 630/650 Commencement Date and ending on the day immediately\npreceding the fourteenth (14th) monthly anniversary of the Suites 630/650 Commencement Date, both dates inclusive (it being\nagreed that if no such monthly anniversary is possible in any month due to the number of calendar days in such month, the\napplicable monthly anniversary will be deemed to occur on the last day of such month);\n(v) for Suite 400, a portion of the fourteen (14) monthly installments of abatement of Base Rent for\nExpansion Space A based on the ratio that the number of months remaining in the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term on the\nSuite 400 Commencement Date bears to 123 months (i.e., the total number of months in the Fourteenth Amendment Extension\nTerm). For purposes of example only, if the Suite 400 Commencement Date occurs on May 1, 2025 (i.e., with 105 months remaining\nin the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term, which is 85.37% of the 123 months in the entire Fourteenth Amendment Extension\nTerm), the abatement of Base Rent for Suite 400 will mean an abatement of one hundred percent (100%) of each monthly\ninstallment of Base Rent payable for Suite 400 for a period of 11.95 months (i.e., 14 months x .8537).\n(vi) for Suite 300, a portion of the fourteen (14) monthly installments of abatement of Base Rent for\nExpansion Space A based on the ratio that the number of months remaining in the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term on the\nSuite 300 Commencement Date bears to 123 months (i.e., the total number of months in the Fourteenth Amendment Extension\nTerm), calculated in the manner shown for purposes of example only in clause (v) of this Paragraph 4(b).\n(c) If an Event of Default by Tenant exists under the Lease (as amended) at a time that any such abatement pursuant\nto Paragraph 4(b) of this Amendment would otherwise be applicable, but neither the Lease (as amended) nor Tenant’s right to\npossession of the Premises (as modified) is terminated in connection therewith, then such abatement shall not be forfeited, but shall\nbe tolled during the pendency of such Event of Default and shall be reinstated if and when such Event of Default is cured. In\naddition, if Tenant would be entitled under any other express provision of the Lease to an abatement of Base Rent for any other\nreason (e.g., a fire or other casualty) at a time that any such abatement pursuant to Paragraph 4(b) would otherwise be applicable,\nthen the abatement contemplated by Paragraph 4(b) shall be tolled during the pendency of such other abatement and shall be\nreinstated when such other abatement ends so as to provide Tenant with the benefit of the full abatement provided pursuant to\nParagraph 4(b).\n(d) Landlord shall return the Excess Rent Payment to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the Amendment Date. If\nLandlord fails timely to do so, then Tenant shall have the same rights and remedies with respect to the Excess Rent Payment as\nwould be applicable to any Overdue Allowance (as hereinafter defined), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in\nSection 4(f) of Attachment B, mutatis mutandis.\n-12-\n5.

The term for the Conference Space shall commence on the Single-Tenant Date (and Tenant shall be entitled to\npossession on such date) in its then as-is condition, and shall be coterminous with the Term of the Lease applicable to the remainder\nof the Premises.\n(b) Tenant shall lease the Conference Space upon and subject to all the same terms and conditions as Tenant's leasing of the\nPremises, except that:\n(i) The commencement date for the Conference Space (the “Conference Space Commencement Date”)\nshall occur on the date that is one hundred twenty (120) days after the Single-Tenant Date, and the term “Lease Year” solely with\nrespect to the Conference Space shall mean the Lease Year that is then applicable with respect to the Existing Space commencing on\nthe Conference Space Commencement Date (in the manner described for purposes of example only in Paragraph 2(b)(iii)(A) above)\nand continuing thereafter during the remainder of the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term.\n(ii) Commencing on the Conference Space Commencement Date, the annual Base Rent for the Conference\nSpace shall be an amount equal to the product of (A) the then-escalated Base Rent per rentable square of the Existing Space that is\nthen payable under the Lease (as amended hereby) on the Single-Tenant Date (without regard to any abatement or offset applicable\nthereto), multiplied by (B) the number of rentable square feet in the Conference Space, and commencing on the first day of each\nLease Year for the Existing Space thereafter during the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term, the annual Base Rent for the\nConference Space shall be increased by 2.5% of the amount of annual Base Rent payable for the Conference Space during the\nimmediately preceding Lease Year (or portion thereof) for the Existing Space (without regard to any abatement or offset applicable\nthereto) (i.e., the Base Rent per rentable square foot of the Conference Space shall be the same amount as the Base Rent per rentable\nsquare foot of the Existing Space, and the Base Rent for the Conference Space shall escalate on the same January 1 date as the Base\nRent escalates for the Existing Space), calculated in the manner shown for purposes of example only in clause (v) of Paragraph 4(a)\nabove.\n-29-\n(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Paragraph 13(b)(ii) above, provided no Event of\nDefault by Tenant exists under the Lease (as amended), Landlord grants to Tenant an abatement of the Base Rent otherwise payable\nhereunder with respect to the Conference Space in an amount equal to a portion of the fourteen (14) monthly installments of\nabatement of Base Rent for Expansion Space A based on the ratio that the number of months remaining in the Fourteenth\nAmendment Extension Term on the Conference Space Commencement Date bears to 123 months (i.e., the total number of months in\nthe Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term), calculated in the manner shown for purposes of example only in Paragraph 4(b)(v)\nabove, it being acknowledged and agreed, however, that the Base Rent escalation for the Conference Space as set forth above shall\nbe based on the full and unabated amount of Base Rent payable therefor under the Lease (as amended hereby).\n(iv) Commencing on the first anniversary of the Conference Space Commencement Date and continuing\nduring the remainder of the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord Tenant’s Pro Rata Share of the\nExpense Excess and the Tax Excess with respect to the Conference Space, except that, (A) the “Base Year” shall be deemed to mean\ncalendar year 2026 for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term (and accordingly, Tenant shall not be required to pay\nany increases in Expenses or Taxes for the Conference Space for the period commencing on January 1, 2026 and ending on the day\nbefore the first anniversary of the Conference Space Commencement Date, both dates inclusive), (B) Tenant’s “Pro Rata Share” for\nthe Conference Space shall be deemed to mean .78% for the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term (based on 257,824 rentable\nsquare feet in the Building and 2,002 rentable square feet in the Conference Space), and (C) the Controllable Expenses Cap shall be\nreset for the Conference Space to commence with calendar year 2027 and accordingly, (I) the first Controllable Expenses Cap for the\nConference Space shall be the actual amount of Controllable Expenses for calendar year 2026 multiplied by one hundred five\npercent (105%) (and the Controllable Expenses Cap for the Conference Space for each calendar year thereafter shall be calculated by\nmultiplying the actual amount of Controllable Expenses for the prior calendar year or, if less, the Controllable Expenses Cap for the\nConference Space for the prior calendar year, by 105%), and (II) all references in the Lease to the Controllable Expenses Cap with\nrespect to the Conference Space shall be deemed to mean the Controllable Expenses Cap as modified hereby.\n(v) The allowance to which Tenant shall be entitled for the Conference Space, to be disbursed in accordance\nwith terms and conditions substantially similar to those set forth in Attachment B hereto, shall be an amount equal to (A) a portion of\na $130.00 per rentable square foot allowance, based on the ratio that the number of months remaining in the Fourteenth Amendment\nExtension Term on the Conference Space Commencement Date bears to 123 months (i.e., the total number of months in the\nFourteenth Amendment Extension Term), multiplied by (B) the number of rentable square feet in the Conference Space.\n(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Event of Default exists at the time Tenant elects to lease\nthe Conference Space or at any time thereafter prior to\n-30-\nTenant’s occupancy of the Conference Space, at Landlord’s election, Tenant shall have no right to lease the Conference Space.\n(d) Promptly after Tenant elects in writing to lease the Conference Space, the parties shall execute an amendment to\nthe Lease (reasonably acceptable to Landlord and

Refurbishment. It is the intent of the parties that, if Landlord desires to reposition the Building and/or the Garage in\nconnection with the expiration of the Lease, any aspects of such repositioning of the Building, and any aspects of such repositioning\nof the Garage that materially adversely affect Tenant’s access to or use of the Garage, shall be performed after the earlier of (a)\nexpiration or earlier termination of the Lease and (b) the date on which Tenant and any subtenant for which no Landlord approval is\nrequired under the Lease vacates the Premises; provided, however, that from and after the earlier of (x) the date that is ninety (90)\ndays prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease and (y) the date on which Tenant and any subtenant for which no\nLandlord approval is required under the Lease vacates the Premises, Landlord shall also be permitted to perform aspects of such\nrepositioning that do not materially adversely affect Tenant’s access to or use of the Premises for Tenant’s normal business\noperations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Lease, during the Fourteenth Amendment Extension Term and,\nif exercised, the First Renewal Term and the Second Renewal Term, Landlord shall not voluntarily undertake any substantial\nBuilding renovation or replacement to any material portion of the Building, such as re-skinning or re-cladding the Building,\nreplacing the windows of the Building, renovating the ground floor lobby, restrooms or other portions of the Building that would\nconstitute common areas on a multi-tenant floor, replacing the Building systems or otherwise performing improvements of similar\nscope, in each case, without Tenant’s prior written approval in its sole and absolute discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, the\nforegoing provisions of this Paragraph 14 shall not be construed to limit Landlord’s repair, maintenance and/or legal compliance\nobligations under the Lease or Landlord’s ability to comply with Laws.\n15. Delicatessen.\n(a) Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the term of the lease for the delicatessen operating on the ground floor\nof the Building as of the Amendment Date (the “Deli Area”), provided that at least eighteen (18) months remain in the Term of the\nLease, Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to lease the Deli Area to another delicatessen or restaurant with carry-out\nsandwich lunch service (in either case, a “Deli”), on commercially reasonable terms. If Landlord determines, in its sole but good\nfaith discretion, that it is not\n-31-\nreasonably able to lease the Deli Area for any such use within a commercially reasonable time period on commercially reasonable\nterms, then prior to leasing the Deli Area to another third party (that is not a Deli), Landlord shall offer Tenant the right to lease the\nDeli Area for a term that is coterminous with the then-remaining Term of the Lease, in accordance with the following terms and\nconditions.\n(b) In the event the Deli Area is available for lease by Tenant in accordance with the foregoing, Landlord shall\nnotify Tenant of the anticipated availability date therefor. Tenant shall have a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of\nLandlord’s notice to notify Landlord in writing (“Tenant’s Deli Area Election”) whether Tenant desires to lease the Deli Area.

Except as otherwise provided herein, all other terms and conditions of the Lease (as amended) shall\napply to the Deli Area, except that no concession, abatement or other allowance shall apply with respect to the Deli Area except as\nare related to the fair market rent determination pursuant to Paragraph 3(b).\n(c) If Tenant leases the Deli Area hereunder, Landlord shall deliver possession of the Deli Area to Tenant promptly\nafter the date on which the Deli Area is vacated by the prior tenant thereof. The rent for such Deli Area shall commence on the date\non which Landlord delivers the Deli Area to Tenant in its then as-is condition and the term therefor shall be coterminous with the\nTerm applicable to the remainder of the Premises.\n(d) Landlord shall incur no liability, and the expiration date of the term for the Deli Area shall not be extended, if\nLandlord is unable to deliver possession of the Deli Area to Tenant on the anticipated delivery date due to the tenant’s refusal to\nvacate, or for any other reason beyond Landlord’s reasonable control. In such event, Landlord agrees to use commercially reasonable\nefforts to obtain possession of such Deli Area as soon as reasonably possible, including without limitation, the filing of eviction\nproceedings.\n(e) If Tenant's Deli Area Election is not given timely, then Tenant's right to lease the Deli Area shall lapse and be of\nno further force or effect and Landlord shall be free to lease such Deli Area to any other party (including without limitation, any\nparty that is not operating a Deli) on such terms and conditions as Landlord in its sole discretion may determine.\n(f) If Tenant is leasing less than the entire office area in the Building or if there exists a Default by Tenant under the\nLease on the date on which Landlord would have notified Tenant of the availability of the Deli Area or any anytime thereafter until\nthe Deli Area is occupied by Tenant, then, at Landlord's election, Tenant shall not have any right to lease the Deli Area hereunder.\n-32-\n(g) Promptly after Tenant elects in writing to lease the Deli Area, the parties shall execute an amendment to the\nLease (reasonably acceptable to Landlord and Tenant) adding such Deli Area to the Premises on the terms and conditions specified\nherein.\n16. Self-Help. Effective from and after the earlier of (x) February 1, 2026, and (y) the date on which all office tenants\n(other than Tenant) have vacated their premises in the Building and surrendered possession thereof to Landlord (as applicable, the\n“Single-Tenant Date”), if (a) Landlord fails to perform any repair, maintenance or legal compliance obligations expressly required\nof Landlord under the Lease (the “Delayed Repair”), (b) such Delayed Repair materially adversely affects Tenant’s ability to\nconduct business operations in any material portion of the Premises or constitutes a material and imminent threat to health or safety\nwith respect to the Building, (c) the performance of such Delayed Repair is within Landlord’s control, (d) such Delayed Repair shall\nnot be performed within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof to Landlord or, if such failure cannot reasonably be cured within\nthirty (30) days, then such longer period as may be required for such cure provided that Landlord commences such cure within such\nthirty (30)-day period and diligently pursues such cure to completion, and (e) Tenant reasonably believes that it could perform the\nDelayed Repair more quickly than Landlord and describes the particulars thereof with reasonable specificity, then Tenant shall have\nthe right to notify Landlord and the holder of any Mortgage to which the Lease is subordinate in writing of Tenant’s intention to\nperform such Delayed Repair (the “Repair Notice”). The Repair Notice shall (i) include a statement that Tenant intends to exercise\nthis right to self help and (ii) identify in reasonable detail both the basis for the self help and the actions Tenant intends to take to\nperform such repair (including without limitation, the information required by clause (e) above). If Landlord or the holder of any\nsuch Mortgage commences such Delayed Repair within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Repair Notice and diligently pursues the\nDelayed Repair to completion, then Tenant shall have no further rights under this Paragraph 16 with respect to such Delayed Repair\n(unless and until Landlord or the holder of such Mortgage fails to diligently proceed with such Delayed Repair). If Landlord or the\nholder of such Mortgage fails to commence such Delayed Repair within such thirty (30) day period or thereafter to diligently\nproceed with such Delayed Repair to completion, then Tenant shall have the right, as Tenant’s sole and exclusive remedy in\nconnection with the Delayed Repair (but without negating any abatement to which Tenant may be entitled pursuant to Section 8.05\nof the Initial Lease with respect to a Service Failure), to perform the Delayed Repair, in which event (A) Tenant shall ensure that all\nsuch work is performed solely by licensed and qualified contractors, subcontractors and design consultants (including without\nlimitation, any subcontractors required under any applicable maintenance contract or required to maintain the applicable warranty\ntherefor, except to the extent such subcontractor(s) are causing such Delayed Repair), and only after the entity performing such work\nhas obtained public liability and worker's compensation insurance policies with commercially reasonable limits, (B) Tenant shall\ncause all such work is performed in a good and workerlike manner and in accordance with the Rules and Procedures for Contractors\nattached hereto as Schedule I to Attachment B (except that (I) from and after the Single-Tenant Date, Landlord shall not enforce\nagainst Tenant any Rules and Procedures for Contractors that relate solely to not disturbing other Building tenants, except to the\nextent such non-enforcement would cause Landlord to be in violation of any such other Building tenant’s\n-33-\nlease (in which event Landlord shall have the right to enforce the same), (II) Landlord shall not enforce any such Rules and\nProcedures for Contractors for the purpose of negating Tenant’s self-help rights hereunder and (III) in the event that Landlord does\nnot respond to any approvals or actions required of Landlord by such Rules and Procedures for Contractors in a timely manner\nfollowing Tenant’s written request therefor, Tenant shall have the right to proceed pursuant to this Paragraph 16 without the Landlord\napproval or other action with respect to which Landlord failed to timely respond), and all governmental laws and regulations\napplicable to the Building, and only after obtaining all required governmental permits and approvals therefor, and (C) Tenant shall\nfurnish Landlord with plans and specifications for all such work prior to the performance thereof and as-built plans following the\ncompletion thereof, and Tenant shall not permit any mechanics’ or materialmen’s liens to be placed on the Property in connection\ntherewith; provided, however, that in no event shall Tenant take any measures that affect any structural elements of the Base\nBuilding, or any measures to replace any Base Building Systems.
