Mr. Meghji has served as the Managing Partner of M3 Partners since 2015 and is a nationally recognized U.S. turnaround professional with a track record of building value across a wide range of sectors, including power, energy and industrials. M3 Partners is a merchant banking, investment and restructuring advisory firm founded by Mr. Meghji which provides operational, strategic and financial advisory solutions to support complex businesses at inflection points in their growth trajectory. Mr. Meghji has more than 30 years of advisory and management experience in building value in companies that are facing financial, operational or strategic inflection points and transitions. He has accomplished this through both operating management and financial advisory roles, often in partnership with some of the world’s leading financial institutions, private equity firms and hedge fund investors. Mr. Meghji has led the repositioning of, and driven value creation at, numerous businesses over the past two decades in an operating management or financial advisory capacity. In his capacity as a restructuring and financial advisory professional, Mr. Meghji has served periodically as Chief Restructuring Officer (or in an analogous position) of companies which elected to utilize bankruptcy proceedings as a part of their financial restructuring process and, as such, he served as an executive officer of various companies which filed bankruptcy petitions under federal law and also has periodically served as an independent director of companies, some of which similarly elected to utilize bankruptcy proceedings. Through M3 Partners, Mr. Meghji has played an integral role in a number of significant restructurings over recent years, including Zachry Holdings, Inc. in 2024, Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. in 2023, Whittaker Clark & Daniels, Inc. in 2023, PWM Property Management LLC in 2021, Seadrill Partners LLC bankruptcy in 2020, Sable Permian Resources, LLC in 2020, Sanchez Energy Corporation in 2020, Barneys Inc. in 2019, Sears Holdings Corporation in 2018, Real Alloy Intermediate Holding, LLC in 2017.

These insurance companies provided life, property and casualty insurance coverage to Springleaf’s customers. Springleaf was created in late-2010 when American International Group, Inc. sold 80% of its subsidiary, American General Finance Inc., to affiliates of Fortress Investment Group LLC. At the time of the sale, American General Finance Inc. provided consumer loans, retail financing and mortgages to more than one million families through more than 1,100 branches located across the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the United Kingdom. After multiple years of operating losses, Springleaf turned profitable in 2013 as a result of the strategic, management and operational improvements implemented by its new ownership and management team, evidencing a significant turnaround in its performance. Springleaf went public in October 2013 at a $1.95 billion valuation. As part of its senior management team and Head of Strategy for the company, Mr. Meghji played a key role in this successful transition.\n\n## ​\n\n## Matthew Perkal\n\n## Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\n## ​\n\nMatthew Perkal serves as our Chief Executive Officer and one of our directors.
