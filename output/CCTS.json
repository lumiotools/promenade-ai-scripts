          "url": "https://cactusac1.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cactus-SPAC-Code-of-Ethics-Oct.-202111966296.2.pdf",
          "content": "Cactus Acquisition Corp. 1 Limited\nCode of Ethics\nAdopted effective as of:\nOctober 28, 2021\n1. Introduction\nThis Code of Ethics (“Code”) has been adopted by the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Cactus\nAcquisition Corp. 1 Limited (together with its subsidiaries (if any), the “Company”) and summarizes\nthe standards that must guide our actions. While covering a wide range of business practices and\nprocedures, these standards cannot and do not cover every issue that may arise, or every situation where\nethical decisions must be made, but rather set forth key guiding principles that represent Company policies\nand establish conditions for directors, officers, consultants, advisors and (if applicable) employees of the\nCompany.\nWe must strive to foster a culture of honesty and accountability. Our commitment to the highest level of\nethical conduct should be reflected in all of the Company’s business activities including, but not limited to,\nrelationships with directors, officers, consultants, advisors, employees (if applicable), customers, suppliers,\ncompetitors, the government, the public, and our shareholders. All of our directors, officers, consultants,\nadvisors and (if applicable) employees must conduct themselves according to the language and spirit of this\nCode and seek to avoid even the appearance of improper behavior. Even well- intentioned actions that\nviolate the law or this Code may result in negative consequences for the Company and for the individuals\ninvolved.\nOne of our Company’s most valuable assets is our reputation for integrity, professionalism and fairness.\nWe should all recognize that our actions are the foundation of our reputation and adhering to this Code and\napplicable law is imperative.\n2. Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations\nWe are strongly committed to conducting our business affairs with honesty and integrity and in full\ncompliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. No director, officer, advisor or (if applicable)\nemployee of the Company shall commit an illegal or unethical act, or instruct others to do so, for any reason.\n3. Trading on Inside Information\nUsing non-public, Company information to trade in securities, or providing a family member, friend or any\nother person with a “tip”, is illegal. All non-public, company information should be considered inside\ninformation and should never be used for personal gain. You are required to familiarize yourself and comply\nwith the Company’s Policy Against Insider Trading, copies of which are distributed to all officers, directors,\nconsultants, advisors and (if applicable) employees, and are available from the Company’s Secretary. You\nshould contact the Secretary with any questions about your ability to buy or sell securities.\n4. Protection of Confidential Proprietary Information\nConfidential proprietary information generated and gathered in our business is a valuable Company\nasset. Protecting this information plays a vital role in our continued growth and ability to compete, and all\n1\nproprietary information should be maintained in strict confidence, except when disclosure is authorized by\nthe Company or required by law.\nProprietary information includes all non-public information that might be useful to competitors or that\ncould be harmful to the Company, its customers or its suppliers if disclosed. Intellectual property, such as\ntrade secrets, patents, trademarks and copyrights, as well as business, research and new product plans,\nobjectives and strategies, records, databases, salary and benefits data, employee medical information,\ncustomer, employee and suppliers lists and any unpublished financial or pricing information must also be\nprotected.\nUnauthorized use or distribution of proprietary information violates Company policy and could be illegal.\nSuch use or distribution could result in negative consequences for both the Company and the individuals\ninvolved, including potential legal and disciplinary actions. We respect the property rights of other\ncompanies and their proprietary information and require our officers, directors, advisors and to observe\nsuch rights.\nYour obligation to protect the Company’s proprietary and confidential information continues even after\nyou leave the Company, and you must return all proprietary information in your possession upon leaving\nthe Company.\nThe provisions of this Section 4 are qualified in their entirety by reference to Section 11.\n5. Conflicts of Interest\nOur directors, officers, consultants, advisors and (if applicable) employees have an obligation to act in the\nbest interest of the Company. All directors, officers, consultants, advisors and (if applicable) employees\nshould endeavor to avoid situations that present a potential or actual conflict between their interest and the\ninterest of the Company.\nA “conflict of interest” occurs when a person’s private interest interferes in any way, or even appears to\ninterfere, with the interest of the Company, including its subsidiaries and affiliates. A conflict of interest\nmay arise when a director, officer, consultant, advisor or (if applicable) employee takes an action or has an\ninterest that may make it difficult for him or her to perform his or her work objectively and effectively.\nConflicts of interest may also arise when a director, officer, consultant, advisor or (if applicable) employee\n(or his or her family members) receives improper personal benefits as a result of the director’s, officer’s,\nconsultant’s, advisor’s or (if applicable) employee’s position in the Company.\nAlthough it would not be possible to describe every situation in which a conflict of interest may arise, the\nfollowing are examples of situations that may constitute a conflict of interest:\n• Working, in any capacity, for a competitor, customer or supplier while employed by the Company.\n• Accepting gifts of more than modest value or receiving personal discounts (if such discounts are not\ngenerally offered to the public) or other benefits as a result of your position in the Company from a\ncompetitor, customer or supplier.\n• Competing with the Company for the purchase or sale of property, products, services or other interests.\n• Having an interest in a transaction involving the Company, a competitor, a customer or supplier (other\nthan as an employee, officer or director of the Company and not including routine investments in\npublicly traded companies).\n• Receiving a loan or guarantee of an obligation as a result of your position with the Company.\n• Directing business to a supplier owned or managed by, or which employs, a relative or friend.\n2\nSituations involving a conflict of interest may not always be obvious or easy to resolve. You should report\nactions that may involve a conflict of interest to the Secretary.\nIn order to avoid conflicts of interests, senior executive officers and directors must disclose to the\nSecretary any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to such a\nconflict, and the Secretary shall notify the committee of the Board of Directors with responsibility for\ncorporate governance of any such disclosure. Conflicts of interests involving the Secretary or directors shall\nbe disclosed to the committee of the Board of Directors with responsibility for corporate governance.\n6. Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets\nProtecting Corporate assets and preventing loss, theft and misuse of Company assets directly impact our\nprofitability. Any suspected loss, misuse or theft should be reported to the Secretary.\nThe sole purpose of the Company’s equipment, vehicles, supplies and technology is the conduct of our\nbusiness. They may only be used for Company business consistent with Company guidelines.\n7. Corporate Opportunities\nIf any of our directors, officers, consultants, advisors and (if applicable) employees becomes aware of a\nbusiness combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary\nor contractual obligations, he or she may need to honor these fiduciary or contractual obligations to present\nsuch business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands\nlaw. However, directors, officers, consultants, advisors and (if applicable) employees may be prohibited\nfrom taking for themselves business opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate property,\ninformation or position. No director, officer, consultant, advisor or (if applicable) employee may use\ncorporate property, information or position for personal gain, and no director, officer, consultant, advisor\nor (if applicable) employee may compete with the Company. Competing with the Company may involve\nengaging in the same line of business as the Company, or any situation where the director, officer,\nconsultant, advisor or (if applicable) employee takes away from the Company opportunities for sales or\npurchases of products, services or interests. Directors, officers, consultants, advisors or (if applicable)\nemployee owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so\narises.\n8. Fair Dealing\nEach director, officer, consultant, advisor and (if applicable) employee of the Company should endeavor to\ndeal fairly with customers, suppliers, competitors, the public and one another at all times and in accordance\nwith ethical business practices. No one should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation,\nconcealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair\ndealing practice. No bribes, kickbacks or other similar payments in any form shall be made directly or\nindirectly to or for anyone for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining any other\nfavorable action. The Company and any director, officer, consultant, advisor or (if applicable) employee\ninvolved may be subject to disciplinary action as well as potential civil or criminal liability for violation of\nthis policy.\nOccasional business gifts to, or entertainment of, non-government employees in connection with business\ndiscussions or the development of business relationships are generally deemed appropriate in the conduct\nof Company business. However, these gifts should be given infrequently and their value should be modest.\nGifts or entertainment in any form that would likely result in a feeling or expectation of personal obligation\n3\nshould not be extended or accepted.\nPractices that are acceptable in a commercial business environment may be against the law or the policies\ngoverning federal, state or local government employees. Therefore, no gifts or business entertainment of\nany kind may be given to any government employee without the prior approval of the Secretary.\nExcept in certain limited circumstances, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”)\nprohibits giving anything of value directly or indirectly to any “foreign official” for the purpose of\nobtaining or retaining business. When in doubt as to whether a contemplated payment or gift may violate\nthe FCPA, contact the Secretary before taking any action.\n9. Quality of Public Disclosures\nThe Company has a responsibility to provide full and accurate information in our public disclosures, in all\nmaterial respects, about the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Our reports and\ndocuments filed with or submitted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and our other\npublic communications shall include full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure, and the\nCompany has established a Disclosure Committee consisting of senior management to assist in monitoring\nsuch disclosures.\n10. Compliance with This Code and Reporting of Any Illegal or Unethical Behavior\nAll directors, officers, consultants, advisors and (if applicable) employees are expected to comply with all\nof the provisions of this Code. The Code will be strictly enforced and violations will be dealt with\nimmediately, including by subjecting persons who violate its provisions to corrective and/or disciplinary\naction such as dismissal or removal from office. Violations of the Code that involve illegal behavior will\nbe reported to the appropriate authorities.\nSituations which may involve a violation of ethics, laws, rules, regulations or this Code may not always be\nclear and may require the exercise of judgment or the making of difficult decisions. Directors, officers,\nconsultants, advisors and (if applicable) employees should promptly report any concerns about a violation\nof ethics, laws, rules, regulations or this Code to their supervisors or the Secretary or, in the case of\naccounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nInterested parties may also communicate directly with the Company’s non-management directors through\ncontact information located in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K.\nAny concerns about a violation of ethics, laws, rules, regulations or this Code by any senior executive\nofficer or director should be reported promptly to the Secretary, and the Secretary shall notify the\nChairman of the Audit Committee of any violation. Any such concerns involving the Secretary should be\nreported to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.\nThe Company encourages all directors, officers, consultants, advisors and (if applicable) employees to\nreport any suspected violations promptly and intends to thoroughly investigate any good faith reports of\nviolations. The Company will not tolerate any kind of retaliation for reports or complaints regarding\nmisconduct that were made in good faith. Open communication of issues and concerns by all personnel\nwithout fear of retribution or retaliation is vital to the successful implementation of this Code. All directors,\nofficers, consultants, advisors and (if applicable) employees are required to cooperate in any internal\ninvestigations of misconduct and unethical behavior.\nThe Company recognizes the need for this Code to be applied equally to everyone it covers. The Secretary\nof the Company will have primary authority and responsibility for the enforcement of this Code, subject to\nthe supervision of the Board of Directors, or, in the case of accounting, internal accounting controls or\n4\nauditing matters, the Audit Committee, and the Company will devote the necessary resources to enable the\nSecretary to establish such procedures as may be reasonably necessary to create a culture of accountability\nand facilitate compliance with the Code. Questions concerning this Code should be directed to the\nSecretary.\nThe provisions of this Section 10 are qualified in their entirety by reference to Section 11.\n11. Reporting Violations to a Governmental Agency\nYou understand that you have the right to:\n• Report possible violations of United States state, federal or local law or regulation that have occurred,\nare occurring, or are about to occur to any governmental agency or entity, or self-regulatory\norganization;\n• Cooperate voluntarily with, or respond to any inquiry from, or provide testimony before any self-\nregulatory organization or any other United States federal, state or local regulatory or law enforcement\nauthority;\n• Make reports or disclosures to law enforcement or a regulatory authority without prior notice to, or\nauthorization from, the Company; and\n• Respond truthfully to a valid subpoena.\nYou have the right to not be retaliated against for reporting, either internally to the Company or to any\ngovernmental agency or entity or self-regulatory organization, information which you reasonably believe\nrelates to a possible violation of law.

          "content": "CACTUS ACQUISITION CORP. 1 LIMITED\nINSIDER TRADING POLICY\nEffective October 28, 2021\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThis Policy Regarding Insider Trading and Dissemination of Inside Information (this “Policy”)\ndescribes the policy of Cactus Acquisition Corp. 1 Limited (the “Company”) regarding:\n• the trading of securities while you are in possession of Inside Information (as defined below)\n(“insider trading”) about the Company or any other company; and\n• other misuse of material non-public information (“Inside Information”) of the Company or\nany other company.\nYour obligations and potential liability under securities laws dealing with insider trading abuses are\nalso outlined below.\nThis Policy provides an overview of the most significant aspects involved in insider trading. Every\ndirector, officer, consultant, advisor and (if applicable) employee of the Company must read and retain this\nPolicy.\nII. STATEMENT OF THE POLICY\nNo director, officer, consultant, advisor, employee (if applicable) or other Insider (as defined\nbelow) shall:\n• trade in securities of the Company or any other company while in possession of Inside\nInformation concerning the Company or such other company;\n• disseminate Inside Information of the Company or any other company to others (except for\nlegitimate Company purposes in accordance with Company communications policies; provided\nthat the disclosing person reasonably does not expect the recipient to trade in securities, or\ndisseminate the information to others who may trade in securities, while in possession of such\nInside Information); or\n• engage in any other action or conduct to take advantage of Inside Information.\nThe prohibited dissemination of Inside Information includes the disclosure through written, oral or\nelectronic means to all persons or entities, including friends, family members, business contacts or others.\nEven the appearance of improper conduct must be avoided to preserve the Company’s reputation\nfor adhering to high ethical standards of conduct. Accordingly, conduct which merely suggests the\npossibility of insider trading may be deemed by the Company, in its sole discretion, to be a violation of this\nPolicy.\nIII. FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITING INSIDER TRADING\n1\nRule 10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), has\nbeen determined by the courts to prohibit trading by an Insider (as defined below) of any securities (debt or\nequity) of a company on the basis of Inside Information about such company. Liability under Rule 10b-5\ncan apply to trading in the Company’s securities or the securities of any other company if one is in\npossession of Inside Information about the company whose securities are traded. The prohibition against\ninsider trading applies to the Company’s officers, directors, consultants, advisors, employees (if\napplicable) and other Insiders at all times regardless of whether or not the Company is observing a\nscheduled or special “blackout” period.\nLiability under Rule 10b-5 may attach not only to Insiders who trade while in possession of Inside\nInformation, but also, under certain circumstances, to (i) Insiders who disclose or tip Inside Information\n(tippers) to third parties without trading themselves, and (ii) third parties (such as relatives, business\nassociates or friends) who have received Inside Information from Insiders (tippees) and trade while in\npossession of that Inside Information.\nIV. THE CONSEQUENCES OF INSIDER TRADING\nIndividuals who trade on material non-public information (or tip information to others) can be\nsubject to an array of civil and criminal penalties. Violations are taken very seriously by the U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law in this area. Potential\nsanctions include:\n• disgorgement of profits gained or losses avoided and interest thereon;\n• a civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided;\n• a bar from acting as an officer or director of a publicly traded company;\n• a criminal fine of up to $5 million ($25 million for an entity); and\n• a jail term of up to twenty years.\nThese penalties can apply even if the individual is not a director, officer or senior manager. In\naddition to the potentially severe civil and criminal penalties for violation of the insider trading laws,\nviolation of this Policy may result in the imposition of Company sanctions, including dismissal. A\nconviction or finding of liability for insider trading can also result in individuals being banned generally\nfrom employment in the securities or financial industries or other employment, and even a mere allegation\nof insider trading can result in severe harm to one’s professional and personal reputation.\nA transaction that may be necessary or seem justifiable for independent reasons (including a need\nto raise money for a personal financial emergency) is neither an exception to this Policy nor a safeguard\nagainst prosecution for violation of insider trading laws.\nFor a company (as well as possibly any supervisory person) that fails to take appropriate steps to\nprevent illegal trading, a civil penalty of the greater of $1.425 million or three times the profit gained or loss\navoided as a result of a controlled person’s violation. There are also likely to be shareholder lawsuits and\nadverse publicity arising from such illegal conduct.\nV. WHO IS AN “INSIDER” FOR PURPOSES OF THE INSIDER TRADING\nPROHIBITIONS?\n2\nAn “Insider” for purposes of insider trading law is any person who possesses Inside Information;\nthe status results from such possession and not simply a person’s position, if any, with the Company.\nAccordingly, Insiders subject to liability for insider trading are not solely those executive officers and\ndirectors who are required to report their securities transactions of Company ordinary shares under Section\n16 of the Exchange Act and who are also often referred to as “insiders” for purposes of that law. The\ncategory of potential Insiders for purposes of insider trading law includes not only the Company’s directors,\nofficers and employees, but also outside professional advisors and business consultants who have access to\nInside Information prior to its public release and absorption by the securities markets.\nVI. PERSONS COVERED BY THE POLICY\nThis Policy covers the directors, officers and (if applicable) employees of the Company, and outside\nprofessional advisors and business consultants of the Company who have access to Inside Information of\nthe Company, as well as their Family Members and Controlled Entities.\n“Family Members” include a person’s spouse, partner, financially dependent children, relative, or\nother members of such person’s immediate household to whose support such person contributes or whose\ninvestments such person controls.\n“Controlled Entities” include any legal entities controlled by a person, such as any corporations,\npartnerships, or trusts.\nVII. INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY\nPersons subject to this Policy have ethical and legal obligations to maintain the confidentiality of\nInside Information and to not trade while in possession of Inside Information. Each individual is responsible\nfor making sure that he or she complies with this Policy, and that any Family Member or Controlled Entity\nalso complies with this policy. In all cases, the responsibility for determining whether an individual is in\npossession of Inside Information rests with that individual, and any action on the part of the Company, the\nAdministrator (as defined under the caption “Administration of the Policy”) or any other employee or\ndirector pursuant to this Policy (or otherwise) does not in any way constitute legal advice or insulate an\nindividual from liability under applicable securities laws. You could be subject to severe legal penalties and\ndisciplinary action by the Company for any conduct prohibited by this Policy or applicable securities laws,\nas described above in more detail under the heading “The Consequences of Insider Trading.”\nVIII. TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THIS POLICY\nThe trading covered by this Policy includes all types of transactions and securities, including\nordinary shares, options or warrants to purchase ordinary shares, or any other type of securities, including\n(but not limited to) preferred shares, convertible debentures, as well as derivative securities that are issued\nby third parties, such as exchange-traded put or call options or swaps relating to securities of the Company\nor another company with respect to which an Insider possesses Inside Information.\nIX. WHAT IS MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION?\nMaterial information is any information that a reasonable investor would consider important in\narriving at a decision to buy, sell or hold the securities of a company and/or would view its disclosure as\nsignificantly altering the total mix of information otherwise made available.\nNon-Public information is information that is not generally known to the public.\n3\nExamples. Examples of non-public information that generally would be regarded as material and\nthus Inside Information include:\n• financial information, such as revenues, expenses, earnings, new sales or investment returns;\n• information about a transaction that will affect the financial condition or performance of the\ncompany in a significant manner, such as a pending or proposed merger, acquisition, tender\noffer, sale of assets, or disposition of a subsidiary, or entering into or terminating a significant\ncontract;\n• earnings estimates;\n• a share split or the offering of additional securities;\n• major litigation;\n• changes in senior management;\n• major new products; and\n• the gain or loss of a substantial customer.\nEither positive or negative information may be material. The foregoing list is not exhaustive; other\ntypes of information may be material at any particular time, depending upon all the circumstances.\nX. TRADING\nThis Policy permits an Insider to trade securities beginning at the close of regular trading on the\nsecond full Trading Day after all Inside Information has been disclosed to the public through general release\nto the national news media, which will provide the securities markets a sufficient opportunity to absorb and\nevaluate the information.\n“Trading Day” means a day on which the principal U.S. stock exchange on which shares of the\nCompany’s ordinary shares are then listed is open for trading.\nFor example, if Inside Information (including quarterly or annual earnings) is disclosed at (a) 8:00\na.m., Eastern Time, on a Monday, then trading may commence after 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on Tuesday,\n(b) 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on Monday, then trading may commence after 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on\nWednesday or (c) 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on Monday, then trading may commence after 4:00 p.m., Eastern\nTime, on Wednesday.\nPlease refer to the paragraph below captioned “Additional Procedures” for additional restrictions\non trading.\nXI. TRANSACTIONS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS POLICY\nA. Bona Fide Gifts\nBona fide gifts are not transactions subject to this Policy, unless the person making the gift has\nreason to believe that the recipient intends to sell the Company securities while the person making the gift\nis aware of Inside Information or during a blackout period to which the person making the gift is subject;\nprovided that bona fide gifts of Company securities by directors, officers who have been designated by the\nCompany’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) as “officers” for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act\n4\n(collectively with the directors, “Section 16 Reporting Persons”) and certain other employees who may\nbe designated by the Administrator from time to time (“Designated Individuals”) are subject to the pre-\nclearance procedures set forth below under the caption “Additional Procedures.”\nB. Option Exercises\nThis Policy does not apply to the exercise of an employee option acquired pursuant to the\nCompany’s plans, or to the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which a person has elected to\nhave the Company withhold shares subject to an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements; provided\nthat such exercises by Section 16 Reporting Persons and Designated Individuals are subject to the pre-\nclearance procedures set forth below under the caption “Additional Procedures.” This Policy does apply,\nhowever, to any sale of shares as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option, or any other market\nsale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option.\nC. Restricted Share Awards\nThis Policy does not apply to the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to\nhave the Company withhold shares to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of any restricted\nshares; provided that such exercise by Section 16 Reporting Persons and Designated Individuals is subject\nto the pre-clearance procedures set forth below under the caption “Additional Procedures.” This Policy does\napply, however, to any market sale of restricted shares.\nD. Mutual Funds\nTransactions in mutual funds that are invested in securities of the Company or another company\nwith respect to which an Insider possesses Inside Information are not transactions subject to this Policy.\nE. Other Similar Transactions\nAny other purchase of Company securities from the Company or sales of Company securities to the\nCompany are not subject to this Policy.\nF. Rule 10b5-1 Plans\nSecurities trading pursuant to contracts, plans or instructions complying with the requirements of\nRule 10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act (“Rule 10b5-1 Plans”) and entered into in good faith while the\nperson entering into the Rule 10b5-1 Plan is not in possession of Inside Information is not subject to this\nPolicy, provided that the adoption and maintenance of any such Rule 10b5-1 Plan by such person must be\napproved by the Administrator and must comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1).\nXII. SPECIAL AND PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company has determined that there is a heightened legal risk and/or the appearance of improper\nor inappropriate conduct if the persons subject to this Policy engage in certain types of transactions.\nTherefore any persons covered by this Policy must comply with the following:\nA. Hedging Transactions\nHedging or monetization transactions can be accomplished through a number of possible\nmechanisms, including through the use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity\nswaps, collars and exchange funds. Such hedging transactions may permit a director, officer, consultant,\n5\nadvisor or employee (if applicable) to continue to own Company securities obtained through employee\nbenefit plans or otherwise, but without the full risks and rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the\ndirector, officer, consultant, advisor or (if applicable) employee may no longer have the same objectives as\nthe Company’s other shareholders. Therefore, directors, officers, consultants, advisors and (if applicable)\nemployees, as well as their Family Members and Controlled Entities, are prohibited from engaging in any\nsuch transactions.\nB. Margin Accounts and Pledged Securities\nIn order to avoid a margin sale or foreclosure sale at a time when a pledgor, who is a Company\ndirector, officer, consultant, advisor or (if applicable) employee, or their Family Members or Controlled\nEntities, is aware of Inside Information or otherwise is not permitted to trade Company securities due to a\nblackout period, no Company director, officer, consultant, advisor or (if applicable) employee, or their\nFamily Members or Controlled Entities, may hold Company securities in a margin account or otherwise\npledge (or hypothecate) Company securities as collateral for a loan without first obtaining prior approval\nfrom the Administrator. Pre-clearance is required for such transactions because Company securities held in\na margin account may be sold by the broker without the customer’s consent if the customer fails to meet a\nmargin call and Company securities pledged (or hypothecated) as collateral for a loan may be sold in\nforeclosure if the borrower defaults on the loan. Any Company director, officer, consultant, advisor or (if\napplicable) employee, or their Family Members or Controlled Entities, preparing to pledge Company\nsecurities or hold such securities in a margin account must submit a request for approval to the Administrator\nat least two weeks prior to the proposed execution of documents evidencing the proposed pledge or margin\naccount. In its request, such Company director, officer , consultant, advisor or (if applicable) employee, or\ntheir Family Members or Controlled Entities, shall:\n• enclose copies of the governing documents evidencing the proposed pledge or margin account,\nwhich governing documents must provide such person with the opportunity to substitute or\nprovide additional collateral or to repay the loan before the pledged Company securities may\nbe sold; and\n• undertake to the Company (in form and manner satisfactory to the Administrator and the\nCompany) (i) to maintain adequate financial capacity to repay the loan or cover the margin call,\nas applicable, without resort to the pledged Company securities and (ii) to substitute or provide\nadditional collateral or repay the loan in the event of a borrower default or margin call, as\napplicable, at a time when such person is aware of Inside Information or otherwise is not\npermitted to trade Company securities due to a blackout period.\nThe above is not meant to restrict the rehypothecation or lending of securities held in a brokerage\naccount; provided that the securities are permitted to be held in such account in accordance with this Policy.\nXIII. ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES\nThe Company has established additional procedures in order to assist the Company in the\nadministration of this Policy, to facilitate compliance with laws prohibiting insider trading while in\npossession of Inside Information, and to avoid the appearance of any impropriety. These additional\nprocedures are applicable only to those individuals described below.\nA. Pre-Clearance Procedures\nSection 16 Reporting Persons and Designated Individuals, as well as their Family Members and\nControlled Entities, may not engage in any transaction in Company securities without first obtaining pre-\n6\nclearance of the transaction from the Administrator in order to determine compliance with this Policy,\ninsider trading laws, Section 16 of the Exchange Act and Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of\n1933, as amended (“Rule 144”). A person requesting pre-clearance should submit the request to the\nAdministrator (and, in the case of a request by the Chief Executive Officer, also notify the Chairman of the\nAudit Committee) at least two business days in advance of the proposed transaction. The Administrator\nmay determine not to permit the transaction if it is not in compliance this Policy, insider trading laws,\nSection 16 of the Exchange Act or Rule 144. If a person seeks pre-clearance and permission to engage in\nthe transaction is denied, then he or she should refrain from initiating any transaction in Company securities,\nand should not inform any other person of the restriction.\nWhen a request for pre-clearance is made, the requestor should carefully consider whether he or she\nmay be aware of any Inside Information about the Company, and should describe fully those circumstances\nto the Administrator. If the requestor is a Section 16 insider, the requestor should also indicate whether he\nor she has effected any non-exempt “opposite-way” transactions within the past six months, and should be\nprepared to report the proposed transaction on an appropriate Form 4 or Form 5. The requestor should also\nbe prepared to comply with Rule 144 and file Form 144, if necessary, at the time of any sale.\nB. Special Blackout Periods\nFrom time to time, an event may occur that is material to the Company and is known by only a few\ndirectors, officers, consultants, advisors and/or (if applicable) employees. So long as the event remains\nmaterial and nonpublic, the persons with knowledge of the event who are designated by the Administrator\nmay not trade Company securities. In that situation, the Administrator may notify these persons that they\nshould not trade in the Company’s securities, without disclosing the reason for the restriction. The existence\nof an event-specific blackout period or extension of a blackout period may not be announced to the Company\nas a whole, and should not be communicated to any other person. Even if the Administrator has not\ndesignated you as a person who should not trade due to an event-specific restriction, you should not trade\nwhile aware of Inside Information.\nXIV. POST-TERMINATION TRANSACTIONS\nIf an individual is in possession of Inside Information or subject to any blackout period or other\nCompany-imposed trading restrictions when his or her service terminates, that individual may not trade in\nCompany securities until that information has become public, is no longer material or such blackout period\nor Company-imposed trading restriction has expired.\nXV. ADMINISTRATION OF THIS POLICY\nThe Company’s principal executive officer, or in his or her absence the Chairman of the Audit\nCommittee, or with respect to matters involving the Company’s principal financial officer, the Chairman of\nthe Audit Committee (the “Administrator”), shall be responsible for administration of this Policy,\nincluding the matters for which the Administrator is specifically designated herein as administering or\ndeciding and all other matters. All determinations and interpretations by the Administrator shall be subject\nto review by the Audit Committee, whose determinations shall be final.\nXVI. COMPANY ASSISTANCE / REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS\nAny person who has any questions about this Policy or about specific transactions may obtain\nadditional guidance from the Administrator. You should contact the Administrator immediately if you know\nor have reason to believe that this Policy has been or is about to be violated.\n7"
