An American company, Carmell Corporation, has created a new category of bio-aesthetic skincare with its proprietary biotechnology research.\n\n### Featured Experts\n\n  * **Dr. Gilles Spenlehauer,** former Worldwide Head of Advanced Research, Head of Sciences & Skills of the Future at L’Oreal, and board member of Carmell Corporation, is based in Paris \n  * **Dr. Jason Bloom** , double board-certified facial plastic surgeon and adjunct faculty at the University of Pennsylvania, is based in Philadelphia\n  * **Dr. Leif Rogers** , board-certified plastic surgeon and Medical Director of Revive Med Spa, is based in Beverly Hills\n  * **Dr. Leonard Miller,** double board-certified facial plastic surgeon and adjunct faculty at Harvard Medical School, is based in Boston\n  * **Dr. Camille Cash,** double board-certified plastic surgeon and board member of The American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Foundation, is based in Houston\n  * **Dr. Adam Rubinstein,** board-certified plastic surgeon and former Chief of Plastic Surgery and Chief of the Department of Surgery at Jackson North Medical Center, is based in Miami\n\n\n\nBorn in the hallowed halls of prestigious Carnegie Mellon University and developed over seven years at a cost of $60 million, Carmell has developed the most comprehensive cocktail of biologic proteins and lipids ever used in skincare. Using an approach successfully proven in human clinical trials, the Carmell Secretome harnesses ingredients naturally found in the body’s innate regenerative processes to deliver unparalleled skin rejuvenation, setting it apart from other skincare technology in the market.\n\n## **Built by Biology: A Better Alternative to Chemical Skincare?**\n\nOur skin is primarily made of proteins with lipids and water forming the extracellular glue that holds it together. This is why most skincare products utilize proteins. Virtually, all proteins used in skincare are chemically synthesized but Carmell takes a different approach. Instead of relying on chemically synthesized proteins, they use proteins and bio-lipids derived from human donor Platelet enriched Plasma (“PRP”). Produced by bone marrow stem cells, PRP plays a key role in the body’s natural healing response.\n\nSynthetic proteins are rudimentary compared to their naturally occurring counterparts and offer questionable clinical efficacy despite marketing claims. For example, oligopeptide-1 is chemically manufactured using three amino acids and is marketed as equivalent to Human Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). It is unlikely that such a small molecule can fully mimic bioactivity from EGF’s complex structure—if it could, it would be widely used in medical practice, but it is not.\n\nAs Rajiv Shukla, chairman of Carmell explained, “By harnessing the power of biologically native ingredients that are naturally present in our body, we aim to replenish not replace what already works. The Carmell Secretome delivers up to 1,000 proteins, peptides and bio-lipids, more than any skincare product in the market. Our ingredients are “Built by Biology” and native to our bodies, making them more powerful yet more gentle than foreign chemicals.”\n\n## **American Ingenuity: How is the Carmell Secretome Produced?**\n\nThe Carmell Secretome is an extract of growth factors (mostly proteins and peptides) and bio-lipids from activated allogeneic PRP. While PRP has been used to address skin, hair and joint conditions by doctors for over 20 years, it has certain shortcomings that Carmell has overcome with its proprietary research. Unlike traditional PRP, which is drawn from the patient (autologous), Carmell uses pooled allogeneic PRP, eliminating the need for blood draws and making it available off-the-shelf without requiring clinical processing. This method ensures a consistently high concentration of platelets, whereas autologous PRP can vary in effectiveness depending on the patient’s health. Clinical studies have shown that allogeneic PRP is more effective than traditional PRP. Additionally, PRP exerts its beneficial effects only after it undergoes de-granulation. Carmell uses an ex vivo activation process to extract the bio-active factors constituting the Carmell Secretome.\n\nCarmell’s products are proudly developed and made in the USA at its in-house Pittsburgh facility instead of being outsourced overseas. The process begins with PRP sourced from rigorously regulated tissue banks. The raw materials undergo over a dozen tests before bio-activation and extraction, and the final product is subjected to multiple safety and potency tests to ensure its quality.\n\nFormer Worldwide Head of Advanced Research at L’Oreal, Dr. Gilles Spenlehauer explains, “The Carmell Secretome represents the most significant scientific advancement since SkinMedica’s Tissue Nutrient Solution. Nature doesn’t rely on a ‘silver bullet’ to regulate biochemical pathways; it uses hundreds, sometimes thousands, of proteins, peptides and bio-lipids. Carmell’s approach mirrors how human biology works, using a complex cocktail of biologic proteins instead of just one or two synthetic peptides. Importantly, Carmell has conducted extensive protein assays to ensure bioactivity and shelf stability, along with years of safety testing. The scientific rigor and supporting data behind the Carmell Secretome are unmatched in today’s market.”\n\n## **Just as Nature Intended: The Carmell ‘Complete Care’ Philosophy**\n\nCarmell has innovated the field of bio-aesthetics by selecting ingredient cocktails closely matching our natural biology. Carmell has dubbed this approach “just as Nature intended”—it guides the entire product development process. For example, rather than relying on common oils like coconut or rosehip, Carmell uses a blend of three types of ceramides (natural skin lipids) and squalane (derived from squalene, found in human sebum) as emollients. For hydration, it uses high and low molecular weight hyaluronic acid and allantoin (a metabolite of urea) instead of glycerin. These natural ingredients are already found in the skin, making Carmell’s products powerful yet gentle.\n\nPhiladelphia plastic surgeon Jason Bloom, MD likens this approach to “switching from junk fast food to organic whole food”. He explains, “We may be stressing our skin by chronic exposure to chemical skincare which feels good temporarily but accumulates damage over time. Carmell’s “just as Nature intended” philosophy relies on billions of years of evolutionary design that has created proteins uniquely suited to human biology. By using human bio-actives instead of chemicals, Carmell replenishes rather than replaces key components in the skin, supporting natural regenerative pathways for excellent anti-aging results.”\n\nBeverly Hills, CA plastic surgeon Leif Rogers, MD, who conducted fellowship research at Carnegie Mellon, adds that most skincare products target only a single pathway with a “hero” ingredient, which doesn’t align with how biology actually works. “The ‘Complete Care’ approach addresses multiple skin concerns—texture, pigmentation and inflammaging—using a cocktail of complementary ingredients designed to drive a holistic regenerative response, just as Nature intended,” explains Dr. Rogers.\n\n## **The ‘Foul 14’: Redefining Clean Cosmetics**\n\nWhat sets Carmell apart isn’t just what is in their products but also what is excluded. Kendra Bracken-Ferguson, CEO of Carmell, emphasizes, “We are committed to clean cosmetics that have active ingredients just as Nature intended and nothing else. So, we developed an exclusion list of 14 chemical classes, the ‘Foul 14,’ that will never be found in our products. Mass-market skincare uses these 14 excipient types to enhance texture, color and fragrance. We are able to avoid the Foul14 due to our innovative oil-free microemulsion. As a result, our products are free of harsh chemicals, pore-clogging goo, artificial dyes and synthetic fragrances.”\n\nCarmell’s commitment to quality extends to its packaging as well. Instead of using inexpensive dropper bottles or open jars that can lead to contamination, or glass bottles that may shatter, Carmell opts for airless pump bottles, which protect its bio-active formulas from oxidation and light damage.\n\n## **Remarkable Results: The Trifecta of Trouble**\n\nWhile the science of skincare is complex, the results we want are simple. Carmell has dubbed this the “Trifecta of Trouble”—two visible issues, skin texture and skin tone, and one invisible driver of aging, inflammation.\n\nBoston plastic surgeon Leonard Miller, MD conducted a six-week trial using Carmell Secretome. His study showed improvements in skin texture and tone that outperformed 12-week results from major brands. Dr. Miller reported, “We observed significant reductions in brown and red spots, as well as a marked decrease in inflammation, which correlates directly with aging. By targeting the invisible drivers of skin aging, we can slow or even reverse the appearance of aging skin. Prejuvenation is better and less painful than rejuvenation.”\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=MjEyNTo2ODY=-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTAyNCA2ODEiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjY4MSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48L3N2Zz4=)Before / After | Results after 6 weeks of Carmell Secretome | Image courtesy of Carmell Cosmetics \n\n![](data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=MjEyOTo2NjY=-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTAyNCA2ODEiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjY4MSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48L3N2Zz4=)Before / After | Results after 6 weeks of Carmell Secretome | Image courtesy of Carmell Cosmetics \n\nHouston plastic surgeon Camille Cash, MD has also incorporated Carmell products into her practice. “I have seen significant reductions in redness and irritation following microneedling procedures, both traditional and radiofrequency. Patients experienced less downtime and faster recovery. These products are well tolerated across all skin tones and types. I have observed improvements in skin texture, pigmentation and vibrancy when used post-procedure or as part of a daily skincare routine.”\n\nMiami plastic surgeon Adam Rubinstein, MD says he has experienced the benefits in his own skin. “In my own case, I found that it reduced the appearance of a brown spot that had been resistant to both topical treatments as well as laser. When I compared a scan of my face after Carmell treatment with another from 10 years ago, my skin is in better condition despite a decade of exposure to Miami sunshine. Also, I saw improvements in test subjects with both light and dark skin tones as well as great results in patients with breakouts and inflamed skin.”\n\nA new era in bio-aesthetics has begun.\n\n###
