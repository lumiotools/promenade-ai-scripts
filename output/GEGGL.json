Moreover, the Monomoy Build-to-Suit pipeline remains strong, and we continue to broaden our tenant relationships.”\n\n“Additionally, as the Great Elm Credit Income Fund marks its first anniversary, our strong returns and now-established track record position us well to attract capital and further scale the platform. We also increased our stock repurchase capacity up to $20 million from $10 million initially, and utilized the program to repurchase shares at a meaningful discount to book value. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities: growing our core credit and real estate platforms, pursuing compelling investment opportunities and leveraging our strong balance sheet to maximize shareholder value.”\n\n**GEG Managed Vehicle Highlights**\n\n  * GECC reported record total investment income in the quarter and was active in managing its capital structure. \n    * In July, GECC utilized its shelf to issue $22.0 million of 8.50% Notes due 2029 in a registered direct offering to an institutional investor.\n    * GECC issued $41.4 million of 8.125% Notes due 2029, utilizing the proceeds and cash on hand to redeem $45.3 million of notes scheduled to mature in January 2025, leaving no maturities until June 2026.\n    * GECC reported $11.7 million of total investment income, a record and the highest cash income in its history.\n  * Monomoy BTS and Monomoy REIT continued to execute on positive momentum from the prior quarter. \n    * Monomoy BTS completed construction of its first build-to-suit property in October 2024, following the property sale in June 2024, and ended the quarter with a strong pipeline in its Construction Management business.\n    * Monomoy REIT monetized approximately $7.1 million of real estate at a gain and enhanced its lease position.\n  * Great Elm Credit Income Fund (“GECIF”) delivered a strong return on invested capital of over 11%, net of fees, through September 30, 2024, since its inception in November 2023.3 \n\n\n\n**_Discussion of Financial Results for the Fiscal First Quarter Ended September 30, 2024_**\n\nGEG reported total revenue of $4.0 million, up 21% from $3.3 million in the prior-year period.\n\nGEG recorded net income from continuing operations of $3.0 million, compared to $2.8 million in the prior year period.

Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made and represent Great Elm’s assumptions and expectations in light of currently available information. These statements involve risks, variables and uncertainties, and Great Elm’s actual performance results may differ from those projected, and any such differences may be material. For information on certain factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from Great Elm’s expectations, please see Great Elm’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Additional information relating to Great Elm’s financial position and results of operations is also contained in Great Elm’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and available for download at its website [www.greatelmgroup.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GmzTm6_inMraoAdsn5L6IEyojMrxPTy_20Azxd4Spfrvwmq2tLM-pWrpsr4l7jgSbPOeU5HWYBqfFOgIdAxuGOWjJyGgaV7LLcxfifvl4gM=) or at the SEC website [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PGJ_-EWDaEag5jspSZE2ImHsd8jsTup1d2zG-_iqMuYamk4g5Mz2YnWDlgQj1xa_NmREI2rQsFmMcGI87pKRWQ==).\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe SEC has adopted rules to regulate the use in filings with the SEC, and in public disclosures, of financial measures that are not in accordance with US GAAP, such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Adjusted EBITDA is derived from methodologies other than in accordance with US GAAP. Great Elm believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure for investors to use in evaluating Great Elm’s businesses. In addition, Great Elm’s management reviews Adjusted EBITDA as they evaluate acquisition opportunities.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it either in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analyzing Great Elm’s results as reported under US GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures reported by Great Elm may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.\n\nIncluded in the financial tables below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure, net income from continuing operations.\n\n**Endnotes** 1 Pro forma FPAUM incorporates net proceeds from $5.4 million of GECC 8.125% Notes due 2029 issued in October as well as the redemption in October of $45.3 million of GECC 6.75% Notes due January 2025. 2 Cash and marketable securities include approximately $40 thousand of restricted cash. 3 Assumes invested at inception on November 1, 2023, and remained invested throughout the succeeding eleven months, net of fees and expenses. Performance results should not be regarded as final until audited financial statements are issued covering the period shown. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Any such offer or solicitation will only be made pursuant to the applicable offering documents for such investment vehicle.\n\n**Media & Investor Contact:** Investor Relations
