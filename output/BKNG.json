In addition,\nthe Company recorded a reduction of $250 million to income tax expense based upon a recent U.S. Tax Court\ndecision, which has been excluded from Adjusted Net income. For more information regarding these matters, see\nNotes 11 and 13 to the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements to be filed with the Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThe section below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" provides definitions and information about\nthe use of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including Adjusted Net income, Adjusted EPS, and\nAdjusted EBITDA, and the attached financial and statistical supplement reconciles non-GAAP financial results with\nBooking Holdings' financial results under GAAP.\n\"We are pleased to report third quarter room night growth of 8%, which exceeded our prior expectations, driven\nprimarily by stronger performance in Europe,\" said Glenn Fogel, Chief Executive Officer of Booking Holdings.\n\"We continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives while driving cost efficiency in our business, which I\nbelieve will position our company well for the long term.\"\nFourth Quarter Dividend\nOur Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $8.75 per share, payable on December 31, 2024, to stockholders\nof record as of the close of business on December 6, 2024.\n1\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and include all normal and recurring adjustments that\nmanagement of the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position and operating\nresults.\nTo supplement the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company uses the following non-GAAP\nfinancial measures: Adjusted Net income (loss), Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free cash flow (Net cash\nprovided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures). The Company also uses information on (i) the\nimpact of the adjustments required to compute Adjusted Net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA on Sales and\nother expenses, General and administrative expenses, Depreciation and amortization expenses, Interest and dividend\nincome, Other income (expense), net, and Income tax expense, as reported in the Company's consolidated\nstatements of operations, as applicable, and (ii) Adjusted fixed operating expenses, which is Total operating\nexpenses, as reported in the Company's consolidated statements of operations, adjusted to exclude (a) certain\noperating expenses which are generally more likely to vary based on changes in business volumes and (b) amounts\nwhich are excluded in the computation of Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information\nshould not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and\npresented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company uses non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a basis to\nevaluate performance and set targets for employee compensation programs. The Company believes that these non-\nGAAP financial measures are useful for analysts and investors to evaluate the Company's ongoing operating\nperformance because they facilitate comparison of the Company's results for the current period and projected next-\nperiod results to those of prior periods and to those of its competitors (though other companies may calculate similar\nnon-GAAP financial measures differently from those calculated by the Company). These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, in particular Adjusted Net income (loss), Adjusted EBITDA and Free cash flow, are not intended to\nrepresent funds available for Booking Holdings' discretionary use and are not intended to represent or to be used as\na substitute for Operating income (loss), Net income (loss) or Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as\nmeasured under GAAP. The items excluded from these non-GAAP measures, but included in the calculation of\ntheir closest GAAP equivalent, are significant components of the Company's consolidated statements of operations\nand cash flows and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance.\nAdjusted Net income (loss) is Net income (loss) with the following adjustments:\n• excludes accruals related to the Netherlands pension fund matter (recorded during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023),\n• excludes accruals related to the fine imposed by the Spanish competition authority,\n• excludes accruals related to settlements of certain indirect tax matters,\n• excludes the termination fee related to an acquisition agreement,\n• excludes amortization expense of intangible assets,\n• excludes gains and losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair values,\n• excludes the impact, if any, of significant gains and losses on the sale of and impairment and credit losses\non investments in available-for-sale debt securities and significant gains and losses on the sale of and\nimpairment and other valuation adjustments on investments in equity securities without readily\ndeterminable fair values,\n• excludes foreign currency transaction gains and losses on the remeasurement of Euro-denominated debt\nand accrued interest that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and debt-\nrelated foreign currency derivative instruments used as economic hedges,\n• excludes accruals related to the Canadian digital services taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022\nand 2023 enacted in June 2024 with retrospective effect,\n• excludes interest received on tax payments refunded pursuant to settlement with authorities,\n• excludes adjustments to the one-time deemed repatriation income tax liability resulting from the U.S. Tax\nCuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") enacted in December 2017,\n• excludes the impact of net unrecognized tax benefits related to certain income tax matters, and\n2\n• the income tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments mentioned above and changes in tax estimates, as\napplicable.\nIn the event the Company reports a GAAP Net income but an Adjusted Net loss, dilutive shares that are included in\nthe GAAP weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding are excluded from the non-GAAP\nweighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding. In the event the Company reports a GAAP Net\nloss but an Adjusted Net income, anti-dilutive shares that are excluded from the GAAP weighted-average number of\ndiluted common shares outstanding are included in the non-GAAP weighted-average number of diluted common\nshares outstanding.\nIn addition to the adjustments listed above regarding Adjusted Net income (loss), Adjusted EBITDA excludes\ndepreciation expense, interest expense, and to the extent not included in the adjustments listed above, interest and\ndividend income, and income tax expense (benefit).\nWe evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We\ncalculate constant currency based on the predominant transactional currency in each country, converting our\ncurrent-year period results in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the corresponding prior-year period monthly\naverage exchange rates.\nThe attached financial and statistical supplement includes reconciliations of our financial results under GAAP to\nnon-GAAP financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We are not\nable to provide a reconciliation between forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP Net income (loss) because\nwe cannot predict certain components of such reconciliation without unreasonable effort as they arise from events in\nfuture periods.\nInformation About Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, which reflect the views of the Company's management\nregarding current expectations based on currently available information about future events.

Inc.\nNotes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nManagement of Booking Holdings Inc. (the \"Company\") is responsible for the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this document,\nwhich have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") and include all normal and\nrecurring adjustments that management of the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position and operating results. The Company\nprepared the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements following the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim reporting. As\npermitted under those rules, the Company condensed or omitted certain footnotes or other financial information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP for\nannual financial statements. These Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in combination with the Consolidated Financial Statements in the\nCompany's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including acquired businesses\nfrom the dates of acquisition. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The functional currency of the Company's\nsubsidiaries is generally the respective local currency. For international operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange\nexisting at the balance sheet date. Income statement amounts are translated at monthly average exchange rates applicable for the period. Translation gains and\nlosses are included as a component of \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign currency transaction\ngains and losses are included in \"Other income (expense), net\" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRevenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these interim financial statements\nmay not be the same as those for any subsequent quarter or the full year.\nReclassification\nCertain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These include the reclassification of certain\nindirect taxes, primarily digital services taxes, between \"General and administrative\" expenses and \"Sales and other expenses\" in the Unaudited Consolidated\nStatements of Operations. See Notes 2 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\" and \"Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nin the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nImproved guidance to help determine transactions to be accounted for as share-based payment arrangements\nIn March 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update adding illustrative guidance to help entities determine\nwhether profits interest and similar awards should be accounted for as share-based payment arrangements within the scope of the Accounting Standards\nCodification (\"ASC\") 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The update is effective for annual and interim financial statements beginning with the fiscal year\n2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the update on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n10\n2. REVENUES\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nGeographic Information\nThe Company's revenues from its businesses outside of the U.S. consists of the results of Booking.com, Agoda, and Rentalcars.com in their entirety and\nthe results of the KAYAK and OpenTable businesses located outside of the U.S. This classification is independent of where the consumer resides, where the\nconsumer is physically located while using the Company's services, or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant. For example, a reservation made\nthrough Booking.com (which is domiciled in the Netherlands) at a hotel in New York by a consumer in the U.S. is part of the results of the Company's businesses\noutside of the U.S. The Company's geographic information on revenues is as follows (in millions):\nOutside of the U.S.\nU.S. The Netherlands Other Total Company\nTotal revenues for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 $ 662 $ 6,614 $ 718 $ 7,994\n2023 $ 633 $ 6,127 $ 581 $ 7,341\nTotal revenues for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 $ 1,857 $ 14,416 $ 1,995 $ 18,268\n2023 $ 1,771 $ 13,326 $ 1,484 $ 16,581\nRevenues by Type of Service\nApproximately 90% of the Company's revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 89% of the Company's\nrevenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 relate to online accommodation reservation services. Revenues from all other sources of online\ntravel reservation services and advertising and other revenues each individually represent less than 10% of the Company's total revenues for each period.\nConsumer Incentive Programs\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, liabilities of $133 million and $149 million, respectively, were included in \"Accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for incentives granted to consumers, including referral bonuses, rebates, credits, discounts, and loyalty\nprograms.\nDeferred Merchant Bookings\nCash payments received from travelers in advance of the Company completing its performance obligations are included in \"Deferred merchant bookings\"\nin the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are comprised principally of amounts estimated to be payable to travel service providers as well as the\nCompany's estimated future revenue for its commission or margin and fees. The amounts are mostly subject to refunds for cancellations.\n11\n3. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company maintains equity incentive plans that include broad-based grants of restricted stock units, performance share units granted to officers and\ncertain other employees, and stock options granted to certain employees.\nRestricted stock units and performance share units granted by the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 had an aggregate grant-\ndate fair value of $627 million. Restricted stock units and performance share units that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 had an aggregate\nfair value at vesting of $736 million. At September 30, 2024, there was $833 million of estimated total future stock-based compensation expense related to\nunvested restricted stock units and performance share units to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in restricted stock units and performance share units for employees and non-employee directors during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024:\nRestricted Stock Units Performance Share Units\nWeighted-average Grant- Weighted-average Grant-\nShares date Fair Value Shares date Fair Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 (1) 291,404 $2,404 233,026 $2,467\nGranted (2) 141,702 $3,511 35,301 $3,660\nVested (134,476) $2,328 (76,070) $2,452\nPerformance shares adjustment (3) 2,124 $3,899\nForfeited (13,019) $2,782 (5,596) $2,617\nUnvested at September 30, 2024 285,611 $2,972 188,785 $2,709\n(1) Excludes 4,399 performance share units awarded during the year ended December 31, 2022 for which the grant date under ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, was\nnot established as of December 31, 2023. Among other conditions, for the grant date to be established, a mutual understanding is required to be reached between the\nCompany and the employee of the key terms and conditions of the award, including the performance targets. The performance targets for each of the annual performance\nperiods under the award are set at the beginning of the respective year.\n(2) Includes 4,399 performance share units awarded during the year ended December 31, 2022 for which the grant date under ASC 718 was established.\n(3) Probable outcome for performance-based awards is updated based upon changes in actual and forecasted operating results or expected achievement of performance goals, as\napplicable, and the impact of modifications, if any.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in stock options during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nWeighted-average\nAggregate Remaining Contractual\nNumber of Weighted-average Exercise Intrinsic Value Term\nEmployee Stock Options Shares Price (in millions) (in years)\nBalance, December 31, 2023 25,523 $1,411 $ 55 6.4\nExercised (7,906) $1,411 $ 17\nBalance, September 30, 2024 17,617 $1,411 $ 49 5.6\nExercisable at September 30, 2024 17,617 $1,411 $ 49 5.6\n12\n4. NET INCOME PER SHARE\nThe Company computes basic net income per share by dividing net income applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of\ncommon shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted-average number of common and common equivalent\nshares outstanding during the period. Only dilutive common equivalent shares that decrease the net income per share are included in the computation of diluted net\nincome per share.\nCommon equivalent shares related to stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units are calculated using the treasury stock method.\nPerformance share units are included in the weighted-average common equivalent shares based on the number of shares that would be issued if the end of the\nreporting period were the end of the performance period, if the result would be dilutive.\nThe Company's convertible senior notes have net share settlement features requiring the Company, upon conversion, to settle the principal amount of the\ndebt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of the Company's common stock, at the Company's option. If the conversion prices for the convertible\nsenior notes exceed the Company's average stock price for the period, the convertible senior notes generally have no impact on diluted net income per share. The\nCompany uses the if-converted method for the convertible senior notes in the calculation of diluted net income per share.\nA reconciliation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in calculating diluted net income per share is as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nWeighted-average number of basic common shares outstanding 33,401 35,570 33,814 36,615\nWeighted-average dilutive stock options, restricted stock units, and performance\nshare units 215 231 229 211\nAssumed conversion of convertible senior notes 248 186 235 145\nWeighted-average number of diluted common and common equivalent shares\noutstanding 33,864 35,987 34,278 36,971\n13\n5. INVESTMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the Company's investments by major security type at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in millions):\nGross Gross\nUnrealized Gains Unrealized Losses\n/Upward /Downward\nCost Adjustments Adjustments Carrying Value\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLong-term investments:\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values $ 715 $ — $ (360) $ 355\nEquity securities of private entities 111 259 (225) 145\nTotal long-term investments $ 826 $ 259 $ (585) $ 500\nDecember 31, 2023\nShort-term investments:\nDebt securities:\nInternational government securities $ 63 $ — $ — $ 63\nU.S. government securities (1) 152 — (1) 151\nCorporate debt securities 365 — (3) 362\nTotal short-term investments $ 580 $ — $ (4) $ 576\nLong-term investments:\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values $ 715 $ — $ (404) $ 311\nEquity securities of private entities 78 259 (208) 129\nTotal long-term investments $ 793 $ 259 $ (612) $ 440\n(1) Includes investments in U.S. municipal bonds.\nThe Company has classified its investments in debt securities as available-for-sale debt securities. The aggregate unrealized gains and losses on the\navailable-for-sale debt securities, net of tax, are included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values include the Company's investments in DiDi Global Inc. and Grab Holdings Limited, with fair\nvalues of $185 million and $161 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 and $155 million and $143 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. Net\nunrealized gains related to these investments are included in \"Other income (expense), net\" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company sold its entire investment in Meituan for\n$1.7 billion, resulting in a loss of $149 million included in \"Other income (expense), net\" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The cost basis of the Company's investment in Meituan was $450 million.\nThe Company's investments in equity securities of private entities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include $51 million originally invested\nin Yanolja Co., Ltd. (\"Yanolja\"). The Company evaluated its investment in Yanolja for impairment as of June 30, 2023 and recognized an impairment charge of $24\nmillion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (see Note 6). The carrying value of the Company's investment in Yanolja was $98 million at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n14\n6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThere are three levels of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible by the Company at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2: Inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly. Such prices may be based upon quoted prices for identical or comparable securities in\nactive markets or inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available.\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and nonrecurring basis, as\napplicable, are classified in the categories described in the table below (in millions):\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nSeptember 30, 2024\nRecurring fair value measurements\nASSETS:\nCash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents:\nMoney market fund investments $ 14,258 $ — $ — $ 14,258\nCertificates of deposit 95 — — 95\nLong-term investments:\nEquity securities 355 — — 355\nDerivatives:\nForeign currency exchange derivatives — 114 — 114\nTotal assets at fair value $ 14,708 $ 114 $ — $ 14,822\nLIABILITIES:\nForeign currency exchange derivatives $ — $ 65 $ — $ 65\nDecember 31, 2023\nRecurring fair value measurements\nASSETS:\nCash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents:\nMoney market fund investments $ 10,871 $ — $ — $ 10,871\nCertificates of deposit 97 — — 97\nShort-term investments:\nInternational government securities — 63 — 63\nU.S. government securities — 151 — 151\nCorporate debt securities — 362 — 362\nLong-term investments:\nEquity securities 311 — — 311\nDerivatives:\nForeign currency exchange derivatives — 62 — 62\nTotal assets at fair value $ 11,279 $ 638 $ — $ 11,917\nLIABILITIES:\nForeign currency exchange derivatives $ — $ 36 $ — $ 36\nNonrecurring fair value measurements\nInvestment in equity securities of a private entity (1) $ — $ — $ 98 $ 98\n(1) During the year ended December 31, 2023, the investment in Yanolja was written down to its estimated fair value.\n15\nInvestments\nSee Note 5 for additional information related to the Company's investments.\nThe Company's investments in debt securities are measured using \"Level 2\" inputs as the Company has access to quoted prices for identical or\ncomparable securities, but does not have visibility into the volume and frequency of trading for these investments. A market approach is used for recurring fair\nvalue measurements and the valuation techniques use inputs that are observable, or can be corroborated by observable data, in an active marketplace.\nThe Company's investments measured using Level 3 inputs primarily consist of investments in privately-held entities. Fair values of these securities are\nestimated using a variety of valuation methodologies, including both the market and income approaches.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company evaluated its investment in Yanolja for impairment using a combination of the market approach and the income\napproach in estimating the fair value of the investment and recognized an impairment charge (see Note 5). The market approach estimates value using prices and\nother relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable companies. The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of\nfuture cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on a company's\nweighted-average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in its cash flows. The key unobservable inputs and ranges used for the June 2023 impairment\nevaluation, primarily using the income approach, includes the weighted average cost of capital (10.5%-14.5%) and the terminal EBITDA multiple (14x-16x).\nSignificant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in significantly different fair value measurements. A change in the assumption used for EBITDA\nmultiples would result in a directionally similar change in the fair value, and a change in the assumption used for weighted average cost of capital would result in a\ndirectionally opposite change in the fair value.\nThe determination of the fair values of investments, where the Company is a minority shareholder and has access to limited information from the investee,\nreflects numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including key assumptions regarding the investee's expected growth rates and\noperating margin, as well as other key assumptions with respect to matters outside of the Company's control, such as discount rates and market comparables. It\nrequires significant judgments and estimates and actual results could be materially different than those judgments and estimates utilized in the fair value\nmeasurement. Future events and changing market conditions may lead the Company to re-evaluate the assumptions reflected in the valuation which may result in a\nneed to recognize additional impairment charges.\nDerivatives\nThe Company reports the fair values of its derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in \"Other current assets\"\nand \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities,\" respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not designate any\nderivatives as hedges for accounting purposes.\nFor the Company's foreign currency exchange derivatives outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the notional amounts of the\nforeign currency purchases were $8.5 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of the foreign currency sales were $4.3 billion and $4.2\nbillion, respectively. The notional amount of a foreign currency exchange derivative contract is the contracted amount of foreign currency to be exchanged and is\nnot recorded in the balance sheets.\nThe effect of foreign currency exchange derivatives recorded in \"Other income (expense), net\" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations\nfor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nGains (losses) on foreign currency exchange derivatives $ 130 $ (56) $ (32) $ (140)\n16\nOther Financial Assets and Liabilities\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's cash consisted of bank deposits. Cash equivalents principally include money market fund\ninvestments and certificates of deposit and their carrying value generally approximates the fair value as they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\nOther financial assets and liabilities, including restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred merchant bookings, are carried at cost which\napproximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these items. Accounts receivable and other financial assets measured at amortized cost are carried\nat cost less an allowance for expected credit losses to present the net amount expected to be collected (see Note 7). See Note 9 for the estimated fair value of the\nCompany's outstanding senior notes, including the estimated fair value of the Company's convertible senior notes.\n7. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS\nAccounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 includes receivables from customers of $2.3\nbillion and $1.9 billion, respectively, and receivables from payment processors and networks of $1.3 billion. The remaining balance principally relates to\nreceivables from marketing affiliates. The amounts mentioned above are stated on a gross basis, before deducting the allowance for expected credit losses.\nSignificant judgments and assumptions are required to estimate the allowance for expected credit losses and such assumptions may change in future\nperiods, particularly the assumptions related to the business prospects and financial condition of customers and marketing affiliates, including macroeconomic\nconditions, inflationary pressures, potential recession, and the Company's ability to collect the receivable or recover prepayments.\nThe following table summarizes the activity of the allowance for expected credit losses on receivables (in millions):\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2024 2023\nBalance, beginning of year $ 137 $ 117\nProvision charged to earnings 152 103\nWrite-offs and other adjustments (158) (104)\nBalance, end of period $ 131 $ 116\n8. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL\nThe Company's intangible assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consist of the following (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nGross Gross\nCarrying Accumulated Net Carrying Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying\nAmount Amortization Amount Amount Amortization Amount Amortization Period\nTrade names $ 1,816 $ (985) $ 831 $ 1,812 $ (911) $ 901 3 - 20 years\nSupply and distribution\nagreements 1,410 (832) 578 1,402 (759) 643 3 - 20 years\nOther intangible assets 331 (290) 41 330 (261) 69 Up to 20 years\nTotal intangible assets $ 3,557 $ (2,107) $ 1,450 $ 3,544 $ (1,931) $ 1,613\nIntangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis. Amortization expense for the intangible assets was $55 million for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023 and $166 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nThe carrying value of the Company's goodwill at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $2.8 billion and is stated net of cumulative impairment\ncharges of $2.0 billion. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of September 30 and between annual tests if an\nevent occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. As of September 30,\n2024, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill.\n17\n9. DEBT\nRevolving Credit Facility\nSee Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for\ninformation related to the Company's unsecured revolving credit facility that extends a revolving line of credit of up to $2 billion to the Company. In May 2024,\nthe Company extended the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from May 2028 to May 2029 pursuant to an extension request under the credit agreement.\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding and $26 million and $18 million, respectively, of letters of credit issued\nunder the revolving credit facility.\nOutstanding Debt\nOutstanding debt at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 consists of the following (in millions):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nOutstanding Outstanding\nPrincipal Carrying Principal Carrying\nAmount Value (1) Amount Value (1)\n2.375% (€1 Billion) Senior Notes due September 2024 (2) $ — $ — $ 1,105 $ 1,104\n3.65% Senior Notes due March 2025 (3) 500 500 500 499\n0.1% (€950 Million) Senior Notes due March 2025 (3) 1,060 1,059 1,050 1,048\n0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due May 2025 (2) (3) 862 860 862 857\n3.6% Senior Notes due June 2026 1,000 999 1,000 998\n4.0% (€750 Million) Senior Notes due November 2026 837 835 828 825\n1.8% (€1 Billion) Senior Notes due March 2027 1,116 1,115 1,105 1,103\n3.55% Senior Notes due March 2028 500 499 500 499\n0.5% (€750 Million) Senior Notes due March 2028 837 835 828 825\n3.625% (€500 Million) Senior Notes due November 2028 558 556 552 549\n3.5% (€500 Million) Senior Notes due March 2029 558 556 — —\n4.25% (€750 Million) Senior Notes due May 2029 837 832 828 823\n4.625% Senior Notes due April 2030 1,500 1,493 1,500 1,492\n4.5% (€1 Billion) Senior Notes due November 2031 1,116 1,109 1,105 1,098\n3.625% (€650 Million) Senior Notes due March 2032 725 720 — —\n4.125% (€1.25 Billion) Senior Notes due May 2033 1,396 1,381 1,381 1,367\n4.75% (€1 Billion) Senior Notes due November 2034 1,116 1,108 1,105 1,097\n3.75% (€850 Million) Senior Notes due March 2036 949 934 — —\n4.0% (€750 Million) Senior Notes due March 2044 837 821 — —\nTotal outstanding debt $ 16,304 $ 16,212 $ 14,249 $ 14,184\nShort-term debt $ 2,422 $ 2,419 $ 1,967 $ 1,961\nLong-term debt $ 13,882 $ 13,793 $ 12,282 $ 12,223\n(1) The carrying values differ from the outstanding principal amounts due to unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of $92 million and $65 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n(2) Included in \"Short-term debt\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023.\n(3) Included in \"Short-term debt\" in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024.\n18\nFair Value of Debt\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of outstanding debt was approximately $17.8 billion and $15.2 billion,\nrespectively, and was considered a \"Level 2\" fair value measurement (see Note 6). Fair value was estimated based upon actual trades at the end of the reporting\nperiod or the most recent trade available as well as the Company's stock price at the end of the reporting period. The estimated fair value of the Company's debt in\nexcess of the outstanding principal amount at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 primarily relates to the conversion premium on the convertible senior\nnotes due in May 2025.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn April 2020, the Company issued $863 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in May 2025 with an interest rate of 0.75%\n(the \"May 2025 Notes\"). The May 2025 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into the Company's common stock at a current conversion price of\n$1,873 per share. The May 2025 Notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, prior to November 1, 2024, upon the occurrence of specific events, including but\nnot limited to a change in control, or if the closing sales price of the Company's common stock for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive trading\ndays ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the conversion price in effect for the notes on the last\ntrading day of the immediately preceding quarter. In the event that all or substantially all of the Company's common stock is acquired on or prior to the maturity of\nthe May 2025 Notes in a transaction in which the consideration paid to holders of the Company's common stock consists of all or substantially all cash, the\nCompany would be required to make additional payments in the form of additional shares of common stock to the holders of the May 2025 Notes in an aggregate\nvalue ranging from $0 to $235 million depending upon the date of the transaction and the then current stock price of the Company. Starting on November 1, 2024,\nholders will have the right to convert all or any portion of the May 2025 Notes, regardless of the Company's stock price. The May 2025 Notes may not be\nredeemed by the Company prior to maturity. The holders may require the Company to repurchase the May 2025 Notes for cash in certain circumstances. Interest\non the May 2025 Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year. If the note holders exercise their option to convert, the Company delivers cash to repay\nthe principal amount of the notes and delivers shares of common stock or cash, at its option, to satisfy the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. At\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of the May 2025 Notes was $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, and was considered a\n\"Level 2\" fair value measurement (see Note 6). Based on the closing sales prices of the Company's common stock for the prescribed measurement periods, the\nMay 2025 Notes were convertible at the option of the holder starting the second calendar quarter of 2023 and continue to be convertible during the fourth calendar\nquarter of 2024.\nOther Senior Notes\nThe following table summarizes the information related to other senior notes issued in March 2024:\nEffective Interest Rate\nOther Senior Notes (1) Timing of Interest Payments\n3.5% Senior Notes due March 2029 3.61% Annually in March\n3.625% Senior Notes due March 2032 3.71% Annually in March\n3.75% Senior Notes due March 2036 3.92% Annually in March\n4.0% Senior Notes due March 2044 4.15% Annually in March\n(1) Represents the coupon interest rate adjusted for deferred debt issuance costs and premiums or discounts existing at the origination of the debt.\nThe proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes are available for general corporate purposes, including to repurchase shares of the Company's\ncommon stock and to redeem or repay outstanding indebtedness.\nIn September 2024, the Company paid $1.1 billion on the maturity of the Senior Notes due September 2024. In March 2023, the Company paid\n$500 million on the maturity of the Senior Notes due March 2023. In addition, the Company paid the applicable accrued and unpaid interest relating to each of\nthese senior notes.\n19\nInterest expense related to other senior notes consists primarily of coupon interest expense of $137 million and $391 million for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $109 million and $301 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company designates certain portions of the aggregate principal value of the Euro-denominated debt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of\nthe net investment in certain Euro functional currency subsidiaries. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of the portion of\nEuro-denominated debt, designated as a net investment hedge, ranged from $2.3 billion to $5.3 billion and from $5.9 billion to $8.4 billion, respectively.\n10. TREASURY STOCK AND DIVIDENDS\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had a total remaining authorization of $13.7 billion related to a program authorized by the Company's Board of\nDirectors (\"the Board\") in 2023 to repurchase up to $20 billion of the Company's common stock. At September 30, 2024, the Company had a total remaining\nauthorization of $8.8 billion to repurchase its common stock. The Company expects to complete the share repurchases under the remaining authorization by the\nend of 2026, assuming no major downturn in the travel market. Additionally, the Board has given the Company the general authorization to repurchase shares of its\ncommon stock withheld to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations related to stock-based compensation.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's stock repurchase activities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in\nmillions, except for shares, which are reflected in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nShares Amount Shares Amount Shares Amount Shares Amount\nAuthorized stock repurchase programs 464 $ 1,767 867 $ 2,616 1,345 $ 4,978 2,856 $ 7,776\nGeneral authorization for shares withheld on\nstock award vesting 2 9 3 9 94 330 70 185\nTotal 466 $ 1,776 870 $ 2,625 1,439 $ 5,308 2,926 $ 7,961\nStock repurchases of $20 million in September 2024 were settled in October 2024.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company remitted employee withholding taxes of $329 million and $185 million,\nrespectively, to the tax authorities, which may differ from the aggregate cost of the shares withheld for taxes for each period due to the timing in remitting the\ntaxes. The cash remitted to the tax authorities is included in financing activities in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe Company recorded an estimated excise tax liability for share repurchases of $141 million and $96 million as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. The excise tax liability is included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid cash dividends of $885 million. In October 2024, the Board declared a cash\ndividend of $8.75 per share of common stock, payable on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 6, 2024.\n20\n11. INCOME TAXES\nIncome tax expense consists of U.S. and international income taxes, determined using an estimate of the Company's annual effective tax rate, which is\nbased upon the applicable tax rates and tax laws of the countries in which the income is generated. A deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary\ndifferences, and a deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is\nprovided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company considers many factors when assessing\nthe likelihood of future realization of the deferred tax assets, including its recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future\nincome, tax planning strategies, the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\nThe Company's effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 12.3% and 16.0%, respectively, compared to 20.3% and\n19.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company's 2024 effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate\nof 21%, primarily due to the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax (discussed below) and a reduction to the Company's 2018 federal one-time deemed\nrepatriation liability, pursuant to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\"), resulting from a recent U.S. Tax Court decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v.\nCommissioner, partially offset by higher international tax rates, unrecognized tax benefits and U.S. federal and state tax associated with the Company's\ninternational earnings. The Company's 2023 effective tax rates differed from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the benefit of the\nNetherlands Innovation Box Tax, partially offset by higher international tax rates and certain non-deductible expenses.\nThe Company's effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were lower than the effective tax rates for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a reduction to the Company's 2018 federal one-time deemed repatriation liability, pursuant to the Tax Act,\nresulting from a recent U.S. Tax Court decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Commissioner, partially offset by higher unrecognized tax benefits and higher\nU.S. federal and state tax associated with the Company's international earnings. The Company recorded a net tax expense reduction of $250 million during the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to its 2018 federal one-time deemed repatriation liability.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, a majority of the Company's income was reported in the Netherlands, where\nBooking.com is based. According to Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying innovative activities is taxed at a rate of 9% (\"Innovation\nBox Tax\") rather than the Dutch statutory rate of 25.8%. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 qualified for Innovation Box Tax treatment, which had a beneficial impact on the Company's effective tax rates for these periods.\nThe aggregate amount of unrecognized tax benefits for all matters at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $262 million and $67 million,\nrespectively. As of September 30, 2024, net unrecognized tax benefits of $237 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. As of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, total gross interest and penalties accrued was $7 million. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits primarily relates to certain 2018 U.S.\nfederal taxes that are impacted by the recent U.S. Tax Court decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Commissioner. The majority of unrecognized tax benefits\nare included in \"Other assets, net\" in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross\nunrecognized tax benefits could change over the next 12 months.\n21\n12. CHANGES IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS BY COMPONENT\nThe table below presents the changes in the balances of accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCI\") by component for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\nNet unrealized gains (losses) on available-\nForeign currency translation adjustments for-sale securities\nForeign currency translation Net investment hedges (1)\nTotal, net of Total, net of Total AOCI,\nBefore tax Tax (2) Before tax Tax tax Before tax Tax tax net of tax\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nBalance, June 30, 2024 $ (644) $ 124 $ 266 $ (70) $ (324) $ — $ — $ — $ (324)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) (\"OCI\") for the\nperiod 226 (67) (180) 42 21 — — — 21\nBalance, September 30, 2024 $ (418) $ 57 $ 86 $ (28) $ (303) $ — $ — $ — $ (303)\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ (537) $ 94 $ 171 $ (48) $ (320) $ (4) $ 1 $ (3) $ (323)\nOCI for the period 119 (37) (85) 20 17 4 (1) 3 20\nBalance, September 30, 2024 $ (418) $ 57 $ 86 $ (28) $ (303) $ — $ — $ — $ (303)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nBalance, June 30, 2023 $ (476) $ 76 $ 163 $ (46) $ (283) $ (11) $ 3 $ (8) $ (291)\nOCI for the period (240) 46 259 (61) 4 3 (1) 2 6\nBalance, September 30, 2023 $ (716) $ 122 $ 422 $ (107) $ (279) $ (8) $ 2 $ (6) $ (285)\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nBalance, December 31, 2022 $ (579) $ 93 $ 310 $ (81) $ (257) $ (13) $ 3 $ (10) $ (267)\nOCI for the period (137) 29 112 (26) (22) 5 (1) 4 (18)\nBalance, September 30, 2023 $ (716) $ 122 $ 422 $ (107) $ (279) $ (8) $ 2 $ (6) $ (285)\n(1) Net investment hedges balance at September 30, 2024 and earlier dates presented above, includes accumulated net losses from fair value adjustments of $35 million ($53\nmillion before tax) associated with previously settled derivatives that were designated as net investment hedges. The remaining balances relate to foreign currency transaction\ngains (losses) and related tax benefits (expenses) associated with the Company's Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the\nnet investment in certain Euro functional currency subsidiaries (see Note 9).\n(2) The tax benefits relate to foreign currency translation adjustments to the Company's one-time deemed repatriation tax liability recorded at December 31, 2017 and foreign\nearnings for periods after December 31, 2017 that are subject to U.S. federal and state income tax, resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act.\n22\n13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCompetition and Consumer Protection Reviews\nOnline travel platforms have been the subject of investigations or inquiries by national competition authorities (\"NCAs\") or other governmental\nauthorities regarding competition law matters, consumer protection issues, or other areas of concern. The Company is and has been involved in many such\ninvestigations. For example, the Company is involved in investigations related to whether Booking.com's contractual parity arrangements with accommodation\nproviders are anti-competitive because they require partners to provide Booking.com with rates, conditions, and availability at least as favorable as those offered to\nother online travel companies (\"OTCs\") or by the partner itself. To resolve certain of the parity-related investigations, the Company has from time to time made\ncommitments regarding future business practices or activities, such as agreeing to narrow the scope of its parity clauses. These investigations have resulted in fines\nand the Company could incur additional fines and/or be restricted in certain of its business practices in the future.\nIn October 2022, the Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia in Spain (the \"CNMC\") opened an investigation into whether certain practices\nby Booking.com may produce adverse effects for hotels and other OTCs. In January 2024, the CNMC notified Booking.com of its draft decision to impose a fine\nof 486 million Euros and to restrict certain business practices such as those relating to parity provisions and the ranking criteria that Booking.com can use to\ndetermine how to rank hotels in its display to customers. In July 2024, the CNMC notified Booking.com of its decision to impose a fine of 413 million Euros,\nwhich reflects a decrease of approximately 72 million Euros from the draft decision. The business restrictions were not materially changed from the draft decision.\nBooking.com does not agree with the rationale stated in the decision and certain of the restrictions imposed, and has filed an appeal. Although the Company\ndisagrees with the rationale stated in the decision, the Company accrued a loss of 486 million Euros ($530 million) during the year ended December 31, 2023. As\nof June 30, 2024, to align with the CNMC's reduced fine, the Company recorded a decrease of 72 million Euros ($78 million) in its accrual, which is reflected in\n\"General and administrative\" expenses in the Unaudited Consolidated Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The related liability\nis included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nIn addition, in September 2017, the Swiss Price Surveillance Office opened an investigation into the level of commissions of Booking.com in Switzerland\nand the investigation is ongoing. If there is an adverse outcome and Booking.com is unsuccessful in any appeal, Booking.com may be required to make other\ncommitments, such as reducing its commissions in Switzerland. In July 2023, the Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection opened an investigation\ninto Booking.com's identification of private and professional hosts and its messaging in relation to obligations owed to consumers. In March 2024, the Italian\nCompetition Authority opened an investigation into whether certain practices by Booking.com may produce adverse effects for hotels and other online travel\nagencies. If any of the investigations were to find that Booking.com practices violated the respective laws, or as part of a negotiated resolution, Booking.com may\nface significant fines, restrictions on its business practices, and/or be required to make other commitments.\nThe Company is and has been involved in investigations or inquiries by NCAs or other governmental authorities involving consumer protection matters,\nincluding in the United Kingdom and the European Union. The Company has previously made certain voluntary commitments to competition authorities to resolve\ninvestigations or inquiries that have included showing prices inclusive of all mandatory taxes and charges, providing information about the effect of money earned\non search result rankings on or before the search results page, and making certain adjustments to how discounts and statements concerning popularity or\navailability are shown to consumers. In the future, it is possible new jurisdictions could engage the Company in discussions to implement changes to its business in\nthose countries. The Company is unable to predict what, if any, effect any future similar commitments will have on its business, industry practices, or online\ncommerce more generally. To the extent that any other investigations or inquiries result in additional commitments, fines, damages, or other remedies, the\nCompany's business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe Company is unable to predict how any current or future investigations or litigation may be resolved or the long-term impact of any such resolution on\nits business. For example, competition and consumer-law-related investigations, legislation, or issues could result in private litigation and the Company is currently\ninvolved in such litigation. More immediate results could include, among other things, the imposition of fines, payment of damages, commitments to change\ncertain business practices, or reputational damage, any of which could harm the Company's business, results of operations, brands, or competitive position.\n23\nTax Matters\nBetween December 2018 and August 2021, the Italian tax authorities issued assessments on Booking.com's Italian subsidiary totaling approximately\n251 million Euros ($280 million) for the tax years 2013 through 2018, asserting that its transfer pricing policies were inadequate. The Company believes\nBooking.com has been and continues to be in compliance with Italian tax law. In September 2020, the Italian tax authorities approved the opening of a mutual\nagreement procedure (\"MAP\") between Italy and the Netherlands for the 2013 tax year and the Italian tax authorities subsequently approved the inclusion of the\ntax years 2014 through 2018 in the MAP. Based on the Company's expectation that the Italian assessments for 2013 through 2018, and any transfer pricing\nassessments received for subsequent open years, will be settled through the MAP process, and after considering potential resolution amounts, 33 million Euros\n($37 million) have been reflected in net unrecognized tax benefits, the majority of which is recorded to \"Other assets, net\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. This unrecognized tax benefit is partially offset by a deferred income tax benefit of 15 million Euros ($17 million).\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company made prepayments of 74 million Euros ($83 million) to the Italian tax authorities to forestall collection enforcement\npending the appeal phase of the case. The payments do not constitute an admission that the Company owes the taxes and will be refunded (with interest) to the\nCompany to the extent that the Company prevails. The payments are included in \"Other assets, net\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\nIn June 2024, the Guardia di Finanza (\"GdF\") of Rome issued a tax audit report to Booking.com, proposing a tax assessment to the Italian Tax Authorities\n(\"ITA\") of 396 million Euros ($442 million), excluding penalties and interest, for June 2017 through December 2023. The GdF alleged that a 2017 law (the \"STR\nLaw\") obliged Booking.com to withhold and remit 21% of the total transaction value for the income tax liabilities of certain short-term rental partners in Italy for\nthe period under audit. While the Company believes that Booking.com has been and continues to be in compliance with Italian tax laws, the Company expects to\nenter into a settlement agreement with the ITA in November 2024 to resolve the matter.\nIn light of the proposed settlement, without admitting liability, the Company accrued an additional amount of 329 million Euros ($365 million) for this\nmatter, which is reflected in \"General and administrative\" expenses in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024. The related liability is included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. The final amount owed in respect of 2023 could be reduced after the assessment of taxes paid by impacted partners through their individual\nincome tax returns for this period.\nThe Company is also involved in other tax-related audits, investigations, and litigation relating to income taxes, value-added taxes, travel transaction taxes\n(e.g., hotel occupancy taxes), withholding taxes, and other taxes.\nAny taxes or assessments in excess of the Company's tax provisions, including the resolution of any tax proceedings or litigation, could have a material\nadverse impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In some cases, assessments may be significantly in excess of the\nCompany's tax provisions, particularly in instances where the Company does not agree with the tax authority's assessment of how the tax laws may apply to the\nCompany's business.\n24\nOther Matters\nBeginning in 2014, Booking.com B.V. received several letters from the Netherlands Pension Fund for the Travel Industry (Reiswerk) (\"BPF\") claiming\nthat it was required to participate in the mandatory pension scheme of the BPF with retroactive effect to 1999, which has a higher contribution rate than the pension\nscheme in which it is currently participating. BPF instituted legal proceedings and in 2016 the District Court of Amsterdam rejected all of BPF's claims. BPF\nappealed the decision to the Court of Appeal, and, in May 2019, the Court of Appeal also rejected all of BPF's claims, in each case by ruling that Booking did not\nmeet the definition of a travel intermediary for purposes of the mandatory pension scheme. BPF then appealed to the Netherlands Supreme Court. In April 2021,\nthe Supreme Court overturned the previous decision of the Court of Appeal and held that Booking.com B.V. met the definition of a travel intermediary for the\npurposes of the mandatory pension scheme. The Supreme Court ruled only on the qualification of Booking.com B.V. as a travel intermediary for the purposes of\nthe mandatory pension scheme and did not rule on the various other defenses brought forward by the Company against BPF's claims. The Supreme Court referred\nthe matter to another Court of Appeal to assess the other defenses brought forward by the Company. In January 2024, that Court of Appeal ruled that Booking.com\nB.V. is required to participate in the mandatory pension scheme of the BPF with retroactive effect to 1999. The Company has filed an appeal of the decision to the\nNetherlands Supreme Court. Although the Company disagrees with the decision, it accrued a loss of 253 million Euros ($276 million), included in \"Personnel\"\nexpenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the\nCompany recorded additional estimated expenses of 13 million Euros ($14 million) and 50 million Euros ($55 million), respectively, included in \"Personnel\"\nexpenses in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations. The related liability is included primarily in \"Accounts payable\" in the Unaudited Consolidated\nBalance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 and \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023. On a go-\nforward basis, Booking.com B.V. expects to begin paying pension premiums to the BPF scheme or to increase contributions to employees under its existing\npension scheme.\nFrom time to time, the Company notifies the competent data protection authority, such as the Dutch data protection authority in accordance with its\nobligations under the General Data Protection Regulation, of certain incidental and accidental personal data security incidents. Should, for example, the Dutch data\nprotection authority decide these incidents were the result of inadequate technical and organizational security measures or practices, it could decide to impose a\nfine.\nThe Company has been, is currently, and expects to continue to be, subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including\nclaims of alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Such claims, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant\nfinancial and managerial resources, divert management's attention from the Company's business objectives and adversely affect the Company's business,\nreputation, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nThe Company accrues for certain other legal contingencies where it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nSuch accrued amounts are not material to the Company's balance sheets and provisions recorded have not been material to the Company's results of operations or\ncash flows.\nOther Contractual Obligations and Contingencies\nThe Company had $652 million and $533 million of standby letters of credit and bank guarantees issued on behalf of the Company as of September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, including those issued under the revolving credit facility. These were obtained primarily for regulatory purposes. See\nNote 9 for information related to letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility.\nBooking.com offers partner liability insurance that provides protection to certain accommodation partners (\"home partners\") in instances where a\nreservation has been made via Booking.com. The partner liability insurance may provide those home partners (both owners and property managers) coverage up to\n$1 million equivalent per occurrence, subject to limitations and exclusions, against third-party lawsuits, claims for bodily injury, or third-party personal property\ndamage that occurred during a stay booked through Booking.com. Booking.com retains certain financial risks related to this insurance offering, which is\nunderwritten by third-party insurance companies.\n25\n14. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\nThe components of other income (expense), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nForeign currency transaction losses (1) $ (365) $ (1) $ (204) $ (102)\nNet gains (losses) on equity securities (2) 32 16 27 (151)\nOther 1 (4) 4 3\nOther income (expense), net $ (332) $ 11 $ (173) $ (250)\n(1) Foreign currency transaction losses include losses of $343 million and $108 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and gains of $36\nmillion and $2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, related to Euro-denominated debt and accrued interest that were not designated\nas net investment hedges (see Note 9).\n(2) See Note 5 for additional information related to net gains (losses) on equity securities.\n15. OTHER\nUnaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Additional Information\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets differ from the amounts of total\ncash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents as shown in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows due to restricted cash and\ncash equivalents, primarily related to the Company's travel-related insurance business, which are included in \"Other current assets\" in the Consolidated Balance\nSheets.\nNoncash investing activity related to additions to property and equipment, including stock-based compensation and accrued liabilities, was $42 million\nand $39 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 10 for additional information on noncash financing activity\nrelated to the excise tax on share repurchases.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company made income tax payments of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, and\ninterest payments of $615 million and $557 million, respectively.\nTerminated Acquisition\nIn November 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire global flight booking provider Etraveli Group. The completion of the acquisition\nwas subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. In September 2023, the European Commission announced its decision to prohibit the\nacquisition and consequently a termination fee of 85 million Euros ($90 million) was paid by the Company in October 2023 and recorded in \"General and\nadministrative\" expenses in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n26\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including Part\nI, Item 1A \"Risk Factors,\" as well as our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes and the Section entitled \"Special Note\nRegarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The information on our websites is not a part of this Quarterly Report and is\nnot incorporated herein by reference.\nWe evaluate certain operating and financial measures on both an as-reported and constant-currency basis. We calculate constant currency based on\nthe predominant transactional currency in each country, converting our current-year period results in currencies other than U.S. Dollars using the\ncorresponding prior-year period monthly average exchange rates.\nOverview\nOur mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We aim to provide consumers with a best-in-class experience offering the travel\nchoices they want, with tailored language, payment, and other options, seamlessly connecting them with our travel service provider partners. We offer these\nservices through five primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, KAYAK, and OpenTable.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from enabling consumers to make travel service reservations. We also earn revenues from advertising services,\nrestaurant reservations and restaurant management services, travel-related insurance services, and other services. See Note 2 to our Unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for more information.\nTrends\nIn the first quarter of 2024, global room nights increased 9% year-over-year driven primarily by healthy travel demand in Europe and Asia. In the second\nquarter of 2024, global room nights increased 7% year-over-year, sequentially slower than the first quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower year-over-year growth in\nEurope. In the third quarter of 2024, global room nights increased 8%, sequentially faster than the second quarter of 2024 primarily due to higher year-over-year\ngrowth in Europe.\n27\nQuarterly Room Nights and Change versus the prior year\nThe cancellation rate in the third quarter of 2024 was slightly lower than the cancellation rate in the third quarter of 2023. Because we recognize revenues\nfrom bookings when the traveler checks in, our reported revenues are not at risk of being reversed due to cancellations. Increases in cancellation rates can\nnegatively impact our marketing efficiency as a result of incurring performance marketing expenses at the time a booking is made even though that booking could\nbe canceled in the future if it was booked under a flexible cancellation policy.\nOur global average daily rates (\"ADRs\") decreased by less than 1% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the third\nquarter of 2023, driven primarily by a lower mix of room nights in North America, which is a higher ADR region, and a higher mix of room nights from Asia,\nwhich is a lower ADR region. Excluding the changes in regional mix, our global ADRs on a constant currency basis increased year-over-year by less than 1%. The\nyear-over-year decrease in our global ADRs has resulted in our accommodation gross bookings growing slower than our room nights in the third quarter of 2024. It\nis difficult to predict what the trend in industry ADRs will be in the future.\nWe focus on relentless innovation to grow our business by providing a best-in-class user experience with intuitive, easy-to-use online platforms that aim\nto exceed the expectations of consumers. We have a long-term strategy to create an ideal traveler experience, offering our customers relevant options and\nconnections at the times and in the language they want them, making trips booked with us seamless, easy, and valuable. We refer to this as the \"Connected Trip.\"\nThe goal of our Connected Trip vision is to offer a differentiated and personalized online travel planning, booking, payment, and in-trip experience for each trip,\nenhanced by a robust loyalty program that provides value to travelers and partners across all trips. We believe these efforts will help improve traveler loyalty,\nfrequency, and mix of direct bookings over time. We believe these improvements will benefit revenue growth and marketing efficiency in the future, however, to\nthe extent our non-accommodation services have lower margins and increase as a percentage of our total business, our operating margins may be negatively\naffected.\n28\nWe believe that our mobile app is an important platform for experiencing the Connected Trip since the app travels with the traveler. The mix of our room\nnights booked on a mobile app in the third quarter of 2024 was a mid-fifties percentage, up from a low-fifties percentage in the third quarter of 2023. The\nsignificant majority of room nights booked on our mobile apps are direct, and we continue to see favorable repeat direct booking behavior from consumers in our\nmobile apps, which allow us more opportunities to engage directly with consumers. The revenues earned on a transaction on a mobile app may be less than a\ntypical desktop transaction as we see different consumer purchasing patterns across devices. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile app\ntypically are for shorter lengths of stay and have lower accommodation ADRs.\nAs part of our strategy to provide more payment options to consumers and travel service providers, increase the number and variety of our\naccommodations, and enable our long-term Connected Trip strategy, Booking.com increasingly processes transactions on a merchant basis, where it facilitates\npayments from travelers for the services provided. This allows Booking.com to process transactions for travel service providers and to increase its ability to offer\nsecure and flexible transaction terms to consumers, such as the form and timing of payment. We believe that expanding these types of service offerings will benefit\nconsumers and travel service providers, as well as our gross bookings, room night, and earnings growth rates. However, this results in additional expenses for\npersonnel, payment processing, chargebacks (including those related to fraud), and other expenses related to these transactions, which are recorded in \"Personnel\"\nexpenses and \"Sales and other expenses\" in our Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as associated incremental revenues (e.g., payment card\nrebates), which are recorded in \"Merchant revenues.\" To the extent more of our business is generated on a merchant basis, we incur a greater level of these\nmerchant-related expenses, which negatively impacts our operating margins despite increases in associated incremental revenues. The mix of our total gross\nbookings generated on a merchant basis was 65% in the third quarter of 2024, an increase from 56% in the third quarter of 2023.\nWe have established widely-used and recognized brands through marketing and promotional campaigns. Our total marketing expenses, which are\ncomprised of performance and brand marketing expenses that are substantially variable in nature, were $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2024, up 6% versus the\nthird quarter of 2023 as a result of the year-over-year growth in travel demand in the quarter and our efforts to invest in marketing. Our performance marketing\nexpenses, which represent a substantial majority of our marketing expenses, are primarily related to the use of online search engines (primarily Google), affiliate\nmarketing, meta-search, and social media channels to generate traffic to our platforms. Our brand marketing expenses are primarily related to costs associated with\nproducing and airing digital branding and television advertising.\nMarketing efficiency, expressed as marketing expenses as a percentage of gross bookings, and performance marketing returns on investment (\"ROIs\") are\nimpacted by a number of factors that are subject to variability and are in some cases outside of our control, including ADRs, costs per click, cancellation rates,\nforeign currency exchange rates, our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customers, and the timing and effectiveness of our brand marketing campaigns. In\nrecent years, we observed periods of stable or increasing ROIs. Although it is difficult to predict how performance marketing ROIs will change in the future, ROIs\ncould be negatively impacted by increased levels of competition and other factors. When evaluating our performance marketing spend, we typically consider\nseveral factors for each channel, such as the customer experience on the advertising platform, the incremental traffic we receive, and anticipated repeat rates.\nMarketing efficiency can also be impacted by the extent to which consumers come directly to our platforms for bookings. The mix of our room nights booked by\nconsumers coming directly to our platforms was a mid-fifties percentage over the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024, and this mix increased versus\nthe trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2023.\nMarketing expenses as a percentage of total gross bookings in the third quarter of 2024 were lower than in the third quarter of 2023 due to an increase in\nthe share of room nights booked by consumers coming directly to our platforms and higher performance marketing ROIs, partially offset by increased spend in\nsocial media channels. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"We face risks relating to our marketing efforts\" and \"We are dependent on travel service providers,\nrestaurants, search platforms, and other third parties\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nBooking.com had approximately 3.9 million total properties on its website at September 30, 2024, consisting of over 475,000 hotels, motels, and resorts\nand over 3.4 million alternative accommodation properties (including homes, apartments, and other unique places to stay), representing an increase from\napproximately 3.3 million total properties at September 30, 2023.\n29\nThe mix of Booking.com's room nights booked for alternative accommodation properties in the third quarter of 2024 was approximately 35%, up versus\napproximately 33% in the third quarter of 2023. We have observed a longer-term trend of an increasing mix of room nights booked for alternative accommodation\nproperties as consumer demand for these types of properties has grown, and as we have increased the number and variety of these properties on Booking.com. We\nmay experience lower profit margins due to additional costs, such as increased customer service or certain partner related costs, related to offering alternative\naccommodations. As our alternative accommodation business has grown, these different characteristics have negatively impacted our profit margins and this trend\nmay continue.\nAlthough we believe that providing an extensive collection of properties, excellent customer service, and an intuitive, easy-to-use consumer experience\nare important factors influencing a consumer's decision to make a reservation, for many consumers, the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining\nwhether to book. Discounting and couponing (i.e., merchandising) occurs across the major regions in which we operate, particularly in Asia. In some cases, our\ncompetitors are willing to make little or no profit on a transaction or offer travel services at a loss in order to gain market share. As a result, it is increasingly\nimportant to offer travel services, such as accommodation reservations, at a competitive price, whether through discounts, coupons, closed-user group rates or\nloyalty programs, increased flexibility in cancellation policies, or otherwise. These initiatives have resulted and, in the future, may result in lower ADRs and lower\nrevenues as a percentage of gross bookings.\nMany taxing authorities are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenues and have targeted large multinational technology companies in these\nefforts. As a result, many countries and some U.S. states have implemented or are considering the adoption of a digital services tax or similar tax that imposes a tax\non revenues earned from digital advertisements or the use of online platforms, even when there is no physical presence in the jurisdiction. Currently, rates for these\ntaxes range from 1.5% to 10% of revenues deemed generated in the jurisdiction. The digital services taxes currently in effect, which we record in \"Sales and other\nexpenses\" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations, have negatively impacted our results of operations. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A,\nRisk Factors - \"We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIncreased regulatory focus on online businesses, including online travel businesses like ours, could result in increased compliance costs or otherwise\nadversely affect our business. For example, the Digital Markets Act (\"DMA\") and Digital Services Act (\"DSA\") give regulators in the EU more instruments to\ninvestigate and regulate digital businesses and impose new rules and requirements on platforms designated as \"gatekeepers\" under the DMA and online platforms\nmore generally, with separate rules for \"Very Large Online Platforms\" (VLOP) under the DSA. In early 2023, Booking.com received a VLOP designation notice\nfrom the European Commission. The Company met the quantitative notification criteria set forth in the DMA and in May 2024, the European Commission\ndesignated the Company as a gatekeeper under the DMA. Certain of the DMA's requirements will become enforceable in the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result of\nthe DMA, compliance costs may increase and changes to our products or business practices may be required. For information regarding risks related to the DMA\nand DSA, please see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"Our business is subject to various competition/anti-trust, consumer protection, and online commerce laws and\nregulations around the world, and as the size of our business grows, scrutiny of our business by legislators and regulators in these areas may intensify\" in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For more information on the impacts of regulations on our business, see Note 13 to our\nUnaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur businesses outside of the U.S. represent a substantial majority of our financial results, but because we report our results in U.S. Dollars, we face\nexposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results and the financial condition of our businesses outside of the U.S. are translated\nfrom local currency (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S. Dollars. See Note 2 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for\ninformation related to revenues by geographic area. As a result of the movements in foreign currency exchange rates, both the absolute amounts of and percentage\nchanges in our foreign-currency-denominated net assets, gross bookings, revenues, operating expenses, and net income as expressed in U.S. Dollars are affected.\nMovements in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a meaningful impact on our total gross bookings or revenue growth in the third quarter of 2024 as\ncompared to the third quarter of 2023. Since our expenses are generally denominated in foreign currencies on a basis similar to our revenues, our operating margins\nhave not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuations.\n30\nWe generally enter into derivative instruments to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We enter into foreign currency\nexchange derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates on our transactional balances denominated in\ncurrencies other than the functional currency. See Note 6 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our derivative\ncontracts. In addition, we designate certain portions of the aggregate principal value of our Euro-denominated debt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of\nthe net investment in certain Euro functional currency subsidiaries. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is not\ndesignated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recognized in \"Other income (expense), net\" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of\nOperations (see Notes 9 and 14 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements). Such foreign currency transaction gains or losses are dependent on the\namount of net assets of the Euro functional currency subsidiaries, the amount of the Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a hedge, and fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\" in\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOther Factors\nOver the long term, we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion, technology, and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to\nimprove long-term operating results, even if those expenditures create pressure on operating margins. In recent years, our investments in initiatives to drive future\ngrowth added pressure on operating margins. We also intend to broaden the scope of our business, including exploring strategic alternatives such as acquisitions.\nThe competition for technology talent in our industry is intense. As a result of the competitive labor market and inflationary pressure on compensation,\nour personnel expenses to attract and retain key talent have increased, which has adversely affected our results of operations and may adversely affect our results of\noperations in the future. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"We rely on the performance of highly skilled employees; and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key\nemployees or hire, retain, and motivate well-qualified employees, our business would be harmed\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nOutlook\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect:\n• the year-over-year growth in room nights will be between 6% and 8%;\n• the year-over-year growth in gross bookings will be between 7% and 9%;\n• the year-over-year growth in revenues will be between 7% and 9%; and\n• operating income will be higher than the fourth quarter of 2023, as the fourth quarter of 2023 was negatively impacted by an accrual of $530 million\nrelated to the fine by the Spanish competition authority, as well as an accrual of $276 million related to the Netherlands pension fund matter. Excluding\nboth of those accruals, we expect operating income will be higher than the fourth quarter of 2023.\nFor the full year 2024, we expect:\n• the year-over-year growth in gross bookings will be about 8%;\n• the year-over-year growth in revenues will be just below 10%; and\n• operating income will be higher than in 2023.\n31\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements,\nwhich have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Certain of our accounting estimates\nare particularly important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need\nto make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain\nestimates and we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in\nthe travel industry, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates\nunder different assumptions or conditions. Matters that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the valuation of investments in private\nentities, the valuation of goodwill and other long-lived assets, income taxes, and contingencies. For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see the\n\"Critical Accounting Estimates\" section of Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated by reference into this Item 2, for details regarding recent\naccounting pronouncements.\n32\nResults of Operations\nThree and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nOperating and Statistical Metrics\nOur financial results are driven by certain operating metrics that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel-\nrelated services. See \"Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information on our Operating and Statistical Metrics, including room nights,\nrental car days, airline tickets, and merchant and agency gross bookings.\nRoom nights, rental car days, and airline tickets reserved through our services for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as\nfollows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nIncrease Increase\n(in millions) 2024 2023 (Decrease) 2024 2023 (Decrease)\nRoom nights 299 276 8.1 % 883 818 7.9 %\nRental car days 23 20 16.2 % 66 59 12.3 %\nAirline tickets 13 9 38.7 % 36 27 33.3 %\nRoom nights reserved through our services increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by increased travel demand in Europe and Asia. Rental car days reserved through our services increased for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by year-over-year growth in rental\ncar days reserved on Booking.com. Airline tickets reserved through our services increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven primarily by the expansion of the flight offerings at Booking.com and Agoda.\nGross bookings resulting from reservations of room nights, rental car days, and airline tickets made through our merchant and agency categories for the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (numbers may not total due to rounding):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nIncrease Increase\n(in millions) 2024 2023 (Decrease) 2024 2023 (Decrease)\nMerchant gross bookings $ 28,362 $ 22,271 27.3 % $ 79,952 $ 63,320 26.3 %\nAgency gross bookings 15,085 17,542 (14.0)% 48,460 55,612 (12.9)%\nTotal gross bookings $ 43,447 $ 39,813 9.1 % $ 128,413 $ 118,932 8.0 %\nMerchant gross bookings increased and agency gross bookings decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to the ongoing shift from agency bookings to merchant bookings at Booking.com.\nThe year-over-year increase in total gross bookings during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to the increase in room nights\nand the positive impact from year-over-year growth in flight gross bookings, partially offset by a decrease in constant currency accommodation ADRs of less than\n1%.\nThe year-over-year increase in total gross bookings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to the increase in room nights\nand the positive impact from year-over-year growth in flight gross bookings, partially offset by a negative impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and by a\ndecrease in constant currency accommodation ADRs of less than 1%.\nFlight gross bookings increased 28% and 22% year-over-year during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to airline\nticket growth, partially offset by lower airline ticket prices. Rental car gross bookings increased 15% and 5% year-over-year during the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024, respectively, due primarily to rental car days growth, partially offset by lower average daily car rental prices.\n33\nRevenues\nOnline travel reservation services\nSubstantially all of our revenues are generated by providing online travel reservation services, which facilitate online travel purchases from travel service\nproviders by travelers.

Advertising and other revenues\nincreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to growth in advertising\nrevenues at Booking.com as well as growth at OpenTable.\nTotal revenues as a percentage of gross bookings was 18.4% and 14.2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which\ncompares to 18.4% and 13.9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The year-over-year increase in total revenues as a percentage\nof gross bookings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to an increase in revenues related to facilitating payments, partially offset by an increase\nin the mix of flight gross bookings.\nOperating Expenses\nMarketing Expenses\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nIncrease Increase\n(in millions) 2024 2023 (Decrease) 2024 2023 (Decrease)\nMarketing expenses $ 2,151 $ 2,022 6.4 % $ 5,700 $ 5,340 6.7 %\n% of Total gross bookings 5.0 % 5.1 % 4.4 % 4.5 %\n% of Total revenues 26.9 % 27.5 % 31.2 % 32.2 %\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of the costs of:\n• search engine keyword purchases;\n• affiliate programs;\n• referrals from meta-search websites;\n• offline and online brand marketing; and\n• other performance-based marketing.\n34\nOur marketing expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023, to help drive additional gross bookings and revenues. Marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross\nbookings in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were lower than in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an\nincrease in the share of room nights booked by consumers coming directly to our platforms and higher performance marketing ROIs, partially offset by increased\nspend in social media channels.\nSales and Other Expenses\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nIncrease Increase\n(in millions) 2024 2023 (Decrease) 2024 2023 (Decrease)\nSales and other expenses $ 872 $ 807 8.2 % $ 2,370 $ 2,094 13.3 %\n% of Total gross bookings 2.0 % 2.0 % 1.8 % 1.8 %\n% of Total revenues 10.9 % 11.0 % 13.0 % 12.6 %\nSales and other expenses consist primarily of:\n• credit card and other payment processing fees associated with merchant transactions;\n• fees paid to third parties that provide call center and other customer services;\n• digital services taxes and other similar taxes;\n• chargeback provisions and fraud prevention expenses associated with merchant transactions;\n• provisions for expected credit losses, mostly related to accommodation commission receivables; and\n• customer relations costs.\nSales and other expenses, which are substantially variable in nature, increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the\nthree and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due primarily to an increase in merchant transaction costs of $34 million and $171 million, respectively, and an\nincrease in digital services taxes and other similar taxes of $15 million and $63 million, respectively. Sales and other expenses for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 were impacted by an accrual of $17 million related to the Canadian digital services taxes related to the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022 that were enacted in June 2024 with retrospective effect.

Commissioner, partially offset by higher international tax rates, unrecognized tax\nbenefits, and U.S. federal and state tax associated with our international earnings. Our 2023 effective tax rates differed from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of\n21%, primarily due to the benefit of the Netherlands Innovation Box Tax, partially offset by higher international tax rates and certain non-deductible expenses.\nOur effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were lower compared to the effective tax rates for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a reduction to our 2018 federal one-time deemed repatriation liability, pursuant to the Tax Act, resulting from a\nrecent U.S. Tax Court decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Commissioner, partially offset by higher unrecognized tax benefits and higher U.S. federal and\nstate tax associated with our international earnings. We recorded a net tax expense reduction of $250 million during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 related to our 2018 federal one-time deemed repatriation liability.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, a majority of our income was reported in the Netherlands, where Booking.com is\nbased. Under Dutch corporate income tax law, income generated from qualifying innovative activities is taxed at a rate of 9% (\"Innovation Box Tax\") rather than\nthe Dutch statutory rate of 25.8%. A portion of Booking.com's earnings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 qualified for Innovation Box\nTax treatment, which had a beneficial impact on the effective tax rates for these periods. For additional information relating to Booking.com's Innovation Box Tax\ntreatment, including associated risks, please see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"We may not be able to maintain our 'Innovation Box Tax' benefit\" in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary source of funds for operations is the cash flow that we generate from operations. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including ongoing\ninvestments in our business, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, and capital expenditures. Our continued access to sources of liquidity depends on\nmultiple factors. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - \"Our liquidity, credit ratings, and ongoing access to capital could be materially and negatively affected by\nglobal financial conditions and events\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our financial results and prospects are almost\nentirely dependent on facilitating the sale of travel-related services. Marketing expenses and personnel expenses are the most significant operating expenses for our\nbusiness. We rely on marketing channels to generate traffic to our websites. See our Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations and \"Trends\" and \"Results\nof Operations\" above for additional information on marketing expenses and personnel expenses including stock-based compensation expenses.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had $16.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, of which approximately $11.1 billion is held by our international\nsubsidiaries. Cash, cash equivalents, and long-term investments held by our international subsidiaries are denominated primarily in Euros, U.S. Dollars, and British\nPounds Sterling. See Notes 5 and 6 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our cash equivalents and investments.\nOur investment policy seeks to preserve capital and maintain sufficient liquidity to meet operational and other needs of the business.\nDeferred merchant bookings of $4.9 billion at September 30, 2024 includes cash payments received from travelers in advance of us completing our\nperformance obligations and are comprised principally of amounts estimated to be payable to travel service providers as well as our estimated future revenue for\nour commission or margin and fees. The amounts are mostly subject to refunds for cancellations.\n38\nAt September 30, 2024, we had a remaining transition tax liability of $487 million as a result of the Tax Act, which included $257 million reported as\n\"Long-term U.S. transition tax liability\" and $230 million included in \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance\nSheet. This liability will be paid over the next two years. Due to a recent U.S. Tax Court decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. vs. Commissioner, a portion of\nour total transition tax liability may be refunded. In accordance with the Tax Act, generally, future repatriation of our international cash will not be subject to a U.S.\nfederal income tax liability as a dividend, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by us.\nSee Note 9 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt arrangements, including principal amounts,\ninterest rates, and maturity dates. Our revolving credit facility extends a revolving line of credit up to $2 billion to us and provides for the issuance of up to $80\nmillion of letters of credit, as well as up to $100 million of borrowings on same-day notice. The revolving credit facility contains a maximum leverage ratio\ncovenant, compliance with which is a condition to our ability to borrow. At September 30, 2024 there were no borrowings outstanding and $26 million of letters of\ncredit issued under the revolving credit facility. In March 2024, we issued senior notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of 2.8 billion\nEuros ($3.0 billion). The proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes are available for general corporate purposes, including to repurchase shares of our\ncommon stock and to redeem or repay outstanding indebtedness. In September 2024, we paid $1.1 billion on the maturity of the Senior Notes due September 2024.\nThe convertible senior notes due in May 2025 are currently convertible at the option of the holder and have been classified as \"Short-term debt\" in the Unaudited\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. If the note holders exercise their option to convert, we deliver cash to repay the principal amount of the\nnotes and deliver shares of common stock or cash, at our option, to satisfy the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. The outstanding senior notes at\nSeptember 30, 2024 had cumulative interest to maturity of $3.9 billion, with $529 million payable within the next twelve months.\nSee Note 10 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our share repurchases and dividends declared and\npaid. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $5.3 billion, including $330 million\nto repurchase shares of our common stock withheld to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations related to stock-based compensation. At September 30, 2024,\nwe had a total remaining authorization of $8.8 billion related to a program authorized by our Board of Directors (\"the Board\") in 2023 to repurchase up to $20\nbillion of our common stock. We expect to complete the share repurchases under the remaining authorization by the end of 2026, assuming no major downturn in\nthe travel market. Excise tax obligations that result from our share repurchases are accounted for as a cost of the treasury stock transaction. As of September 30,\n2024, we recorded an estimated excise tax liability of $141 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid cash dividends of $885 million. In\nOctober 2024, the Board declared a cash dividend of $8.75 per share of common stock, payable on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of\nbusiness on December 6, 2024.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had lease obligations of $814 million, of which $194 million is payable within the next twelve months. Additionally, at\nSeptember 30, 2024, we had, in the aggregate, $1.0 billion of non-cancellable purchase obligations individually greater than $10 million, of which $220 million is\npayable within the next twelve months. Such purchase obligations relate to agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and\nthat specify significant terms, including the quantities to be purchased, price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nAt September 30, 2024, there were $652 million of standby letters of credit and bank guarantees issued on our behalf, which were obtained primarily for\nregulatory purposes. See Note 13 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our commitments and contingencies.\nWe believe that our existing cash balances and liquid resources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, capital expenditures, and other\nobligations through at least the next twelve months. However, if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional\ncapital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditures and scale back the scope\nof our business plans, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our ability to compete or our future growth prospects, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. If additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our then current\nstockholders would be diluted. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, revenues growth or sustained profitability may not be\nrealized, and future borrowings or equity sales may not be available in amounts sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditures, finance our strategies, or repay\nour indebtedness.\n39\nCash Flow Analysis\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $7.6 billion, resulting from net income of $4.8 billion, a\nfavorable net impact from adjustments for non-cash and other items of $1.3 billion, and a favorable net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities of\n$1.5 billion. Non-cash and other items were principally associated with depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for expected\ncredit losses and chargebacks, operating lease amortization, and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses related to Euro-denominated debt. For the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities increased by $2.3 billion and accounts receivable increased by $651\nmillion, primarily due to higher business volumes. Merchant revenues increased while agency revenues decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to the ongoing shift from agency revenues to merchant revenues at Booking.com.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $6.0 billion, resulting from net income of $4.1 billion, a\nfavorable net impact from adjustments for non-cash and other items of $826 million, and a favorable net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities\nof $1.1 billion. Non-cash and other items were principally associated with deferred income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation\nexpense, provision for expected credit losses and chargebacks, net losses on equity securities, and operating lease amortization. For the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities increased by $2.6 billion and accounts receivable increased by $1.5 billion, primarily\ndue to increases in business volumes.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $204 million, resulting mainly from proceeds from the\nmaturity of investments of $590 million, partially offset with additions to property and equipment of $353 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 was $1.5 billion, principally resulting from proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments of $1.8 billion, partially\noffset with additions to property and equipment of $251 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $4.3 billion, resulting mainly from payments for the repurchase\nof common stock of $5.3 billion, payment on the maturity of debt of $1.1 billion, and dividends of $885 million, partially offset with proceeds from the issuance of\nlong-term debt of $3.0 billion. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $6.4 billion, resulting from payments for\nthe repurchase of common stock of $7.9 billion and payment on the maturity of debt of $500 million, partially offset with proceeds from the issuance of long-term\ndebt of $1.9 billion.\nContingencies\nFor information related to tax matters, see Note 13 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item IA, Risk Factors - \"We may have\nexposure to additional tax liabilities\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nFor information related to our contingent liabilities, see Note 13 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-Q, including \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\" in Part I, Item 2, and the documents\nincorporated by reference contain forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our views regarding current expectations and projections about future\nevents and conditions and are based on currently available information. They are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and\nassumptions that are difficult to predict including the Risk Factors identified in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023; therefore, our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or described in the forward-looking statements.\nExpressions of future goals and expectations and similar expressions, including \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"aims,\" \"seeks,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\"\n\"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"targets,\" and \"continue,\" reflecting something other than historical fact are intended to\nidentify forward-looking statements. Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of\nnew information, future events, or otherwise. However, readers should carefully review the reports and documents we file or furnish from time to time with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, particularly our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our subsequent Quarterly Reports on\nForm 10-Q, and our Current Reports on Form 8-K.\n40\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe have exposure to several types of market risk, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity prices. See Part II, Item\n7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional\ninformation on our policies and how we manage our exposure to such risks.\nSee Note 9 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our convertible senior notes and other debt. Excluding the effect on\nthe fair value of our convertible senior notes, a hypothetical 100 basis point (1.0%) decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase in the estimated\nfair value of our other debt of approximately $810 million at September 30, 2024. Our convertible senior notes are more sensitive to the equity market price\nvolatility of our shares than changes in interest rates. The fair value of the convertible senior notes will likely increase as the market price of our shares increases\nand will likely decrease as the market price of our shares falls. Our convertible senior notes due in May 2025 are currently convertible at the option of the holder. If\nthe note holders exercise their option to convert, we deliver cash to repay the principal amount of the notes and deliver shares of common stock or cash, at our\noption, to satisfy the conversion value in excess of the principal amount.\nWe face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results and the financial condition of our businesses outside of the\nU.S., which represent a substantial majority of our financial results, are translated from local currencies (principally Euros and British Pounds Sterling) into U.S.\nDollars. For example, our total gross bookings increased by 8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, but without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates our total gross bookings increased year-over-year on a constant-\ncurrency basis by approximately 9%. Our total revenues increased by 10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, but without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our total revenues increased year-over-year on a constant-currency\nbasis by approximately 11%. See Notes 9 and 14 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information about foreign currency transaction gains and losses, changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates, the impact of such changes on the increase in our revenues and operating margins, and our designation of certain portions of our Euro-denominated\ndebt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in certain Euro functional currency subsidiaries.\nSee Notes 5 and 6 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded\ncompanies and private entities. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair values at September 30, 2024 of our investments in equity securities of publicly-traded\ncompanies and private entities would have resulted in a loss, before tax, of approximately $50 million being recognized in net income.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, we\nconducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such a term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our\nprincipal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period\ncovered by this report.\nIn 2022, we began a multi-year implementation to integrate and upgrade certain financial systems and processes, including SAP S4 HANA. As a result of\nthese improvements, there were changes to our internal control over financial reporting processes and procedures. However, there were no changes in our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Further, as the phased integration and upgrade\ncontinues, there will be additional changes to our processes and procedures that are likely to impact our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe believe we are taking the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this period of change.\nWhile we expect this implementation to strengthen our internal financial controls by automating certain manual processes and standardizing business\nprocesses and reporting across our organization, management will continue to evaluate and monitor our internal controls as the implementation continues.\n41\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nA description of any material legal proceedings to which we are a party, and updates thereto, is included in Note 13 to our Unaudited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and is incorporated into this Part II, Item 1\nby reference thereto.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. For a discussion of such risks, please refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nItem 2.

Go ahead, gentlemen.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGlenn D. Fogel\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nThank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO,\nEwout Steenbergen. I am pleased to report an improvement in topline trends in the third quarter, particularly in\nEurope, that resulted in room nights, gross bookings and revenue all exceeding the high end of our prior\nexpectations.\nThe revenue outperformance combined with disciplined marketing spend and lower than expected fixed OpEx\ngrowth, helped drive adjusted EBITDA that was 9% above the high end of our prior guidance range. We continue\nto be encouraged by the strength of our underlying business, the health of the travel industry and the\nattractiveness of our products.\nIn the third quarter, our travelers booked just under 300 million room nights across our platforms, an increase of\n8% year-over-year. Revenue of $8 billion grew 9% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion increased\n12% year-over-year. Finally, adjusted earnings per share grew 16% year-over-year, helped by our strong capital\nreturn program, which reduced our average share count by 6% year-over-year.\nFrom a regional perspective, we observed an improvement in our room night growth in Europe in the third quarter,\nwhich was the primary driver of the sequential increase in our global room night growth. In Asia, we continue to\nperform well with another quarter of double-digit growth and we remain optimistic in our outlook for this region,\nwhich I'll discuss in more detail later on the call.\nIn the US, we see relatively stable levels of growth in our business so far this year, which we think continues to\noutpace the broader US accommodation industry. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to continue\nto see healthy levels of room night growth as demand for travel remains resilient. Ewout will provide further details\non our third quarter results and our thoughts about the fourth quarter.\nI remain confident in the attractive growth profile of the travel industry, our competitive position and our long-term\ngrowth and earnings model. We continue to see progress across several important initiatives, which include\ngrowing alternative accommodations, advancing our Connected Trip Vision, continuing to develop our AI\ncapabilities and continuing our progress in Asia. These initiatives contribute to our ongoing effort to deliver a\nbetter planning, booking and travel experience for our travelers while also benefiting our supplier partners.\nWe remain focused on being a trusted and valuable partner to all of the accommodation properties on our\nplatforms by delivering incremental travel demand and developing products and features to help support these\nbusinesses, the majority of which are small independents.\nFor alternative combination of Booking.com, we continue to see more properties connected to our platform with\nlistings at the end of Q3 reaching 7.9 million, up about 10% from last year. The growing number of listings provide\nmore accommodation choices for our travelers, which we believe contributed to strong alternative\naccommodations room night growth of 14% in Q3.\nWe believe that we have a differentiated offering because we make all property types, hotels and alternative\naccommodations available on our Booking.com platform. We see benefits to this approach.\n3\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nFor example, our data shows that a portion of our bookers landing on our platform with an interest in a hotel will\ninstead end up booking an alternative accommodation and vice versa. We believe that this shows in many cases\ntravelers are open to compare hotel and alternative accommodation options when determining the best place to\nstay for their trip. Our objective is to make sure we continue to provide great choices for our travelers across all\nproperty types.\nOn the Connected Trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make the planning, booking and\ntravel experience easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our travelers and\nsupplier partners. We believe the Connected Trip is strengthened by our growing merchant capabilities, which\nhelp bring the different elements of travel together in a more seamless booking experience.\nIn addition, our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com has been expanding outside of accommodations and into\nour other travel verticals, which helps to deliver more value to our travelers, as they book more components of\ntheir trips with us and to our partners as they receive incremental bookings.\nWe continue to see growth in Connected Trip transactions, which means a trip that includes booking more than\none travel vertical. These connected transactions increased by over 40% year-over-year in the third quarter and\nrepresented a high single-digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions.\nWe believe by making it easier to plan and book multiple elements of a trip on our platform, we are providing a\nbetter overall booking experience for our travelers. And we have seen in past experiments, that customers who\nchoose to book a Connected Trip book more frequently with us and have a higher likelihood of booking directly\nwith us in the future.\nTurning to flights. They're an important component for many of the Connected Trips that our travelers are\nbooking. In the third quarter, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 39% year-over-year, which was an\nacceleration from Q2 growth of 28% and was driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com slate offering, but we\nalso benefited from strong growth in Agoda's flight business. We continue to see a healthy number of new\ncustomers coming to Booking.com through the flight vertical and are encouraged by the number of these\ncustomers and returning customers that also see the value of the other services we offer on our platform.\nTo achieve the easier and more personalized experience of the Connected Trip, we have always intended for AI\ntechnology to be at the center of this vision. At each of our brands, our teams of AI experts continue to draw on\ntheir valuable experience as they incorporate AI technology into our platforms.\nWe believe that our proprietary data, along with our resources and scale position us well to build compelling and\npersonalized AI-powered offerings for our travelers and partners. This technology will also enable us to drive\nfurther efficiency in our own operations. We have significant activity in this area across the company, and I'll\nbriefly discuss just a few of the encouraging efforts that are underway across our brands.\nLast summer, Booking.com launched its AI Trip Planner. And since the launch, Booking.com has gained valuable\ninsights from its millions of interactions with bookers as well as from the use of the GenAI technology alongside\nour existing machine learning models. The learnings from the AI Trip Planner are leading to new applications of\nGenAI technology, including a recent launch of a Smart filter, which makes over 200 potential search filters\nfindable through a free text interface.\n4\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nThese innovations also extend to the partner-facing side of the business at Booking.com. GenAI is being\nleveraged to help properties write responses to traveler queries, and this tool has led to an increase in response\nrates to traveler messengers. This improves the experience for our travelers and partners. Booking.com is also\ntesting a GenAI-powered partner chatbot to help with questions during the onboarding process and accelerate\nsign-ups, starting with a focus on alternative accommodation properties.\nBooking.com is also working to incorporate GenAI into its customer service function to drive increased efficiency\nand a better experience for travelers. Initial testing shows meaningful improvements in topic detection in\nBooking.com's customer health center as well as customer service agent case summarization. Booking.com is\nstill early in this journey and sees meaningful opportunities in improving customer service and driving greater\nefficiency by leveraging AI in the future.\nAt Priceline, Travelers have now had over 3 million interactions with its Generative AI travel assistant called\nPenny. This was launched last summer. While Penny was originally positioned at the end of the funnel on the\ncheckout page, it's now available across the full booking experience and can address many types of traveler\nquestions, including destination discovery, hotel search and trip support.\nIn October, Priceline launched Penny Voice, which enables Penny to engage in verbal conversations with\ntravelers and to assist them with planning trips, searching for hotels and servicing bookings. As Priceline\ncontinues to enhance this offering, we envision that Penny will be able to anticipate needs based on preferences\nand past interaction and then respond in a real-time voice. While there has been great progress in the\ndevelopment of Penny over the last year, Priceline is focused on further enhancing Penny over time by leveraging\ntheir valuable learnings so far.\nAt Agoda, over 120 use cases for GenAI have been implemented across customer service, software\ndevelopment, content generation, product, finance and HR.\nAgoda is highly focused on leveraging GenAI to automate product development using both externally and\ninternally developed tools. This is leading to an increase in the share of code written by AI as well as measurable\nimprovements in productivity per developer and development time.\nIn March, KAYAK launched its Ask KAYAK travel planning tool, which improves and personalizes the search\nexperience by allowing travelers to use free form text entries to search and refine their results.\nAt the same time, KAYAK also launched PriceCheck, a price comparison tool that allows travelers to upload a\nscreen shock of a flight itinerary, which KAYAK can then check against many different sites in order to determine,\nif there is a better price available for the traveler.\nAt OpenTable, an AI voicebot has been recently integrated into its offering to help participating restaurants\nanswer their phones. Diners can call these restaurants and perform tasks like making a reservation, altering their\nreservation, asking questions and noting dietary restrictions, which are then automatically updated into\nOpenTable software.\nOpenTable is also partnered with Salesforce's Agentforce platform. This helps its customer service agents better\nserve its restaurants and diners. This platform is now handling restaurant web queries, which is helping agents\nfocus on delivering great service in more complex situations.\n5\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nIt's exciting to see the work happening across our company to integrate GenAI into our platforms and the\nknowledge sharing that is ongoing between all of our brands. We know we are still in the very early days of GenAI\nand we have much more to learn about consumers, how they ultimately want to interact with this new technology.\nBut I remain confident in our company's ability to benefit from AI developments and to improve our products for\nour customers given our many years of experience in AI, our travel-related data connections to our supply\npartners and our human and financial capital.\nOvertime, as we further incorporate this technology, we expect to see benefits in travel and partner acquisition,\nretention and satisfaction. In addition, we expect it to improve operational efficiency, which will contribute to a\ndeceleration of our fixed expense growth in the future.\nFinally, as I mentioned at the start of the call, we continue to be optimistic about our long-term outlook for Asia.\nWe see Asia as a strategically important due to its size, growth potential and our positioning in the region.\nWe estimate that the travel industry growth in Asia will be in the high-single-digits over the next five years, which\nis the highest market growth rate of our major regions. Our ambition is to continue to grow faster than the overall\ntravel industry in Asia as we have done through the pandemic recovery.\nOver the last 12 months, about 24% of our global room nights were booked by bookers in the Asia region, which\nis a slightly higher mix than it was prior to the pandemic. Our business in Asia is diversified across the countries in\nthe region with no single country representing more than a low single-digit percentage of our global room nights.\nThe success we have seen in Asia and our solid position in the region has been driven by operating two\ncomplementary brands, Agoda and Booking.com. Our approach is to utilize both of these brands across the\nregion with an eye on profitable growth for booking holdings over the long run.\nIn conclusion, I'm encouraged by our strong third quarter results and the continued resilience of leisure travel\ndemand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our\nbusiness well for the long-term. We remain confident in the long-term growth of travel and in the many\nopportunities ahead for our company.\nI will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will now review our results for the third quarter and provide our thoughts\nfor the fourth quarter and the full year. All growth rates on the year-over-year basis. Information regarding\nreconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release.\nWe will be posting a summary earnings presentation as well as our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings\nInvestor Relations website after the conclusion of earnings call. Now let's move to our third quarter results.\nOur room nights in the third quarter grew 8%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 3 percentage\npoints. The stronger-than-expected room night growth was driven by an improvement in trends in Europe starting\nin August and benefited from the booking window expanding year-over-year in the third quarter versus our\nexpectation for it to be more similar to 2023.\n6\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nLooking at our room nights growth by region in the third quarter, Europe was up high single-digits; Asia was up\nlow double-digits; Rest of World was up mid-single-digits and the US was up low single-digits. As Glenn noted, we\ncontinue to make progress against our strategic priorities, including growing alternative accommodations,\nincreasing the mix of our bookings to the direct channel and our mobile apps, enhancing our Genius offering and\ndriving growth in our other travel verticals as part of our Connected Trip vision.\nFor our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our third quarter room night growth was 14%, which\ncontinued to outpace the overall business. The global mix of alternative accommodation room nights at\nBooking.com was 35%, which was up 2 percentage points from the third quarter of 2023.\nWe continue to strengthen our direct relationships with our travelers and increase loyalty on our platforms. Over\nthe last four quarters, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid-50%\nrange. And when we exclude our B2B business was in the low-60% range. We have seen both of these mixes\ncontinue to increase year-over-year.\nMobile app mix of our total third quarter room nights was in the mid-50% range, which was up from the low-50%\nrange in 2023. We continue to see that a significant majority of bookings received from our mobile apps come\nthrough the direct channel.\nFor our Genius loyalty program, the mix of Booking.com room nights booked by travelers in the higher Genius\ntiers of Levels 2 and 3 was in the mid-50% range over the last four quarters, and this mix continued to increase\nyear-over-year.\nIn our other travel verticals, we saw airline tickets booked on our platforms in the third quarter increased 39%,\ndriven by the continued growth of flight offerings by Booking.com and Agoda. We also saw rental car days booked\non our platforms increased 16% in the third quarter, driven by strong growth at Booking.com. The growth rates for\nairline tickets and rental car days were both better than our expectation and both accelerated from the second\nquarter.\nThird quarter gross bookings increased 9%, which was approximately one percentage point higher than the 8%\nroom night growth due to about two percentage points from higher flight bookings growth, partially offset by a\ndecrease in constant currency accommodation ADRs of less than 1%. The year-over-year ADR decline was\nnegatively impacted by a higher mix of the room nights from Asia.\nExcluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up less than 1% versus 2023. The increase in gross\nbookings exceeded the high end of our guidance by 5 percentage points due to stronger room night growth, plus\nless pressure from changes in FX and stronger flight ticket growth.\nThird quarter revenue of $8 billion grew 9% year-over-year, which also exceeded the high end of our guidance by\n5 percentage points. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was in line with our expectations at 18.4% and\nwas also in line with the prior year, as increased revenues associated with payments were offset by a higher mix\nof flight bookings. The increased revenues from payments were driven by an increase in our merchant mix, which\nreached 65% of our total gross bookings, up from 56% in the third quarter of 2023.\nMarketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line increased 6% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a\npercentage of gross bookings was 5.0%, about 15 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2023, due to a\nhigher direct mix and higher performance marketing ROIs, partially offset by increased spend in social media\nchannels.\n7\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nThird quarter sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 2.0% in line with last year.\nOur fixed expenses on an adjusted basis were up 7% year-over-year and were below our expectation, due\nprimarily to lower IT expenses, some of which we expect to shift into the fourth quarter, as well as lower G&A\nexpenses. We continue to be very focused on carefully managing the growth of our fixed expenses. We believe it\nis important to drive greater operating leverage in our fixed expenses, as this creates capacity for disciplined\ninvestment across our strategic initiatives, which we believe will help drive stronger top line and earnings growth\nin the future.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion grew 12% year-over-year and was above our expectation, largely driven by the\nhigher revenue and also by the lower-than-expected fixed expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% in the\nthird quarter was up versus last year by a bit more than 1 percentage point due to marketing and fixed expense\nleverage.\nAdjusted net income of over $2.8 billion was up 9%. Adjusted EPS of $83.89 per share was up 16% and benefited\nfrom a 6% lower average share count than the third quarter of 2023.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income was $2.5 billion in the third quarter and was negatively impacted by a $365 million\naccrual in G&A expenses related to a potential settlement of certain Italian indirect tax matters, partially offset by\na $250 million reduction to our US repatriation tax liability, which lowered income tax expense.\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our third quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.3 billion\nwas down versus our second quarter ending balance of $16.8 billion, due to about $2 billion of capital return,\nincluding share repurchases and dividends and a pay down of about $1.1 billion for debt that matured in\nSeptember, partially offset by about $2.3 billion in free cash flow generated in the quarter.\nMoving to our thoughts for the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter room night growth to be between 6% and\n8%, continuing our positive trend from the third quarter. We expect fourth quarter gross bookings to grow between\n7% and 9%, 1 point ahead of room night growth due to expected higher flight ticket growth.\nWe expect constant currency accommodation ADRs to be approximately flat year-over-year. We expect fourth\nquarter revenue growth to be between 7% and 9%. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between\nabout $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion, representing growth between 9% and 13%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to\ngrow faster than revenue due primarily to marketing leverage as a result of increasing direct mix.\nWe're increasing our outlook for the full year, driven primarily by the stronger than expected third quarter, which is\nour seasonally largest revenue and profit quarter. We expect full year gross bookings to increase about 8%, an\nimprovement from our prior expectation of faster than 6%. We expect full year revenue growth of just below 10%,\nwhich is better than our prior expectation of faster than 7%.\nWe expect a slightly negative impact from changes in FX on our full year top-line growth rates, which compares to\nour prior expectation for about 1 percentage point of negative impact. We expect fixed OpEx on an adjusted basis\nto grow around 10%, lower than our prior expectation.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA to grow between 13% and 14%, which is better than our prior expectation due to the\nincreased revenue growth and lower fixed OpEx growth. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-\n8\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nover-year by a bit more than 1 percentage point. And finally, we expect our full year adjusted EPS to grow in the\nhigh-teens.\nIn conclusion, we are pleased with our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year.\nThank you to all my colleagues across the company for their hard work, determination innovation and teamwork.\nWith that, we'll now take your questions. Operator, will you please open the lines.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question today from Justin Post, Bank of\nAmerica.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJustin Post Q\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.\nThanks. I guess since you talked a lot about AI in your prepared remarks, maybe you could talk about how you\nexpect that to translate to financials? Do you think AI could bring more direct traffic because of all your tools,\nbetter attach rates when people come to your site, maybe lower expenses? Just how will we see that translate to\nfinancials?\nAnd then one on bookings, it looks like – can you talk about some of the factors in Q4 that could affect bookings\neither hurricanes or the – maybe the Middle East comps? How you're thinking about some of the 4Q factors?\nThank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGlenn D. Fogel A\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nHi Justin. It's Glenn speaking. I'll take the first question about AI, and then I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about your\nquestion regarding fourth quarter. So, we did give a number of examples about some of the things we're working\non out of the company on AI because I know there's a lot of curiosity about where are we and what's happening.\nAnd it is one of the most exciting times I've – in this company ever. And it's something I've talked about before.\nMaybe you've heard me talk in some conference, et cetera, that this type of technology is really transformational.\nAnd it's going to make it so much better for all people in the travel industry, particularly for the traveler. It's also\ngoing to enable us to be able to provide a better service to our partners, enabling them to get more incremental,\nmore targeted customers help their business better.\nYou, of course, you'd like to know how does that translate into dollars and cents. That is difficult at this time. It's\nstill very, very early. We see some of the efficiencies already coming in, in some places. And we've mentioned – I\nmentioned in the prepared remarks, about some of the numbers in terms of number of people using it, which is\nactually a relatively small number compared to the total number of interactions that we have with customers.\nSounds like a big a big number, 3 million, where that's a big number, but it's small compared to the size of this\ncompany.\nSo, I know what you'd like to know, but we're not going to project those kind of numbers right now. But what I will\nsay is, it's incredibly important. The companies that are successful in AI are going to be the long-term winners\nbecause it is going to, as I say, be transformational. I'm very pleased that we made progress so far, and we have\nsome certain advantages. We've got capital. We've got people who've been working with AI now for many, many\n9\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nyears. Sure, it wasn't GenAI. They're working on machine learning models, but we've got a lot of people who are\nvery, very skilled in the areas of technology.\nIn addition, having more data, which is so important to be able to combine with other people's large language\nmodels, other people systems and come up with really unique ways to provide a better service. It's something that\nI'm just so thrilled to see what we're doing and what we're building, and I urge anybody who's curious about just\ntest out some of the things we have out there. It's out in the market. It's live. It's real. See what you think of it.\nI've done it lot myself and sometimes I'm really pleased, sometimes a little disappointed, but I know we're making\ngreat progress. And in the future, we'll be able to better quantify for you what you'd like to know. Ewout I'll let you\ngo on the fourth quarter.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nJustin, with respect to the outlook for bookings in the fourth quarter, I think the headline is we're looking at the\nfourth quarter as a very robust and positive quarter where we see a continuation of the trends we have seen over\nthe last few months. But let me dive a little bit deeper into that.\nFirst, the comps get a little easier in the fourth quarter because we're lapping the period last year where we had\nan impact, particularly with respect to the start of the conflict in the Middle East.\nThe second point is you are referring to events. Events from our perspective, doesn't really impact our results. It\nmight have a really short-term impact. But in the end, it always will effort out. So, you will never hear us really\npointing to events as an impact on our outlook or actual performance.\nThe third is, what we have seen so far is, continuation of the strength of August and September, also in October.\nThe fourth is, I think it's important to take into consideration that we expect the booking window to be less\nexpended in the fourth quarter than we have seen in the third quarter. In other words, there might have been\nsome pull forward of bookings that otherwise would have been in the fourth quarter into the third quarter.\nAnd the last is, we absolutely also have reflected uncertainties and risks with respect to the global geopolitical\nenvironment. We all know there are a lot of things out there that are happening. And we also have taken that in\nour consideration with respect to our fourth quarter outlook and guidance.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJustin Post Q\nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.\nGreat. Thank you, appreciate it.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Mahaney, Evercore.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMark Mahaney Q\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\nTwo questions, please. On the Asia call out, Glenn, I think it was the first time that Asia I think as a percentage of\nyour mix was higher than it was pre-COVID. I assume so, that's why you called it out. But anything in particular in\nthe region that you've done? Or is that just the region finally recovering back to kind of full outbound travel mode?\nSo how much of that sort of success for you was what you did versus just the market they're finally recovering?\n10\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nAnd then AA in the mix, this, I think, 35% number. The question I have for you is, I'm trying to figure out where\nthat mix is long term? In markets where you have kind of full sufficient inventory, both traditional and AA, is the\nusual mix in those markets around that average of 35%? Or is it materially higher? Therefore, we could expect the\noverall mix to go up because you still have a lot of regions where you don't have enough AA inventory? Thanks a\nlot\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGlenn D. Fogel A\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nHi, Mark, I'm not sure if you're right actually on that thing about calling out Asia. I think we had some things where\nAsia has done better. But regardless of that, let's just talk a little bit about how pleased we are with the growth\nwe're seeing in Asia. And yes, we're obviously getting a bit of a benefit because Asia overall as a market is\ngrowing fast. There were certain areas of Asia that were a little slower coming out of pandemic and such. But this\nis an opportunity for me to really put out a thanks to our Agoda team. That team has been just doing really well in\ncoming up with ways to provide a better service to the Asia customers. It's a little bit different in some parts.\nNow I say Asia, obviously, Asia is a very big place. A lot of different countries. A lot of different ways people buy,\nwhat people are looking for. And the Agoda team has done a good job of localization, of coming up the ways that\nthe customer in different parts of Asia, the way they want to buy, matching up with different types of payment\nmethods, for example, to be able to – that the local person wants to pay in a certain way, can use our service and\nfeel comfortable doing that. And in addition is making sure we're getting great inventory. Again, can be a little bit\ndifferent in Asia than other parts where there's a lot of small independents or different ways to get great pricing,\nmake sure it's showing up on our site. So, a great team effort by everybody there in Agoda, and that's helping\ngreat deal of booking, also doing Asia efforts. So overall, we're really, really pleased with what's happening.\nNow your second question about alternative accommodations, we are pleased, again, with the growth rate there,\n14%, like it, increasing the listings to 7.9 million, 10% increase, and I like that one too.\nLast time in the call, I said how we had beaten our biggest homes competitor in 11 of the last 12 times, and we\ncame out of that time ahead of them in terms of the earnings announcement, I didn't know for them to beat them\nagain. And we did, so I'm wondering, this time when we do it again, maybe 13 quarters out of 14, and it's not a\nsmall business. It's a big business because as we mentioned a couple of times, the total amount of room nights\nfor alternative combination is running roughly a little bit two-thirds of the biggest homes player in this marketplace.\nSo, it's a big business. So, it's great to be able to be growing at this size. And it's great to be doing and sort of\nleading in terms of growth.\nYour question is at what stage do we end up and feel sort of that's sort of the max or so? I don't know, because\none of the key things to our business is making sure that we just get as much of the inventory that the customer\nwants on the site and they choose. And I mentioned it in the remarks about how customers come to our site and\nfrom what they've chosen to start with, we know what they were thinking of and then they go and they buy\nsomething else. So, a key thing to our business is making sure we provide whatever the customer wants and not\ntry and steer them.\nSo, I don't know what the ultimate share is going to be. I do know though, what's important is to continue to work\non getting great inventory. And as long we're talking about it, we're nowhere near in certain regions in terms of\ngetting it. It's a lot of ramp left in front of us. US in particular, I keep repeating myself quarter-after-quarter. Sure,\nwe're growing that business nicely in the US. But there's so much more to be done. And I was just looking today,\nliterally today, because seeing what was available for us in the Hamptons, I'm a New Yorker, I look in the\n11\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nsummer. It's like [ph] enough (00:36:10) inventory there yet. So, some people say that's a negative. I see that's an\nopportunity for us. I'm really looking forward to us continuing to build that business.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nMark Mahaney Q\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\nThank you, Glenn.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And your next question comes from Doug Anmuth, JPMorgan. I apologize – okay go ahead Doug. I'm\nsorry.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDae K. Lee Q\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\nOkay. Hey. This is Dae on for Doug. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. So, the first one, could you\ndouble click on what you're seeing in Europe. Last quarter, you talked about moderation in growth in Europe, but\nthe region drove outperformance this quarter. So what changed there in the summer and fall? And do you have\nany macro views to share around the US as a region?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nFirst, with respect to Europe, we have clearly seen a reacceleration of growth starting in August. We believe that\nperhaps in July, there was a bit of impact of some of the events. But again, we always look at that as purely\ntiming, and that is averaging out. But then, we also believe there's a general underlying improvement what we are\nseeing in Europe in terms of the general demand for our products and services. It's partially market, but it's\npartially also our proposition. Of course, as Glenn already explained, having such a great platform with so many\noptions, so many verticals, where you can purchase in so many different ways. And in Europe, many people use\nus on the app.\nAnd it's really very much a mainstream app that people are using if they want to travel, very easy. You have your\ncredit card there, easy to book, easy to adjust. So that is definitely in Europe a big winner, and therefore, we have\nbeen so much really the stand out in Europe with respect to our proposition. I also need to point out at the\nexpansion of the booking window that happens in the third quarter. So that definitely also helped with the\nacceleration of growth at the same time.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nDae K. Lee Q\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\nGreat. Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And the next question comes from Kevin Kopelman, TD Cowen.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nKevin Kopelman Q\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\nGreat. Thanks so much. I had a question on marketing. Could you give us an update on kind of what you're\nseeing? You mentioned higher ROIs in the third quarter. How much of that is underlying improvement in ROIs\nversus Europe being stronger? And can you update us on how you expect the full year now to look in terms of\nmarketing and merchandising as a percentage of GDP? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n12\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nYes, Kevin, overall, how you should look at marketing and higher ROIs, I think this is really where the company\nhas such a specialized expertise, has such a great algorithms that are continuously optimizing our incremental\nspend to make sure that the incremental ROIs are really the highest that are possible. And doing that across all\nthe different options we have, how to allocate our dollars. So, this could be the different forms of performance\nmarketing channels. It could be with respect to merchandising, but it could also be with the social media channels\nwhere we are expanding our marketing spend as well. So clearly, the opportunity was there through our\ncontinuous optimization, to ultimately achieve higher growth with higher ROIs at the same time.\nWith respect to your question on the outlook, merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings, we expect it to\nbe more or less flat compared to last year for each of the quarters of 2024 and for the full year. With respect to\nmarketing, we expect marketing leverage to continue in the fourth quarter as a result of the continued growth of\nour direct channels.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nKevin Kopelman Q\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\nGreat. Thanks so much.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Next up, we'll hear from Eric Sheridan, Goldman Sachs.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEric J. Sheridan Q\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\nThanks so much for taking the question. I want to come back to the theme on fixed investments. First looking\nbackwards, maybe highlight some of where you've made investments around fixed cost and what you're most\nproud of in terms of turning a return profile on those fixed investments that you're seeing an impact on the\nbusiness today?\nAnd not about 2025, but just longer term, how do you think about coming out of that fixed investment cycle? And\n[ph] as I think (00:40:54) about the return profile or incremental margin that could be produced in the business as\nfixed investments start to grow slower than revenue over the longer term? Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nYeah, Eric, I really love that question because it's something I'm extremely personally passionate about. The way\nwe look at this is actually in two different ways. One is where do we see opportunities for efficiencies and\nachieving operating leverage. And then a completely separate decision mechanism around where can we reinvest\nthose dollars in the most optimal way that we will achieve the highest growth potential at attractive business case\nreturns in the future. So let me start with the first part.\nIn terms of operating leverage, we believe there are many opportunities we have as a company because we have\nbeen building up scale in the organization, and now we should have an opportunity to run much more volume\nover the existing scale over the next period. So let me point you to a couple of areas.\n13\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nFirst, we have tremendously slowed down hiring. So if you look now, our year-over-year head count is up\napproximately 3%. If you go back a year ago in the third quarter of 2023, head count was up 13%. So clearly, we\nare being more efficient, and we are very careful with hiring.\nWe already touched on AI, artificial intelligence, as a clear opportunity to find efficiencies in the future across\nmany different areas. In the interest of time, I will not elaborate on that, but that's a clear opportunity. We're also\nlooking at procurement, real estate, operating model optimizations, looking at spends, layers to really make the\norganization more agile and many of those areas. And we believe we really have an opportunity to expand on that\nin the future.\nBut then I think your question is also where are we proud about in terms of investments? Well, if you think about\nthe number of new areas where we're growing as a company, it's super impressive from my perspective. A few\nyears ago, we were not really in flights. Look at the growth we are reporting, 39%. Look at all the other verticals.\nLooking at what we're doing with respect to payments and fintech.\nLooking at what we're doing from a geographical perspective. Glenn was touching on the very impressive growth\nin Asia, the investments we are making in the US, and we believe we are growing still faster than the market in\nthe US and we'll continue to aim to do that in the future as well and many other areas.\nSo we are very much focused on in a very disciplined way, looking at our scarce resources making sure that we're\nusing that in the most optimal way. And in the end, invest in the most attractive growth opportunities for the\ncompany over the next period.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGlenn D. Fogel A\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nAnd I'll just add, I think what Ewout said, really hit a lot of the key things that have made us successful. And\nlooking back, there have been a lot of times that people question what are we investing on and why we're\nspending the money there, et cetera. And we're now finally beginning to see a little bit of a benefit to this.\nSo there is a point where, as you know, Booking.com was totally an agency business, totally agency business, no\npayments at all. Now we talk about our merchant mix is now 65%. And we talked about how important it was to\nhave that as a foundational pillar for our Connected Trip, which is another area where people question, why are\nyou getting out of hotels? Why are you getting to these other verticals?\nAt the end of the day is, the long-term success of a company is being able to make change, to make things\ndifferent. As the world changes, you have to change with it. If we just stayed as an agency-only hotel and not had\ninvested in other areas, we would not be where we are today. Now going forward, we can't stop. We can see how\nto do that.\nSo as Ewout said, we've got very careful. Where are we spending our money? We've got to not put money into\nthings that are not going to be productive and move resource into place that is – something is no longer\nnecessary, we just have to have the will to stop that and do something else. So I'm really proud that we've been\nable to, we have been here now almost 25 years. It will be 25 years in February. And throughout this, we have\nchanged tremendously. But the one thing that we are really concentrated on is making sure we are careful with\nour shareholders money.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEric J. Sheridan Q\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC\n14\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nThank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And from Deutsche Bank, Lee Horowitz has the next question.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nLee Horowitz Q\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe Glenn another one on alternative accommodations. You gave a lot of color on the booking\npatterns you're seeing on the platform as it relates to cross-shopping hotels and alternative accommodations. But\ncan you comment at all what you're seeing in terms of incrementality of this volume? Do you think your growing\npresence here is bringing in new cohorts of travelers who are coming to Booking for this vertical specifically? Or is\na large piece of this volume coming from consumers that you would have likely booked a hotel in your platform\notherwise?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGlenn D. Fogel A\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nThat's a very interesting question because I haven't noticed any surveying or trying to understand. Obviously, we\ncan see if we look at it, the customer has come who we've never seen before, we started with an alternative\naccommodation because I knew that we had alternative accommodations, and that would be completely\nincremental because we have alternative accommodations.\nI don't have the data on that, but I can say, I believe without actual data proof, I believe that we have brought in\npeople who would not have come otherwise, would have gone to another site but came to us because we did\noffer them an alternative accommodation. And I would say, specifically in Europe, I'm almost certain of that.\nBecause the awareness of our alternative accommodations business in Europe is very high, unlike in other parts\nof the world.\nIt's when somebody thinks that I want to have a nice villa in Nice in France, they will think Booking.com. And that\nis the incrementality that you're asking about. But again, what's more important is to offering all aspects of travel\nthat goes back to the whole Connected Trip Vision. Because if somebody does get that Nice villa, they have to\nget there somehow.\nSo if they're going to fly is good to be able to combine that and then they'll have to get from the airport to the villa.\nSo it's nice to have the ground transportation. Maybe they need insurance. And as I always say, nobody goes on\na holiday so they can sit in the room, whether it be a villa, even if it's a really nice one, or a hotel room. They want\nto do stuff, and that's why attractions is important. I can go on and on and on.\nAnd tying that all together in that Connected Trip Vision using science, using data, using our GenAI capabilities to\nmake sure we're offering the optimal things for that traveler in addition given the opportunities for our suppliers to\noffer up different types of service at different price points so that they, too, can enjoy the benefits of this\nConnected Trip Vision in terms of more customers, more profitability.\nThat's the thing we're building. That's the real true incrementality and that is getting people whoever they're\ntraveling right now, some other way that they come to us because we offer them a better service.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nLee Horowitz Q\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.\n15\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nGreat, thanks. And then maybe Ewout just one follow-up on sort of fixed OpEx. So there has been a lot of\nconversation around your passion for driving fixed OpEx going forward. I guess, given where you guys are in your\ninvestment cycle, your motivation to free up resources to invest in a lot of your growth drivers and a lot of the\nconversation on the potential for GenAI to help the P&L.\nDo you think that the business is in a place where it can drive fixed OpEx leverage, not just next year, but for\nmany years out into the future, and it should be part of the way we think about you guys going forward?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nI would say absolutely Lee, there is a big opportunity to do that. But there is always the flip side of how much\nopportunity do we have to reinvest in the business. So again, coming to the two sides of the coin that I was talking\nabout before, do have opportunities to find more opportunities for operating leverage not only in 2025 but also in\n2026? Absolutely. And of course, some of the initiatives that are being worked on or under development or have\nbeen recently implemented, the run rate effects you will see that coming in then over time in the future.\nBut as I said as well is, I think this company – the uniqueness of this company is it's doing well. It's growing fast.\nIt's delivering very strong results. We have a lot of free cash flow generation, but we also can reinvest in so many\ninitiatives in order to grow even faster in all those different areas. So how that, on a net basis, will play out, that's a\nlittle bit hard to say. But on a growth basis in the sense of how much can we really find in terms of efficiencies, I\nthink there's still a long way to go.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Next up we'll take a question from Tom White, D.A. Davidson.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nTom White Q\nAnalyst, D.A. Davidson & Co.\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Just one, if I could, on social. It seems like in recent months, we've heard\nyou guys mention having better success kind of access and travel demand in social media channels, which I\nguess, for a long time, didn't really seem to be the case. There's obviously a ton of engagement there, but it didn't\nseem like it was necessarily efficient demand source for you. Can you maybe talk a bit about why that's changing\nor it seems to be changing? And curious like how big a vector of growth social maybe could be for you guys over\nthe next several years? And how do you think about the incrementality, I guess, of that channel? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGlenn D. Fogel A\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nSo, it's Glenn speaking. I'll let Ewout talk a little bit [ph] he wants about (00:51:05) anything that I don't mention.\nBut we are pleased that we are seeing good results from putting money to work in social platforms. And as you\nknow, over many years, we had mentioned that we were experimenting, but it wasn't really working for us yet.\nAnd now finally, we are beginning to see it work.\nThat being said, it's a relatively small amount of money compared to our overall marketing expenses, but we're\nglad. And the thing is it always comes down to we're agnostic. As long as we get the right ROI, that's what we\nreally – our goal is, that's what we care about. And it's working now more than in the past because I think\ncooperation with people in the social platform areas that we're working with people there and coming up with\ncreative ways together to achieve our mutual goals. And we want to continue to do that, and we'll continue to\ninvest so long as we keep getting the ROIs that we want. That's as simple as it is. How big could it be? I don't\nknow.\n16\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nIt really will depend on how much further ahead we keep the ROI. In the past, we have seen some interesting\nthings that work a little bit. But then when you try to scale it, the ROIs fell off. Now we're not really seeing that in\nthe things we're trying now. But I can promise that as we grow bigger and bigger and [ph] start getting (00:52:24)\nlarge numbers, real numbers like you know what our number are, total amount we spend on marketing, who\nknows. But I am encouraged by the progress we have made so far. And I am really glad to be able to diversify\nthat pay performance type spend.\nAnd Ewout, you want to say anything on it?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nMaybe two quick things to add. First, coming back to AI. Actually, AI is an important tool to help with the additional\nadvertisement effectiveness, so that the targeting is better, and therefore, we can achieve those higher\nincremental ROIs. And maybe one other point with respect to the financials. Glenn is right. In absolute terms, the\nspend on the social media and marketing channels is still relatively small. But I'm actually encouraged because if\nyou look at the marketing increase spend year-over-year, actually meaningful part of the delta increase is actually\ngoing to those social channels.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: Next question is Jed Kelly, Oppenheimer.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJed Kelly Q\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\nHey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the US, you're getting some nice branding here with\nthe baseball playoffs having record ratings. You called out room nights maybe growing low single-digits. So can\nyou talk about where you think your brand is in the US?\nAnd then just on the single units in the US, talking to some property managers, they still think you're a little more\ncomplex to work with versus some of the other platforms. Can you talk about where you are in terms of maybe\nsimplifying it for them? Thank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGlenn D. Fogel A\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nSo you're right on your second point about, it's not as easy yet as some of our competitors, I know that's true, and\nthat's one of the things we're working on, and I'll be short to say, that's opportunity for us. That's great. We're\ndoing so well right now, and we still haven't perfected that. So that's all upside for us.\nIn terms of awareness, we're still not where we'd like to be, but we continue to improve. I continue to see those\nnumbers going up. When I look at the reports, marketing comes back – market report comes back to me – reports\nfrom our market department comes back to me, I am pleased with the progress we're making. But again, that's\nmore opportunity for us.\nEwout, anything specific you want to add?\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc.\n17\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nYeah. Just a small technicality, just to point out is, it looks like where we said last quarter, we are growing in the\nUS mid single-digits, and now it's low single-digits. I would still characterize this more as stable growth over these\nperiods because we're really at the cusp in both quarters in terms of which of those buckets is falling. So I\nwouldn't read too much in it as an investor. But overall, I would call this more stable growth over the last two\nquarters in the US.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJed Kelly Q\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.\nThank you.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: The next question is from Naved Khan, B. Riley Securities.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nNaved Khan Q\nAnalyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.\nYeah. Hi. Thanks a lot. A couple of questions. Glenn, it's great to hear that based on GenAI. Maybe give us your\nthoughts on if you think GenAI can drive more shift in bookings that can happen through online marketplaces like\nBooking.com versus those that's happened directly on a hotel website?\nAnd then with respect to Connected Trip, I remember you guys had a partnership with some super apps in Asia\nlike Grab, which is a ride-hailing app. Any updates you can share on those partnerships would be great. Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nGlenn D. Fogel A\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nSure. So, two separate questions. Let me talk first a little bit about AI in general and the ability of us versus\nothers. This stuff is not easy. It's complicated. GenAI is hard stuff. And it's really good to be in the position where\nyou have resources, people, capital, data to be able to drive forward experiments to see what works, what doesn't\nwork, how well, how quickly it works. And there's no doubt, this is an advantage.\nSo if you're a hotel, even an extremely large hotel, you do not have the resources that we have, I believe. Now, of\ncourse, you can partner with others. In fact, we're doing that ourselves. For example, we have – go to OpenTable\nexample. They're not building so much, so they're partnering though they have a good agreement with Salesforce\nto work with their new AI service, it's great there.\nBut I believe it's really important to be able to combine your own data in the hotels accommodations area and\ncome up with things that are truly differentiated and personalization. So I am confident that we have, I'd say, the\npole position in the growth of this area, and I'm very excited about it.\nThe other thing you mentioned about our partnerships in Asia with some other players. It's a very small amount of\nthose, but we're pleased with where our relationships are with them, et cetera. But that is not something that is –\nshould be seen as anything that was influencing our Asia numbers at all.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nNaved Khan Q\nAnalyst, B. Riley Securities, Inc.\nThank you, Glenn.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: We'll go next to John Colantuoni, Jefferies.\n18\n1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2024 FactSet CallStreet, LLC\nBooking Holdings, Inc.\n(BKNG) Corrected Transcript\nQ3 2024 Earnings Call 30-Oct-2024\nJohn Colantuoni Q\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. A quick one on booking window. Maybe you could just help us size the\nbenefit to the third quarter in terms of room nights from both – relative to your expectations and on a year-on-year\ngrowth rate perspective?\nAnd then second, on North America, your business there seems to be maybe the one region that's tracking more\nconsistent with the broader market. Talk about what investments and capabilities you're making to start driving\nmarket share gains once again in North America? Thanks.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen A\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Booking Holdings, Inc.\nJohn, I will take the first question. We're not really breaking out how much the booking window had an impact on\naccelerated growth in the third quarter. It is a bit of benefit, but I wouldn't overestimate the impact period-over-\nperiod. So I would say a slight benefit in the third quarter, but we're not really quantifying that.\nIn terms of your second question, we are doing in North America relative to the market, based on external data\nsources that we are looking at, we believe in the third quarter, actually, we were growing a bit faster than the\nmarket overall. And that's, of course, the result of a lot of investments we are making. Glenn has touched on\nmany of those already, the number of listings, the focus on alternative accommodations, the investments in the\nbrand we're making, for example, with respect to the World Series and the baseball playoffs in general.\nWhat we're doing in terms of becoming more – creating more familiarity with the brand in the US and many other\nfeatures and product enhancements we're making to really further improve our market position in the US. We're a\nchallenger in this market. And actually, we think that's a good position to be in because it is an opportunity to grow\nand ultimately be able to get to our natural position in terms of overall market impact in the US.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nJohn Colantuoni Q\nAnalyst, Jefferies LLC\nThanks so much.\n.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator: And everyone, that does conclude our question-and-answer session.

          "content": "Q3 2024 Earnings Presentation\nOctober 30, 2024\nDisclaimer\nDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis presentation contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect the views of Booking Holdings Inc.’s (the “Company” or “Booking Holdings” or “BKNG”) management regarding current expectations and projections\nabout future events and conditions and are based on currently available information and current foreign currency exchange rates. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and\nassumptions that are difficult to predict such as:\n● adverse changes in market conditions for travel services;\n● the effects of competition;\n● the Company's ability to manage growth and expand its global business;\n● adverse changes in relationships with travel service providers and restaurants and other third parties on which the Company depends;\n● the Company’s performance marketing efficiency and the effectiveness of its marketing efforts;\n● the Company’s ability to respond to and keep up with the rapid pace of technological and market changes;\n● the Company's ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;\n● risks related to data privacy obligations and cyberattacks;\n● IT systems-related failures or security breaches;\n● risks related to exposure to additional tax liabilities and maintaining tax benefits;\n● legal and regulatory risks;\n● risks associated with the facilitation of payments;\n● fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with doing business in multiple currencies and jurisdictions;\n● financial risks including increased debt levels and stock price volatility; and\n● success of investments and acquisitions, including integration of acquired businesses.\nFor a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those described in this presentation, refer to the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, any current reports\non Form 8-K, and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Unless required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements,\nwhether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nThis presentation may contain industry market data, industry forecasts and other statistical information. Such information has been obtained from publicly available information, industry publications and other third-party sources, and the\nCompany makes no representations as to the accuracy of such information. The Company has not independently verified any such information. Certain information in this presentation is based upon management forecasts and reflects prevailing\nconditions and management's views as of this date, all of which are subject to change.\nAdjusted Financial Measures:\nWhile the Company reports financial results in accordance with accounting principles (“GAAP”) generally accepted in the United States, this presentation includes certain Adjusted “Non-GAAP” measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash\nFlow, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Net Income per Diluted Common Share (Adjusted EPS), which are not presented in accordance with GAAP or intended to be substitutes for GAAP measures. The Company also uses information on (i) the\nimpact of the adjustments required to compute Adjusted Net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA on Other income (expense), net, as reported in the Company's consolidated statements of operations, as applicable, and (ii) Adjusted fixed operating\nexpenses, which is Total operating expenses, as reported in the Company's consolidated statements of operations, adjusted to exclude (a) certain operating expenses which are generally more likely to vary based on changes in business volumes\nand (b) amounts which are excluded in the computation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS as important supplemental measures of its performance and ability to\nservice debt. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS are used by the Company to assess its performance because they allow comparison of operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing\nthe effects of various items. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted EPS have various limitations as analytical tools, and the Recipient should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of the\nCompany’s results as reported under GAAP. Further, because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentation of Adjusted measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
