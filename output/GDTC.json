Transform CAR-T Cell Therapy Access\n\nby [Tom White](/author/tom-white), Benzinga Partner Contributor[](https://twitter.com/benzinga)\n\nDecember 2, 2024 1:48 PM |  4 min read  | Make a Comment\n\nPartner Disclosure\n\n![]()\n\nThe biotech industry has long grappled with a fundamental challenge in cell therapies – astronomical costs and complex logistics of customizing treatments for each patient. The potential solution? A novel and versatile “off-the-shelf” allogeneic platform using healthy donor cells (instead of the patient’s own cells) that could potentially dramatically reduce both cost and production time while expanding treatment options for cancer patients.\n\n[CytoMed Therapeutics Limited](https://w2.cytomed.sg/) GDTC, a small-cap biotech company from Singapore, is looking to change that narrative through its novel allogeneic platform. While current CAR-T treatments require extracting and modifying a patient’s own T cells before reinfusion – a personalized but time-intensive and costly process – CytoMed’s approach utilizes healthy donor cells to create “off-the-shelf” treatments that could serve multiple patients.\n\n![](https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/29060949/Screenshot-2024-11-29-at-4.54.15%E2%80%AFPM-1024x676.png)\n\n_Photo credit – Courtesy of CytoMed Therapeutics_\n\n### **Innovative Versatile Technology Platform**\n\nThe company’s patented technology centers on γδ T cells, a rare specialized immune cell subset with unique anti-cancer properties that do not require blood matching. These cells naturally recognize and respond to a broader range of tumor signals while better distinguishing between healthy and cancerous tissues, potentially offering improved safety profiles compared to conventional CAR-T therapies. \n\nThrough their platform, they’ve also demonstrated versatility through integration with various therapeutic approaches, including:\n\n– Chimeric antigen receptors\n\n– Checkpoint inhibitors\n\n– Bi-specific T cell engagers\n\n– Antibody-drug conjugates\n\n### **Clinical Progress and Manufacturing Excellence**\n\nA crucial advancement in this technology’s development is CytoMed’s ANGELICA first-in-human clinical trial in Singapore, supported by a grant from Singapore's National Medical Research Council. This trial is particularly significant as it targets both blood cancers and solid tumors – the latter being a historical challenge in CAR-T therapy due to complex tumor microenvironments and physical barriers.\n\nThe company’s operational strategy leverages a key advantage that sets it apart: a sophisticated English-speaking Southeast Asian infrastructure that combines excellence with efficiency. Their state-of-the-art cGMP facility in Johor, Malaysia, strategically located near Singapore’s biotech hub, operates under the same stringent PIC/S GMP Standards required by the FDA and EMA, while helping to achieve significantly lower manufacturing costs.\n\n![](https://editorial-assets.benzinga.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/29061013/Screenshot-2024-11-29-at-4.54.43%E2%80%AFPM-1024x742.png)\n\n_Photo credit – Courtesy of CytoMed Therapeutics_\n\n### **Strategic Global Expansion**\n\nCytoMed’s international collaboration, particularly in regions with large patient populations like India, provides opportunities to evaluate the therapy’s efficacy across diverse genetic and environmental factors. With their collaboration in India, one of the world’s largest healthcare markets, the company aims to leverage the country’s extensive healthcare infrastructure and large patient population to accelerate the development and accessibility of their allogeneic therapies.\n\nThrough the recent acquisition of a licensed cord blood bank, they now have access to abundant, rare, valuable cord blood raw materials that will help to support their research and development.\n\n### **Expanding Therapeutic Applications**\n\nBeyond oncology, CytoMed’s research scientists are also exploring applications in non-cancer diseases such as:\n\n– Autoimmune disorders\n\n– Inflammatory conditions\n\n– Regenerative medicine\n\nThe technology’s “off-the-shelf” nature could simplify delivery logistics, making cell therapy accessible to medical facilities beyond major treatment centers.\n\n### **Leadership Vision**\n\nWe’re not just another biotech company with promising technology,” remarked Chairman Peter Choo, “We’re building a sustainable and versatile business model that could make advanced cell therapies accessible to the masses. Our approach combines cutting-edge science with practical economics while maintaining quality and potentially prolonging life.”\n\n### **Future Prospects**\n\nCytoMed’s ongoing research is examining the therapy’s potential across different cancer types and stages. The platform’s adaptability enables rapid modification to address various cancer antigens, potentially allowing more personalized treatment approaches while maintaining off-the-shelf benefits. As research progresses, this allogeneic approach represents a promising strategy to make cell therapy more accessible while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.\n\nThe advancement of CytoMed’s technology could mark a significant step toward making advanced cell therapies available to a broader patient population, potentially transforming the space of cancer treatment and beyond.\n\nFor more information, please visit[ www.cytomed.sg](http://www.cytomed.sg) and follow CytoMed on Twitter (“X”) [@CytomedSG](https://x.com/CytomedSG), and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cytomed-therapeutics-limited/)\n\n_This post was authored by an external contributor and does not represent Benzinga's opinions and has not been edited for content.

This trial has been registered with and has received clinical trial authorisation from the Health Sciences Authority in Singapore. \n\nThe ANGELICA Trial evaluates allogeneic NKG2DL-targeting chimeric antigen receptor-grafted (CAR) gamma delta T cells (CTM-N2D) in patients with advanced solid tumours or haematological malignancies. Refer to [Form 6K announcement on October 7, 2024](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1873093/000149315224039643/form6-k.htm).\n\n“Dosing the first patient in the ANGELICA Trial, CytoMed has reached a significant milestone as a clinical stage biopharma,” says Chairman Peter Choo. “The ANGELICA Trial aims to assess the safety and potential efficacy of an allogeneic CAR-T therapy patients with advanced solid tumours or haematological malignancies.”\n\nThis is different from the current CAR-T cell therapy that typically involves taking patient’s blood cells and modifying these cells by grafting an artificial protein, known as a chimeric antigen receptor, on the surface of T cells, a type of white blood cells. The modified T cells are then re-infused into the patient to target and destroy cancer cells. Unlike chemotherapy which targets all actively dividing cells including healthy ones, CAR-T cells specifically recognize targets present on cancer cells (antigens) to kill them, thus sparing most healthy cells.\n\nThe ANGELICA Trial taps on blood drawn from eligible donors, potentially improving the quality of CAR-T cells, reducing production costs and increasing patients’ accessibility to therapy.\n\nCytoMed’s ANGELICA Trial uses a subtype of T cells known as gamma delta T cells which can be derived from donors, expanded, modified and infused into unrelated patients without the need for donor-patient compatibility matching.\n\nAbout CytoMed Therapeutics Limited (CytoMed)\n\nIncorporated in 2018, CytoMed was spun off from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore’s leading research and development agency in the public sector. CytoMed is a biopharmaceutical company focused on harnessing its licensed proprietary technologies, namely gamma delta T cell and iPSC-derived gamma delta Natural Killer T cell, to create novel cell-based allogeneic immunotherapies for the treatment of various human cancers.

credit – Courtesy of CytoMed Therapeutics\n\nIn the world of cell therapy, Silicon Valley has long recognized that technological innovation is the key to solving healthcare's most complex challenges. Enter [CytoMed Therapeutics Limited](http://www.cytomed.sg) (NASDAQ: GDTC), a small-cap biotech company from Singapore that's revolutionizing cancer treatment through its groundbreaking allogeneic “off-the-shelf” approach using blood from healthy donors and making cell therapies affordable to patients.\n\n### A Paradigm Shift in Cell Therapy\n\nTraditional CAR-T cell therapies, while groundbreaking, face substantial limitations. They require a complex, time-intensive process of extracting, modifying, and reinfusing a patient's own cells - a procedure that must be customized for each individual.\n\nAt the core of CytoMed’s breakthrough is a very versatile platform incorporating a sophisticated allogeneic system utilizing gamma delta T cells (γδ T cells), a rare and powerful subset of immune cells with remarkable anti-cancer properties. \n\n\"We hope to fundamentally transform the cell therapy landscape by manufacturing at low cost in Southeast Asia,\" explains Peter Choo, Chairman of CytoMed. \"Our approach harnesses the unique properties of the rare gamma delta T cells to create standardized, readily available treatments that eliminate the need for patient-specific manufacturing.\"\n\n### Revolutionary Technology with Broad Applications\n\nThe technological breakthrough lies in CytoMed's patented approach to utilizing gamma delta T cells from healthy donors. This innovation enables the creation of \"off-the-shelf\" treatments that can be administered to multiple patients, eliminating the traditional waiting period for custom manufacturing and shipping logistics.\n\nTheir versatile approach encompasses multiple therapeutic strategies, ranging from unmodified cell treatments to sophisticated CAR-modified versions. As explained by Chairman Peter Choo, their gamma delta T cells can be adapted for various combinational approaches, including use with chimeric antigen receptors, checkpoint inhibitors, and bi-specific T-cell engagers and even antibody drug conjugates. Thanks to their powerful effector cell properties, these cells can potentially target both blood cancers and historically challenging solid tumors - the latter being particularly significant in the CAR-T field.\n\n### Clinical Progress and Infrastructure Development\n\nCytoMed is now collaborating with one of the world's most prestigious cancer research institutions.\n\n###  Ex // Top Stories \n\n[ ![Deal expected to avoid Urban Alchemy layoffs]() ](/news/politics/urban-alchemy-layoffs-avoided-by-sf-budget-committee-deal/article_0a993e9c-b0da-11ef-9094-a78becb9856f.html#tncms-source=top-stories-article)\n\n![](https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sfexaminer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/e5/ee58a7fe-b00d-11ee-aa62-ff0c6efc9834/659f24b579762.image.jpg?resize=200%2C133)\n\n####  [ Deal expected to avoid Urban Alchemy layoffs](/news/politics/urban-alchemy-layoffs-avoided-by-sf-budget-committee-deal/article_0a993e9c-b0da-11ef-9094-a78becb9856f.html#tncms-source=top-stories-article)\n\nBut the long-term future of the organization in SF remains unclear\n\n[ ![SF co-op residents, property owners at odds over site’s future]() ](/news/health/sf-hiv-survivors-clash-in-court-with-co-op-home-owner/article_f05de4ee-b104-11ef-a2d0-7782e60beff7.html#tncms-source=top-stories-article)\n\n![](https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sfexaminer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/95/29564672-b0f8-11ef-bfad-1f36fe3d3638/674e2cd85abcf.image.jpg?resize=200%2C133)\n\n####  [ SF co-op residents, property owners at odds over site’s future](/news/health/sf-hiv-survivors-clash-in-court-with-co-op-home-owner/article_f05de4ee-b104-11ef-a2d0-7782e60beff7.html#tncms-source=top-stories-article)\n\nMarty’s Place currently houses low-income residents who are long-term survivors or HIV, AIDS\n\n[ ![AI is boosting interest in nuclear power, but won’t soon benefit from it]() ](/news/technology/ai-driving-electricity-demand-prompts-nuclear-power-push/article_da60c830-ad1e-11ef-8fcb-5b9b9bfbeb23.html#tncms-source=top-stories-article)\n\n![](https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sfexaminer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/70/670b678a-b0ef-11ef-9da6-17417a850b9a/674e1e5376368.image.jpg?resize=200%2C133)\n\n####  [ AI is boosting interest in nuclear power, but won’t soon benefit from it](/news/technology/ai-driving-electricity-demand-prompts-nuclear-power-push/article_da60c830-ad1e-11ef-8fcb-5b9b9bfbeb23.html#tncms-source=top-stories-article)\n\nNew reactors are years away — if they happen at all\n\nThe ANGELICA trial, Singapore's first locally-developed allogeneic CAR-T therapy trial, demonstrates CytoMed's clinical potential.

In addition, CytoMed is able to manufacture at a very low cost due to its strategic location in Southeast Asia, with its huge 700 million population.\n\nFor more information, please visit

Our immune system is comprised of various types of immune cells, including\nwhite blood cells that help us fight infection and cancer. Among the white blood cells,\nT cells play an essential role in infiltrating tumours, targeting and destroying cancerous cells.\nA rapidly evolving area of immunotherapy, adoptive cell therapy (ACT), uses modified\nimmune cells to treat cancer. During ACT, T cells are taken from the patient and then\nmodified to enhance their anti-cancer properties, before being transferred back to the\npatient through their veins.\nCurrent CAR-T therapies predominantly\nrely on the patient’s own alpha-beta (αβ)\nT cells, the major population of T cells\nin the peripheral blood.\nOne of the strategies to enhance anti-cancer function of T cells is to modify the cells with\na chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CAR is an artificially engineered receptor that binds to a\nmolecule (called an antigen) on cancer cells. In this way, T cells modified with CAR (CAR-T\ncells) can selectively target cancer cells carrying that specific antigen. CAR-T cells are now\ncommonly used in ACT for B-cell malignancies, cancers which originate from the immune\nB-cells. This strategy is called CAR-T therapy.\nCurrent CAR-T therapies\nCurrent CAR-T therapies predominantly rely on the patient’s alpha-beta (αβ) T cells, the\nmajor population of T cells in the peripheral blood. However, it is not suitable to use donor’s\nαβ T cells to generate CAR-T therapies due to the risk of life-threatening graft versus host\ndisease (GvHD), in which donor’s αβ T cells (‘the graft’) attack healthy cells in the patient\n(the ‘host’) after infusion.\nresearchfeatures.com\nCytoMed Therapeutics Limited\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a type of adoptive cell therapy (ACT) that uses CAR-modified T cells to specifically target cancer cells.\nSuch risk arises with donor’s αβ T cells because their T-cell use.
