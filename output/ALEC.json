(Nasdaq: ALEC), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering novel, genetically validated therapies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, today announced results from the INVOKE-2 Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of AL002 in slowing disease progression in individuals with early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Treatment with AL002 resulted in sustained target engagement and pharmacodynamic responses indicative of microglial activation. However, AL002 failed to meet the primary endpoint of slowing of Alzheimer’s clinical progression as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR®-SB), and there were no treatment effects that favored AL002 on secondary clinical and functional endpoints. Similarly, there were no significant effects on Alzheimer’s fluid biomarkers favoring AL002, and amyloid PET imaging demonstrated no treatment-related reduction of brain amyloid levels. As previously reported, MRI changes resembling amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion-related reactions were observed in INVOKE-2. The instances of ARIA were primarily seen in participants treated with AL002.\n\n“We, at Alector, recognize the importance of advancing therapeutics to treat Alzheimer’s disease and remain committed in our mission to develop safe and effective treatments for the millions of people worldwide impacted by neurodegenerative diseases,” said Gary Romano, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at Alector. “With a robust dataset from the INVOKE-2 trial, we plan to further explore TREM2 biology. We extend our deepest gratitude to the dedicated investigators, patients and caregivers who made this important trial possible. We plan to share the results of the trial with the scientific community in the near future in the hopes of contributing to the understanding of AD pathophysiology and advancing effective therapeutics for this terrible disease.”\n\nBased upon the results, Alector is stopping the long-term extension study.\n\nAlector remains committed to advancing its mechanistically broad and genetically validated drug candidates for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. At the core of this effort are the company’s progranulin-elevating programs, latozinemab and AL101/GSK4527226, developed in collaboration with GSK. Topline data from the pivotal INFRONT-3 Phase 3 clinical trial of latozinemab in frontotemporal dementia with a progranulin gene mutation is expected in late 2025 or early 2026. PROGRESS-AD, a global Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating AL101/GSK4527226 in early AD, has reached more than one-third of its target enrollment of 282 participants. Alector is also advancing its preclinical candidates aimed at a broad and diverse range of protein and enzyme targets.\n\nIn addition to advancing its pipeline, the company is continuing to develop its proprietary and versatile blood-brain barrier technology platform, Alector Brain Carrier (ABC). ABC aims to enhance the delivery of therapeutic antibodies, proteins and enzymes, achieve deeper penetration and efficacy at lower doses, and ultimately improve patient outcomes while reducing costs.\n\nTo align resources with these strategic priorities, Alector is reducing its workforce by approximately 17%. By focusing on organizational goals, Alector continues to build upon its core strength in developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, with the potential to deliver transformative value for patients.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Alector has $457.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, which the company continues to expect will provide runway through 2026. Alector plans to provide guidance for 2025 during its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings conference call.\n\n**About INVOKE-2** INVOKE-2 ([Clinicaltrials.gov](http://Clinicaltrials.gov) identifier NCT04592874), was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of AL002 in slowing disease progression in individuals with early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The trial, conducted at multiple sites across 11 countries, utilized a common close design with up to 96 weeks of randomized treatment, and all participants remained on their assigned regimen until the last participant completed 48 weeks of treatment. This design provided the opportunity to capture more observations for the primary analysis, with data collected at 48, 72, and 96 weeks. Patients were randomized to three dose regimens of AL002, 15mg/kg IV/q4w, 40mg/kg IV/q4w, 60mg/kg IV/q4w, or placebo. \n\n**About Alector** Alector is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that has pioneered immuno-neurology. The company has discovered and is developing a portfolio of mechanistically broad and genetically validated product candidates, including antibodies, protein and enzyme replacement therapies, for neurodegenerative diseases. Supported by biomarkers, Alector’s product candidates seek to treat a range of indications, including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson's disease. Alector is also developing Alector Brain Carrier (ABC), a proprietary blood-brain barrier platform, which is being selectively applied to its next-generation product candidates and research pipeline. ABC aims to enhance the delivery of therapeutics, achieve deeper penetration and efficacy at lower doses, and ultimately improve patient outcomes while reducing costs.

(Nasdaq: ALEC), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering immuno-neurology, today reported third quarter 2024 financial results and recent portfolio and business updates. As of September 30, 2024, Alector’s cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $457.2 million.\n\n“We continue to make meaningful progress advancing our innovative pipeline of product candidates and remain on track to report data in 2024 from the INVOKE-2 Phase 2 trial of AL002, the most advanced TREM2 candidate in clinical development for early Alzheimer’s disease,” said Arnon Rosenthal, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alector. “We believe that increased TREM2 signaling via AL002 may recruit disease-fighting microglia to broadly counteract the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. INVOKE-2 is designed to provide meaningful insights into AL002’s potential benefits across a combination of clinical and functional endpoints, as well as imaging and fluid biomarkers. We also believe that the broad mechanism of AL002 may have the potential to deliver potent and durable therapeutic benefits, both as a standalone therapy and in combination with anti-amyloid beta antibodies.”\n\nDr. Rosenthal continued, “For our progranulin franchise, we recently reported the patient baseline characteristics for our INFRONT-3 Phase 3 clinical trial of latozinemab in frontotemporal dementia with a progranulin gene mutation, suggesting a representative study population in this indication. We are approaching a top-line data readout for INFRONT-3 in late 2025/early 2026. Additionally, PROGRESS-AD, the Phase 2 trial of AL101/GSK4527226 in early Alzheimer’s disease, has reached more than one-third of its target enrollment. It is an exciting time at Alector, and we are well positioned to advance our proprietary pipeline of novel immuno-neurology drugs.”\n\nSara Kenkare-Mitra, Ph.D., President and Head of Research and Development at Alector, added, “We are actively advancing our Alector Brain Carrier, ABC, a proprietary versatile blood-brain barrier technology, and we are strategically leveraging this platform across our portfolio. We believe our ABC technology may advance treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by potentially enabling improved delivery of our therapeutics to the brain.”\n\n**Recent Clinical Updates**\n\n**_Immuno-Neurology Portfolio_**** _TREM2 Program (AL002) Being Developed in Collaboration with AbbVie_**\n\n  * The results of the INVOKE-2 Phase 2 clinical trial of AL002 are expected in 2024. INVOKE-2, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of AL002 in slowing disease progression in individuals with early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AL002 is a novel investigational humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is designed to bind to TREM2 to increase TREM2 signaling and, thereby, is hypothesized to improve the functionality of microglia. It is the most advanced TREM2 agonist product candidate in clinical development worldwide.\n\n\n  * 98% of eligible participants who completed the planned treatment period of INVOKE-2 have elected to participate in the long-term extension (LTE) study.\n\n\n  * In October 2024, Alector published a manuscript titled “Preclinical and first-in-human evaluation of AL002, a novel TREM2 agonistic antibody for Alzheimer’s disease” in _Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy._ The publication outlines preclinical and INVOKE-1 Phase 1 study results, demonstrating that AL002 engaged TREM2, and induced pharmacodynamic biomarker changes associated with microglial proliferation, survival, and phagocytic activity in a dose-dependent manner.\n\n\n  * AbbVie has an exclusive option to globally develop and commercialize AL002. Alector will deliver a data package resulting from the INVOKE-2 study to AbbVie for their evaluation. AbbVie’s exercise of its option would prompt a $250 million payment to Alector.\n\n\n\n**_Progranulin Programs (latozinemab (AL001) and AL101/GSK4527226) Being Developed in Collaboration with GSK_**\n\n  * The pivotal, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled INFRONT-3 Phase 3 clinical trial of latozinemab targeting frontotemporal dementia with a progranulin gene mutation (FTD-_GRN_) is ongoing and on track, with enrollment completed in October 2023 and a treatment duration of 96 weeks. Latozinemab is a novel investigational human mAb that aims to increase progranulin (PGRN) levels by inhibiting sortilin and is the most advanced PGRN-elevating candidate in development for the treatment of FTD-_GRN_.\n\n\n  * In September 2024, Alector presented a poster highlighting the patient baseline characteristics for INFRONT-3 at the 14th International Conference on Frontotemporal Dementias (ISFTD 2024). Notably, the baseline characteristics of symptomatic INFRONT-3 participants, including age, Clinical Dementia Rating scale plus National Alzheimer’s Disease Coordinating Center Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Sum of Boxes (CDR® plus NACC FTLD-SB) score and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, were representative of the broader FTD-_GRN_ registry population, based on available registry data. Additionally, Alector shared findings from the FTD Caregiver Survey and FTD Insights Survey, highlighting the challenges faced by caregivers of individuals living with FTD.\n\n\n  * PROGRESS-AD, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study evaluating AL101/GSK4527226 in early AD has reached more than one-third of its target enrollment of 282 participants, with dosing initiated in February 2024. AL101 is an investigational human mAb designed to block and downregulate the sortilin receptor to elevate the level of PGRN in the brain in a manner that is similar to investigational latozinemab but with different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.\n\n\n\n**Early Research Pipeline**\n\n  * Alector continues to advance its Alector Brain Carrier (ABC), a proprietary, versatile blood-brain barrier technology platform, which is being applied selectively to the company’s next-generation product candidates and research pipeline. The technology platform enables customization of affinity, valency, and format to optimize effector function and half-life in preclinical models. Alector is applying its ABC technology, combined with its expertise in immuno-neurology, to work on novel targets and develop first or best-in-class therapeutics.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Revenue.** Collaboration revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was $15.3 million, compared to $9.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was mainly due to an increase in revenue recognized for the AL002 program.\n\n**R &D Expenses. **Total research and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $48.0 million, compared to $46.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly driven by the increase in research and development expenses for the AL101 programs resulting from the initiation of the PROGRESS-AD Phase 2 clinical trial in 2024.\n\n**G &A Expenses. **Total general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were $15.8 million, compared to $13.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the impairment of the right-of-use asset and the leasehold improvements as the Company transitioned operations from its laboratory and office space in Newark to its South San Francisco headquarters.\n\n**Net Loss.** For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, Alector reported a net loss of $42.2 million, or $0.43 per share, compared to a net loss of $44.5 million, or $0.53 per share, for the same period in 2023.\n\n**Cash Position.** Cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $457.2 million as of September 30, 2024. Management expects that this will be sufficient to fund current operations through 2026.\n\n**2024 Guidance.** The Company continues to anticipate collaboration revenue to be between $60 million and $70 million, total research and development expenses to be between $210 million and $220 million, and total general and administrative expenses to be between $60 million and $70 million.\n\n**About Alector** Alector is a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering immuno-neurology, a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
