(NASDAQ: ODD) today announced that it has entered into a transaction with a fund managed by L Catterton (“L Catterton”) to repurchase approximately 2.35 million Class A Ordinary Shares (the “Shares”) of the Company for a total cash consideration of approximately $100 million, at a purchase price of $42.501 per share. The transaction will be funded from the Company’s existing cash resources.\n\nODDITY’s board of directors determined that the repurchase is in the best interest of the Company given the significant strength of the Company’s balance sheet and the prevailing circumstances. The transaction is independent of the Company’s standing share buyback plan—announced on June 7, 2024, and authorizing the Company to purchase up to $150 million of the Company’s shares over 3 years—which will continue as planned subject to its terms, including the availability of distributable funds.\n\nAfter the closing of the transaction, L Catterton will own approximately 4 million shares, representing approximately 7% of the company’s ordinary shares outstanding as of September 30, 2024, pro forma for the transaction.\n\nUpon completion of the present transaction, the Company will have repurchased $147 million of its Shares year-to-date; inclusive of the $47 million of shares repurchased through September 30, 2024 under the Company’s standing share buyback plan.\n\nAs reported by the Company on November 6, 2024, as of September 30, 2024, ODDITY held $248 million of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, in addition to $100 million available through an undrawn credit facility; the Company also has no financial debt. The company’s cash deployment strategy prioritizes reinvestment in the business, M&A, and share buybacks as appropriate.\n\nFor the 12 months ending September 30, 2024, the company generated $127 million of free cash flow, including $130 million of cash from operations and $3 million of capital expenditures.\n\nThe financial measures set forth above for the twelve months ending September 30, 2024 have been calculated as follows: (1) the value of the relevant financial measure for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, plus (2) the value of such financial measure for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 minus (3) the value of such financial measure for the nine months ending September 30, 2023.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measure:**\n\nIn addition to the GAAP financial measures set forth in this press release, ODDITY has included the following non-GAAP financial measure: free cash flow. ODDITY believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to management and investors to help evaluate ODDITY’s business, measure its performance, identify trends, prepare financial projections and make business decisions.\n\nODDITY defines “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less purchase of property, plant and equipment.\n\nODDITY’s non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, its financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate this measure differently or not at all, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\nA reconciliation from net operating cash flow to free cash flow is included below.\n\n**_Reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flo_**** _w_**** _(U.S. dollars in thousands)_**  \n---  \nTwelve Months Ended|  Nine Months Ended  \nSeptember 30,| December 31,| September 30,  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \n(Unaudited)| (Unaudited)  \nNet Operating cash flow| $| 129,504| $| 87,455| $| 121,599| $| 79,550  \nPurchase of property and equipment| (2,917| )| (2,101| )| (2,398| )| (1,582| )  \n**Free cash flow**| **$**| **126,587**| **$**| **85,354**| **$**| **119,201**| **$**| **77,968**  \n  \n**_Forward-Looking Statements:_**\n\nCertain statements in this press release may constitute “forward-looking” statements and information, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to our current expectations and views of future events.

(NASDAQ: ODD) today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“The beauty industry is transforming, and we believe ODDITY is leading this transformation,” said Oran Holtzman, ODDITY co-founder and CEO. “Our outstanding third quarter results demonstrate once again how our investments in the two most important vectors of industry growth – consumer demand for online and for high performance products – are driving outsized, profitable growth, market share gains, and powerful cash flows.”\n\n“The strength and resilience of our direct-to-consumer model is on full display in this market backdrop, where some of our competitors are experiencing slowing sales, weaker foot traffic, and excess inventory conditions. In contrast, we are consistently delivering strong, profitable growth across brands, products, and categories in every environment,” Holtzman continued. “We have massive engagement with our users on a daily basis, directly, with no intermediaries. We have the data to predict which consumers are in the market to buy and which products they are likely seeking. That direct interaction drives high consumer satisfaction and enables us to have greater predictability in our business. Accordingly, we exceeded our revenue and EBITDA objectives again this quarter, just as we have done in the past six quarters since we took the company public, and I remain very bullish on our business.”\n\nODDITY achieved key objectives during the third quarter and the first nine months of the year:\n\n  * Exceeding financial guidance for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 across every metric and raising the full year 2024 outlook.\n  * High, profitable growth at both IL MAKIAGE and SpoiledChild brands across markets and products.\n  * Great progress in developing brands 3 and 4 to disrupt additional large beauty and wellness categories.\n  * Continued development and expansion of the ODDITY LABS molecule discovery platform.\n  * Delivering $96 million of net income and $135 million of adjusted EBITDA in the first nine months of 2024.\n  * Generating $119 million of free cash flow in the first nine months of 2024.\n  * A strong balance sheet position including $248 million of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, with zero outstanding debt, as of September 30, 2024.\n  * Repurchasing 1 million shares for $37 million during the third quarter, with a total buyback of $47 million in the first nine months of 2024. $103 million remains on the $150 million buyback authorization.\n\n\n\n“We are pleased with our financial results for the third quarter, which beat our guidance across revenue, gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS,” said Lindsay Drucker Mann, ODDITY Global CFO. “Our excellent Q324 and year-to-date results, combined with a strong start to Q4 and our sustained high repeat rates allow us to once again raise our full year 2024 financial outlook across all metrics.”\n\n**_Third_** **_Quarter Fiscal 202_**** _4_**** _Financial Highlights_**** _1_** :\n\nResults for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 are presented below in comparison to the same period in the prior year:\n\n  * Net revenue was $119 million compared to $94 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing a 26% year-over-year increase.\n  * Gross profit was $83 million compared to $66 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing a 25% year-over-year increase.

ODDITY’s Q424 outlook reflects the delayed timing of investments in future growth initiatives, which were pushed out of Q3 and into Q4.\n\nODDITY is raising guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2024:\n\n  * Net revenue between $642 million and $644 million, representing year-over-year growth between 26% and 27%.\n  * Gross margin of approximately 71.5%.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA between $147 million and $149 million.\n  * Adjusted diluted EPS between $1.85 and $1.87.

This assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 30.0% and average fully diluted shares of approximately 64.0 million.\n\n\n\n**Q****4****2024 Outlook**  \n---  \nNet Revenue| $118-120 million  \nGross Margin| 68.0%  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $12-14 million  \nAdjusted Diluted EPS| $0.11-0.13  \n  \nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income margin, Adjusted diluted EPS and Free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the sections titled “Non GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures” below for more information regarding ODDITY’s use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. ODDITY has not provided a quantitative reconciliation of its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted diluted EPS outlook to the corresponding net income and diluted EPS GAAP measures, because the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net income and GAAP diluted EPS cannot be calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. ODDITY is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable reconciling items, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on its future GAAP financial results.\n\nThe financial outlook figures presented above are forward-looking statements that are subject to a variety of assumptions and estimates. Actual results may differ materially from ODDITY’s financial outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below.\n\n**_Conference Call Details_**** _:_**\n\nA conference call to discuss ODDITY’s Q3 2024 financial and business results and outlook is scheduled for tomorrow, November 7, 2024, at 8:30 a.m. ET. To participate, please dial 1-800-717-1738 (US) or 1-646-307-1865 (international) and the conference ID is 24334. A webcast of the call will be accessible on the Investors section of ODDITY’s website at https://investors.oddity.com. A recording will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call. To access the replay, please dial 1-844-512-2921 or 1-412-317-6671 (international). An archive of the webcast will be available on the Investors section of ODDITY’s website.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_**** _:_**\n\nIn addition to the GAAP financial measures set forth in this press release, ODDITY has included the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income margin, Adjusted diluted EPS and Free cash flow. ODDITY believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to management and investors to help evaluate ODDITY’s business, measure its performance, identify trends, prepare financial projections and make business decisions.\n\nODDITY defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as net income before financial expenses (income), net, taxes on income, and depreciation and amortization as further adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense and non-recurring items. “Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue. ODDITY believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. By excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its recurring core operating results, ODDITY believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and interest income, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on their financing and capital structures and the method by which their assets were acquired.\n\nODDITY defines “Adjusted net income” as net income adjusted for the impact of share-based compensation, non-recurring items and the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments and “Adjusted net income margin” as Adjusted net income divided by net revenue. In addition, ODDITY defines “Adjusted diluted earnings per share” as Adjusted net income divided by diluted shares outstanding. ODDITY believes the presentations of Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income margin, and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are useful because they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, ODDITY believes these measures are helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results, because they exclude the impact of items that are outside the control of management or not reflective of our ongoing operations and performance.\n\nODDITY defines “Free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less purchase of property, plant and equipment.\n\nODDITY’s non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, its financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently or not at all, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\nReconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included with the financial tables at the end of this release under the heading “Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.”\n\n**_Forward-Looking Statements:_**\n\nCertain statements in this press release may constitute “forward-looking” statements and information, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to our current expectations and views of future events.

In addition, these forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are not a guarantee of future performance. Actual outcomes may differ materially from the information contained in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including, without limitation, the following: our ability to maintain the value of our brands; our ability to anticipate and respond to market trends and changes in consumer preferences; our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and maintain or increase sales to those customers; our ability to maintain a strong base of engaged customers and content creators; the loss of suppliers or shortages or disruptions in the supply of raw materials or finished products; our ability to accurately forecast customer demand, manage our inventory, and plan for future expenses; our future rate of growth; competition; the fluctuating cost of raw materials; the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or the unauthorized diversion by third parties of our products; changes in, or disruptions to, our shipping arrangements; our ability to manage our growth effectively; a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions; our ability to successfully introduce and effectively market new brands, or develop and introduce new, innovative, and updated products; foreign currency fluctuations; product returns; our ability to execute on our business strategy; our ability to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction; our ability to comply with and adapt to changes in laws and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, including with respect to regulation of the internet and e-commerce, evolving AI-technology related laws, tax laws, the anti-corruption, trade compliance, anti-money laundering, and terror finance and economic sanctions laws and regulations, consumer protection laws, and data privacy and security laws; failure of our products to comply with quality standards and risks related to product liability claims; trade restrictions; existing and potential tariffs; any data breach or other security incident of our information technology systems, or those of our third-party service providers or cyberattacks; risks related to online transactions and payment methods; any failure to obtain, maintain, protect, defend, or enforce our intellectual property rights; conditions in Israel and the Middle East generally, including as a result of geopolitical conflict; the concentration of our voting power as a result of our dual class structure; our status as a foreign private issuer; and other risk factors set forth in the section titled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 6, 2024, and other documents filed with or furnished to the SEC.
