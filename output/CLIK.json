Their review report is set\nout on page 5. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the supervision of Mr G Traill (CA), the chief\nfinancial officer of the group.\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2024 are\nin terms of IFRS Accounting Standards and are consistent with those applied in the Audited Annual Financial Statements for the year ended\n31 August 2023.\n1.2 Related party transactions for the current year are similar to those disclosed in the group’s Audited Annual Financial Statements for the\nyear ended 31 August 2023. No significant related party transactions arose during the current year.\n1.3 During the year, the group repurchased and cancelled 3 098 344 Clicks Group Limited ordinary shares. Refer to the statement of\nchanges in equity.\n1.4 The carrying value of all financial instruments approximates fair value. All financial instruments are held at amortised cost, with the exception of\nderivative instruments which are designated as hedging instruments, the investment in Guardrisk Insurance Company Limited (R14.7 million) and\ninvestments held by the New Clicks Foundation Trust (R166.1 million), which are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of\nfinancial instruments that are not traded in active markets is determined by using valuation techniques; if all significant inputs required to fair value\nan instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2 and if the significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are unobservable,\nthe instrument is included in level 3. The derivative instruments comprise equity derivative hedges which are calculated using a Monte Carlo option\npricing model with reference to the closing share price, 250-day historical volatility, the 12-month trailing dividend yield and the risk-free rate; and\nforward exchange contracts which are calculated using standard market calculation conventions with reference to the relevant closing market\nspot rates, forward foreign exchange rates and interest rates; both of which are classified as level 2 instruments. All financial instruments accounted\nfor at fair value through profit or loss are considered to be level 2 instruments with the exception of investments held by the New Clicks Foundation\nTrust which are considered to be level 1 instruments, since the investments are listed instruments with a valuation based on listed prices. There have\nbeen no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 instruments during the year. The group applies hedge accounting and where derivative instruments\nare designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge, fair value gains/losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and released\neither to profit or loss or as a basis adjustment to the hedged item when the forecast transaction takes place.\n1.5 The derivative financial assets comprise the hedge obligations under the cash-settled share compensation scheme.\n1.6 Revenue 31 August 31 August %\nR’000 2024 2023 change\nThe group’s revenue from contracts with customers is disaggregated as disclosed below:\nGoods sold to customers 45 437 640 41 621 681 9.2%\nOther income 3 082 302 2 846 623 8.3%\nDistribution and logistics fees 1 349 266 1 283 509 5.1%\nCost recoveries and other 1 733 036 1 563 114 10.9%\nRevenue from contracts with customers 48 519 942 44 468 304 9.1%\nFinancial income 89 866 92 228 (2.6%)\nRevenue 48 609 808 44 560 532 9.1%\nRetail turnover can be further disaggregated between the following retail categories:\nPharmacy 9 745 692 8 951 799 8.9%\nFront shop health 8 951 836 8 083 648 10.7%\nBeauty and personal care 11 369 375 9 808 752 15.9%\nGeneral merchandise 5 371 587 4 880 676 10.1%\nTotal Retail turnover 35 438 490 31 724 875 11.7%\nClicks Group Annual Results 2024\n15\n1.6 Revenue (continued) 31 August 31 August %\nR’000 2024 2023 change\nDistribution turnover can be further disaggregated between the following categories:\nFine wholesale 13 205 444 13 268 057 (0.5%)\nClicks 7 414 243 6 943 527 6.8%\nPrivate hospitals 4 958 817 5 260 010 (5.7%)\nIndependent pharmacies and other 832 384 1 064 520 (21.8%)\nBulk wholesale 4 544 172 3 907 219 16.3%\nTotal Distribution turnover 17 749 616 17 175 276 3.3%\nIntergroup elimination (7 750 466) (7 278 470)\nTotal Group turnover 45 437 640 41 621 681 9.2%\n1.7 Headline earnings reconciliation\nYear to Year to\n31 August 31 August %\nR’000 2024 2023 change\nProfit attributable to equity holders of the parent 2 837 057 2 537 528 11.8%\nAdjusted for:\nLoss on disposal of property, plant and equipment 5 415 7 381\nProfit on disposal of business (180) –\nTotal tax effects of adjustments 2 306 (1 993)\nHeadline earnings 2 844 598 2 542 916 11.9%\nHeadline earnings per share (cents) 1 193.5 1 044.5 14.3%\nDiluted headline earnings per share (cents) 1 193.5 1 044.5 14.3%\n1.8 Other costs\nIncluded in other costs are advertising expenses of R417.6 million (2023: R381.2 million), electricity and water costs of R368.7 million\n(2023: R351.2 million), transport fees of R254.1 million (2023: R258.7 million), data fees of R261.2 million (2023: R261.0 million) and commissions\npaid of R214.3 million (2023: R189.2 million).\nClicks Group Annual Results 2024\n16\nStore footprint\nClicks The Body Total\nClicks Baby Shop Sorbet retail\nNumber of stores at 31 August 2024 930 6 57 9 1 002\nas at 31 August 2023 881 4 61 4 950\nopened/acquired 53 2 – 6 61\nclosed/disposed (4) – (4) (1) (9)\nPresence in Clicks stores at 31 August 2024 257\nNumber of pharmacies at 31 August 2024 720 720\nas at 31 August 2023 711 711\nnew/converted 12 12\nclosed (3) (3)\nNumber of clinics at 31 August 2024 206\nAnalysis of shareholders\nFund managers managing 3% or more of the issued share capital:\nPercentage of shares Percentage of shares\nAugust August Geographic distribution August August\nMajor fund managers 2024 2023 of shareholders 2024 2023\nPublic Investment Corporation (SA) 17.9% 16.8% South Africa and rest of Africa 39.3 31.7\nJPMorgan Asset Management (UK and US) 5.4% 6.1% Offshore holdings 60.7 68.3\nNinety One Asset Management (SA) 5.1% 1.7% USA and Canada 28.5 31.8\nBlackRock (US and UK) 4.8% 4.7% United Kingdom and Ireland 12.1 14.3\nGIC Asset Management (Singapore) 4.5% 5.6% Europe 10.5 11.7\nThe Vanguard Group (US) 4.0% 4.0% Other countries 9.6 10.5\nRBC Global Asset Management (UK) 3.8% 4.6%\nFederated Hermes (UK) 3.4% 4.7%\nFunds no longer managing 3% or more:\nT Rowe Price (UK and US) 2.7% 4.9%\nClicks Group Annual Results 2024\n17\nDefinitions\nCapital expenditure Interest–bearing debt, including cash, and lease payments, net of a tax charge at\nMaintenance capital expenditure to shareholders’ interest at year-end the group’s effective tax rate, expressed as a\nCapital expenditure incurred in replacing Interest–bearing debt (including bank percentage of invested capital.
