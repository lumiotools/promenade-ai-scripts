Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results\n\nby [Media Team](https://airt.net/author/media-team/ \"Posts by Media Team\") | Nov 12, 2024 | [Press Release](https://airt.net/category/press-release/)\n\n#### Air T, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Results\n\n**CHARLOTTE, NC, November 12, 2024** — Air T, Inc. (NASDAQ: AIRT) is an industrious American company with a portfolio of businesses, each of which is independent yet interrelated. We seek dynamic individuals and teams to operate companies with processes and insights that drive increasing value over time. We believe we can invest corporate resources to help activate growth and overcome challenges.\n\nOur core segments are overnight air cargo; ground equipment sales; commercial jet engines and parts; and corporate and other. The Company also invests in non-consolidated investments, notably in Crestone Asset Management, LLC and its joint venture, Crestone JV II LLC.\n\n**Today the Company is announcing results for the fiscal second quarter ended September 30, 2024:**\n\n  * Revenues totaled $81.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.3 million, or 3% from the prior year’s comparable quarter.\n  * Operating income was $3.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $3.1 million from the prior year comparable quarter’s operating income of $0.8 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* profit of $5.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA* profit of $1.6 million in the prior year’s comparable quarter.\n  * Net Income attributable to Air T stockholders for its equity method investees was $2.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024; compared to Net Income attributable to Air T stockholders for its equity method investees of $0.7 million from the prior year’s comparable quarter.\n  * The investment balance for the Company’s equity method investees was $17.6 million at September 30, 2024; as compared to $14.2 million at September 30, 2023.\n  * Earnings per share of $0.91 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the loss per share of $0.57 for the prior year’s comparable quarter.\n\n\n\n*Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure; see below for further explanation and reconciliation to GAAP measure.\n\n**Company Chairman and CEO Nick Swenson commented:**\n\n“Results for the quarter were driven by strong margins in our aviation parts trading business. We are heartened by the outstanding leadership provided by the management of these businesses, particularly since the COVID times were incredibly difficult. They are great people who have a wise and intuitive feel for the business. Challenges for the quarter included a combination of issues that lowered industry-wide sales of de-icing equipment, namely a second warmer winter and, we believe, the psychological impacts of election uncertainty and political violence coincident with the selling season. GGS’s great team is primed with new products and services; and we expect them to rebound with the market, but that may not occur until next year.”\n\n“Our financial disclosures this quarter include additional information about our equity method investments and related distributions & dividends. Additionally, we are highlighting relevant information related to our equity method investment in Crestone Asset Management.”\n\n**Business Segment Results**\n\n**Overnight Air Cargo**\n\n  * This segment provides air express delivery services, primarily for FedEx, and repair services.\n  * Revenues for this segment increased 11% to $31.2 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $28.2 million in the prior year’s comparable quarter. The increase was principally attributable to higher administrative fees due to an increased fleet of 105 aircraft in the current year’s quarter compared to 85 aircraft in the prior year’s comparable quarter and additional routes granted by FedEx.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* for this segment was $2.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $0.2 million when compared to the prior year’s comparable quarter.\n\n\n\n**Ground Equipment Sales (“GGS”)**\n\n  * This segment—which includes some of the world-leading brands in the category—manufactures mobile deicers and other specialized ground-support equipment. Customers include passenger and cargo airlines, airports, the military, and other industrial customers.\n  * Revenues for this segment totaled $14.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, up 18% when compared to revenue of $12.2 million in the previous year’s second fiscal quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the higher number of deicing trucks sold in the current year quarter compared to prior year’s comparable quarter.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* profit for this segment was $0.5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $0.5 million compared to the prior year’s quarter, due primarily to the revenue increase noted above.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, this segment’s order backlog was $9.1 million versus $7.0 million as of September 30, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Commercial Jet Engines and Parts**\n\n  * This segment leases commercial jet engines and aircraft; buys, sells and trades in surplus and aftermarket commercial jet engines, engine parts, airframes, and airframe parts, avionics, and other; then delivers the related documents and logistics.\n  * Revenues for this segment totaled $32.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $3.6 million versus the previous year’s fiscal second quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by four whole engine sales at Contrail in the prior year’s quarter compared to none in the current year’s quarter. This was partially offset by the increase in component part sales in the current year’s quarter compared to the prior year’s quarter. We believe Contrail’s increased component part sales is driven by airlines’ focusing on maintaining existing fleets of 737NG and A320CEO aircraft, because new orders from the OEMs have been cancelled or delayed. The company is in a position to satisfy customer demand through available inventory and expertise in serviceable aftermarket material.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* profit for this segment was $4.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.8 million when compared to the prior year’s comparable quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to higher profit margins on Contrail’s component part sales compared to the prior year’s comparable quarter.\n\n\n\n**Corporate and Other**\n\n  * This segment reflects the Company’s activities as a capital allocator and resource for its consolidated businesses. Moreover, Corporate and Other segment also comprises activity related to its smaller businesses and business interests.\n  * Revenues for this segment totaled $2.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $0.6 million versus the previous year’s fiscal second quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to increased software subscriptions at Shanwick.\n  * This segment’s Adjusted EBITDA* for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, represented a loss of $1.6 million in the quarter, a decrease of $0.3 million when compared to the prior year’s comparable quarter. The increase is primarily to increased software subscriptions.\n\n\n\n**Crestone Asset Management**\n\nWe launched Crestone Asset Management, LLC (“CAM”) and its joint venture, Crestone JV II LLC (“CJVII”), in May 2021, in order to develop products and services for the aircraft asset management industry. This strategic initiative leverages our expertise in asset origination and aircraft management to capitalize on the demand for commercial aircraft and jet engines.\n\nCrestone JV II is designed as a series LLC, allowing for targeted investments across multiple individual series. Its activities focus on current-generation narrow-body aircraft and engines. Through this structure we seek to enhance our investment flexibility and help optimize risk management across diverse asset classes.\n\n_Dual Functionality of CAM:_\n\n  1. Asset Management Function: CAM directs the sourcing, acquisition, and management of aircraft assets owned by CJVII. This is governed by a comprehensive Management Agreement, ensuring that our operations are efficient and aligned with best practices in asset management.\n  2. Investment Function: CAM invests alongside our institutional partners in CJVII, in order to demonstrate our commitment, and participate in what we believe will likely be attractive returns on investment.\n\n\n\n_Financial Highlights:_\n\nCAM’s assets under management totaled $5.9 million, $116.7 million, $215.1 million, and $410.4 million as of December 31, 2021*, December 31, 2022*, December 31, 2023*, and September 30, 2024, respectively.\n\nThe table below presents net income (loss) attributable to Air T, Inc. stockholders and cash distributions to the Company (in thousands):\n\n![](https://airt.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1st-table-2.png)\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe Company uses adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. This performance measure is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.\n\n4Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the Company’s performance because it provides investors additional information about the Company’s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace or be an alternative to operating income, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.\n\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of operating income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 (in thousands):\n\n![](https://airt.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2nd-table.png)\n\n**NOTE REGARDING STAKEHOLDER QUESTIONS**\n\nIf you have questions related to this release or other Air T matters, please use our interactive Q&A capability, through [Slido.com](https://airt.net/investors/ask-mgmt-question/)[,](https://airt.net/investors/ask-mgmt-question/) accessible from our website, to submit your questions.

To submit your own question, click [here](https://airt.net/investors/ask-mgmt-question/). Please note that questions received, and answers transcribed from public forums, may be edited for spelling and/or clarity.\n\n##### How does the company go about sourcing information from each such supplier about the origin of conflict minerals in your products?\n\nPlease refer to Air T’s Form SD filed with the SEC, available in this link:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/353184/000035318424000055/a2024formsd-airt53124.htm](Please%20refer to Air T's Form SD filed with the SEC, available in this link: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/353184/000035318424000055/a2024formsd-airt53124.htm)\n\n##### What is your interest coverage ratio and what’s the risk you won’t be able to service your debt this year and next?\n\n_Answered in the June 30, 2024 Investor Presentation. _Thank you for this question. We received a similar one last quarter. The table below shows historical information that may help you understand Air T’s interest coverage ratio better. Company policy dictates that we do not make forward looking statements.\n\n_![](https://airt.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-16-133251-300x48.png)_Additionally, our corporate policy is to endeavor to reinvest our cash flows in positive expected return investments whenever possible. Management believes that, at the margin, it can reduce cash expenditures by reducing optionalcash capital expenditures and cash-consuming initiatives. We, at any time, believe we have the option to reduce our investment level, in addition, we can cut corporate expenses that are related to growth. Note that our bankcovenants are calculated before considering funding for certain business units that Air T funds at its discretion.\n\n##### Most conglomerates have a business they rely on as their steady cash cow (think GEICO for Berkshire, etc.) what business of yours is the backbone of AIRT?\n\n_Answered in March 31, 2024 Investor Presentation._ Fortunately, we believe that we have a number of businesses that fall in this category. We would highlight that Mountain Air Cargo has been a consistent cash producer for us in the past with the exception of FY2020. The relatively low performance during that year was due to leadership changes that we have since remedied. After this change, MAC’s performance has stabilized. Global Ground Support is also a steady cash generator with the exception of FY2024 where, due to costs associated with management changes and reduced orders from customers in part due to the cyclicality and the unseasonable light winter, GGS had their first down year in recent history. Historical performance shows that GGS produces a consistent $2-$3 million in EBITDA but has reached levels of greater than $9 million in recent years.\n\n##### The commercial jet engines and parts division has seen massive growth recently. I believe you have partners in this business. What is the comp structure?\n\n_Answered in March 31, 2024 Investor Presentation._ As indicated on slide 17 of our Investor Presentation, you can see that our Aircraft JVs have been growing. They receive standard aviation industry management fees that include an incentive fee of approximately 20% above a hurdle rate of 0% to 8%, depending on the JV. Our Aircraft JV investors seek to generate 10%+ returns.\n\n##### Does anyone even review this process?\n\n_Answered in March 31, 2024 Investor Presentation._ Our interactive Q&A capability, through Slido.com, allows shareholders to ask questions of our management. We plan to present and answer all questions received in a given quarter through a section in the quarterly Investor Presentation. We plan to release an Investor Presentation each quarter with the filing of our financial statements.\n\n##### What is the status of the AIRTP May dividend payment?\n\n_Answered in March 31, 2024 Investor Presentation._ The AIRTP dividend payment scheduled for May was paid as scheduled on May 13, 2024\n\n##### As EBIT has been volatile, it’s been difficult to discern what to expect regarding interest coverage. What do you expect your typical interest coverage ratio to be?\n\n_Answered in March 31, 2024 Investor Presentation._ Company policy dictates that we do not make forward looking statements. However, you can see in the table below historical information that may help you understand Air T and our interest coverage better.\n\n_![](https://airt.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-02-082733-300x47.png)_\n\nOur corporate policy is to endeavor to reinvest our cash flows in positive expected return investments whenever possible. Management believes that, at the margin, it can reduce cash expenditures by reducing optional cash capital expenditures and cash-consuming initiatives. We, at any time, believe we have the option to reduce our investment level, in addition, we can cut corporate expenses that are related to growth. Note that our bank covenants are calculated before considering funding for certain business units that Air T funds at its discretion.\n\n##### Why is your stock down?\n\n_Answered in December 31, 2023 Investor Presentation._ We do not comment on our stock price.\n\n##### Why do you think issuing Trust Preferreds (\"TruPs\") addresses your liquidity issues?\n\n_Answered in December 31, 2023 Investor Presentation._ TruPs are long-term capital with a periodic fixed obligation. This type of capital is well matched with the long-term businesses and assets that Air T owns. Because they are traded on the open market, we can buy and sell TruPs to manage our liquidity needs.\n\n##### Why is this private company rife with conflicts of interest allowed to be publicly traded?\n\n_Answered in December 31, 2023 Investor Presentation._ We follow the law. We care about our brand. Our board, auditors and SEC lawyers take very seriously all legal and regulatory conflicts of interest rules and concerns. Our CEO’s annual salary has never been more than $50,000. All of our AIRT employee equity incentive vesting requirements are tied to the performance of the stock; and, to date, none of the stock return vesting tests have been met. \n\n##### Why doesn’t this company just part itself out? Surely the two owners of 66% realize that a sale and debt paydown is better than an equity wipeout.\n\n_Answered in December 31, 2023 Investor Presentation._ Thank you for your assertive question. We believe in the power of building businesses for the long term, and holding them in a public company structure allows us to do that. We believe in the Allocator/Operator Partnership – redeploying cash flows from businesses into high potentialities. We believe that over time our businesses are likely to generate cash flows for investment or principal repayment. We consider the combined value of these businesses to be greater than the individual parts. In addition, if we listen carefully and do our job correctly, Air T’s independent yet interrelated business enterprises may have emergent properties that isolated individuals do not possess. \n\n##### How is Air T, Inc preparing itself for a future with EVTOLs?\n\n_Answered in December 31, 2023 Investor Presentation._ We work closely with our partners in the aviation industry to be on the cutting edge of pragmatic innovation. Therefore, we feel like we will be able to implement new flight technologies as they are adopted by the market. We do not have any EVTOL projects underway at this time.\n\n##### Can I receive proxy statements online instead of via hard copy sent via snail mail?\n\n_Answered at 2023 Annual Shareholder Meeting (August 16, 2023)._ Yes, that is our standard practice and something we have done in the most recent past with the exception of this year. This year (fiscal year end 2022), we had an additional item up for vote on our proxy card, which was the amendment of our certificate of incorporation, and that requires an additional period of time for the SEC to review before it can become effective and thereafter mailed out. As a result, there was not enough time for the electronic (“Notice and Access”) delivery of our proxy materials. Any year in which we do not have an additional item up for vote on our proxy statement, we fully intend to send electronically.\n\n##### Do you pay ordinary dividends or make partner distributions?\n\n_Answered on July 27, 2023._ No. Our value proposition to shareholders of AIR T, INC. is to be good stewards of shareholder capital. We plan to reinvest in our high-performing businesses, acquire new cash-flow generating businesses and identify other great investment opportunities. Through our acquisitions and investments, along with our ongoing support of the dynamic individuals and teams at our networked portfolio of powerful companies, we seek to deliver meaningful value for all our stakeholders. \n\nNever say never, however, we have made one special dividend to shareholders in the past. The distribution consisted of Trust Preferred securities and warrants to purchase additional trust preferred securities. The total face value of the Trust Preferred securities distributed was $4 million or approximately $1.30 per share. \n\nInvestors who are interested in owning an income generating security should consider owning our Trust Preferred securities which have a $2.00 annual dividend per share. \n\n##### With the increased cash, any plans to reduce debt as in buying back some of the high rate AIRTP trust securities?\n\n_Answered at 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting (August 17, 2022)._ We expect to see increased cash levels. We have not received our ERC from the U.S. Treasury or the recent tax refund. Those two items add up to a significant cash infusion to the company, and we expect them in the future. We have decided to use Air T 8% Preferred securities as a long-term source of capital. They serve as a terrific way for retail investors to get income, at the same time they allow us to capitalize Air T and do the things we want to do with our investments on the balance sheet. \n\n##### Can you please update us on the status of the aviation ground support equipment segment and its outlook. Does the recent slump in sales suggest future demand? \n\n_Answered at 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting (August 17, 2022)._ We had a very significant and positive result in fiscal 2021 which was not repeated in fiscal 2022. We have a terrific management team at Global Ground Support (GGS) and a consistent long-term track record of generating high returns on capital. We would point you to the historical results so you can make your own conclusions about the future. \n\n##### The Trust Preferred Securities cost Air T 8% annually. Are you confident you will be able to earn in excess of an 8% return when investing this capital?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ We believe the past year has proven that the future is much like a foreign country: sometimes strange and always impossible to forecast. Yet we believe on balance that the cash flow dynamics of our Trust Preferred (30 year bullet maturity) are similar to low-cost, 10-year amortizing bank facilities. Moreover, note that the interest on AIRTP 8% is tax deductible to Air T, Inc. so our after-tax hurdle is lower than 8%.\n\n##### Adjusted EBITDA at GGS went from $9.13 MM in FY21 to $3.45 MM in FY22 due, in part, to fewer truck sales to the US Air Force. Any possibility of diversifying sales to other customers in the ground support equipment sector?\n\n_Answered at 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting (August 17, 2022)._ We see an up-and-down and back-and-forth of sales to our customers including the military, airlines, and commercial deicing companies. Those are year-in and year-out fluctuations, and we expect those to continue. We’re constantly working on and have a dedicated sales team focused on growing our reach at the airlines and in the commercial aviation space. We expect both those customer bases to be very much a part of GGS’s future. Note that we announced our recent product development project at GGS, the Remote Aircraft Deicing Unit, which will be on display at this fall’s ground support show. It allows an operator to remotely control a deicer from anywhere in the world over the internet, which allows companies to manage their staffing and the training of their staff much more easily.\n\n##### It would be helpful if you could disclose some of the major customers within the Ground Equipment Sales segment besides the USAF?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._\n\nMost major domestic airlines Several domestic regional airlines Most major cargo operators Foreign Militaries such as the Royal Canadian Airforce Various Foreign Customers\n\n##### How do you plan to allocate capital going forward?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ We believe, theoretically, that the Kelly Criterion is the best framework we know by which to judge an investment’s merit. Simply speaking, how much edge (or insight) do we have into the future state of an outcome, as compared to the payoff odds of that outcome? \n\nIn some sense, AIRT is set up as an idea factory that generates “looks” at various investments. Possibilities occur when real companies generate real investment projects, when our research and trading platform generates theses about compelling securities, and when our network generates private or special situations. We ‘get the call’ in each of these cases. \n\nThe more unique and insightful ‘looks,’ the greater possibility we will have a favorable edge given the payoff odds.\n\nWe don’t foresee a major change in our capital deployment strategy in the next 12 months. \n\n##### Can you outline what you believe returns will likely be on the capital you've invested into Air T's various businesses?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ We cannot predict or guarantee the returns we will earn going forward, but below are our aspirational goals for each segment: \n\nAir Cargo: 20%+ unlevered Ground Support Equipment: 20%+ unlevered Commercial Jet Engines and Parts: 10%+ unlevered Public and Private Securities: 15%+ unlevered\n\n##### Could you outline what the future looks like over the next 3 - 5 years for Air T overall and also specifically for each of the businesses you own?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ We strive to direct AIRT’s capital to businesses and projects that generate attractive returns. We firmly believe a 20% hurdle rate is a healthy challenge given our size and opportunity set. Of course, we will at times fail to reach our goals. We think very hard about generating sustainable value that sets us up for future growth. To do that, we set out to identify and develop strong investor-operator partnerships with the people and teams who are running our businesses. We want to secure and empower these management teams. We believe that if we do this well, we will build lasting value for our shareholders and we will build an investor base whose goals and philosophies are consistent with our own. These are simple, but powerful ideas that we will strive to execute well. \n\nPerhaps you are thinking: “Seems like this is what every private equity firm and investor is trying to do, what’s your edge?” Imagine that our Holdco Investing team is focused on empowering skilled management teams, and those managers focus on building their businesses without regard to an expiration date (like a P.E. firm) and with appropriate autonomy not found in most public companies (love you Jack Welch). Now imagine that occasionally, and unpredictably, these businesses generate real options that we identify and capitalize intelligently. Then this might, in some scenarios, represent a sustainable edge for Air T’s business model. \n\n##### At your deicing business, do you see this as just a stable business or does this business have the ability to grow over time?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ While the business can be highly cyclical, the Global Ground Support team has proven their ability to grow this business over the last several years and we expect them to continue searching for new ways to grow; they are not standing still. \n\n##### Could you outline what you think the future looks like for the deicing segment?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ We are focused on continuing to take market share and leading innovation in aircraft deicing. We will always be on the lookout for adjacent market or acquisition opportunities. The leadership at Global Ground Support is very strong, and we would welcome the opportunity to deploy additional capital under this team if the right opportunity presents itself. \n\n##### Could you also disclose the customers and counterparties at the Commercial jet engines and parts segment? \n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ Typically, aftermarket parts are sold to a range of airlines, cargo operators, and MRO shops worldwide. Customers and Counterparties that have been disclosed in our SEC filings include: Air Macau, DAE, Interjet, and Sun Country Airlines. Our Commercial Jet Engines and Parts segment does not have major customer or counter-party concentration at this time. \n\n##### It would be helpful if you could describe how you view the competitive advantages of Air T's various businesses?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._\n\nAir Cargo: 40-year relationship as a trusted provider for FedEx. \n\nGround Support Equipment: Largest provider of deicing equipment in the country. Longstanding relationships with all major deicing customers worldwide and a strong management team.\n\nCommercial Jet Engines: Longstanding industry relationships and a strong management team combined with a specialization on end -of -life aircraft management we feel provides a strong foundation to earn above -average returns in the industry. \n\n##### What are your key initiatives over the next year?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ We are in a pandemic that has put tremendous strain on aviation, the sector in which many of our businesses operate. These challenges will continue to be a major area of focus over the next year. One of the growth initiatives we have mentioned in our past investor presentations is creating unique investment products with outside capital partners. We have products in advanced stages of development which will continue to be a major area of focus for us over the next year. Of course, intelligently investing the capital recently raised in Contrail JV II, LLC is one of our highest priorities. \n\n##### The Commercial Jet Engine segment really took off after you acquired Contrail. Why did it do so well? What drove this performance pre-COVID?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ After acquon by Air T, Contrail expanded its aircraft trading and leasing operation with the opening of the Denver, Colorado office. This, combined with a strong banking relationship with Old National Bank, allowed the team to significantly expand trading operations that leveraged core competencies.\n\n##### Could you outline the vision with the Commercial Jet Engines and Parts segment? What could this business look like in 3, 5, and 10 years?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ If we execute well, then it’s possible to imagine that this segment will become a much larger player in the industry over the next 5 – 10 years. We believe the total addressable market is large, and they have an ambitious leadership team.\n\nWe believe the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent turmoil in the aviation industry will present a major opportunity for Contrail to play offense over the next 5-10 years. We believe the combination of Contrail, Worthington, AirCo, and Jet Yard provide a strong end-of-life aircraft management platform that can be used to maximize the value of these assets. We believe we can use this platform to manage our own assets as well as assets on behalf of outside capital partners. \n\n##### At the Commercial Jet Engines and Parts segment, do the various subsidiaries work together or are they pretty independent of one another? \n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ Contrail has separate management and historically has not worked closely with the other Commercial Jet Engines and Parts companies. This may change over time as various opportunities present themselves that would benefit both Contrail and the other Air T entities. Worthington/AirCo/Jet Yard are more closely integrated with Mark Harris as the CEO. \n\n##### At your Commercial Jet Engines and Parts segment does Jet Yard tear apart planes and the other companies sell those parts?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ There is some cooperation of that nature between Jet Yard and AirCo. However, most of Jet Yard’s teardown business has been for outside customers. \n\n##### Can you help us better understand what drove the loss at the Commercial Aircraft Engines and Parts segment?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ The loss is driven by Covid-19, causing overall lower activity levels in commercial aviation. Fewer planes are being bought, sold, and leased, fewer engines are being bought, sold and leased, fewer replacement parts are being bought, all in line with overall declines in aviation activity that have failed to produce volumes at or above our fixed cost. \n\n##### How do you think about the returns you will earn on the capital invested in the Commercial Jet Engines and Parts segment?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ Our aspirational goal is to earn a minimum 10% unlevered Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). \n\n##### The Commercial Jet Engines & Parts segment has been allocated the most capital, therefore, can you provide more information on the segment & outline the vision?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ The goal of the commercial aircraft segment is to be a premier provider of third-party aircraft/airframes/engines/parts. We seek to maximize the value of aircraft in the later stage of their lifecycle (15+ years old). \n\n##### How integrated are the subsidiaries in the Commercial Jet Engines and Parts segment?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ Contrail has separate management and historically has not worked closely with the other Commercial Jet Engines and Parts companies. This may change over time as various opportunities present themselves that would benefit both Contrail and the other Air T entities. Worthington/AirCo/Jet Yard are more closely integrated with Mark Harris as CEO. \n\n##### Any help in terms of understanding the loss at the Commercial Aircraft Engines and Parts segment on a more granular level would be helpful?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ Contrail: Buys, Sells, and Leases entire aircraft and aircraft engines. Also tears downs engines to be sold for parts. Primarily focused on 737 and A319/A320 aircraft. Primary operations in Madison Wisconsin and Denver Colorado. \n\nWorthington: After-market parts and repairs for regional aircraft (under 150 seats). Primary operations in Eagan Minnesota. AirCo: commercial airframe liquidator primarily focused on 737 and A320 aircraft. Primary operations in Eagan Minnesota. \n\nJet Yard: End-of-Life aircraft services company based at Pinal Airpark in Marana Arizona. Primarily focused on aircraft teardowns, part outs, and storage. \n\n##### Was the loss at the Commercial Aircraft Engines and Parts segment caused by asset impairments, customers defaulting on leases, or something else?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ The loss is driven by overall lower activity levels in commercial aviation. Fewer planes are being bought, sold, and leased, few engines are being bought, sold and leased, fewer replacement parts are being bought, all in line with overall declines in aviation activity. We have taken a write-down in inventory to account for current market conditions. The cash and non-cash P&L impacts can be discerned from our 10K.\n\n##### What is the rationale for the investment in Cadillac Castings?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ Cadillac Casting is a Ductile Iron Foundry located in Cadillac, Michigan with a capacity to produce approximately 1.4 million molds per year. An elderly shareholder of Cadillac Casting wanted to sell in 2019 and Air T was among several parties who purchase the shares as part of the elderly-shareholder’s exit. An independent committee within Air T conducted due diligence and approved the purchase of this stake. This investment is completely independent from Air T’s other operations and investments. \n\n# Latest\n\n##  [Air T, Inc.

(the Company) will receive a special distribution of three securities:\n\n  * **Additional Common Stock** : A dividend of one additional share for every two shares already held (a 50% stock dividend, or the equivalent of a 3-for-2 stock split).\n  * **Alpha Income Preferred Stock (AIP or Capital Securities)** : A fixed income trust preferred capital security with a stated value of $2.50 per share, paying quarterly distributions of 8% per annum. The Company will distribute an aggregate of 1,600,000 shares of AIP ($4,000,000 stated value).\n  * **Warrants to Purchase AIP (Warrants)** : The Warrants allow the holder to purchase additional AIP at a discounted price (exercise price of $2.40 per share of AIP with a stated value of $2.50 per share). The Company will distribute an aggregate of 8,400,000 Warrants to purchase 8,400,000 shares of AIP (representing Warrants to purchase $21,000,000 in stated value of AIP). The Warrants are exercisable for one year.\n\n\n\nAgain, the distribution will be effective at 5:00 p.m. EST on June 10, 2019.\n\n##### How can I trade the securities I receive?\n\nAs of market open on Monday, June 10, 2019, the Company’s Common Stock will trade on the NASDAQ Global Market, and the AIP and Warrants will also be listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbols “AIRTP” and “AIRTW” respectively. No public market currently exists for the AIP or Warrants. However, starting on June 3, 2019, there will be a market for the AIP and Warrants on the NASDAQ Global Market on a “when issued” basis.\n\n##### If I buy Common Stock after the Record Date, will I receive the additional securities? \n\nYes. Any shares of Common Stock purchased after the Record Date through the date of the distribution will trade “regular way” with “due bills”, which entitle the purchaser to receive the additional Common Stock, AIP and Warrants. Starting on June 10, 2019, the Common Stock will trade ex-dividend, with the trading price reflecting the value of the Common Stock on a post-distribution basis without the additional securities.\n\n##### What securities will I hold after the distribution? \n\n**_Example_** : A holder of 1,000 shares of Common Stock on the Record Date (market value of approximately $27,000, based on a hypothetical market price of $27.00 per share) would receive the following additional securities in the distribution on June 7, 2019: (a) 500 additional shares of Common Stock; (b) 790 AIP shares (stated value of $1,975.00); and (c) 4,150 Warrants to purchase 4,150 additional shares of AIP (stated value of $10,375.00, for an aggregate exercise price of $9,960.00, representing a discount of $415.00). **_Note_** : this example assumes 2,024,331 shares of common stock outstanding on the Record Date (based on the outstanding shares as of February 14, 2019).\n\nAfter the distribution, the holder would hold the following securities:\n\n  * 1,500 shares of Common Stock, with the market value reduced to reflect the impact of the 50% stock dividend and the impact of the issuance of the AIP on the Company’s equity capital;\n  * 790 shares of AIP with an aggregate stated value of $1,975.00, paying quarterly distributions of 8% per annum; and\n  * 4,150 Warrants to purchase up to 4,150 additional shares of AIP (stated value of $10,375.00 in additional AIP, for an aggregate exercise price of $9,960.00, representing a discount of up to $415.00).\n\n\n\n##### What are the income tax impacts of the distribution?\n\n**1) 50% Stock Dividend**\n\nWhat to expect: Form 8937 has been posted [here](https://airt.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Form-8937-signed.pdf), addressing the common stock dividend.\n\n**2) Alpha Income Preferred Stock (AIP or Capital Securities)**\n\nWhat to expect: The AIP security is a debt instrument for US federal income tax purposes. The distribution of the AIP security will be reported on a 2019 Form 1099-DIV, which will be issued prior to January 31, 2020. We are in the process of determining the amount of the dividend to be reported on the 2019 Form 1099-DIV.\n\n**3) Warrants to Purchase AIP (Warrant)**\n\nWhat to expect: The AIP warrant is an option to acquire a debt instrument for US federal income tax purposes at a $0.10 discount from face value. The distribution of the AIP warrant will be reported on a 2019 Form 1099-DIV which will be issued prior to January 31, 2020. We are in the process of determining the amount of the dividend to be reported on the 2019 Form 1099-DIV.\n\n##### How do I transfer or trade my securities?\n\nIf you own your shares through a brokerage account, you should notify your broker of your desire to transfer your AIP or Warrants. After the date of the distribution, your broker can provide a statement indicating the securities in your account and can facilitate the sale of the AIPor Warrants, or the purchase of additional AIP and Warrants.\n\nIf you hold your shares in an account in your name, you should contact the transfer agent of the Company, American Stock Transfer.\n\n##### What are the terms of the Warrants? \n\nEach Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-tenth share of AIP for $2.40. Therefore, each ten (10) Warrants confer upon the holder the right to purchase one (1) full share of AIP for $24.00, representing a 4% discount to the stated value of $25.00 for one share. \n\nThe Warrants will expire on September 8, 2020. The exercise price and number of shares of AIP issuable upon exercise is subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits, reorganizations or similar events affecting the Company’s common stock and the exercise price.\n\nNo fractional shares of AIP will be issued in connection with the exercise of a Warrant. In lieu of fractional shares, the Company will either pay the holder an amount in cash equal to the fractional amount multiplied by the exercise price or round up to the next whole share. Other terms of the Warrants and the AIP are described in the Prospectus that you will receive in connection with the distribution.\n\n##### How do I exercise my Warrants?\n\nIf you own your shares through a brokerage account, you should notify your broker of your desire to exercise Warrants. Your broker, via DTC, can facilitate the exercise through the DTC automated warrant exercise program, including your payment of the cash exercise price to purchase AIP.\n\nIf you hold your shares directly in your name, you can obtain a transfer notice form by contacting the transfer agent of the Company, American Stock Transfer. You should complete the exercise notice and deliver it to American Stock Transfer, along with a wire transfer of $24.00 per AIP to be purchased pursuant to the exercise.\n\nNote: The purchase of AIP through exercise of the Warrants is described in a Prospectus that you will receive in connection with the distribution. Before purchasing the AIP, you should review the information in the Prospectus carefully, including the information under the caption “Risk Factors”.\n\n# Latest\n\n##  [Air T, Inc.

To submit your own question, click [here](https://airt.net/investors/ask-mgmt-question/). Please note that questions received, and answers transcribed from public forums, may be edited for spelling and/or clarity.\n\n##### How does the company go about sourcing information from each such supplier about the origin of conflict minerals in your products?\n\nPlease refer to Air T’s Form SD filed with the SEC, available in this link:\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/353184/000035318424000055/a2024formsd-airt53124.htm](Please%20refer to Air T's Form SD filed with the SEC, available in this link: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/353184/000035318424000055/a2024formsd-airt53124.htm)\n\n##### What is your interest coverage ratio and what’s the risk you won’t be able to service your debt this year and next?\n\n_Answered in the June 30, 2024 Investor Presentation. _Thank you for this question. We received a similar one last quarter. The table below shows historical information that may help you understand Air T’s interest coverage ratio better. Company policy dictates that we do not make forward looking statements.\n\n_![](https://airt.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-16-133251-300x48.png)_Additionally, our corporate policy is to endeavor to reinvest our cash flows in positive expected return investments whenever possible. Management believes that, at the margin, it can reduce cash expenditures by reducing optionalcash capital expenditures and cash-consuming initiatives. We, at any time, believe we have the option to reduce our investment level, in addition, we can cut corporate expenses that are related to growth. Note that our bankcovenants are calculated before considering funding for certain business units that Air T funds at its discretion.\n\n##### Most conglomerates have a business they rely on as their steady cash cow (think GEICO for Berkshire, etc.) what business of yours is the backbone of AIRT?\n\n_Answered in March 31, 2024 Investor Presentation._ Fortunately, we believe that we have a number of businesses that fall in this category. We would highlight that Mountain Air Cargo has been a consistent cash producer for us in the past with the exception of FY2020. The relatively low performance during that year was due to leadership changes that we have since remedied. After this change, MAC’s performance has stabilized. Global Ground Support is also a steady cash generator with the exception of FY2024 where, due to costs associated with management changes and reduced orders from customers in part due to the cyclicality and the unseasonable light winter, GGS had their first down year in recent history. Historical performance shows that GGS produces a consistent $2-$3 million in EBITDA but has reached levels of greater than $9 million in recent years.\n\n##### The commercial jet engines and parts division has seen massive growth recently. I believe you have partners in this business. What is the comp structure?\n\n_Answered in March 31, 2024 Investor Presentation._ As indicated on slide 17 of our Investor Presentation, you can see that our Aircraft JVs have been growing. They receive standard aviation industry management fees that include an incentive fee of approximately 20% above a hurdle rate of 0% to 8%, depending on the JV. Our Aircraft JV investors seek to generate 10%+ returns.\n\n##### Does anyone even review this process?\n\n_Answered in March 31, 2024 Investor Presentation._ Our interactive Q&A capability, through Slido.com, allows shareholders to ask questions of our management. We plan to present and answer all questions received in a given quarter through a section in the quarterly Investor Presentation. We plan to release an Investor Presentation each quarter with the filing of our financial statements.\n\n##### What is the status of the AIRTP May dividend payment?\n\n_Answered in March 31, 2024 Investor Presentation._ The AIRTP dividend payment scheduled for May was paid as scheduled on May 13, 2024\n\n##### As EBIT has been volatile, it’s been difficult to discern what to expect regarding interest coverage. What do you expect your typical interest coverage ratio to be?\n\n_Answered in March 31, 2024 Investor Presentation._ Company policy dictates that we do not make forward looking statements. However, you can see in the table below historical information that may help you understand Air T and our interest coverage better.\n\n_![](https://airt.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-02-082733-300x47.png)_\n\nOur corporate policy is to endeavor to reinvest our cash flows in positive expected return investments whenever possible. Management believes that, at the margin, it can reduce cash expenditures by reducing optional cash capital expenditures and cash-consuming initiatives. We, at any time, believe we have the option to reduce our investment level, in addition, we can cut corporate expenses that are related to growth. Note that our bank covenants are calculated before considering funding for certain business units that Air T funds at its discretion.\n\n##### Why is your stock down?\n\n_Answered in December 31, 2023 Investor Presentation._ We do not comment on our stock price.\n\n##### Why do you think issuing Trust Preferreds (\"TruPs\") addresses your liquidity issues?\n\n_Answered in December 31, 2023 Investor Presentation._ TruPs are long-term capital with a periodic fixed obligation. This type of capital is well matched with the long-term businesses and assets that Air T owns. Because they are traded on the open market, we can buy and sell TruPs to manage our liquidity needs.\n\n##### Why is this private company rife with conflicts of interest allowed to be publicly traded?\n\n_Answered in December 31, 2023 Investor Presentation._ We follow the law. We care about our brand. Our board, auditors and SEC lawyers take very seriously all legal and regulatory conflicts of interest rules and concerns. Our CEO’s annual salary has never been more than $50,000. All of our AIRT employee equity incentive vesting requirements are tied to the performance of the stock; and, to date, none of the stock return vesting tests have been met. \n\n##### Why doesn’t this company just part itself out? Surely the two owners of 66% realize that a sale and debt paydown is better than an equity wipeout.\n\n_Answered in December 31, 2023 Investor Presentation._ Thank you for your assertive question. We believe in the power of building businesses for the long term, and holding them in a public company structure allows us to do that. We believe in the Allocator/Operator Partnership – redeploying cash flows from businesses into high potentialities. We believe that over time our businesses are likely to generate cash flows for investment or principal repayment. We consider the combined value of these businesses to be greater than the individual parts. In addition, if we listen carefully and do our job correctly, Air T’s independent yet interrelated business enterprises may have emergent properties that isolated individuals do not possess. \n\n##### How is Air T, Inc preparing itself for a future with EVTOLs?\n\n_Answered in December 31, 2023 Investor Presentation._ We work closely with our partners in the aviation industry to be on the cutting edge of pragmatic innovation. Therefore, we feel like we will be able to implement new flight technologies as they are adopted by the market. We do not have any EVTOL projects underway at this time.\n\n##### Can I receive proxy statements online instead of via hard copy sent via snail mail?\n\n_Answered at 2023 Annual Shareholder Meeting (August 16, 2023)._ Yes, that is our standard practice and something we have done in the most recent past with the exception of this year. This year (fiscal year end 2022), we had an additional item up for vote on our proxy card, which was the amendment of our certificate of incorporation, and that requires an additional period of time for the SEC to review before it can become effective and thereafter mailed out. As a result, there was not enough time for the electronic (“Notice and Access”) delivery of our proxy materials. Any year in which we do not have an additional item up for vote on our proxy statement, we fully intend to send electronically.\n\n##### Do you pay ordinary dividends or make partner distributions?\n\n_Answered on July 27, 2023._ No. Our value proposition to shareholders of AIR T, INC. is to be good stewards of shareholder capital. We plan to reinvest in our high-performing businesses, acquire new cash-flow generating businesses and identify other great investment opportunities. Through our acquisitions and investments, along with our ongoing support of the dynamic individuals and teams at our networked portfolio of powerful companies, we seek to deliver meaningful value for all our stakeholders. \n\nNever say never, however, we have made one special dividend to shareholders in the past. The distribution consisted of Trust Preferred securities and warrants to purchase additional trust preferred securities. The total face value of the Trust Preferred securities distributed was $4 million or approximately $1.30 per share. \n\nInvestors who are interested in owning an income generating security should consider owning our Trust Preferred securities which have a $2.00 annual dividend per share. \n\n##### With the increased cash, any plans to reduce debt as in buying back some of the high rate AIRTP trust securities?\n\n_Answered at 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting (August 17, 2022)._ We expect to see increased cash levels. We have not received our ERC from the U.S. Treasury or the recent tax refund. Those two items add up to a significant cash infusion to the company, and we expect them in the future. We have decided to use Air T 8% Preferred securities as a long-term source of capital. They serve as a terrific way for retail investors to get income, at the same time they allow us to capitalize Air T and do the things we want to do with our investments on the balance sheet. \n\n##### Can you please update us on the status of the aviation ground support equipment segment and its outlook. Does the recent slump in sales suggest future demand? \n\n_Answered at 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting (August 17, 2022)._ We had a very significant and positive result in fiscal 2021 which was not repeated in fiscal 2022. We have a terrific management team at Global Ground Support (GGS) and a consistent long-term track record of generating high returns on capital. We would point you to the historical results so you can make your own conclusions about the future. \n\n##### The Trust Preferred Securities cost Air T 8% annually. Are you confident you will be able to earn in excess of an 8% return when investing this capital?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ We believe the past year has proven that the future is much like a foreign country: sometimes strange and always impossible to forecast. Yet we believe on balance that the cash flow dynamics of our Trust Preferred (30 year bullet maturity) are similar to low-cost, 10-year amortizing bank facilities. Moreover, note that the interest on AIRTP 8% is tax deductible to Air T, Inc. so our after-tax hurdle is lower than 8%.\n\n##### Adjusted EBITDA at GGS went from $9.13 MM in FY21 to $3.45 MM in FY22 due, in part, to fewer truck sales to the US Air Force. Any possibility of diversifying sales to other customers in the ground support equipment sector?\n\n_Answered at 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting (August 17, 2022)._ We see an up-and-down and back-and-forth of sales to our customers including the military, airlines, and commercial deicing companies. Those are year-in and year-out fluctuations, and we expect those to continue. We’re constantly working on and have a dedicated sales team focused on growing our reach at the airlines and in the commercial aviation space. We expect both those customer bases to be very much a part of GGS’s future. Note that we announced our recent product development project at GGS, the Remote Aircraft Deicing Unit, which will be on display at this fall’s ground support show. It allows an operator to remotely control a deicer from anywhere in the world over the internet, which allows companies to manage their staffing and the training of their staff much more easily.\n\n##### It would be helpful if you could disclose some of the major customers within the Ground Equipment Sales segment besides the USAF?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._\n\nMost major domestic airlines Several domestic regional airlines Most major cargo operators Foreign Militaries such as the Royal Canadian Airforce Various Foreign Customers\n\n##### How do you plan to allocate capital going forward?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ We believe, theoretically, that the Kelly Criterion is the best framework we know by which to judge an investment’s merit. Simply speaking, how much edge (or insight) do we have into the future state of an outcome, as compared to the payoff odds of that outcome? \n\nIn some sense, AIRT is set up as an idea factory that generates “looks” at various investments. Possibilities occur when real companies generate real investment projects, when our research and trading platform generates theses about compelling securities, and when our network generates private or special situations. We ‘get the call’ in each of these cases. \n\nThe more unique and insightful ‘looks,’ the greater possibility we will have a favorable edge given the payoff odds.\n\nWe don’t foresee a major change in our capital deployment strategy in the next 12 months. \n\n##### Can you outline what you believe returns will likely be on the capital you've invested into Air T's various businesses?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ We cannot predict or guarantee the returns we will earn going forward, but below are our aspirational goals for each segment: \n\nAir Cargo: 20%+ unlevered Ground Support Equipment: 20%+ unlevered Commercial Jet Engines and Parts: 10%+ unlevered Public and Private Securities: 15%+ unlevered\n\n##### Could you outline what the future looks like over the next 3 - 5 years for Air T overall and also specifically for each of the businesses you own?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ We strive to direct AIRT’s capital to businesses and projects that generate attractive returns. We firmly believe a 20% hurdle rate is a healthy challenge given our size and opportunity set. Of course, we will at times fail to reach our goals. We think very hard about generating sustainable value that sets us up for future growth. To do that, we set out to identify and develop strong investor-operator partnerships with the people and teams who are running our businesses. We want to secure and empower these management teams. We believe that if we do this well, we will build lasting value for our shareholders and we will build an investor base whose goals and philosophies are consistent with our own. These are simple, but powerful ideas that we will strive to execute well. \n\nPerhaps you are thinking: “Seems like this is what every private equity firm and investor is trying to do, what’s your edge?” Imagine that our Holdco Investing team is focused on empowering skilled management teams, and those managers focus on building their businesses without regard to an expiration date (like a P.E. firm) and with appropriate autonomy not found in most public companies (love you Jack Welch). Now imagine that occasionally, and unpredictably, these businesses generate real options that we identify and capitalize intelligently. Then this might, in some scenarios, represent a sustainable edge for Air T’s business model. \n\n##### At your deicing business, do you see this as just a stable business or does this business have the ability to grow over time?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ While the business can be highly cyclical, the Global Ground Support team has proven their ability to grow this business over the last several years and we expect them to continue searching for new ways to grow; they are not standing still. \n\n##### Could you outline what you think the future looks like for the deicing segment?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ We are focused on continuing to take market share and leading innovation in aircraft deicing. We will always be on the lookout for adjacent market or acquisition opportunities. The leadership at Global Ground Support is very strong, and we would welcome the opportunity to deploy additional capital under this team if the right opportunity presents itself. \n\n##### Could you also disclose the customers and counterparties at the Commercial jet engines and parts segment? \n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ Typically, aftermarket parts are sold to a range of airlines, cargo operators, and MRO shops worldwide. Customers and Counterparties that have been disclosed in our SEC filings include: Air Macau, DAE, Interjet, and Sun Country Airlines. Our Commercial Jet Engines and Parts segment does not have major customer or counter-party concentration at this time. \n\n##### It would be helpful if you could describe how you view the competitive advantages of Air T's various businesses?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._\n\nAir Cargo: 40-year relationship as a trusted provider for FedEx. \n\nGround Support Equipment: Largest provider of deicing equipment in the country. Longstanding relationships with all major deicing customers worldwide and a strong management team.\n\nCommercial Jet Engines: Longstanding industry relationships and a strong management team combined with a specialization on end -of -life aircraft management we feel provides a strong foundation to earn above -average returns in the industry. \n\n##### What are your key initiatives over the next year?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ We are in a pandemic that has put tremendous strain on aviation, the sector in which many of our businesses operate. These challenges will continue to be a major area of focus over the next year. One of the growth initiatives we have mentioned in our past investor presentations is creating unique investment products with outside capital partners. We have products in advanced stages of development which will continue to be a major area of focus for us over the next year. Of course, intelligently investing the capital recently raised in Contrail JV II, LLC is one of our highest priorities. \n\n##### The Commercial Jet Engine segment really took off after you acquired Contrail. Why did it do so well? What drove this performance pre-COVID?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ After acquon by Air T, Contrail expanded its aircraft trading and leasing operation with the opening of the Denver, Colorado office. This, combined with a strong banking relationship with Old National Bank, allowed the team to significantly expand trading operations that leveraged core competencies.\n\n##### Could you outline the vision with the Commercial Jet Engines and Parts segment? What could this business look like in 3, 5, and 10 years?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ If we execute well, then it’s possible to imagine that this segment will become a much larger player in the industry over the next 5 – 10 years. We believe the total addressable market is large, and they have an ambitious leadership team.\n\nWe believe the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent turmoil in the aviation industry will present a major opportunity for Contrail to play offense over the next 5-10 years. We believe the combination of Contrail, Worthington, AirCo, and Jet Yard provide a strong end-of-life aircraft management platform that can be used to maximize the value of these assets. We believe we can use this platform to manage our own assets as well as assets on behalf of outside capital partners. \n\n##### At the Commercial Jet Engines and Parts segment, do the various subsidiaries work together or are they pretty independent of one another? \n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ Contrail has separate management and historically has not worked closely with the other Commercial Jet Engines and Parts companies. This may change over time as various opportunities present themselves that would benefit both Contrail and the other Air T entities. Worthington/AirCo/Jet Yard are more closely integrated with Mark Harris as the CEO. \n\n##### At your Commercial Jet Engines and Parts segment does Jet Yard tear apart planes and the other companies sell those parts?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ There is some cooperation of that nature between Jet Yard and AirCo. However, most of Jet Yard’s teardown business has been for outside customers. \n\n##### Can you help us better understand what drove the loss at the Commercial Aircraft Engines and Parts segment?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ The loss is driven by Covid-19, causing overall lower activity levels in commercial aviation. Fewer planes are being bought, sold, and leased, fewer engines are being bought, sold and leased, fewer replacement parts are being bought, all in line with overall declines in aviation activity that have failed to produce volumes at or above our fixed cost. \n\n##### How do you think about the returns you will earn on the capital invested in the Commercial Jet Engines and Parts segment?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ Our aspirational goal is to earn a minimum 10% unlevered Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). \n\n##### The Commercial Jet Engines & Parts segment has been allocated the most capital, therefore, can you provide more information on the segment & outline the vision?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ The goal of the commercial aircraft segment is to be a premier provider of third-party aircraft/airframes/engines/parts. We seek to maximize the value of aircraft in the later stage of their lifecycle (15+ years old). \n\n##### How integrated are the subsidiaries in the Commercial Jet Engines and Parts segment?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ Contrail has separate management and historically has not worked closely with the other Commercial Jet Engines and Parts companies. This may change over time as various opportunities present themselves that would benefit both Contrail and the other Air T entities. Worthington/AirCo/Jet Yard are more closely integrated with Mark Harris as CEO. \n\n##### Any help in terms of understanding the loss at the Commercial Aircraft Engines and Parts segment on a more granular level would be helpful?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ Contrail: Buys, Sells, and Leases entire aircraft and aircraft engines.

Fewer planes are being bought, sold, and leased, few engines are being bought, sold and leased, fewer replacement parts are being bought, all in line with overall declines in aviation activity. We have taken a write-down in inventory to account for current market conditions. The cash and non-cash P&L impacts can be discerned from our 10K.\n\n##### What is the rationale for the investment in Cadillac Castings?\n\n_Answered on August 17, 2021._ Cadillac Casting is a Ductile Iron Foundry located in Cadillac, Michigan with a capacity to produce approximately 1.4 million molds per year. An elderly shareholder of Cadillac Casting wanted to sell in 2019 and Air T was among several parties who purchase the shares as part of the elderly-shareholder’s exit. An independent committee within Air T conducted due diligence and approved the purchase of this stake. This investment is completely independent from Air T’s other operations and investments. \n\n# Latest\n\n##  [Air T, Inc.
