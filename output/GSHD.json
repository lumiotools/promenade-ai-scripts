(“Goosehead” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: GSHD), a rapidly growing independent personal lines insurance agency, today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third** **Quarter****2024****Highlights**\n\n  * Total Revenues grew 10% over the prior-year period to $78.0 million in the third quarter of 2024\n  * Third quarter Core Revenues* of $73.5 million increased 16% over the prior-year period\n  * Third quarter net income of $12.6 million improved from net income of $11.3 million a year ago\n  * EPS of $0.31 per share increased from $0.29 in the prior-year period, and Adjusted EPS* of $0.50 per share increased 10% over the prior-year period\n  * Net Income Margin for the third quarter was 16%\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* of $26.1 million increased from $22.4 million in the prior-year period\n  * Adjusted EBITDA Margin* increased versus the prior-year period to 34%\n  * Total Written Premiums placed for the third quarter increased 28% over the prior-year period to $1.03 billion\n  * Policies in Force increased 12% from the prior-year period to approximately 1,636,000\n  * Corporate agent headcount of 458 was up 45% compared to the prior-year period\n  * Total franchise producers of 2,093 increased 4% from the prior-year period and 5% compared to second quarter 2024\n\n\n\n*Core Revenue, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of Core Revenue to total revenues, Adjusted EPS to basic earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth in the reconciliation table accompanying this release.\n\n“We delivered an outstanding third quarter result in the face of continued macro headwinds related to product availability and real estate as well as severe weather events which temporarily impacted production across several large states,” stated Mark Miller, President and CEO. “For the quarter, total revenue grew 10%, core revenue grew 16%, net income margin was 16% and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 34%, up from 32% in the year ago quarter. This marked the first time we have generated over $1 billion of premium in a single quarter, with 28% growth over the prior year, a great milestone for the company. We are seeing strong momentum in a number of our key performance indicators that we expect will drive future growth, including franchise productivity, total producer headcount and policy in force growth rates. We have also stabilized our client retention levels in the quarter at 84%, despite continued market challenges. I’m extremely pleased with the tremendous accomplishments of the organization over the past 2 years driven by our exceptional people and industry leading technology. We are well positioned for a strong finish to 2024 and faster growth in 2025 and beyond as we progress to our goal of being the largest distributor of personal lines in the US.”\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Results** For the third quarter of 2024, revenues were $78.0 million, an increase of 10% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Core Revenues, a non-GAAP measure which excludes contingent commissions, initial franchise fees, interest income, and other income, were $73.5 million, a 16% increase from $63.1 million in the prior-year period. Core Revenues are the most reliable revenue stream for the Company, consisting of New Business Commissions, Agency Fees, New Business Royalty Fees, Renewal Commissions, and Renewal Royalty Fees. Core Revenue growth was driven by improved franchise productivity, increased corporate agent headcount, client retention of 84%, and rising premium rates. The Company grew total written premiums, which we consider to be the leading indicator of future revenue growth, by 28% in the third quarter.\n\nTotal operating expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and impairment expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $51.9 million, up 7% from $48.6 million in the prior-year period. The increase from the prior period was due to increased employee compensation and benefits expenses related to investments in corporate producers, partnership, technology, and service functions. General and administrative expenses, excluding impairment, increased to $15.2 million from $14.8 million primarily due to investments in technology and systems to drive growth and continue to improve the client experience. Equity-based compensation increased to $7.1 million for the period, compared to $6.5 million a year ago. Bad debt expense of $0.6 million decreased from $0.8 million a year ago.\n\nNet income in the third quarter of 2024 was $12.6 million versus net income of $11.3 million a year ago. Earnings per share and Net Income Margin for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.31 and 16%, respectively. Adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2024, which excludes equity-based compensation and impairment expense, was $0.50 per share. Total Adjusted EBITDA was $26.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $22.4 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 34% increased compared to the prior-year period.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources** As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $47.5 million. We had an unused line of credit of $74.8 million as of September 30, 2024. Total outstanding term note payable balance was $95.6 million as of September 30, 2024. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of Class A common stock. As of September 30, 2024, $36.8 million remains available under the share repurchase authorization.\n\n**2024 Outlook** The Company is raising its guidance for full year 2024 as follows:\n\n  * Total written premiums placed for 2024 are expected to be between $3.70 billion and $3.82 billion, representing growth of 25% on the low end of the range to 29% on the high end of the range.\n  * Total revenues for 2024 are expected to be between $295 million and $310 million, representing growth of 13% on the low end of the range to 19% on the high end of the range.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA Margin is expected to expand for the full year 2024.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information** Goosehead will host a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 PM ET to discuss these results.\n\nTo access the call by phone, participants should go to this link ([registration link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=fPHe3aK_1Pt3CMafRBLYpjsK8Y-TB1HPeHnf9HSEGFxLGmjGVhZnH8LUO7dyE-b2-w8AC5N5ry2TWCkqWxfZ8ajKvYcRvhjF_AI7a4ojKt8osY8nb-YNp67R86Q-n7pwvoqCTOsohPg4AtUwNVaTtxp84HIf09TdKsY5URy7Dr7vsId_0W1_BnZG45F_mV4juMhd8V9jrotJ9ZmabcoojxWVZAJH_n7sDrc_KIPQt18Kgc_go8Xm_p26Dv9cGSQq3J6rOjfyZcdPXhbxHezxdcQqQfmOZbei1twEOW5fVl8mVm9CL-0wDGAni8Qe5iB5)), and you will be provided with the dial in details.\n\nIn addition, a live webcast of the conference call will also be available on Goosehead’s investor relations website at [http://ir.goosehead.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XlKVfQ5yyI2dfcnj9bjt9v3NiEAcIxGIjVl7C4wHHZFaEpNjzJugUhlsljtm0xFjxdZTNKxAh1WEGwb-JG6Rp25uanbH3QgwXmcN03Wj3gg=).\n\nA webcast replay of the call will be available at [http://ir.goosehead.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XlKVfQ5yyI2dfcnj9bjt9v3NiEAcIxGIjVl7C4wHHZEsJY8rvF3nEQN4drJlPlXY7LExQt31OG7OELxQOJmdLoo7sMY51v1G0moFezKCmRs=) for one year following the call.\n\n**About Goosehead**\n\nGoosehead (NASDAQ: GSHD) is a rapidly growing and innovative independent personal lines insurance agency that distributes its products and services through corporate and franchise locations throughout the United States.

Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EPS that are not required by, nor presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company refers to these measures as “non-GAAP financial measures.” The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating its performance and considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures, tax position, depreciation, amortization and certain other items that the Company believes are not representative of its core business. The Company uses Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, Ancillary Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EPS for business planning purposes and in measuring its performance relative to that of its competitors.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are defined by the Company as follows:\n\n  * \"Core Revenue\" is a supplemental measure of our performance and includes Renewal Commissions, Renewal Royalty Fees, New Business Commissions, New Business Royalty Fees, and Agency Fees. We believe that Core Revenue is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it summarizes all of our revenues from sales of individual insurance policies.\n  * \"Cost Recovery Revenue\" is a supplemental measure of our performance and includes Initial Franchise Fees and Interest Income. We believe that Cost Recovery Revenue is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it summarizes revenues that are viewed by management as cost recovery mechanisms.\n  * \"Ancillary Revenue\" is a supplemental measure of our performance and includes Contingent Commissions and Other Income. We believe that Ancillary Revenue is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it summarizes revenues that are ancillary to our core business.\n  * \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is a supplemental measure of the Company's performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of items that do not relate to business performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude equity-based compensation, impairment expense, and other non-operating items, including, among other things, certain non-cash charges and certain non-recurring or non-operating gains or losses.\n  * \"Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" is Adjusted EBITDA as defined above, divided by total revenue excluding other non-operating items. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is helpful in measuring profitability of operations on a consolidated level.\n  * \"Adjusted EPS\" is a supplemental measure of our performance, defined as earnings per share (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before non-recurring or non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted EPS is a useful measure to management because it eliminates the impact of items that do not relate to business performance and helps measure our profitability on a consolidated level.\n\n\n\nWhile the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating its business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for revenues, net income, or earnings per share, in each case as recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in the Company’s industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\nThe following tables show a reconciliation from total revenues to Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, and Ancillary Revenue (non-GAAP basis) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nTotal Revenues | $ | 78,035 | $ | 71,030 | $ | 220,583 | $ | 198,262  \nCore Revenue:  \nRenewal Commissions(1) | $ | 20,215 | $ | 19,036 | $ | 56,767 | $ | 53,395  \nRenewal Royalty Fees(2) | 38,070 | 30,040 | 103,951 | 80,344  \nNew Business Commissions(1) | 6,249 | 6,125 | 18,612 | 17,899  \nNew Business Royalty Fees(2) | 6,994 | 5,910 | 20,396 | 17,819  \nAgency Fees(1) | 1,989 | 2,008 | 6,036 | 6,642  \nTotal Core Revenue | 73,516 | 63,119 | 205,762 | 176,099  \nCost Recovery Revenue:  \nInitial Franchise Fees(2) | 1,413 | 2,430 | 5,288 | 8,780  \nInterest Income | 231 | 321 | 725 | 1,135  \nTotal Cost Recovery Revenue | 1,644 | 2,751 | 6,013 | 9,915  \nAncillary Revenue:  \nContingent Commissions(1) | 2,490 | 4,811 | 7,367 | 10,701  \nOther Franchise Revenues(2) | 385 | 349 | 1,440 | 1,547  \nTotal Ancillary Revenue | 2,875 | 5,160 | 8,808 | 12,248  \nTotal Revenues | $ | 78,035 | $ | 71,030 | $ | 220,583 | $ | 198,262  \n  \n(1) Renewal Commissions, New Business Commissions, Agency Fees, and Contingent Commissions are included in \"Commissions and agency fees\" as shown on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.(2) Renewal Royalty Fees, New Business Royalty Fees, Initial Franchise Fees, and Other Franchise Revenues are included in \"Franchise revenues\" as shown on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe following tables show a reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (non-GAAP basis) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** | **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet Income | $ | 12,607 | $ | 11,273 | $ | 25,291 | $ | 18,272  \nInterest expense | 2,060 | 1,617 | 5,529 | 5,057  \nDepreciation and amortization | 2,614 | 2,352 | 7,814 | 6,817  \nTax (benefit) expense | 2,315 | 724 | (3,272 | ) | 2,944  \nEquity-based compensation | 7,093 | 6,459 | 21,082 | 18,951  \nImpairment expense | — | — | 347 | 3,628  \nOther (income) expense | (544 | ) | — | 5,742 | —  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 26,145 | $ | 22,425 | $ | 62,533 | $ | 55,669  \nNet Income Margin(1) | 16 | % | 16 | % | 11 | % | 9 | %  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin(2) | 34 | % | 32 | % | 28 | % | 28 | %  \n  \n(1) Net Income Margin is calculated as Net Income divided by Total Revenue ($12,607/$78,035) and ($11,273/$71,030) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

(“Goosehead” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: GSHD), a rapidly growing independent personal lines insurance agency, today announced results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second** **Quarter****2024****Highlights**\n\n  * Total Revenues grew 13% over the prior-year period to $78.1 million in the second quarter of 2024\n  * Second quarter Core Revenues* of $73.4 million increased 20% over the prior-year period\n  * Second quarter net income of $10.9 million improved from net income of $7.2 million a year ago.\n  * EPS of $0.25 per share increased from $0.15 in the prior-year period, and adjusted EPS* of $0.43 per share increased 5% over the prior-year period\n  * Net Income Margin for the second quarter was 14%\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* of $24.7 million increased from $23.1 million in the prior-year period\n  * Adjusted EBITDA Margin* remained flat versus the prior-year period at 32%\n  * Total written premiums placed for the second quarter increased 30% over the prior-year period to $998.9 million\n  * Policies in force increased 11% from the prior-year period to approximately 1,588,000\n\n\n\n*Core Revenue, Adjusted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of Core Revenue to total revenues, Adjusted EPS to basic earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth in the reconciliation table accompanying this release.\n\n“Our excellent second quarter 2024 results reinforce our return to an accelerating profitable growth phase as total revenue was up 13%, core revenue grew 20%, premiums increased 30% and a significant number of new high-quality producers were added to both corporate and franchise networks during the quarter”, stated Mark Miller, President and CEO. “We are particularly pleased that new business productivity continues to trend well despite continued headwinds from product availability and housing. New business productivity per franchise increased 54% in the quarter, representing the 6th consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. Importantly, new business gains in the franchise network today will have more meaningful impact on revenue growth in 2025 as current new business converts to renewal revenue and we retain a larger portion of the economics. We were also very excited to repurchase over $63 million worth of Goosehead Class A shares since last quarter at what we view as highly attractive levels. Our strong balance sheet with conservative leverage, and our growing cash flow generation gives us multiple options to increase shareholder value. We believe our operations have never been stronger, and I am excited for our unmatched runway for substantial future growth in revenue and earnings. I want to thank our employees, franchises, and carrier partners for their tireless efforts that help us achieve these exceptional results.”\n\n**Second****Quarter****2024****Results**\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, revenues were $78.1 million, an increase of 13% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Core Revenues, a non-GAAP measure which excludes contingent commissions, initial franchise fees, interest income, and other income, were $73.4 million, a 20% increase from $61.0 million in the prior-year period. Core Revenues are the most reliable revenue stream for the Company, consisting of New Business Commissions, Agency Fees, New Business Royalty Fees, Renewal Commissions, and Renewal Royalty Fees. Core Revenue growth was driven by improved productivity, strong client retention of 84%, and rising premium rates. The Company grew total written premiums, which we consider to be the leading indicator of future revenue growth, by 30% in the second quarter.\n\nTotal operating expenses, excluding equity-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and impairment expenses for the second quarter of 2024 were $53.4 million, up 16% from $46.2 million in the prior-year period. The increase from the prior period was due to increased employee compensation and benefits expenses related to investments in corporate producers, partnership, technology, and service functions. Equity-based compensation increased to $6.6 million for the period, compared to $5.9 million a year ago. Bad debt expense of $0.7 million decreased from $0.9 million a year ago. The increase in General and administrative expenses, excluding impairment, is due to investments in technology and systems to drive growth and continue to improve the client experience.\n\nNet income in the second quarter of 2024 was $10.9 million versus net income of $7.2 million a year ago. Earnings per share and Net Income Margin for the second quarter of 2024 were $0.25 and 14%, respectively. Adjusted EPS for the second quarter of 2024, which excludes equity-based compensation and impairment expense, was $0.43 per share. Total Adjusted EBITDA was $24.7 million for the second quarter of 2024 compared to $23.1 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 32% remained flat compared to the prior-year period.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $23.6 million. We had an unused line of credit of $74.8 million as of June 30, 2024. Total outstanding term note payable balance was $98.1 million as of June 30, 2024. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company repurchased and retired 1.045 million shares at an average share price of $60.46. As of June 30, 2024, $36.8 million remains available under the share repurchase authorization.\n\n**2024****Outlook**\n\nThe Company is reiterating its guidance for full year 2024 as follows:\n\n  * Total written premiums placed for 2024 are expected to be between $3.62 billion and $3.82 billion, representing growth of 22% on the low end of the range to 29% on the high end of the range.\n  * Total revenues for 2024 are expected to be between $290 million and $310 million, representing growth of 11% on the low end of the range to 19% on the high end of the range.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA Margin is expected to expand for the full year 2024.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nGoosehead will host a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 PM ET to discuss these results.\n\nTo access the call by phone, participants should go to this link ([registration link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SKi7gbBPIOFPfph0kRPoE3601tht3wFfFIb5W9CsipdfVzLHhrMWGHYcZZytOmq6zL5sCkUxun3gWoPfwgAfLW8KElgdd1zLs5cA4zFGrscnrQ3E2wABxvDXWwkRwhMnSgKKcQQgnPetU8sp5icOOQfcZRYuf3kESmhL2od4iihBzqncImhobBRT_2l3o_YbyJM-QlgymSign3wYUedvUkhb8QZjEpBj1W0b7ZfK7-4e7GjlvO9eIfYgG3JPgBHfv1Yma0jU0Vweq_SyiHbHaTObBa16SxHtql8DMnJm93H8GVTwny560JWsjdQ3JB7w)), and you will be provided with the dial in details.\n\nIn addition, a live webcast of the conference call will also be available on Goosehead’s investor relations website at [http://ir.goosehead.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hPwQDx0xtA5pF0-KCULZCE5KbpZ2pxrbMn9EPOpaCu08hWCFohkVWgT0LmbyHRU7IFPpH0pvhj8nYk_KKlB3libAHA0WEnZ5hyA0Ng3QRzM=).\n\nA webcast replay of the call will be available at [http://ir.goosehead.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=hPwQDx0xtA5pF0-KCULZCE5KbpZ2pxrbMn9EPOpaCu246c5jQhhIdq4tgXExlQMZP3Gss-9z3l-jFtdFRnvp2idsTrQoDioaaMEUOGdRZWU=) for one year following the call.\n\n**About Goosehead**\n\nGoosehead (NASDAQ: GSHD) is a rapidly growing and innovative independent personal lines insurance agency that distributes its products and services through corporate and franchise locations throughout the United States.

\n**Goosehead Insurance, Inc.****Reconciliation Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP**\n\nThis release includes Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, Ancillary Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EPS that are not required by, nor presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company refers to these measures as “non-GAAP financial measures.” The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating its performance and considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful metrics for management and investors to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures, tax position, depreciation, amortization and certain other items that the Company believes are not representative of its core business. The Company uses Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, Ancillary Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Adjusted EPS for business planning purposes and in measuring its performance relative to that of its competitors.\n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are defined by the Company as follows:\n\n  * \"Core Revenue\" is a supplemental measure of our performance and includes Renewal Commissions, Renewal Royalty Fees, New Business Commissions, New Business Royalty Fees, and Agency Fees. We believe that Core Revenue is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it summarizes all of our revenues from sales of individual insurance policies.\n  * \"Cost Recovery Revenue\" is a supplemental measure of our performance and includes Initial Franchise Fees and Interest Income. We believe that Cost Recovery Revenue is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it summarizes revenues that are viewed by management as cost recovery mechanisms.\n  * \"Ancillary Revenue\" is a supplemental measure of our performance and includes Contingent Commissions and Other Income. We believe that Ancillary Revenue is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it summarizes revenues that are ancillary to our core business.\n  * \"Adjusted EBITDA\" is a supplemental measure of the Company's performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of items that do not relate to business performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude equity-based compensation and other non-operating items, including, among other things, certain non-cash charges and certain non-recurring or non-operating gains or losses.\n  * \"Adjusted EBITDA Margin\" is Adjusted EBITDA as defined above, divided by total revenue excluding other non-operating items. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is helpful in measuring profitability of operations on a consolidated level.\n  * \"Adjusted EPS\" is a supplemental measure of our performance, defined as earnings per share (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) before non-recurring or non-operating income and expenses. Adjusted EPS is a useful measure to management because it eliminates the impact of items that do not relate to business performance and helps measure our profitability on a consolidated level.\n\n\n\nWhile the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating its business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for revenues, net income, or earnings per share, in each case as recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in the Company’s industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\nThe following tables show a reconciliation from total revenues to Core Revenue, Cost Recovery Revenue, and Ancillary Revenue (non-GAAP basis) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30,** | **Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nTotal Revenues | $ | 78,088 | $ | 69,277 | $ | 142,548 | $ | 127,232  \nCore Revenue:  \nRenewal Commissions(1) | $ | 20,591 | $ | 18,541 | $ | 36,552 | $ | 34,359  \nRenewal Royalty Fees(2) | 36,828 | 27,552 | 65,881 | 50,304  \nNew Business Commissions(1) | 6,682 | 6,257 | 12,363 | 11,774  \nNew Business Royalty Fees(2) | 7,169 | 6,267 | 13,402 | 11,909  \nAgency Fees(1) | 2,137 | 2,404 | 4,048 | 4,634  \nTotal Core Revenue | 73,407 | 61,021 | 132,246 | 112,980  \nCost Recovery Revenue:  \nInitial Franchise Fees(2) | 1,631 | 3,287 | 3,875 | 6,350  \nInterest Income | 244 | 417 | 494 | 814  \nTotal Cost Recovery Revenue | 1,875 | 3,704 | 4,369 | 7,164  \nAncillary Revenue:  \nContingent Commissions(1) | 2,209 | 3,971 | 4,877 | 5,890  \nOther Franchise Revenues(2) | 598 | 581 | 1,055 | 1,198  \nTotal Ancillary Revenue | 2,807 | 4,552 | 5,933 | 7,088  \nTotal Revenues | $ | 78,088 | $ | 69,277 | $ | 142,548 | $ | 127,232  \n  \n(1) Renewal Commissions, New Business Commissions, Agency Fees, and Contingent Commissions are included in \"Commissions and agency fees\" as shown on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n(2) Renewal Royalty Fees, New Business Royalty Fees, Initial Franchise Fees, and Other Franchise Revenues are included in \"Franchise revenues\" as shown on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe following tables show a reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin (non-GAAP basis) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):\n\n**Three Months Ended June 30,** | **Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nNet Income | $ | 10,875 | $ | 7,180 | $ | 12,684 | $ | 6,999  \nInterest expense | 1,982 | 1,709 | 3,469 | 3,440  \nDepreciation and amortization | 2,632 | 2,372 | 5,200 | 4,465  \nTax (benefit) expense | 2,981 | 2,301 | (5,587 | ) | 2,220  \nEquity-based compensation | 6,632 | 5,872 | 13,989 | 12,492  \nImpairment expense | — | 3,628 | 347 | 3,628  \nOther (income) expense | (441 | ) | — | 6,286 | —  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $ | 24,661 | $ | 23,062 | $ | 36,388 | $ | 33,244  \nNet Income Margin(1) | 14 | % | 10 | % | 9 | % | 6 | %  \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin(2) | 32 | % | 33 | % | 26 | % | 26 | %  \n  \n(1) Net Income Margin is calculated as Net Income divided by Total Revenue ($10,875/$78,088) and ($7,180/$69,277) for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.
