Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nNovember 13, 2024 at 4:01 PM EST\n\n[PDF Version](/node/7866/pdf)\n\nCULVER CITY, Calif., Nov. 13, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Snail, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNAL) (“Snail” or “the Company”), a leading, global independent developer and publisher of interactive digital entertainment, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\nTony Tian, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Snail, commented, “Since taking over as Co-CEO of Snail in April, we’ve continued to see a transformation in the business, guided by the extraordinary talent and vision of our dedicated team. Snail is committed to pushing the boundaries of interactive entertainment, and we are thrilled with the successes seen across our titles and DLCs this quarter, including _Aberration_ , part two of _Bobs Tall Tales_ and the _Ark_ franchise. We remain focused on delivering innovative gaming experiences that exceed our fans’ expectations around the globe, staying true to the creative spirit that has defined our company's remarkable journey.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Operational Highlights:**\n\n  * **_ARK: Survival Ascended_****and**** _Ark: Survival Evolved_**\n    * On October 25, 2023, the Company launched its flagship remake of the _ARK_ franchise leveraging Unreal Engine 5's stunning graphics and introduced a game-altering cross-platform modding system, ushering in a new era of creativity.\n    * In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 0.4 million units and 1.3 million units of _ARK: Survival Ascended_ , respectively.\n    * In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, _ARK: Survival Evolved_ and _ARK: Survival Ascended_ combined for an average total of 210,000 and 212,000 daily active users on the Steam and Epic platforms, respectively.\n    * Through September 30, 2024, the Company’s _ARK_ franchise game has been played for 3.8 billion hours with an average playing time per user of 162 hours and with the top 21.2% of all players spending over 100 hours in the game, according to data from the Steam platform.\n\n\n  * **_Product and Business Updates:_**\n    * **_ARK: Ultimate Survivor Edition._** On July 16, 2024, the Company announced the expansive adaptation of the acclaimed ARK franchise into iOS and Android mobile devices.\n    * **Wandering Wizard** , an indie branch of the Company, strategically acquired the publishing rights to four new games since the second quarter of 2024. The games, _The Cecil_ , _Chasmal Fear_ , _Castle of Secrets_ , and _Stoneguard_ , are still under development.\n    * **_For The Stars._** On August 15, 2024, the Company officially announced a new AAA title _For The Stars_ , a space-themed survival sandbox MMO game set to launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.\n    * **_Honeycomb: The World Beyond._** Snail acquired the publishing rights to the upcoming sci-fi survival adventure game in the third quarter of 2024, further enhancing our sandbox survival content portfolio.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights:**\n\n  * **Net revenue** for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $22.5 million, an increase of $13.5 million, or 150.9%, compared to $9.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net revenue was due to the recognition of $8.2 million in revenue from the release of _Aberration_ and part II of _Bobs Tall Tales_ , an increase in total _Ark_ sales of $5.9 million, an increase in _Bellwright_ sales of $1.0 million, $1.2 million recognized for meeting the performance obligations of releasing _Genesis II_ and _Myth of Empires_ on certain platforms, partially offset by a decrease in _Ark Mobile_ sales of $0.3 million, and an increase in deferred revenues of $2.6 million related to sales of _ARK: Survival Ascended_ and _Bobs Tall Tales_ DLC’s which have not yet been released.\n  * **Net income** for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased significantly to $0.2 million versus a net _loss_ of $4.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of the increase in net revenue driven by the release of new titles.\n  * **Bookings** for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $16.1 million as compared to $10.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of $5.6 million, or 53.6%. The increase was primarily due to the release of _ARK: Survival Ascended_ in the fourth quarter of 2023, the releases of _Bobs Tall Tales_ and _Bellwright_ in the first half of 2024, as well as the _ARK: Survival Ascended_ DLC’s _Aberration_ and _Scorched Earth_ in September and April of 2024, respectively.\n  * **Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA** ”) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $0.5 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $5.1 million in the prior year period. The $5.6 million, or 109.7%, increase in EBITDA was due to an increase in net income of $4.6 million and a decrease in the benefit from income taxes of $1.4 million, that was partially offset by a decrease in interest expenses of $0.3 million.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, unrestricted cash was $10.6 million and the Company has repaid $3.0 million of its revolving loan, $2.3 million in notes payable, and $0.8 million of its convertible notes that were outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nIn addition to the financial results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Snail believes EBITDA, as non-GAAP measure, and Bookings, as an operating metric, are useful in evaluating its operating performance. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is presented as a supplemental disclosure to net income (loss) and should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss) or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity, as determined in accordance with GAAP. Snail supplementally presents Bookings and EBITDA because they are key operating measures used by management to assess financial performance. Bookings adjusts for the impact of deferrals and, Snail believes, provides a useful indicator of sales in a given period. EBITDA adjusts for items that Snail believes do not reflect the ongoing operating performance of its business, such as certain non-cash items, unusual or infrequent items or items that change from period to period without any material relevance to its operating performance. Management believes Bookings and EBITDA are useful to investors and analysts in highlighting trends in Snail’s operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which Snail operates and capital investments.\n\nBookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or physically in the period. Bookings is equal to revenues, excluding the impact from deferrals. Below is a reconciliation of total net revenue to Bookings, the closest GAAP financial measure.\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**(in millions)**  \nTotal net revenue| $| 22.5| $| 9.0| $| 58.3| $| 32.3  \nChange in deferred net revenue| (6.4| )| 1.5| 0.4| 0.8  \nBookings| $| 16.1| $| 10.5| $| 58.7| $| 33.1  \n  \nWe define EBITDA as net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, (ii) interest income, (iii) income tax provision (benefit from) and (iv) depreciation and amortization expense.
