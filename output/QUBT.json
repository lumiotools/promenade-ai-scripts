Reports Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**HOBOKEN, NJ – November 6, 2024** – [_Quantum Computing Inc_](https://www.quantumcomputinginc.com/) _._ (“QCi” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: QUBT), an innovative, integrated photonics and quantum optics technology company, today released financial results for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024.\n\nDr William McGann, Chief Executive Officer of QCi, commented, “Throughout the third quarter of 2024, we continued to make strategic progress across multiple fronts. Our ongoing development of our U.S.-based Thin Film Lithium Niobate (TFLN) foundry in Tempe remains on schedule and we are in the final stage of commissioning, marking a critical step toward scaling our capabilities and expanding into new markets. Our recent sales efforts, led by new leadership, have begun to translate into tangible results as we progress on securing offtake agreements for our chips and orders for our machines. We are excited by the interest we’ve seen from potential partners and customers, and we look forward to delivering on the promise of high-performance photonics technology in early 2025. I remain confident in our team’s ability to execute on our vision of delivering accessible, affordable, and scalable quantum solutions, and I am excited about the opportunities ahead.”\n\n** _Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights_**\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 revenues totaled approximately $101,000 (9% gross margin) compared to $50,000 (52% gross margin) generated in the third quarter 2023. The increase in revenues and decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of progress executing our contract with Johns Hopkins University to deliver a customized quantum LiDAR prototype.\n\n  * Third quarter 2024 operating expenses totaled $5.4 million compared to the previous year’s second quarter operating expenses of $6.6 million. The 18% period-over-period decrease is primarily a result of the Company’s disciplined strategy to minimize general and administrative expenses, including reductions in both employee and consultant costs.\n\n  * The Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $5.7 million, or $(0.06) per basic share for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $7.1 million or $(0.10) per basic share for the same period of the previous year.\n\n  * Total assets at September 30, 2024 were $76.8 million, increasing from $74.4 million at December 31, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 increased by $1.0 million to $3.1 million from year-end 2023. During the third quarter, the Company raised net proceeds of $7.0 million in a secured convertible debt financing.\n\n  * Total liabilities at September 30, 2024 were $10.9 million, an increase of approximately $5.3 million compared to year-end 2023, driven primarily by the Company’s aforementioned secured convertible debt financing, offset by repayment of the Company’s unsecured debt financing in the first quarter 2024.\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company had shareholders’ equity totaling $60.4 million.\n\n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Operational Highlights_**\n\n  *  _Extension of CRADA with Los Alamos National Laboratory:_ QCi renewed its Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) to further explore the capabilities of the Dirac-3 quantum optimization machine. This extension will support the development of advanced quantum solutions in fields such as energy grid management, social networks, and telecommunications.\n\n  * _Progress on TFLN Chip Foundry:_ QCi advanced to the final phase of commissioning its U.S.-based TFLN foundry in Tempe, Arizona. The facility remains on track to begin production in early 2025, positioning QCi as a leader in the high-performance, TFLN-based optical chip market.\n\n  * _Key Industry Engagements:_ QCi actively participated in major industry events, including the Quantum World Congress 2024 and Quantum.Tech Europe, where the Company presented the capabilities of its Dirac-3 platform and began initial conversations on its planned foundry services. These engagements raised the profile of QCi's technology among key government and commercial stakeholders, driving further interest and partnerships.\n\n  * _Continued Development of Entropy Quantum Computing Solutions:_ The Company’s Dirac-3 platform continued to gain traction, with benchmark studies conducted in collaboration with National Laboratories such as Oak Ridge and Lawrence Berkeley to demonstrate its efficiency in solving complex computational problems.\n\n  * _Progress with NASA:_ Subsequent to the end of the quarter, QCi secured a fifth task order with NASA, focused on developing quantum remote sensing technology for spaceborne LiDAR missions. This contract aims to reduce the cost of climate-monitoring missions and enhance data collection capabilities, reinforcing QCi’s strategic partnership with NASA.\n\n\n\n\n**_Earnings Conference Call_**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call on Wednesday, November 6, 2024, at 4:30 p.m., to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024.

In September, QCi attended key conferences such as Quantum World Congress 2024 (QWC) and Quantum.Tech Europe, as well as delivered multiple presentations, significantly raising the profile of the Dirac-3 and its capabilities among government and commercial customers. \n\nAdditionally, our Quantum Technology Lead, Lac Nguyen, has been dedicated to delivering solutions to critical industry problems that are recognized as true quantum benchmarks by the National Laboratories and other prominent commercial entities. This effort reflects a collaborative, team-first approach across the Company and with our government relations and marketing team at A10 Associates. Together, the team continues to raise the profile of QCi as a leading company in photonics and non-linear quantum optics. \n\nThe commercial activities surrounding our new TFLN foundry services also have shown progress. Our Director of PIC and Foundry Services, Pouya Dianat, has led this effort with great passion and the results are building momentum towards securing preorders for our TFLN electro-optical modulators chips. Notably, we have signed a letter of intent with Comtech Telecommunications, a leading satellite and terrestrial communications company, for the purchase of TFLN optical chips upon availability. In just a year, QCi has built a core team who has been effectively driving this technology to the finish line at the Company’s TFLN fabrication facility in Tempe, Arizona, setting the stage for growth and revenue in 2025 as the foundry services come online.\n\nWhile these commercial efforts have been at the forefront in recent months, much more is happening at QCi. Our reservoir computing device, EmuCore, is gaining considerable traction in the marketplace with exciting engagements in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, particularly for applications in neuropathology and in the financial market prediction arena. Our Quantum Technology Lead, Jeeva Ramanathan and Quantum Engineer, Malvika Garikapati also have maintained a steady and growing effort in our quantum sensing efforts with NASA and other U.S. government opportunities. \n\nNone of this progress happens without focused teamwork. It is inspiring to see a truly collaborative business team emerge as we grow, with our Chief Technology Officer, Yong Meng Sua, effectively serving as a strong proxy for the Company’s executive team at our headquarters and lab in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nFinally, I want to highlight the tremendous efforts of the business team led by QCi’s Chief Financial Officer, Chris Boehmler, in regaining SEC and NASDAQ compliance, including appointing a new auditor, BPM LLP, completing a reaudit of our accounts from the past two years, and reviewing our financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2024. I am pleased to announce that with the filing of our first and second quarter financial results on October 2, we have taken key steps to regain compliance with Nasdaq and are now caught up with our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements. This has been an immense undertaking, led by Chris with the support of our Staff Accountant Kayla Resco, our General Counsel Chris Roberts, and our investor relations team at IMS. \n\nI want to personally thank every person working at QCi for their dedication and passion. I am proud to be a part of this team, and I am confident that we will continue to achieve great things together.\n\n**- Bill**\n\n** _“Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed”… (Antoine Lavoisier, French chemist and 'Father of Modern Chemistry')_**\n\n[Previous page](/news/blogs/from-the-desk-of-the-ceo-october-2024-message)\n\n[Next page](/news/blogs/from-the-desk-of-the-ceo-august-2024-message)\n"
