Diluted net income per common share was $1.41, up $0.09 or 6.82% from the prior year's third quarter of $1.32. \n  * Cash dividend of $0.36 cents per common share for the quarter was approved, up 12.50% from the cash dividend declared a year ago. \n  * Tax-equivalent net interest income was $75.63 million, up $1.44 million or 1.94% from the second quarter of 2024 and up $6.22 million, or 8.97% from the third quarter a year ago. Tax-equivalent net interest margin was 3.64%, up five basis points from the previous quarter and up 18 basis points from the third quarter a year ago. \n  * Net charge-offs of $0.85 million or 0.05% of average loans and leases occurred during the quarter compared to net recoveries of $1.99 million or 0.12% of average loans and leases during the previous quarter.\n\n\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana--(Newsfile Corp. - October 24, 2024) - 1st Source Corporation (NASDAQ: SRCE), parent company of 1st Source Bank, today reported quarterly net income of $34.94 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $36.79 million the previous quarter and up 6.07% from the $32.94 million reported in the third quarter a year ago. Year-to-date 2024 net income was $101.19 million, up 4.86% compared to $96.50 million during the first nine months of 2023. Diluted net income per common share for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.41, down 5.37% compared to $1.49 in the previous quarter and up 6.82%, versus $1.32 in the third quarter of 2023. Diluted net income per common share for the first nine months of 2024 was $4.09, up 5.68% compared to $3.87 a year earlier.\n\nAt its October 2024 meeting, the Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.36 cents per common share, up 12.50% from the cash dividend declared a year ago. The cash dividend is payable to shareholders of record on November 5, 2024, and will be paid on November 15, 2024.\n\nChristopher J. Murphy III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We are pleased with our increase in revenue and net interest margin expansion compared to the previous quarter. Disciplined loan and lease pricing lead to a five basis point improvement from the prior quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion despite persistent deposit rate competition as the Federal Reserve raised rates or held them steady over that period. They have recently begun to lower rates.\n\n\"While still very good, credit was challenged in the quarter with elevated net charge-offs, the majority of which were from one business account. Nonperforming assets to loans and leases at September 30, 2024, was 0.47%, up from 0.31% at June 30, 2024, and the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases remained strong at 2.30% up from 2.26% the previous quarter.\n\n\"We were very pleased to learn during the third quarter that 1st Source Bank won several accolades. We made _Forbes_ ' America's Best-in-State Employers list, which was created by surveying more than 160,000 employees working for companies that had at least 500 employees in the United States. Also, 1st Source Bank's Specialty Finance Group was included in _Monitor_ 's Best Companies in Equipment Finance in the Leadership category. Great leadership was defined for this award to include attributes such as accessibility, transparency, communication, and collaboration - an apt description of our Bank leadership team.\n\n\"Another welcome honor was when two of our board members along with myself, were named to the Indiana 250 list by IBJ Media. Isaac Torres and Tracy Graham were both included in the list which identifies the state's most influential community and business leaders. We are thrilled to have both Isaac and Tracy's experience and leadership on our Board of Directors. Finally, we once again made the Piper Sandler Sm-All Stars list in the Class of 2024. This list identifies the top performing small-cap banks and thrifts in the U.S. These honors speak directly to our values and mission in the ways that we deliver both for our clients and colleagues - helping them achieve security, build wealth, and realize their dreams.\" Mr. Murphy concluded.\n\n**THIRD QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\n**Loans**\n\nThird quarter average loans and leases were $6.61 billion, which was flat compared to the previous quarter, and increased $359.79 million, up 5.76% from the third quarter a year ago. Year-to-date average loans and leases increased $430.26 million to $6.57 billion, up 7.01% from the first nine months of 2023.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nThird quarter average deposits were $7.13 billion, which was down $49.25 million, or 0.69%, from the previous quarter, and up $184.32 million or 2.65% compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Average deposits for the first nine months of 2024 were $7.11 billion, an increase of $190.13 million, up 2.75% from the same period a year ago. Average deposit balances declined from the previous quarter primarily due to expected seasonal public fund outflows and lower brokered deposit balances. Average deposit balance growth from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily in savings, time, and brokered deposits.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nThird quarter 2024 tax-equivalent net interest income increased $1.44 million to $75.63 million, up 1.94% from the previous quarter and increased $6.22 million, up 8.97% from the third quarter a year ago. For the first nine months of 2024, tax equivalent net interest income increased $14.00 million to $221.89 million, up 6.73% from the first nine months of 2023.\n\nThird quarter 2024 net interest margin was 3.63%, an increase of four basis points from the 3.59% in the previous quarter and an increase of 18 basis points from the same period in 2023. On a fully tax-equivalent basis, third quarter 2024 net interest margin was 3.64%, up five basis points compared to the 3.59% in the previous quarter, and an increase of 18 basis points from the same period in 2023. The five basis point increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to higher rates on loan balances and less reliance on higher costing short-term borrowings.\n\nNet interest margin for the first nine months of 2024 was 3.58%, an increase of eight basis points compared to the first nine months of 2023. Net interest margin on a fully-tax equivalent basis for the first nine months of 2024 was 3.59%, an increase of eight basis points compared to the first nine months of the prior year.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nThird quarter 2024 noninterest income of $22.45 million was down $0.77 million, or 3.33% from the previous quarter, and decreased $2.01 million, down 8.21% compared to the third quarter a year ago. For the first nine months of 2024, noninterest income was $67.83 million, a decrease of $2.72 million, down 3.86% from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe decrease in noninterest income compared to the previous quarter was mainly due to lower trust and wealth advisory income from seasonal tax preparation fees during the second quarter, a decline in mortgage banking income from lower sales volumes, a decrease in partnership investment gains, lower interest rate swaps fees, and a reduction in equipment rental income as demand for leases declined. These decreases were offset by increased bank owned life insurance policy claims recognized.\n\nThe decrease in noninterest income compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 was primarily due to fewer gains on the sale of renewable energy tax equity investments, reduced equipment rental income as demand for leases declined, lower contingent insurance commissions received, a decline in bank owned life insurance policy claims recognized, and less interest rate swap fees. These declines were offset by higher trust and wealth advisory income due to improvements in overall market performance and increased mortgage banking income from higher sales volumes and margins.\n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nThird quarter 2024 noninterest expense of $49.44 million was flat compared to the prior quarter and decreased $0.72 million or 1.44% from the third quarter a year ago. For the first nine months of 2024, noninterest expense was $148.52 million, down slightly from the same period a year ago.\n\nTotal noninterest income was flat compared to the previous quarter. Increases were the result of higher employee benefit costs from increased group insurance claims and higher incentive compensation. These increases were offset by a decrease in the provision for unfunded loan commitments due to higher loan fundings and higher gains on the sale of fixed assets.\n\nThe decrease in noninterest expense compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, was the result of a decrease in the loan loss provision for unfunded commitments due to higher loan fundings, lower leased equipment depreciation, reduced group insurance claims, and higher gains on the sale of fixed assets. These decreases were offset by higher salaries and wages from normal merit increases, the impact of wage inflation and an increase in the number of employees filling prior open positions, increased data processing costs from technology projects, and an increase in professional fees as a result of a $1.08 million reversal of accrued legal fees during the first quarter of 2023.\n\n**Credit**\n\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses increased to $152.32 million as of September 30, 2024, or 2.30% of total loans and leases. This percentage compared to 2.26% at June 30, 2024, and 2.27% at September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs of $0.85 million were recorded for the third quarter of 2024, compared with net recoveries of $1.99 million in the prior quarter and net charge-offs of $0.33 million in the same quarter a year ago. The majority of the third quarter's charge-offs related to one account in the commercial and agricultural portfolio.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $3.11 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $3.05 million from the previous quarter and an increase of $2.25 million compared with the same period in 2023. Net charge-offs and higher special attention outstandings compared to net recoveries in the previous quarter were the primary reasons for the increase in the provision for credit losses during the quarter, along with a change in quantitative assumptions during the quarter regarding the treatment of renewals for loans in special attention. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and leases was 0.47% as of September 30, 2024, compared to 0.31% on June 30, 2024, and 0.27% on September 30, 2023.\n\n**Capital**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the common equity-to-assets ratio was 12.60%, compared to 11.75% at June 30, 2024, and 10.84% a year ago. The tangible common equity-to-tangible assets ratio was 11.76% at September 30, 2024, compared to 10.91% at June 30, 2024, and 9.96% a year earlier. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, calculated under banking regulatory guidelines, was 14.18% at September 30, 2024, compared to 13.74% at June 30, 2024, and 13.31% a year ago. Capital accretion over the last twelve months has been driven primarily by growth in retained earnings and a reduction in unrealized losses in our short-duration investment securities available-for-sale portfolio.\n\nNo shares were repurchased for treasury during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**ABOUT 1ST SOURCE CORPORATION**\n\n1st Source common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under \"SRCE\" and appears in the National Market System tables in many daily newspapers under the code name \"1st Src.\" Since 1863, 1st Source has been committed to the success of its clients, individuals, businesses and the communities it serves.

Readers are advised that various important factors could cause 1st Source's actual results or circumstances for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in such forward-looking statements. Such factors, among others, include changes in laws, regulations or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; 1st Source's competitive position within its markets served; increasing consolidation within the banking industry; unforeseen changes in interest rates; unforeseen downturns in the local, regional or national economies or in the industries in which 1st Source has credit concentrations; and other risks discussed in 1st Source's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, which filings are available from the SEC. 1st Source undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nThe accounting and reporting policies of 1st Source conform to generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company's performance. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a financial institution, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), net interest margin (including its individual components), the efficiency ratio, tangible common equity-to-tangible assets ratio and tangible book value per common share. Management believes that these measures provide users of the Company's financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company's operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures differently.\n\nManagement reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent (\"FTE\") basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a FTE basis is also used in the calculation of the Company's efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses and lease depreciation), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses and lease depreciation are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity-to-tangible assets ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company's equity.\n\nSee the table marked \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company with their most closely related GAAP measures.\n\nCategory: Earnings\n\n# # #\n\n(charts attached)\n\n**1st SOURCE CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**3rd QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**  \n_(Unaudited -

Year-to-date 2024 net income was $66.25 million compared to $63.56 million during the first six months of 2023. Diluted net income per common share for the second quarter of 2024 was $1.49, up $0.30 or 25.21% from the previous quarter and up 14.62%, versus $1.30 in the second quarter of 2023. Diluted net income per common share for the first half of 2024 was $2.68 compared to $2.55 a year earlier.\n\nAt its July 2024 meeting, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the cash dividend of two cents per share, raising the approved dividend for the quarter to $0.36 per common share, up 12.50% from the cash dividend declared a year ago. The cash dividend is payable to shareholders of record on August 5, 2024, and will be paid on August 15, 2024.\n\nChristopher J. Murphy III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"We are very pleased to have achieved record quarterly earnings during the second quarter. Average loans and leases grew $102.14 million, up 1.57%, and average deposits increased $172.53 million, or 2.46% compared to the previous quarter. Disciplined loan and lease pricing led to an improvement in our net interest margin of five basis points from the prior quarter. This marks the third consecutive quarter of margin expansion despite persistent deposit rate competition. We were also helped by net recoveries of $1.99 million during the quarter. Nonperforming assets to loans and leases at June 30, 2024, was 0.31%, down from 0.34% at March 31, 2024, and the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases remained strong and unchanged from the previous quarter at 2.26%. Additionally, our liquidity and capital positions remained strong.\n\n\"During the quarter, we were excited to learn that 1st Source was named by _Forbes_ ' as one of America's Best Banks! We ranked #14 on the list and the only bank in Indiana to be in the top 15. This award is a proof point that we are holding true to our long-standing commitment of helping our clients achieve security, build wealth, and realize their dreams by building a fortress-like balance sheet and quality, sustainable earnings to help us better serve them!\n\n\"The proof points continued to roll in this quarter as we also were named to the _Forbes_ ' Best in State Banks and Best Employers for New Grads lists. Finally, _US News & World Report_ recently announced that 1st Source Bank was named a \"Best Company to Work For\" in the Midwest. It is an honor to receive this blend of awards because it emphasizes our stability as a bank not only financially, but also culturally.\n\n\"We strive to provide our colleagues with an engaging work environment that upholds our core values of integrity, teamwork, and superior quality paired with outstanding client service and community leadership. In keeping with our commitment to our community, we have remodeled both our Dunlap and our Bristol Street Banking Centers to feature our side-by-side banking model. This experience invites clients behind the teller line, allowing for clients and bankers to have a more transparent and inclusive relationship,\" Mr. Murphy concluded.\n\n**SECOND QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\n**Loans**\n\nSecond quarter average loans and leases increased $102.14 million to $6.61 billion, up 1.57% from the previous quarter and increased $465.05 million, up 7.57% from the second quarter a year ago. Year-to-date average loans and leases increased $466.17 million to $6.56 billion, up 7.66% from the first six months of 2023. Growth during the quarter occurred primarily within the Construction Equipment, Renewable Energy and Auto and Light Truck portfolios.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nAverage deposits of $7.18 billion, increased $172.57 million, or 2.46% from the previous quarter, and grew $244.60 million or 3.52% compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Average deposits for the first six months of 2024 were $7.10 billion, an increase of $193.15 million, up 2.80% from the same period a year ago. Average deposit balance growth from the previous quarter was primarily due to expected seasonal public fund deposit inflows. Average deposit balance growth from the second quarter of 2023 was primarily in savings, time, and brokered deposits.\n\nEnd of period deposits were $7.20 billion at June 30, 2024, compared to $7.06 billion at March 31, 2024. Balances were higher mainly due to increased public fund deposits and time deposits, offset by decreased noninterest bearing deposits and brokered deposits. Rate competition for deposits persisted during the quarter from various areas including traditional bank and credit union competitors, money market funds, bond markets, and other non-bank alternatives.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nSecond quarter 2024 tax-equivalent net interest income increased $2.13 million to $74.19 million, up 2.96% from the previous quarter and increased $5.50 million, up 8.00% from the second quarter a year ago. For the first six months of 2024, tax equivalent net interest income increased $7.77 million to $146.26 million, up 5.61% from the first half of 2023.\n\nSecond quarter 2024 net interest margin was 3.59%, an increase of five basis points from the 3.54% in the previous quarter and an increase of 12 basis points from the same period in 2023. On a fully tax-equivalent basis, second quarter 2024 net interest margin was 3.59%, up by five basis points compared to the 3.54% in the previous quarter, and an increase of 11 basis points from the same period in 2023. The five basis point increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to higher rates on loan and lease balances and less reliance on higher costing short-term borrowings.\n\nNet interest margin for the first six months of 2024 was 3.56%, an increase of three basis points compared to the first six months of 2023. Net interest margin on a fully-tax equivalent basis for the first half of 2024 was 3.57%, an increase of three basis points compared to the first half of the prior year.\n\n**Noninterest Income**\n\nSecond quarter 2024 noninterest income of $23.22 million increased $1.07 million, up 4.81% from the previous quarter, and was up modestly compared to the second quarter a year ago. For the first six months of 2024, noninterest income decreased slightly from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe increase in noninterest income compared to the previous quarter was mainly due to higher trust and wealth advisory income primarily from seasonal tax preparation fee income and improvements in overall investment market performance. Additionally, increased debit card income, and a rise in mortgage banking income from higher sales volumes were offset by lower equipment rental income due to a change in customer preferences and continued competitive pricing pressure for new business.\n\n**Noninterest Expense**\n\nSecond quarter 2024 noninterest expense of $49.49 million was relatively flat compared to the prior quarter and increased slightly from the second quarter a year ago. For the first six months of 2024, noninterest expense was $99.08 million, up marginally from the same period a year ago.\n\nThe increase in noninterest expense compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2023 was the result of higher salaries and wages from normal merit increases, the impact of wage inflation and an increase in the number of employees filling prior open positions and a $1.08 million reversal of accrued legal fees during the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, increased data processing costs from technology projects, higher blanket bond insurance premium costs, as well as an increase in business development and marketing expenses, added to the increase. These increases were offset by reduced group insurance claims, lower leased equipment depreciation, a decrease in the loan loss provision for unfunded commitments and gains on the sale of leased equipment.\n\n**Credit**\n\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses of $150.07 million as of June 30, 2024, was 2.26% of total loans and leases. This percentage compared to 2.26% at March 31, 2024, and 2.31% at June 30, 2023. Net recoveries of $1.99 million were recorded for the second quarter of 2024, compared with $6.12 million of net charge-offs in the prior quarter and net recoveries of $0.98 million in the same quarter a year ago. The majority of the second quarter's recoveries were related to activity in our Construction, Auto and Light Truck and Aircraft portfolios.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $0.06 million for the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of $6.54 million from the previous quarter and an increase of $0.01 million compared with the same period in 2023. Net recoveries recorded during the quarter, compared to net charge-offs in the previous quarter, were the primary reason for the decrease in the provision for credit losses. The provision for credit losses during the quarter was driven by modest loan growth, an increase in specific impairments, and overall higher special attention outstandings, offset by a decrease in aircraft portfolio loan balances which carry a higher allowance due to historical risk volatility. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and leases was 0.31% as of June 30, 2024, compared to 0.34% on March 31, 2024, and 0.33% on June 30, 2023.\n\n**Capital**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the common equity-to-assets ratio was 11.75%, compared to 11.65% at March 31, 2024, and 10.95% a year ago. The tangible common equity-to-tangible assets ratio was 10.91% at June 30, 2024, compared to 10.79% at March 31, 2024, and 10.05% a year earlier. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, calculated under banking regulatory guidelines was 13.74% at June 30, 2024 compared to 13.48% at March 31, 2024 and 13.59% a year ago. \n\nCapital accretion over the last twelve months has been driven primarily by growth in retained earnings and a reduction in unrealized losses in our short-duration investment securities available-for-sale portfolio.\n\nNo shares were repurchased for treasury during the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**ABOUT 1ST SOURCE CORPORATION**\n\n1st Source common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under \"SRCE\" and appears in the National Market System tables in many daily newspapers under the code name \"1st Src.\" Since 1863, 1st Source has been committed to the success of its clients, individuals, businesses and the communities it serves.

Readers are advised that various important factors could cause 1st Source's actual results or circumstances for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in such forward-looking statements. Such factors, among others, include changes in laws, regulations or accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; 1st Source's competitive position within its markets served; increasing consolidation within the banking industry; unforeseen changes in interest rates; unforeseen downturns in the local, regional or national economies or in the industries in which 1st Source has credit concentrations; and other risks discussed in 1st Source's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, which filings are available from the SEC. 1st Source undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nThe accounting and reporting policies of 1st Source conform to generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company's performance. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a financial institution, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), net interest margin (including its individual components), the efficiency ratio, tangible common equity-to-tangible assets ratio and tangible book value per common share. Management believes that these measures provide users of the Company's financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company's operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures differently.\n\nManagement reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent (\"FTE\") basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a FTE basis is also used in the calculation of the Company's efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses and lease depreciation), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses and lease depreciation are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity-to-tangible assets ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company's equity.\n\nSee the table marked \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company with their most closely related GAAP measures.\n\n# # #\n\nCategory: Earnings\n\n(charts attached)\n\n**1st SOURCE CORPORATION**  \n---  \n**2nd QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**  \n_(Unaudited -

This award is another proof point of our efforts to empower our employees with a workplace where they can thrive.\"\n\nAccording to _U.S. News & World Report_, the ratings were created by analyzing employee perceptions of six factors that are important to employee wellbeing. These included: quality of pay and benefits, work/life balance and flexibility, job and company stability, physical and psychological comfort (safety), career opportunities and professional development, and belongingness and esteem.\n\n[![Cannot view this image?

These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to the rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial\nstatements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have been omitted.\nThe Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in 1st Source Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-K (2023 Annual\nReport), which include descriptions of significant accounting policies, should be read in conjunction with these interim financial\nstatements. The Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at December 31, 2023, has been derived from the audited financial\nstatements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.\nCertain amounts in the prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period\npresentation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements – Financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP require the\nCompany to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nLoans and Leases – Loans are stated at the principal amount outstanding, net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs\nand net of unearned income. Interest income is accrued as earned based on unpaid principal balances. Origination fees and direct loan\nand lease origination costs are deferred, and the net amount amortized to interest income over the estimated life of the related loan or\nlease. Loan commitment fees are deferred and amortized into other income over the commitment period.\nDirect financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased property, net of\nunamortized deferred lease origination fees and costs and unearned income. Only those costs incurred as a direct result of closing a\nlease transaction are capitalized and all other initial direct costs are expensed immediately. Interest income on direct financing leases is\nrecognized over the term of the lease to achieve a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding investment.\nAccrued interest is included in Accrued Income and Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and is\nexcluded from the calculation of the allowance for credit losses. The accrual of interest on loans and leases is discontinued when a loan\nor lease becomes contractually delinquent for 90 days, or when an individual analysis of a borrower’s credit worthiness indicates a\ncredit should be placed on nonperforming status, except for residential mortgage loans and consumer loans that are well secured and in\nthe process of collection. Residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual at the time the loan is placed in foreclosure. When\ninterest accruals are discontinued, interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and interest accrued in the prior year is\ncharged to the allowance for loan and lease losses. However, in some cases, the Company may elect to continue the accrual of interest\nwhen the net realizable value of collateral is sufficient to cover the principal and accrued interest. When a loan or lease is classified as\nnonaccrual and the future collectability of the recorded loan or lease balance is doubtful, collections on interest and principal are\napplied as a reduction to principal outstanding. Loans are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts\ncontractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured, which is typically evidenced by a sustained\nrepayment performance of at least six months.\nOccasionally, the Company modifies loans and leases to borrowers in financial distress (typically denoted by internal credit quality\ngraded “substandard” or worse) by providing term extensions, other-than-insignificant payment delays, or interest rate reductions. In\nsome cases, a combination of modifications are made to the same loan or lease. These modifications typically result from the\nCompany’s loss mitigation activities. If the Company determines that the value of the modified loan is less than the recorded\ninvestment in the loan (net of previous charge-offs, deferred loan fees or costs and unamortized premium or discount), impairment is\nrecognized through an allowance for loan and lease losses estimate or a charge-off to the allowance for loan and lease losses.\n8\nTable of Contents\nNote 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome Taxes: In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.\n2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” Among other things, these amendments require that\npublic business entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional\ninformation for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than\nfive percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income (loss) by the applicable statutory income tax rate.) The amendments\nalso require that all entities disclose on an annual basis the following information about income taxes paid: (1) the amount of income\ntaxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes and (2) the amount of income taxes paid (net of\nrefunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater\nthan five percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received.) This guidance is effective for public business entities for annual\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or\nmade available for issuance. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis although retrospective application is permitted.\nThe Company continues to assess ASU 2023-09 and its impact on its accounting and disclosures.\nSegment Reporting: In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures.” These amendments require, among other things, that a public entity that has a single reportable\nsegment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this ASU and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 208. The\nASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted.

The Company does not intend to sell these investments, and it is more\nlikely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these investments before recovery of the amortized cost basis, which may\nbe the maturity dates of the securities. The unrealized losses occurred as a result of changes in interest rates, market spreads and market\nconditions subsequent to purchase.\nThe following table shows the gross realized gains and losses from the available-for-sale debt securities portfolio.

The Company uses two methods to\nassess credit risk: loan or lease credit quality grades and credit risk classifications. The purpose of the loan or lease credit quality grade\nis to document the degree of risk associated with individual credits, as well as inform management of the degree of risk in the portfolio\ntaken as a whole. Credit risk classifications are used to categorize loans by degree of risk and to designate individual or committee\napproval authorities for higher risk credits at the time of origination. Credit risk classifications include categories for: Acceptable,\nMarginal, Special Attention, Special Risk, Restricted by Policy, Regulated and Prohibited by Law.\n10\nTable of Contents\nAll loans and leases, except residential real estate loans‚ home equity loans, and consumer loans, are assigned credit quality grades on a\nscale from 1 to 12, with grade 1 representing superior credit quality. The criteria used to assign grades to extensions of credit that\nexhibit potential problems or well-defined weaknesses are primarily based upon the degree of risk and the likelihood of orderly\nrepayment, and their effect on the Company’s safety and soundness. Loans or leases graded 7 or weaker are considered “special\nattention” credits and, as such, relationships in excess of $250,000 are reviewed quarterly as part of management’s evaluation of the\nappropriateness of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Grade 7 credits are defined as “watch” and contain greater than average\ncredit risk and are monitored to limit the exposure to increased risk; grade 8 credits are “special mention” and, following regulatory\nguidelines, are defined as having potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention. Credits that exhibit well-defined\nweaknesses and a distinct possibility of loss are considered “classified” and are graded 9 through 12 corresponding to the regulatory\ndefinitions of “substandard” (grades 9 and 10) and the more severe “doubtful” (grade 11) and “loss” (grade 12). For residential real\nestate and home equity and consumer loans, credit quality is based on the aging status of the loan and by payment activity.\nNonperforming loans are those loans which are on nonaccrual status or are 90 days or more past due.\nBelow is a summary of the Company’s loan and lease portfolio segments and a discussion of the risk characteristics relevant to each\nportfolio segment.\nCommercial and agricultural – loans are to entities within the Company’s local market communities. Loans are for business or agri-\nbusiness purposes and include working capital lines of credit secured by accounts receivable and inventory that are generally renewable\nannually and term loans secured by equipment with amortizations based on the expected life of the underlying collateral, generally\nthree to seven years. These loans are typically further supported by personal guarantees. Commercial exposure is to a wide range of\nindustries and services. Risks in this sector are also varied and are most impacted by general economic conditions. Risk mitigants\ninclude appropriate underwriting and monitoring and, when appropriate, government guarantees, including SBA and FSA.\nRenewable energy – loans are for the purpose of financing solar related projects and may include construction draw notes, operating\nloans, letters of credit and may entail a tax equity structure. Collateral in a multi-state area includes tangible assets of the borrower,\nassignment of intangible assets including power purchase agreements, and pledges of permits and licenses. Financing is provided to\nqualified borrowers throughout the continental United States with an emphasis on the region east of the Rocky Mountains.\nAuto and light truck – loans are secured by vehicles and borrowers are nationwide. The portfolio predominantly consists of loans to\nborrowers in the auto rental and commercial auto leasing industries. Borrowers in the auto rental segment are primarily independent\nauto rental entities with on-airport and off-airport locations, and some insurance replacement business. Loan amortizations are\nrelatively short, generally eighteen months, but up to four years. Auto leasing customers lease to businesses and the Company takes\nassignment of the lease stream and places its lien on the vehicles. Terms are generally longer than the auto rental sector, three to seven\nyears and match the underlying leases. Risks in both these segments include economic risks and collateral risks, principally used\nvehicle values.\nMedium and heavy duty truck – loans and full-service truck leases are secured by heavy-duty trucks, commonly Class 8 trucks, and are\ngenerally personally guaranteed. In addition to economic risks, collateral risk is significant. Financing is generally at full cost, plus\nadditional expenditures to get the vehicle operational, such as taxes, insurance and fees. It takes three to four years of debt amortization\nto reach an equity position in the collateral.\nAircraft – loans are to domestic and foreign borrowers with the domestic segment further divided into two pools: 1) personal and\nbusiness use, and 2) dealers and operators. The Company’s focus for the foreign sector is Latin America, principally Mexico and Brazil.\nLoans are primarily secured by new and used business jets and helicopters, with appropriate advances, amortizations of ten to fifteen\nyears, and are generally guaranteed by individuals. The most significant risk in the Aircraft portfolio is collateral risk - volatility in\nunderlying values and maintenance concerns. The portfolio is subject to national and global economic risks.\nConstruction equipment – loans are to borrowers throughout the country secured by specific equipment. The borrowers include\nhighway and road builders, asphalt producers and pavers, suppliers of aggregate products, site developers, frac sand operations, general\nconstruction equipment dealers and operators, and crane rental entities. Generally, loans include personal guarantees. The construction\nequipment industry is heavily dependent on both the U.S. and global economy. Market growth is reliant on investments from public and\nprivate sectors into urbanization and infrastructure projects.\nCommercial real estate – loans are generally to entities within the local market communities served by the Company with advances\ngenerally within regulatory guidelines. Historically, the Company’s exposure to commercial real estate has been primarily to the less\nrisky owner-occupied segment. The non-owner-occupied segment accounts for less than half of the commercial real estate portfolio and\nincludes hotels, apartment complexes and warehousing facilities. There is limited exposure to construction loans. Many commercial\nreal estate loans carry personal guarantees. Additional risks in the commercial real estate portfolio stem from geographical\nconcentration in northern Indiana and southwest Michigan and general economic conditions.\n11\n\nTable of Contents\nResidential real estate and home equity – loans predominantly include one-to-four family mortgages to borrowers in the Company’s\nlocal market communities and are appropriately underwritten and secured by residential real estate.\nConsumer – loans are to individuals in the Company’s local markets and auto loans are generally secured by personal vehicles and\nappropriately underwritten.\nThe following table shows the amortized cost of loans and leases, segregated by portfolio segment, credit quality rating and year of\norigination as of September 30, 2024, and gross

Therefore, the amortized cost of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for loan and lease losses\nis adjusted by the same amount.\nNote 5 — Allowance for Credit Losses\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the Company’s loan and lease portfolios utilizing\nguidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326. The determination of the allowance requires significant judgment to\nestimate credit losses measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist, and for loans evaluated individually. In\ndetermining the allowance, the Company estimates expected future losses for the loan’s entire contractual term adjusted for expected\npayments when appropriate. The allowance estimate considers relevant available information, from internal and external sources,\nrelating to the historical loss experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts for the Company’s outstanding\nloan and lease balances. The allowance is an estimation that reflects management’s evaluation of expected losses related to the\nCompany’s financial assets measured at amortized cost. To ensure the allowance is maintained at an adequate level, a detailed analysis\nis performed on a quarterly basis and an appropriate provision is made to adjust the allowance.\nThe Company categorizes its loan portfolios into nine segments based on similar risk characteristics. Loans within each segment are\ncollectively evaluated using either: 1) a cohort cumulative loss rate methodology (“cohort”) or, 2) the probability of default (“PD”)/loss\ngiven default (“LGD”) methodology (PD/LGD).\nThe following table shows the changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses, segregated by portfolio segment, for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n16\nTable of Contents\nMedium Residential\nand real estate\nCommercial and Renewable Auto and heavy duty Construction Commercial and home\n(Dollars in thousands) agricultural energy light truck truck Aircraft equipment real estate equity Consumer Total\nSeptember 30, 2024\nBalance, beginning of period $ 18,637 $ 7,653 $ 17,726 $ 9,221 $ 35,166 $ 26,944 $ 24,847 $ 7,792 $ 2,081 $ 150,067\nCharge-offs 2,004 — 302 — — — — — 323 2,629\nRecoveries 217 — 719 — 214 28 538 2 60 1,778\nNet charge-offs (recoveries) 1,787 — (417) — (214) (28) (538) (2) 263 851\nProvision (recovery of provision) 2,812 304 (188) (559) 332 1,051 (1,118) 43 431 3,108\nBalance, end of period $ 19,662 $ 7,957 $ 17,955 $ 8,662 $ 35,712 $ 28,023 $ 24,267 $ 7,837 $ 2,249 $ 152,324\nSeptember 30, 2023\nBalance, beginning of period $ 16,637 $ 6,308 $ 17,173 $ 7,556 $ 40,571 $ 26,105 $ 20,356 $ 6,767 $ 2,069 $ 143,542\nCharge-offs 2,261 — 189 — — — — 45 283 2,778\nRecoveries 20 — 1,825 — 243 284 — 1 78 2,451\nNet charge-offs (recoveries) 2,241 — (1,636) — (243) (284) — 44 205 327\nProvision (recovery of provision) 573 (203) (2,471) 155 (354) 506 2,288 168 197 859\nBalance, end of period $ 14,969 $ 6,105 $ 16,338 $ 7,711 $ 40,460 $ 26,895 $ 22,644 $ 6,891 $ 2,061 $ 144,074\nThe following table shows the changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses, segregated by portfolio segment, for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nMedium Residential\nand real estate\nCommercial and Renewable Auto and heavy duty Construction Commercial and home\n(Dollars in thousands) agricultural energy light truck truck Aircraft equipment real estate equity Consumer Total\nSeptember 30, 2024\nBalance, beginning of period $ 17,385 $ 6,610 $ 16,858 $ 8,965 $ 37,653 $ 26,510 $ 23,690 $ 7,698 $ 2,183 $ 147,552\nCharge-offs 9,115 — 318 — 68 598 — 13 935 11,047\nRecoveries 356 — 2,281 — 1,063 1,434 722 24 180 6,060\nNet charge-offs (recoveries) 8,759 — (1,963) — (995) (836) (722) (11) 755 4,987\nProvision (recovery of provision) 11,036 1,347 (866) (303) (2,936) 677 (145) 128 821 9,759\nBalance, end of period $ 19,662 $ 7,957 $ 17,955 $ 8,662 $ 35,712 $ 28,023 $ 24,267 $ 7,837 $ 2,249 $ 152,324\nSeptember 30, 2023\nBalance, beginning of period $ 14,635 $ 7,217 $ 18,634 $ 7,566 $ 41,093 $ 24,039 $ 17,431 $ 6,478 $ 2,175 $ 139,268\nCharge-offs 2,833 — 301 — — 45 218 55 879 4,331\nRecoveries 209 — 3,414 — 746 291 6 327 189 5,182\nNet charge-offs (recoveries) 2,624 — (3,113) — (746) (246) 212 (272) 690 (851)\nProvision (recovery of provision) 2,958 (1,112) (5,409) 145 (1,379) 2,610 5,425 141 576 3,955\nBalance, end of period $ 14,969 $ 6,105 $ 16,338 $ 7,711 $ 40,460 $ 26,895 $ 22,644 $ 6,891 $ 2,061 $ 144,074\nThe higher allowance for credit losses during the current quarter reflects an increase in special attention outstandings which carry\nhigher reserves, the impact of a change in quantitative assumptions regarding the treatment of renewals for loans in special attention\nwhich increased historical loss rates primarily in the commercial and agricultural and construction equipment portfolios, and modest net\ncredit losses during the period. The previous quarter’s forecast adjustment was increased slightly as a mixed overall outlook and\nsoftening economic conditions are anticipated during the two-year time horizon. The Company remains cautious on the forward\noutlook and its forecast adjustment represents fragile growth expectations during the forecast period. Ongoing risks include heightened\ngeopolitical instability, tightened credit conditions, increasing consumer stressors, a softening labor market, and elevated inflation and\ninterest rates. Credit quality metrics reflect higher special attention outstandings during the current quarter, with modest levels of non-\nperforming and delinquency that are trending higher. The Company reported modest net losses during the current quarter, reporting\ncredit losses in the commercial and agricultural and consumer portfolios, partially offset by recoveries in the auto and light truck,\ncommercial real estate, and aircraft portfolios.\nCommercial and agricultural – the increase in the allowance in the current quarter was principally due to higher loss rates from the\naforementioned change in quantitative assumptions regarding renewals of special attention loans along with slightly higher loan\nbalances during the period. Also, the portfolio has experienced higher credit losses in recent quarters.\nRenewable energy – the allowance increased due to higher loan balances. Credit quality remains stable.\nAuto and light truck – the allowance increased during the current quarter due to increased special attention loan balances which carry\nhigher reserves, largely offset by a decrease in loan balances during the period.\nMedium and heavy duty truck – the allowance decreased due to lower loan balances. The near-term industry outlook remains weak due\nto overcapacity in the segment which has negatively pressured freight rates.\n17\n\nTable of Contents\nAircraft – the allowance increased during the current quarter as the higher reserved foreign segment of the portfolio experienced\nincreased loan volumes. The Company has historically carried a higher allowance in this portfolio due to risk volatility.\nConstruction equipment – the allowance increased due to loan growth, higher loss rates from the aforementioned change in quantitative\nassumptions regarding renewals of special attention loans, and higher specific impairments in the portfolio.\nCommercial real estate – the allowance decreased due to lower loan balances. Higher interest rates and shifting demand dynamics have\nimpacted commercial real estate. The majority of the Company’s real estate exposure is owner-occupied, and exposure to non-owner-\noccupied office property is minimal.\nResidential real estate and home equity – the allowance increased slightly due to modest loan growth.\nConsumer – the allowance increased slightly due to the addition of a qualitative factor which addresses the trend of modestly higher\ndelinquency and non-performing rates in the portfolio, offsetting a slight decrease in loan balances.\nEconomic Outlook\nAs of September 30, 2024, the most significant economic factors impacting the Company’s loan portfolios are a fragile domestic\ngrowth outlook, impacted by elevated inflation and interest rates, along with broadening foreign conflicts and increasing geopolitical\ninstability. The labor market has shown signs of softening and questions surrounding the timing and velocity of future interest rate cuts\npersist. The Company remains concerned about the impact of tighter credit conditions on the economy and the effect that may have on\nfuture economic growth. Consumer stressors are increasing, and the Company remains concerned about small businesses and their\nability to control expenses and compete for labor, while absorbing the impact of higher interest rates and higher cost of capital. Asset\nvaluations which collateralize loans, particularly in the auto and light truck and medium and heavy duty portfolios, are softening.\nTightened lending conditions and the higher-rate environment are impacting commercial real estate activity. The forecast considers\nglobal and domestic economic impacts from these factors, as well as other key economic factors, such as changes in gross domestic\nproduct and unemployment which may impact the Company’s clients. The Company’s assumption is that economic growth will be\nsomewhat tepid during the forecast period over the next two years, with inflation slowly moving back towards the 2% Federal Reserve\ntarget rate, resulting in an adverse impact on the loan and lease portfolio.\nAs a result of geopolitical risks and economic uncertainty, the Company’s future loss estimates may vary considerably from the\nSeptember 30, 2024 assumptions.\nLiability for Credit Losses on Unfunded Loan Commitments\nThe liability for credit losses inherent in unfunded loan commitments is included in Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities on the\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The following table shows the changes in the liability for credit losses on unfunded\nloan commitments.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBalance, beginning of period $ 8,694 $ 7,370 $ 8,182 $ 5,616\n(Recovery of provision) provision (1,385) 649 (873) 2,403\nBalance, end of period $ 7,309 $ 8,019 $ 7,309 $ 8,019\nNote 6 — Lease Investments\nAs a lessor, the Company’s loan and lease portfolio includes direct finance leases, which are included in Commercial and Agricultural,\nRenewable Energy, Auto and Light Truck, Medium and Heavy Duty Truck, Aircraft, and Construction Equipment on the Consolidated\nStatements of Financial Condition.

Expense related to personal property tax payments on operating leased\nequipment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $0.00 million and $0.00 million, respectively and for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $0.16 million and $0.23 million, respectively.\nNote 7 — Mortgage Servicing Rights\nThe Company recognizes the rights to service residential mortgage loans for others as separate assets, whether the servicing rights are\nacquired through a separate purchase or through the sale of originated loans with servicing rights retained. The Company allocates a\nportion of the total proceeds of a mortgage loan to servicing rights based on the relative fair value. The unpaid principal balance of\nresidential mortgage loans serviced for third parties was $785.43 million and $806.05 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, respectively.\nMortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are evaluated for impairment at each reporting date. For purposes of impairment measurement,\nMSRs are stratified based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying servicing, principally by loan type. If temporary\nimpairment exists within a tranche, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income equal to the amount by which the\ncarrying value exceeds the fair value. If it is later determined all or a portion of the temporary impairment no longer exists for a\nparticular tranche, the valuation allowance is reduced through a recovery of income.\nThe following table shows changes in the carrying value of MSRs and the associated valuation allowance.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nMortgage servicing rights:\nBalance at beginning of period $ 3,567 $ 3,874 $ 3,670 $ 4,137\nAdditions 130 119 396 291\nAmortization (207) (217) (576) (652)\nCarrying value before valuation allowance at end of period 3,490 3,776 3,490 3,776\nValuation allowance:\nBalance at beginning of period — — — —\nImpairment recoveries — — — —\nBalance at end of period $ — $ — $ — $ —\nNet carrying value of mortgage servicing rights at end of period $ 3,490 $ 3,776 $ 3,490 $ 3,776\nFair value of mortgage servicing rights at end of period $ 7,842 $ 8,029 $ 7,842 $ 8,029\nAt September 30, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of MSRs exceeded the carrying value reported in the Consolidated Statements of\nFinancial Condition by $4.35 million and $4.25 million, respectively. This difference represents increases in the fair value of certain\nMSRs that could not be recorded above cost basis.\nMortgage loan contractual servicing fees, including late fees and ancillary income, were $0.63 million and $0.63 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Mortgage loan contractual servicing fees, including late fees and ancillary\nincome, were $1.80 million and $1.92 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Mortgage loan\ncontractual servicing fees are included in Mortgage Banking on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n19\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 8 — Commitments and Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk — 1st Source and its subsidiaries are parties to financial instruments with off-\nbalance-sheet risk in the normal course of business. These off-balance-sheet financial instruments include commitments to originate\nand sell loans and standby letters of credit. The instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in\nexcess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nThe following table shows financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk.\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nAmounts of commitments:\nLoan commitments to extend credit $ 1,361,575 $ 1,454,506\nStandby letters of credit $ 22,209 $ 17,287\nCommercial and similar letters of credit $ — $ 7,047\nThe exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for loan commitments and\nstandby letters of credit is represented by the dollar amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies and\ncollateral requirements in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nThe Company grants mortgage loan commitments to borrowers, subject to normal loan underwriting standards. The interest rate risk\nassociated with these loan commitments is managed by entering into contracts for future deliveries of loans. Loan commitments\ngenerally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments\nare expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments that guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. The credit risk\ninvolved in and collateral obtained when issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan\ncommitments to clients. Standby letters of credit generally have terms ranging from two months to one year.\nCommercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when\nthe underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and the third party. Commercial letters of credit generally have terms\nranging from two months to six months.\nNote 9 — Derivative Financial Instruments\nCommitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale and forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans are\nconsidered derivative instruments. See Note 8 for further information.\nThe Company has certain interest rate derivative positions that are not designated as hedging instruments. Derivative assets and\nliabilities are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and do not take into account the effects of\nmaster netting agreements. Master netting agreements allow the Company to settle all derivative contracts held with a single\ncounterparty on a net basis, and to offset net derivative positions with related collateral, where applicable. These derivative positions\nrelate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a client while at the same time entering into an\noffsetting interest rate swap with another financial institution. In connection with each transaction, the Company agrees to pay interest\nto the client on a notional amount at a variable interest rate and receive interest from the client on the same notional amount at a fixed\ninterest rate. At the same time, the Company agrees to pay another financial institution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional\namount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount. The transaction allows the client to effectively convert\na variable rate loan to a fixed rate. Because the terms of the swaps with the customers and the other financial institutions offset each\nother, with the only difference being counterparty credit risk, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts are not\nmaterially different and do not significantly impact the Company’s results of operations.\n20\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the amounts of non-hedging derivative financial instruments.\nAsset derivatives Liability derivatives\nNotional or\ncontractual Statement of Financial Statement of Financial\n(Dollars in thousands) amount Condition classification Fair value Condition classification Fair value\nSeptember 30, 2024\nInterest rate swap contracts $ 1,081,092 Other assets $ 20,064 Other liabilities $ 20,433\nLoan commitments 5,817 Mortgages held for sale 201 N/A —\nForward contracts - mortgage loan 7,500 N/A — Mortgages held for sale 9\nTotal $ 1,094,409 $ 20,265 $ 20,442\nDecember 31, 2023\nInterest rate swap contracts $ 1,085,618 Other assets $ 22,704 Other liabilities $ 23,140\nLoan commitments 2,824 Mortgages held for sale 107 N/A —\nForward contracts - mortgage loan 3,500 N/A — Mortgages held for sale 16\nTotal $ 1,091,942 $ 22,811 $ 23,156\nThe following table shows the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for non-hedging derivative financial\ninstruments.\nGain (loss)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) Statement of Income classification 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest rate swap contracts Other expense $ 26 $ (42) $ 68 $ (41)\nInterest rate swap contracts Other income 190 475 743 766\nLoan commitments Mortgage banking (84) (14) 94 76\nForward contracts - mortgage loan Mortgage banking (30) 8 7 12\nTotal $ 102 $ 427 $ 912 $ 813\nThe following table shows the offsetting of financial assets and derivative assets.\nGross Amounts Not Offset in the\nStatement of Financial Condition\nGross Net Amounts of\nAmounts of Gross Amounts Offset Assets Presented in\nRecognized in the Statement of the Statement of Financial Cash Collateral\n(Dollars in thousands) Assets Financial Condition Financial Condition Instruments Received Net Amount\nSeptember 30, 2024\nInterest rate swaps $ 20,064 $ — $ 20,064 $ — $ — $ 20,064\nDecember 31, 2023\nInterest rate swaps $ 22,704 $ — $ 22,704 $ — $ 10,795 $ 11,909\n21\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the offsetting of financial liabilities and derivative liabilities.\nGross Amounts Not Offset in the\nStatement of Financial Condition\nGross Net Amounts of\nAmounts of Gross Amounts Offset Liabilities Presented in\nRecognized in the Statement of the Statement of Financial Cash Collateral\n(Dollars in thousands) Liabilities Financial Condition Financial Condition Instruments Pledged Net Amount\nSeptember 30, 2024\nInterest rate swaps $ 20,433 $ — $ 20,433 $ — $ 525 $ 19,908\nRepurchase agreements 63,553 — 63,553 63,553 — —\nTotal $ 83,986 $ — $ 83,986 $ 63,553 $ 525 $ 19,908\nDecember 31, 2023\nInterest rate swaps $ 23,140 $ — $ 23,140 $ — $ — $ 23,140\nRepurchase agreements 55,809 — 55,809 55,809 — —\nTotal $ 78,949 $ — $ 78,949 $ 55,809 $ — $ 23,140\nIf a default in performance of any obligation of a repurchase agreement occurs, each party will set-off property held in respect of\ntransactions against obligations owing in respect of any other transactions.

The Company’s investments in VIEs are primarily related\nto investments promoting affordable housing, community development and renewable energy sources. Some of these tax-advantaged\ninvestments support the Company’s regulatory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. The Company’s investments in\nthese entities generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits, such as\ntax deductions from operating losses of the investments, over specified time periods. These tax credits are recognized as a reduction of\ntax expense or, for investments qualifying as investment tax credits, as a reduction to the related investment asset. The Company\nrecognized federal and state income tax credits related to its affordable housing and community development tax-advantaged\ninvestments in tax expense of $0.80 million and $0.66 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,\nand $2.39 million and $1.99 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company also\nrecognized $1.34 million and $0.57 million of investment tax credits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $12.13 million and $25.02 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company is not required to consolidate VIEs in which it has concluded it does not have a controlling financial interest, and thus is\nnot the primary beneficiary. In such cases, the Company does not have both the power to direct the entities’ most significant activities\nand the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. As a limited partner\nin these operating partnerships, the Company is allocated credits and deductions associated with the underlying properties. The\nCompany has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these investments because the general partners have the power to\ndirect activities that most significantly influence the economic performance of their respective partnerships.\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s investments in these unconsolidated VIEs are carried in Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial\nCondition. The Company’s unfunded capital and other commitments related to these unconsolidated VIEs are generally carried in Other\nLiabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from these\nunconsolidated VIEs includes the investment recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, net of unfunded capital\ncommitments, and previously recorded tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features\nrequired to be met at the project level. While the Company believes potential losses from these investments are remote, the maximum\nexposure was determined by assuming a scenario where the community-based business projects, housing projects, and renewable\nenergy projects completely fail and do not meet certain taxing authority compliance requirements, resulting in recapture of the related\ntax credits.\nThe following table provides a summary of investments in affordable housing, community development, and renewable energy VIEs\nthat the Company has not consolidated.\n(Dollars in thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nInvestment carrying amount $ 70,889 $ 79,228\nUnfunded capital and other commitments 62,260 80,719\nMaximum exposure to loss 71,686 59,649\nThe Company is required to consolidate VIEs in which it has concluded it has significant involvement and the ability to direct the\nactivities that impact the entity’s economic performance. The Company is the managing general partner of entities in which it shares\ninterest in tax-advantaged investments with a third party. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, approximately $78.77\nmillion and $87.37 million, respectively, of the Company’s assets and $0.00 million and $0.00 million, respectively, of its liabilities\nincluded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition were related to tax-advantaged investment VIEs which the Company\nhas consolidated. The assets of the consolidated VIEs are reported in Other Assets, the liabilities are reported in Other Liabilities, and\nthe non-controlling interest is reported in Equity on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The assets of a particular VIE\nare the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. The creditors of the VIE do not have recourse to the general credit of the\nCompany. The Company’s exposure to the consolidated VIE is generally limited to the carrying value of its variable interest plus any\nrelated tax credits previously recognized.\nAdditionally, the Company sponsors one trust, 1st Source Master Trust (Capital Trust), of which 100% of the common equity is owned\nby the Company. The Capital Trust was formed in 2007 for the purpose of issuing corporation-obligated mandatorily redeemable\ncapital securities (the capital securities) to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale of the capital securities solely\nin junior subordinated debenture securities of the Company (the subordinated notes). The subordinated notes held by the Capital Trust\nare the sole assets of the Capital Trust. The Capital Trust qualifies as a variable interest entity for which the Company is not the primary\nbeneficiary and is therefore reported in the financial statements as an unconsolidated subsidiary. The junior subordinated debentures are\nreflected as subordinated notes on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition with the corresponding interest distributions\nreflected as Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The common shares issued by the Capital Trust are included in\nOther Assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nDistributions on the capital securities issued by the Capital Trust are payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate\nbeing earned by the Capital Trust on the subordinated notes held by the Capital Trust. The capital securities are subject to mandatory\nredemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the subordinated notes. The Company has entered into agreements which, taken\ncollectively, fully and unconditionally guarantee the capital securities subject to the terms of each of the guarantees. The capital\nsecurities held by the Capital Trust qualify as Tier 1 capital under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.\nThe following table shows subordinated notes at September 30, 2024.\nAmount of\nSubordinated\n(Dollars in thousands) Notes Interest Rate Maturity Date\nJune 2007 issuance (1) $ 41,238 7.22 % 6/15/2037\nAugust 2007 issuance (2) 17,526 6.69 % 9/15/2037\nTotal $ 58,764\n(1) Fixed rate through life of debt.\n(2) 3-Month Term SOFR + the 3-Month tenor spread adjustment + 1.48% through remaining life of debt.\n23\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 11 — Earnings Per Share\nEarnings per common share is computed using the two-class method. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net\nincome available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable\nperiod, excluding outstanding participating securities. Participating securities include non-vested restricted stock awards. Non-vested\nrestricted stock awards are considered participating securities to the extent the holders of these securities receive non-forfeitable\ndividends at the same rate as holders of common stock. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted-average\nnumber of shares determined for the basic earnings per common share computation plus the dilutive effect of stock compensation using\nthe treasury stock method.\nStock options, where the exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares, were excluded from the\ncomputation of diluted earnings per common share because the result would have been antidilutive. There were no stock options\noutstanding as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of shares used in the\ncalculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands - except per share amounts) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nDistributed earnings allocated to common stock $ 8,821 $ 7,900 $ 25,438 $ 23,694\nUndistributed earnings allocated to common stock 25,801 24,707 74,795 71,894\nNet earnings allocated to common stock 34,622 32,607 100,233 95,588\nNet earnings allocated to participating securities 315 332 952 910\nNet income allocated to common stock and participating securities $ 34,937 $ 32,939 $ 101,185 $ 96,498\nWeighted average shares outstanding for basic earnings per common share 24,514,144 24,660,508 24,489,665 24,677,914\nDilutive effect of stock compensation — — — —\nWeighted average shares outstanding for diluted earnings per common share 24,514,144 24,660,508 24,489,665 24,677,914\nBasic earnings per common share $ 1.41 $ 1.32 $ 4.09 $ 3.87\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 1.41 $ 1.32 $ 4.09 $ 3.87\nNote 12 — Stock Based Compensation\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had four active stock-based employee compensation plans, which are more fully described in\nNote 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in 1st Source’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThese plans include three executive stock award plans, the Executive Incentive Plan (EIP), the Restricted Stock Award Plan (RSAP),\nthe Strategic Deployment Incentive Plan (SDP); and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The 2011 Stock Option Plan was\napproved by the shareholders on April 21, 2011, but the Company had not made any grants through September 30, 2024.\nStock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted is based on the grant-date fair value. For all\nawards except stock option awards, the grant date fair value is either the fair market value per share or book value per share\n(corresponding to the type of stock awarded) as of the grant date. For stock option awards, the grant date fair value is estimated using\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model. For all awards, the Company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over\nthe requisite service period of the award, for which the Company uses the related vesting term.\nTotal fair value of options vested and expensed was zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30,\n2024 and 2023 there were no outstanding stock options. There were no stock options exercised during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023. All shares issued in connection with stock option exercises are issued from available treasury stock.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $11.34 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based\ncompensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.31 years.\n24\nTable of Contents\nNote 13 — Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table presents reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to unrealized gains and\nlosses on available-for-sale securities.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nAffected Line Item in the Consolidated\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Statements of Income\nLosses on investment securities available-\nRealized losses included in net income $ — $ — $ — $ (44)for-sale\n— — — (44)Income before income taxes\nTax effect — — — 10 Income tax expense\nNet of tax $ — $ — $ — $ (34)Net income\nNote 14 — Income Taxes\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized was zero at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. Interest and penalties are recognized through the income tax provision. For the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized no interest or penalties. There were no accrued interest and penalties at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nTax years that remain open and subject to audit include the federal 2020-2023 years and the Indiana 2020-2023 years. The Company\ndoes not anticipate a significant change in the amount of uncertain tax positions within the next 12 months.\nNote 15 — Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company records certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements\nare also utilized to determine the initial value of certain assets and liabilities, to perform impairment assessments, and for disclosure\npurposes. The Company uses quoted market prices and observable inputs to the maximum extent possible when measuring fair value.\nIn the absence of quoted market prices, various valuation techniques are utilized to measure fair value. When possible, observable\nmarket data for identical or similar financial instruments is used in the valuation. When market data is not available, fair value is\ndetermined using valuation models that incorporate management’s estimates of the assumptions a market participant would use in\npricing the asset or liability.\nFair value measurements are classified within one of three levels based on the observability of the inputs used to determine fair value,\nas follows:\n• Level 1 — The valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.\n• Level 2 — The valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted\nprices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all\nsignificant assumptions are observable in the market.\n• Level 3 — The valuation is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by minimal or no market activity and that are\nsignificant to the fair value of the instrument. Level 3 valuations are typically performed using pricing models, discounted\ncash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that incorporate management’s own estimates of assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing the instrument, or valuations that require significant management judgment or estimation.\nA financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\nThe Company elected fair value accounting for mortgages held for sale and for its best-efforts forward sales commitments. The\nCompany economically hedges its mortgages held for sale at the time the interest rate locks are issued to the customers. The Company\nbelieves the election for mortgages held for sale will reduce certain timing differences and better match changes in the value of these\nassets with changes in the value of derivatives or best-best efforts forward sales commitments. At September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, all mortgages held for sale were carried at fair value.\n25\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the differences between the fair value carrying amount of mortgages held for sale measured at fair value and\nthe aggregate unpaid principal amount the Company is contractually entitled to receive at maturity.\nExcess of fair\nvalue carrying\nFair value amount over\ncarrying Aggregate (under) unpaid\n(Dollars in thousands) amount unpaid principal principal\nSeptember 30, 2024\nMortgages held for sale reported at fair value $ 3,690 $ 3,358 $ 332 (1)\nDecember 31, 2023\nMortgages held for sale reported at fair value $ 1,442 $ 1,297 $ 145 (1)\n(1) The excess of fair value carrying amount over (under) unpaid principal is included in mortgage banking income and includes changes in fair value at and\nsubsequent to funding and gains and losses on the related loan commitment prior to funding.\nFinancial Instruments on Recurring Basis:\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nInvestment securities available-for-sale are valued primarily by a third-party pricing agent. Prices supplied by the independent pricing\nagent, as well as their pricing methodologies and assumptions, are reviewed by the Company for reasonableness and to ensure such\nprices are aligned with market levels. In general, the Company’s investment securities do not possess a complex structure that could\nintroduce greater valuation risk. The portfolio mainly consists of traditional investments including U.S. Treasury and Federal agencies\nsecurities, Federal agency mortgage pass-through securities, and general obligation and revenue municipal bonds. Pricing for such\ninstruments is fairly generic and is easily obtained. On a quarterly basis, prices supplied by the pricing agent are validated by\ncomparison to prices obtained from other third-party sources for a material portion of the portfolio.\nThe valuation policy and procedures for Level 3 fair value measurements of available-for-sale debt securities are decided through\ncollaboration between management of the Corporate Accounting and Funds Management departments. The changes in fair value\nmeasurement for Level 3 securities are analyzed on a periodic basis under a collaborative framework with the aforementioned\ndepartments. The methodology and variables used for input are derived from the combination of observable and unobservable inputs.\nThe unobservable inputs are determined through internal assumptions that may vary from period to period due to external factors, such\nas market movement and credit rating adjustments.\nBoth the market and income valuation approaches are implemented using the following types of inputs:\n• U.S. treasuries are priced using the market approach and utilizing live data feeds from active market exchanges for identical\nsecurities.\n• Government-sponsored agency debt securities and corporate bonds are primarily priced using available market information\nthrough processes such as benchmark curves, market valuations of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing.\n• Other government-sponsored agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and some of the actively traded REMICs and\nCMOs, are primarily priced using available market information including benchmark yields, prepayment speeds, spreads and\nvolatility of similar securities.\n• State and political subdivisions are largely grouped by characteristics, i.e., geographical data and source of revenue in trade\ndissemination systems. Since some securities are not traded daily and due to other grouping limitations, active market quotes\nare often obtained using benchmarking for like securities. Local direct placement municipal securities, with very little market\nactivity, are priced using an appropriate market yield curve, which includes a credit spread assumption.\nMortgages held for sale and the related loan commitments and forward contracts (hedges) are valued by a third-party pricing agent.\nPrices supplied by the independent pricing agent, as well as their pricing methodologies, are reviewed by the Company for\nreasonableness and to ensure such prices are aligned with market values. On a quarterly basis, prices supplied by the pricing agent are\nvalidated by comparison to the prices obtained from other third-party sources.\n26\nTable of Contents\nInterest rate swap positions, both assets and liabilities, are valued by a third-party pricing agent using an income approach and utilizing\nmodels that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. This valuation process considers various factors including interest\nrate yield curves, time value and volatility factors. Validation of third-party agent valuations is accomplished by comparing those values\nto the Company’s swap counterparty valuations. Management believes an adjustment is required to “mid-market” valuations for\nderivatives tied to its performing loan portfolio to recognize the imprecision and related exposure inherent in the process of estimating\nexpected credit losses as well as velocity of deterioration evident with systemic risks embedded in these portfolios. Any change in the\nmid-market derivative valuation adjustment will be recognized immediately through the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table shows the balance of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\n(Dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAssets:\nInvestment securities available-for-sale:\nU.S. Treasury and Federal agencies securities $ 479,400 $ 343,967 $ — $ 823,367\nU.S. States and political subdivisions securities — 81,991 1,058 83,049\nMortgage-backed securities — Federal agencies — 656,545 — 656,545\nCorporate debt securities — — — —\nForeign government and other securities — 500 — 500\nTotal debt securities available-for-sale 479,400 1,083,003 1,058 1,563,461\nMortgages held for sale — 3,690 — 3,690\nAccrued income and other assets (interest rate swap agreements) — 20,064 — 20,064\nTotal $ 479,400 $ 1,106,757 $ 1,058 $ 1,587,215\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities (interest rate swap agreements) $ — $ 20,433 $ — $ 20,433\nTotal $ — $ 20,433 $ — $ 20,433\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets:\nInvestment securities available-for-sale:\nU.S. Treasury and Federal agencies securities $ 541,461 $ 381,405 $ — $ 922,866\nU.S. States and political subdivisions securities — 91,403 1,161 92,564\nMortgage-backed securities — Federal agencies — 598,252 — 598,252\nCorporate debt securities — 8,329 — 8,329\nForeign government and other securities — 589 — 589\nTotal debt securities available-for-sale 541,461 1,079,978 1,161 1,622,600\nMortgages held for sale — 1,442 — 1,442\nAccrued income and other assets (interest rate swap agreements) — 22,704 — 22,704\nTotal $ 541,461 $ 1,104,124 $ 1,161 $ 1,646,746\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities (interest rate swap agreements) $ — $ 23,140 $ — $ 23,140\nTotal $ — $ 23,140 $ — $ 23,140\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows changes in Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the quarter ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023.\nU.S. States and\npolitical\nsubdivisions\n(Dollars in thousands) securities\nBeginning balance July 1, 2024 $ 1,037\nTotal gains or losses (realized/unrealized):\nIncluded in earnings —\nIncluded in other comprehensive income (loss) 21\nPurchases —\nIssuances —\nSales —\nSettlements —\nMaturities —\nTransfers into Level 3 —\nTransfers out of Level 3 —\nEnding balance September 30, 2024 $ 1,058\nBeginning balance July 1, 2023 $ 4,249\nTotal gains or losses (realized/unrealized):\nIncluded in earnings —\nIncluded in other comprehensive income (loss) (26)\nPurchases —\nIssuances —\nSales —\nSettlements —\nMaturities (85)\nTransfers into Level 3 —\nTransfers out of Level 3 —\nEnding balance September 30, 2023 $ 4,138\nThere were no gains or losses for the period included in earnings attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to\nassets still held at September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nThe following table shows the valuation methodology and unobservable inputs for Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis.\n(Dollars in thousands) Fair Value Valuation Methodology Unobservable Inputs Range of Inputs Weighted Average\nSeptember 30, 2024\nDebt securities available-for sale\nDirect placement municipal securities $ 1,058 Discounted cash flows Credit spread assumption 3.41% - 4.25% 3.68 %\nDecember 31, 2023\nDebt securities available-for sale\nDirect placement municipal securities $ 1,161 Discounted cash flows Credit spread assumption 0.31% - 5.28% 4.28 %\nFinancial Instruments on Non-recurring Basis:\nThe Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain other financial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis in\naccordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from application of lower of cost or market accounting or\nimpairment charges of individual assets.\n28\nTable of Contents\nThe Credit Policy Committee (CPC), a management committee, is responsible for overseeing the valuation processes and procedures\nfor Level 3 measurements of impaired loans, other real estate and repossessions. The CPC reviews these assets on a quarterly basis to\ndetermine the accuracy of the observable inputs, generally third-party appraisals, auction values, values derived from trade publications\nand data submitted by the borrower, and the appropriateness of the unobservable inputs, generally discounts due to current market\nconditions and collection issues. The CPC establishes discounts based on asset type and valuation source; deviations from the standard\nare documented. The discounts are reviewed periodically, annually at a minimum, to determine they remain appropriate. Consideration\nis given to current trends in market values for the asset categories and gains and losses on sales of similar assets. The Loan and Funds\nManagement Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the CPC.\nDiscounts vary depending on the nature of the assets and the source of value. Aircraft are generally valued using quarterly trade\npublications adjusted for engine time, condition, maintenance programs, discounted by 10%. Likewise, autos are valued using current\nauction values, discounted by 10%; medium and heavy duty trucks are valued using trade publications and auction values, discounted\nby 15%. Construction equipment is generally valued using trade publications and auction values, discounted by 20%. Real estate is\nvalued based on appraisals or evaluations, discounted by 20% with higher discounts for property in poor condition or property with\ncharacteristics which may make it more difficult to market. Commercial loans subject to borrowing base certificates are generally\ndiscounted by 20% for receivables and 40% - 75% for inventory with higher discounts when monthly borrowing base certificates are\nnot required or received.\nCollateral-dependent impaired loans and related write-downs are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is\nexpected solely from the collateral. Collateral values are reviewed quarterly and estimated using customized discounting criteria,\nappraisals and dealer and trade magazine quotes which are used in a market valuation approach. In accordance with fair value\nmeasurements, only impaired loans for which an allowance for loan loss has been established based on the fair value of collateral\nrequire classification in the fair value hierarchy. As a result, only a portion of the Company’s impaired loans are classified in the fair\nvalue hierarchy.\nThe Company has established MSRs valuation policies and procedures based on industry standards and to ensure valuation\nmethodologies are consistent and verifiable. MSRs and related adjustments to fair value result from application of lower of cost or fair\nvalue accounting. For purposes of impairment, MSRs are stratified based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying\nservicing, principally by loan type. The fair value of each tranche of the servicing portfolio is estimated by calculating the present value\nof estimated future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates, discount\nrates, servicing costs, and other economic factors. Prepayment rates and discount rates are derived through a third-party pricing agent.\nChanges in the most significant inputs, including prepayment rates and discount rates, are compared to the changes in the fair value\nmeasurements and appropriate resolution is made. A fair value analysis is also obtained from an independent third-party agent and\ncompared to the internal valuation for reasonableness. MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices and\nthough sales of MSRs do occur, precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available, and the characteristics of the\nCompany’s servicing portfolio may differ from those of any servicing portfolios that do trade.\nOther real estate is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less expected selling costs. Collateral values are estimated\nprimarily using appraisals and reflect a market value approach. Fair values are reviewed quarterly, and new appraisals are obtained\nannually. Repossessions are similarly valued.\nFor assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, the following represents impairment charges (recoveries) recognized on these\nassets during the quarter ended September 30, 2024: collateral-dependent impaired loans - $2.30 million; mortgage servicing rights -\n$0.00 million; repossessions - $0.01 million; and other real estate - $0.00 million.\n29\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the carrying value of assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\n(Dollars in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCollateral-dependent impaired loans $ — $ — $ 15,666 $ 15,666\nAccrued income and other assets (mortgage servicing rights) — — 3,490 3,490\nAccrued income and other assets (repossessions) — — 109 109\nTotal $ — $ — $ 19,265 $ 19,265\nDecember 31, 2023\nCollateral-dependent impaired loans $ — $ — $ 6,289 $ 6,289\nAccrued income and other assets (mortgage servicing rights) — — 3,670 3,670\nAccrued income and other assets (repossessions) — — 705 705\nTotal $ — $ — $ 10,664 $ 10,664\nThe following table below shows the valuation methodology and unobservable inputs for Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair\nvalue on a non-recurring basis.\n(Dollars in thousands) Carrying Value Fair Value Valuation Methodology Unobservable Inputs Range of Inputs Weighted Average\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCollateral-dependent $ 15,666 $ 15,666 Collateral based measurements Discount for lack of marketability 20% - 73% 29.9 %\nimpaired loans including appraisals, trade and current conditions\npublications, and auction values\nMortgage servicing rights 3,490 7,842 Discounted cash flows Constant prepayment rate (CPR) 7.9% - 31.2% 8.3 %\nDiscount rate 10.3% - 12.3% 10.4 %\nRepossessions 109 124 Appraisals, trade publications and Discount for lack of marketability 0% - 25% 13 %\nauction values\nDecember 31, 2023\nCollateral-dependent $ 6,289 $ 6,289 Collateral based measurements Discount for lack of marketability 10% - 20% 13.9 %\nimpaired loans including appraisals, trade and current conditions\npublications, and auction values\nMortgage servicing rights 3,670 8,151 Discounted cash flows Constant prepayment rate (CPR) 6.1% - 17.6% 7.3 %\nDiscount rate 11.0% - 13.1% 11.2 %\nRepossessions 705 757 Appraisals, trade publications and Discount for lack of marketability 0% - 10% 8 %\nauction values\nGAAP requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial\nliabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis.\n30\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments.\nCarrying or\n(Dollars in thousands) Contract Value Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nSeptember 30, 2024\nAssets:\nCash and due from banks $ 99,900 $ 99,900 $ 99,900 $ — $ —\nFederal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks 69,461 69,461 69,461 — —\nInvestment securities, available-for-sale 1,563,461 1,563,461 479,400 1,083,003 1,058\nOther investments 23,855 23,855 23,855 — —\nMortgages held for sale 3,690 3,690 — 3,690 —\nLoans and leases, net of allowance for loan and lease losses 6,463,776 6,367,340 — — 6,367,340\nMortgage servicing rights 3,490 7,842 — — 7,842\nAccrued interest receivable 30,721 30,721 — 30,721 —\nInterest rate swaps 20,064 20,064 — 20,064 —\nLiabilities:\nDeposits $ 7,125,944 $ 7,125,447 $ 5,283,336 $ 1,842,111 $ —\nShort-term borrowings 165,677 165,677 65,630 100,047 —\nLong-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities 39,220 38,818 — 38,818 —\nSubordinated notes 58,764 59,293 — 59,293 —\nAccrued interest payable 43,017 43,017 — 43,017 —\nInterest rate swaps 20,433 20,433 — 20,433 —\nOff-balance-sheet instruments * — 177 — 177 —\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets:\nCash and due from banks $ 77,474 $ 77,474 $ 77,474 $ — $ —\nFederal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks 52,194 52,194 52,194 — —\nInvestment securities, available-for-sale 1,622,600 1,622,600 541,461 1,079,978 1,161\nOther investments 25,075 25,075 25,075 — —\nMortgages held for sale 1,442 1,442 — 1,442 —\nLoans and leases, net of allowance for loan and lease losses 6,370,953 6,204,791 — — 6,204,791\nMortgage servicing rights 3,670 8,151 — — 8,151\nAccrued interest receivable 30,232 30,232 — 30,232 —\nInterest rate swaps 22,704 22,704 — 22,704 —\nLiabilities:\nDeposits $ 7,038,581 $ 7,033,549 $ 5,299,896 $ 1,733,653 $ —\nShort-term borrowings 312,359 312,359 56,013 256,346 —\nLong-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities 47,911 47,098 — 47,098 —\nSubordinated notes 58,764 55,842 — 55,842 —\nAccrued interest payable 29,520 29,520 — 29,520 —\nInterest rate swaps 23,140 23,140 — 23,140 —\nOff-balance-sheet instruments * — 120 — 120 —\n* Represents estimated cash outflows required to currently settle the obligations at current market rates.\nThese estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company’s entire\nholdings of a particular financial instrument.

Total\ninvestment securities available-for-sale were $1.56 billion, a decrease of $59.14 million or 3.64% from December 31, 2023. The largest\ncontributor to the decrease in investment securities available-for-sale was expected redemptions, which were used to fund loan growth\nand pay down borrowings. Federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks were $69.46 million, an increase of $17.27\nmillion or 33.08% from December 31, 2023. The increase in federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with other banks was due\nto higher interest bearing deposits at other banks.\nTotal loans and leases were $6.62 billion, an increase of $97.60 million or 1.50% from December 31, 2023. The largest contributors to\nthe increase in loans and leases was growth in the renewable energy, construction equipment, commercial real estate and residential real\nestate and home equity portfolios, offset by decreases in the commercial and agricultural, auto and light truck, medium and heavy duty\ntruck, and aircraft portfolios. Our foreign loan and lease balances, all denominated in U.S. dollars were $304.00 million and $302.41\nmillion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Foreign loans and leases are in aircraft financing. Loan and\nlease balances to borrowers in Brazil and Mexico were $132.57 million and $137.72 million as of September 30, 2024, respectively,\ncompared to $119.38 million and $147.61 million as of December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023, there was not a significant concentration in any other country.\nEquipment owned under operating leases was $13.01 million, a decrease of $7.36 million, or 36.11% compared to December 31, 2023.\nThe largest contributors to the decrease in equipment owned under operating leases was reduced leasing volume primarily due to a\nchange in customer preferences and continued competitive pricing pressure for new business.\nTotal deposits were $7.13 billion, an increase of $87.36 million or 1.24% from the end of 2023. The largest contributors to the increase\nin total deposits was higher time, savings, and interest-bearing public fund deposits offset by lower brokered time deposits, consumer\nand business interest-bearing demand deposits and noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Rate competition for deposits persisted during\nthe third quarter across our footprint from various sources, including traditional bank and credit union competitors, money market\nfunds, bond markets, and other non-bank alternatives.\n32\nTable of Contents\nShort-term borrowings were $165.68 million, a decrease of $146.68 million or 46.96% from December 31, 2023, due primarily to pay\ndowns of short-term FHLB borrowings offset by an increase in repurchase agreements. Long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable\nsecurities were $39.22 million, a decrease of $8.69 million or 18.14% from December 31, 2023, due primarily to maturities of long-\nterm FHLB borrowings. Accrued expenses and other liabilities were $199.14 million, a decrease of $2.94 million or 1.46% from\nDecember 31, 2023, mainly due to decreased unfunded partnership commitments, offset by increased accrued interest payable.\nThe following table shows accrued income and other assets.\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023\nAccrued income and other assets:\nBank owned life insurance cash surrender value $ 85,977 $ 84,414\nOperating lease right of use assets 21,840 21,692\nAccrued interest receivable 30,721 30,232\nMortgage servicing rights 3,490 3,670\nRepossessions 109 705\nPartnership investments carrying amount 149,655 166,596\nDeferred tax assets 52,973 64,255\nAll other assets 49,940 56,215\nTotal accrued income and other assets $ 394,705 $ 427,779\nThe largest contributors to the decrease in accrued income and other assets from December 31, 2023, were decreases in partnership\ninvestments, the fair value of interest rate swap contracts with customers, accounts receivable and deferred tax assets, offset by\nincreased bank owned life insurance cash surrender value during the period.\nCAPITAL\nAs of September 30, 2024, total shareholders’ equity was $1.10 billion, up $114.69 million, or 11.59% from the $989.57 million at\nDecember 31, 2023. In addition to net income of $101.19 million, other significant changes in shareholders’ equity during the first nine\nmonths of 2024 included $25.54 million of dividends paid. The accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders’\nequity decreased to $71.23 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $106.32 million at December 31, 2023, due to changes in\nmarket conditions on our available-for-sale investment portfolio. Our shareholders’ equity-to-assets ratio was 12.60% as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to 11.34% at December 31, 2023. Book value per common share increased to $45.05 at September 30,\n2024, from $40.50 at December 31, 2023, primarily due to increased retained earnings and decreased accumulated other comprehensive\nlosses.\nWe declared and paid cash dividends per common share of $0.36 during the third quarter of 2024. The trailing four quarters dividend\npayout ratio, representing cash dividends per common share divided by diluted earnings per common share, was 26.34%. The dividend\npayout is continually reviewed by management and the Board of Directors subject to the Company’s capital and dividend policy.\nThe banking regulators have established guidelines for leverage capital requirements, expressed in terms of Tier 1 or core capital as a\npercentage of average assets, to measure the soundness of a financial institution.

Total net available liquidity\nwas $3.38 billion at September 30, 2024, which accounted for approximately 51% of total deposits net of brokered and listing services\ncertificates of deposit.\nOur loan to asset ratio was 75.49% at September 30, 2024 compared to 74.69% at December 31, 2023 and 74.53% at September 30,\n2023. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $169.36 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $129.67 million at December 31, 2023\nand $111.14 million at September 30, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to an increase in core deposits\nand the expected redemptions of investment securities available-for-sale. At September 30, 2024, the Consolidated Statements of\nFinancial Condition was rate sensitive by $496.59 million more liabilities than assets scheduled to reprice within one year, or\napproximately 0.89%. Management believes that the present funding sources provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash flow needs.\n34\nTable of Contents\nUnder Indiana law governing the collateralization of public fund deposits, the Indiana Board of Depositories determines which\nfinancial institutions are required to pledge collateral based on the strength of their financial ratings. We have been informed that no\ncollateral is required for our public fund deposits. However, the Board of Depositories could alter this requirement in the future and\nadversely impact our liquidity. Our potential liquidity exposure if we must pledge collateral is approximately $1.24 billion.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet income available to common shareholders for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 was $34.94 million and\n$101.19 million compared to $32.94 million and $96.50 million for the same periods in 2023. Diluted net income per common share\nwas $1.41 and $4.09 for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.32 and $3.87 earned for the same\nperiods in 2023. Return on average common shareholders’ equity was 13.02% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to 14.04% in 2023. The return on total average assets was 1.55% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared\nto 1.54% in 2023.\nNet income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the first nine months of 2023. Net interest income\nincreased and noninterest expense decreased offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses and a decrease in noninterest\nincome.

The net interest margin on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 3.64% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to 3.46% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the three month period ended September 30, 2024, average earning assets increased $309.76 million, up 3.89% over the\ncomparable period in 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $240.11 million or 4.31%. The yield on average earning assets\nincreased 57 basis points to 5.93% from 5.36% at September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher rates on loans and leases and higher\nbalances of other investments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances,\nFederal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock and commercial paper. Total cost of average interest-bearing\nliabilities increased 56 basis points to 3.27% from 2.71% as a result of higher rates on interest-bearing deposits and a rise in imputed\ninterest on mandatorily redeemable securities. The result to the tax-equivalent net interest margin, or the ratio of tax-equivalent net\ninterest income to average earning assets, was an increase of 18 basis points.\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe largest contributors to the improved yield on average earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023, was an increase in yields on loans and leases and higher balances of other investments,\nprimarily excess reserves held at the Federal Reserve Bank. The yield on loans and leases grew 57 basis points, mainly from rising\ninterest rates. Average loans and leases increased $359.79 million or 5.76%, primarily in the commercial real estate, renewable energy,\nconstruction equipment, auto and light truck, and residential real estate portfolios. Net interest recoveries positively contributed four\nbasis points to the yield on average loans and leases during the quarter and four basis points to the average loans and leases yield during\nthe prior year third quarter. Average investment securities decreased $106.69 million or 6.48%, primarily due to the use of proceeds\nfrom matured securities to fund loan growth. Average other investments, primarily held at the Federal Reserve Bank, increased $56.07\nmillion or 81.76%.\nAverage interest-bearing deposits increased $287.03 million, or 5.47% for the third quarter of 2024 over the same period in 2023\nprimarily in savings, time, and interest-bearing public fund deposits. The effective rate on average interest-bearing deposits increased\n55 basis points to 3.15% from 2.60%, in line with the competitive rate environment. Average noninterest-bearing deposits declined\n$102.71 million or 6.03% for the third quarter of 2024 over the same period in 2023, largely due to greater utilization of excess funds\nby our business customers, and a heightened rate sensitivity in our customer base given the overall level of market yields.\nAverage short-term borrowings decreased $39.52 million or 18.44% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.\nInterest on short-term borrowings decreased 52 basis points due to lower short-term FHLB borrowings and utilization of the Federal\nReserve’s Bank Term Funding Program. Interest on subordinated notes decreased two basis points during the third quarter of 2024 from\nthe same period a year ago due to a slight variable rate decrease on one tranche. Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable\nsecurities balances decreased $7.40 million or 15.91%, primarily from the maturity of long-term debt. Interest on long-term debt and\nmandatorily redeemable securities increased 1,006 basis points during the third quarter of 2024 from the same period in 2023, primarily\ndue to higher imputed interest on mandatorily redeemable securities from a larger increase in book value per share during the quarter\ncompared to the previous year’s third quarter. Mandatorily redeemable securities are issued under the terms of one of our executive\nincentive compensation plans and are settled based on book value per share with changes from the previous reporting date recorded as\ninterest expense.\n37\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAverage Interest Yield/ Average Interest Yield/\n(Dollars in thousands) Balance Income/Expense Rate Balance Income/Expense Rate\nASSETS\nInvestment securities available-for-sale:\nTaxable $ 1,537,066 $ 18,099 1.57 % $ 1,657,241 $ 18,512 1.49 %\nTax exempt(1) 30,057 962 4.28 % 46,385 1,413 4.07 %\nMortgages held for sale 3,257 162 6.64 % 2,489 114 6.12 %\nLoans and leases, net of unearned discount(1) 6,572,108 337,580 6.86 % 6,141,849 280,374 6.10 %\nOther investments 110,580 4,500 5.44 % 69,799 2,498 4.78 %\nTotal earning assets(1) 8,253,068 361,303 5.85 % 7,917,763 302,911 5.11 %\nCash and due from banks 62,277 70,288\nAllowance for loan and lease losses (150,127) (143,545)\nOther assets 545,805 523,548\nTotal assets $ 8,711,023 $ 8,368,054\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nInterest-bearing deposits $ 5,511,116 $ 126,621 3.07 % $ 5,143,493 $ 84,538 2.20 %\nShort-term borrowings:\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase 57,934 366 0.84 % 87,909 107 0.16 %\nOther short-term borrowings 168,234 6,403 5.08 % 133,965 5,047 5.04 %\nSubordinated notes 58,764 3,176 7.22 % 58,764 3,108 7.07 %\nLong-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities 41,633 2,850 9.14 % 46,174 2,219 6.43 %\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 5,837,681 139,416 3.19 % 5,470,305 95,019 2.32 %\nNoninterest-bearing deposits 1,598,711 1,776,202\nOther liabilities 163,091 143,086\nShareholders’ equity 1,037,809 919,182\nNoncontrolling interests 73,731 59,279\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 8,711,023 $ 8,368,054\nLess: Fully tax-equivalent adjustments (436) (575)\nNet interest income/margin (GAAP-derived)(1) $ 221,451 3.58 % $ 207,317 3.50 %\nFully tax-equivalent adjustments 436 575\nNet interest income/margin - FTE(1) $ 221,887 3.59 % $ 207,892 3.51 %\n(1) See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this section for additional information on this performance measure/ratio.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe taxable-equivalent net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $221.89 million, an increase of 6.73%\nover the same period in 2023. The net interest margin on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was 3.59% for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, compared to 3.51% for the same period in 2023.\nDuring the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, average earning assets increased $335.31 million, up 4.23% over the\ncomparable period in 2023. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $367.38 million or 6.72%. The yield on average earning assets\nincreased 74 basis points to 5.85% from 5.11% primarily due to higher rates on loans and leases and higher balances of other\ninvestments, which include federal funds sold, time deposits with other banks, Federal Reserve Bank excess balances, Federal Reserve\nBank and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock and commercial paper. Total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased 87\nbasis points to 3.19% from 2.32%, as a result of repricing of interest-bearing deposits and higher other short-term borrowings balances,\nwhich is predominately short-term FHLB borrowings and Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program borrowings. The result to the\nnet interest margin, or the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets, was a net eight basis point improvement.\nThe largest contributor to the improved yield on average earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, was an increase in yields on net loans and leases of 76 basis points primarily due to market\nconditions. Average loans and leases increased $430.26 million, up 7.01%. Net interest recoveries positively contributed five basis\npoints to the yield on average loans and leases during the first nine months of 2024 and two basis points during the first nine months of\n2023. Average mortgages held for sale increased $0.77 million or 30.86%. Average investment securities decreased $136.50 million or\n8.01%, which represents the use of proceeds from the maturity of securities to fund loan growth. Average other investments, primarily\nheld at the Federal Reserve Bank, increased $40.78 million or 58.43%.\n38\nTable of Contents\nAverage interest-bearing deposits increased $367.62 million or 7.15% for the first nine months of 2024 over the same period in 2023,\nprimarily due to increased time deposits, brokered deposits, savings account balances and interest-bearing public fund deposits. The\neffective rate on average interest-bearing deposits increased 87 basis points to 3.07% from 2.20%, mainly from rate competition in the\nmarket. Average noninterest-bearing deposits declined $177.49 million or 9.99% for the first nine months of 2024, over the same period\nin 2023, primarily due to persistent rate competition for deposits and greater utilization of excess funds by our business customers.\nAverage short-term borrowings increased $4.29 million or 1.94% for the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in\n2023. Interest on short-term borrowings increased 89 basis points due to higher Federal Reserve Bank Term Funding Program\nborrowings and lower securities sold under agreements to repurchase balances. Interest on subordinated notes increased 15 basis points\ndue to a variable rate increase on one tranche. Average long-term debt and mandatorily redeemable securities balances decreased $4.54\nmillion or 9.83%.

However, certain non-GAAP performance measures are used by management to\nevaluate and measure the Company’s performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual\ncomponents) and net interest margin (including its individual components). Management believes that these measures provide users of\nthe Company’s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities.\nManagement reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a\nfully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest\nincome on an equivalent before-tax basis. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-\nexempt sources.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, June 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCalculation of Net Interest Margin\n(A) Interest income (GAAP) $ 123,230 $ 121,169 $ 107,326 $ 360,867 $ 302,336\nFully tax-equivalent adjustments:\n(B) - Loans and leases 79 79 92 239 293\n(C) - Tax-exempt investment securities 65 65 78 197 282\n(D) Interest income - FTE (A+B+C) 123,374 121,313 107,496 361,303 302,911\n(E) Interest expense (GAAP) 47,744 47,119 38,090 139,416 95,019\n(F) Net interest income (GAAP) (A–E) 75,486 74,050 69,236 221,451 207,317\n(G) Net interest income - FTE (D–E) 75,630 74,194 69,406 221,887 207,892\n(H) Annualization factor 3.978 4.022 3.967 1.336 1.337\n(I) Total earning assets $ 8,273,301 $ 8,303,518 $ 7,963,537 $ 8,253,068 $ 7,917,763\nNet interest margin (GAAP-derived) (F*H)/I 3.63 % 3.59 % 3.45 % 3.58 % 3.50 %\nNet interest margin - FTE (G*H)/I 3.64 % 3.59 % 3.46 % 3.59 % 3.51 %\nPROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $3.11 million and $9.76 million compared\nto $0.86 million and $3.96 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Year-to-date net charge-offs of $4.99 million or 0.10% of average loans and\nleases have been recorded in 2024, compared to net recoveries of $0.85 million or 0.02% of average loans and leases through\nSeptember 30, 2023. Net charge-offs recognized in 2024 are principally concentrated in the commercial and agricultural portfolio.\n39\nTable of Contents\nThe provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was driven by a change in quantitative assumptions\nregarding the treatment of renewals for loans in special attention which increased historical loss rates primarily in the commercial and\nagricultural and construction equipment portfolios, a slight increase in the forecast adjustment due to a mixed forward economic\noutlook, and an increase in special attention outstandings which carry higher reserves, most notably in the auto and light truck and\ncommercial and agricultural portfolios. Risks include a fragile domestic GDP outlook, heightened geopolitical instability, tightened\ncredit conditions, a softening labor market, and continued elevated levels of inflation and interest rates. We remain concerned about the\npotential risks in our small business portfolio, as liquidity provided by government programs afforded to our lending clients dissipates.\nClients in our auto and light truck portfolio are experiencing softening rental rates and pockets of excess fleet inventory. Consumers\nremain under stress and economic imbalances are prevalent as rising consumer costs have tended to outpace income growth.\nImpairment reserves for assets individually evaluated total $1.55 million this quarter, consisting of accounts in our construction\nequipment and commercial and agricultural portfolios.\nWe continually evaluate risks which may impact our loan portfolios. Such risks include a cautious economic outlook and increased\nuncertainty fueled by widening conflicts around the world, and the Federal Reserve’s challenge of maintaining full employment, while\nbalancing inflation and interest rate concerns in the effort to maintain overall economic stability. The possibility for economic\ndisruption remains a concern, as geopolitical events and fragile growth prospects raise the potential for adverse impacts in the domestic\nand global economies. Higher interest rates apply downward pressure to asset values which collateralize our loans. Credit market\nconditions remain tightened. The growth outlook in the U.S. is mixed, and is susceptible to disruption caused by global conflicts and an\nenvironment of heightened instability. The upcoming domestic election presents additional uncertainty while highlighting increasing\ndivision within the electorate and uncompromising political partisanship. Political discord is also an ever-present threat in our Latin\nAmerican markets. Corruption scandals persist and U.S. border concerns are heightened. Globally, there is an ever-present threat of\nterrorism.\nOur aircraft portfolio exhibits collateral concentration and contains $304 million of foreign exposure at September 30, 2024, the\nmajority of which is in Mexico and Brazil. We review political and economic data for these countries on a regular basis to assess the\nimpact the environment may have on our customers. Historically, we have experienced volatile and unanticipated losses in both the\nforeign and domestic segments of our aircraft portfolios. Losses have been primarily attributable to unexpected declines in the value of\nspecific aircraft collateral at a time when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties. We review and assess aircraft values on an\nongoing basis and use a tiered approach to establish advance rates and amortization schedules to limit collateral exposure. We\ncontinually monitor individual customer performance and assess risks in the overall portfolio.\nOn September 30, 2024, 30 day and over loan and lease delinquency as a percentage of loan and lease balances was 0.31%, compared\nto 0.10% on September 30, 2023. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding at the end of\nthe period was 2.30% compared to 2.27% one year ago.

The increase in nonperforming\nassets during the first nine months of 2024 was related to higher nonaccrual loans and leases. The increase in nonperforming assets at\nSeptember 30, 2024 from September 30, 2023, was also related to an increase in nonaccrual loans and leases. There were no properties\nheld in other real estate at September 30, 2024.\nThe increase in nonaccrual loans and leases at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023, was predominantly in our construction\nequipment portfolio offset by lower balances in our commercial and agricultural portfolio due to charge-off activity during the year.

The market value of trust assets under management at September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023,\nwas $6.03 billion, $5.46 billion, and $4.96 billion, respectively. Positive equity market returns during the first nine months of 2024\nresulted in an increase in assets under management.\nService charges on deposit accounts was relatively flat during the three months ended September 30, 2024, but increased for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, over the comparable periods in 2023. The increase for the first nine months of 2024 primarily\nreflects a higher volume of business deposit account and consumer non-sufficient fund and overdraft fees.\nDebit card income increased during the three months ended September 30, 2024, but decreased for the first nine months of 2024\ncompared to the same periods a year ago. The increase during the third quarter was due to an overall increase in client transactions. The\nprimary driver of the decrease for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 was related to shifts in both client transaction behavior\nand the networks over which those merchants are routing transactions.\n41\n\nTable of Contents\nMortgage banking income increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in\n2023. The increase was primarily a result of higher production and margins on loans originated for the secondary market.\nInsurance commissions declined during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods a year ago.\nThe decrease was mainly due to decreased contingent commissions received.\nEquipment rental income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, over the comparable periods in 2023. The\ndecline was the result of a reduction in the average equipment rental portfolio by 42.4% over the same period a year ago, due to\nchanging customer preferences and competitive pricing pressures for new business.\nThere were no losses on available-for-sale investment securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nOther income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the comparable periods in 2023. The\ndecrease was primarily the result of decreased partnership investment gains on sale of renewable energy tax equity investments,\ncustomer interest rate swap fees, and a decline in bank owned life insurance policy claims recognized offset by a rise in brokerage\ncommissions and fees.\nNONINTEREST EXPENSE\nThe following table shows the details of noninterest expense.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNoninterest expense:\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 31,274 $ 28,866 $ 2,408 8.34 % $ 90,084 $ 85,699 $ 4,385 5.12 %\nNet occupancy 3,011 2,867 144 5.02 % 8,915 8,165 750 9.19 %\nFurniture and equipment 1,496 1,217 279 22.93 % 3,910 3,938 (28) (0.71)%\nData processing 7,002 6,289 713 11.34 % 20,214 18,714 1,500 8.02 %\nDepreciation – leased equipment 907 1,672 (765) (45.75)% 3,194 5,570 (2,376) (42.66)%\nProfessional fees 1,928 1,763 165 9.36 % 4,986 4,149 837 20.17 %\nFDIC and other insurance 1,423 1,598 (175) (10.95)% 4,707 4,302 405 9.41 %\nBusiness development and marketing 1,671 1,201 470 39.13 % 5,441 4,822 619 12.84 %\nOther 731 4,693 (3,962) (84.42)% 7,069 13,393 (6,324) (47.22)%\nTotal noninterest expense $ 49,443 $ 50,166 $ (723) (1.44)% $ 148,520 $ 148,752 $ (232) (0.16)%\nSalaries and employee benefits increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in\n2023. Higher base salaries were a result of normal merit increases, wage inflation, as well as a higher headcount due to fewer open\npositions compared to the previous year. Additionally, increases in incentive compensation were offset by a reduction in group\ninsurance claims.\nNet occupancy expense increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023.\nThe increase for both periods was primarily due to increased premises expenses and higher rent.\nFurniture and equipment expenses, including depreciation, increased during the third quarter of 2024, and were relatively flat during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods a year ago. The increase in the quarter was primarily due to\nincreased equipment repairs and purchases of furniture and equipment.\nData processing expense grew during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods a year ago\ndue primarily to higher computer processing charges and software maintenance expense on technology projects.\nDepreciation on leased equipment decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in\n2023. Depreciation on leased equipment correlates with the decrease in equipment rental income.\nProfessional fees were higher during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods a year ago.\nThe increase was primarily due to a $1.08 million reversal of accrued legal fees in the first quarter of 2023, as well as an increase in\naudit and examination fees and professional consulting fees during the year.\nFDIC and other insurance was lower during the third quarter of 2024, and was higher during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease for the quarter was the result of lower blanket bond insurance premiums due\nto a more cost effective policy renewal during the quarter. The increase for the first nine months of 2024 was mainly due to higher\nblanket bond insurance premiums as compared to the prior year.\n42\nTable of Contents\nBusiness development and marketing expense was higher during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the same\nperiods a year ago. The increases during the year were related to an increase in business meals, entertainment, travel opportunities, and\nmarketing promotions.\nOther expenses were lower during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023. The\ndecreases were primarily the result of a reduction in the provision for unfunded loan commitments, gains related to the sale of fixed\nassets, lower printing and postage costs, reduced data communication line charges, and a reduction in employment and relocation costs.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe provision for income taxes for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 was $10.47 million and $29.82 million\ncompared to $9.73 million and $28.64 million for the same periods in 2023. The effective tax rate was 23.07% and 22.80% for the\nquarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 22.76% and 22.88% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023, respectively. The increase in the quarterly effective tax rate was due to higher permanent book and tax differences in relationship\nto pretax income in 2024 compared to 2023.\nITEM 3.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere have been no material changes in market risks faced by 1st Source since December 31, 2023.

The audience is advised that various important factors could cause 1st Source’s actual results or\ncircumstances for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in such forward-looking statements. Please\nrefer to our press releases, Form 10-Qs, and 10-Ks concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any\nforward-looking statements of which we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe accounting and reporting policies of 1st Source conform to generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United\nStates and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures are used by management to\nevaluate and measure the Company’s performance. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to\nevaluate a financial institution, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for\nanalyses of results as reported under GAAP. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual\ncomponents), net interest margin (including its individual components), the efficiency ratio, tangible common equity-to-tangible assets\nratio, pre-tax pre-provision income and tangible book value per common share. Management believes that these measures provide\nusers of the Company’s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the interest-earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities and of the Company’s operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these\nmeasures differently. See the slides titled “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP\nfinancial measures used by the Company with their most closely related GAAP measures.\n2\npage\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW\nFounded in 1863\n$8.8 billion Community Bank with\nInternational Reach headquartered in\nSouth Bend, Indiana\nCommunity Banking\n\nLocations throughout northern Indiana and southwestern Michigan\n\nBusiness and personal banking, payment services, lending, mortgage, and leasing\n\nInvestment management, wealth advisory, estate planning, and retirement planning services\n\nBusiness and consumer insurance sales\nRenewable Energy Financing\n\nNational footprint\n\nConstruction loans, permanent loans, and tax equity investments\n\nCommunity solar, commercial and industrial, small utility scale, university, and municipal projects\n\nEnergy storage solutions\nSpecialty Finance\n\nNational and international footprint\n\nAuto rental and leasing\n\nTruck rental and leasing\n\nConstruction machinery\n\nCorporate and personal aircraft\n3\npage\nMISSION & VISION\nMission\nTo help our clients achieve security, build\nwealth and realize their dreams by offering\nstraight talk, sound advice and keeping their\nbest interests in mind for the long-term.\nVision\n\nOffer our clients the highest\nquality service\n\nBe the financial institution of choice in\neach market we serve\n\nRemain independent and nurture pride\nof ownership among all 1st Source\ncolleagues\n\nSupport a proud family of colleagues\nwho personify the 1st Source spirit of\npartnership\n\nAchieve long-term, superior\nfinancial results\n4\npage\nMARKET AREA Specialty\nFinance\nLoans & Leases\n$3.47 billion\nCommunity\nBank\nLoans & Leases\n$3.16 billion\n5\npage\nBUSINESS MIX\nLoans & Leases\nBusiness Personal\n75% 25%\nCOMMUNITY BANKING SPECIALTY FINANCE\n48% 52%\n6\npage\nCOMMUNITY BANKING\n77\nBanking Centers\n97\nTwenty-four-hour ATMs\n9\nTrust & Wealth Advisory locations with approximately\n$6.0 billion of assets under management\n10\n1st Source Insurance offices\n3\nLoan Production offices\nIn person Over the phone Online Mobile\n7\npage\nRENEWABLE ENERGY\nFINANCING\nOur Renewable Energy Financing Division provides sponsors and developers with\none-stop-shop financing by providing construction loans, permanent loans, and tax equity\ninvestments to community solar, commercial and industrial, small utility scale, university,\nand municipal projects.
