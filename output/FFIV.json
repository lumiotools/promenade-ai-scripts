This powerful containerized solution optimizes performance, observability, and protection capabilities—all leading to reduced costs. Integrated with F5’s portfolio, AI Gateway gives security and operations teams a seamless path to adopting AI services through significantly improved data output quality and a superior user experience. \n\nAccording to F5’s [State of AI Application Strategy Report](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.f5.com%2Fresources%2Freports%2Fstate-of-ai-application-strategy-report&esheet=54150607&newsitemid=20241112358635&lan=en-US&anchor=State+of+AI+Application+Strategy+Report&index=2&md5=1ef330a5a814ab8b991aa9cb1d18580d), 75% of enterprises are implementing AI. Like countless modern applications, AI services are largely delivered and consumed via APIs. However, enterprises face many additional challenges in architecting and scaling AI-fluent apps and services. As an example, efficient operations require close monitoring of increasingly relevant metrics such as GPU compute costs and system responsiveness, as well as emerging regulatory compliance concerns. \n\n“LLMs are unlocking new levels of productivity and enhanced user experiences for customers, but they also require oversight, deep inspection at inference-time, and defense against new types of threats,” said Kunal Anand, Chief Innovation Officer at F5. “By addressing these new requirements and integrating with F5’s trusted solutions for API traffic management, we’re enabling customers to confidently and efficiently deploy AI-powered applications in a massively larger threat landscape.” \n\nReal-world AI solutions require optimized request, response, and prompt interactions across an entire data ecosystem. F5 AI Gateway observes, optimizes, and secures a vast number of user and automated variables to offer cost reductions, mitigate malicious threats, and ensure regulatory compliance. \n\nF5 AI Gateway is designed to meet customers—and their apps—at the ideal place in their AI journey. It can be deployed in any cloud or data center and will natively integrate with F5’s [NGINX](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.f5.com%2Fproducts%2Fnginx&esheet=54150607&newsitemid=20241112358635&lan=en-US&anchor=NGINX&index=3&md5=c82607a7782b32d1153fb3f0af57e61d) and [BIG-IP](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.f5.com%2Fproducts%2Fbig-ip&esheet=54150607&newsitemid=20241112358635&lan=en-US&anchor=BIG-IP&index=4&md5=cdcf489605fd313cc3c8ae4f1729edb3) platforms to take advantage of F5’s leading app security and delivery services in traditional, multicloud, or edge deployments. In addition, the solution’s open extensibility enables organizations to develop and customize programmable security and controls enforced by F5 AI Gateway. These processes can be easily updated and applied dynamically to drive instant adherence to security policies and compliance mandates. \n\n“AI-powered applications will become a cornerstone for nearly every business and organization in the coming years,” said Shari Lava, Senior Director, AI and Automation at IDC. “F5’s introduction of an AI gateway to its application stack of services enables its customers to have greater flexibility in how they build their AI application structure, but still have enhanced protection and model optimization.” \n\nF5 AI Gateway: \n\n  * Delivers security and compliance policy enforcement with automated detection and remediation against the risks [identified](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fowasp.org%2Fwww-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications%2F&esheet=54150607&newsitemid=20241112358635&lan=en-US&anchor=identified&index=5&md5=42e42292312b25535908cf8b868b9aae) in the OWASP Top Ten for LLM Applications. \n  * Offloads duplicate tasks from LLMs with semantic caching, enhancing the user experience and reducing operations costs. \n  * Streamlines integration processes, allowing developers to focus on building out AI-powered applications rather than managing complex infrastructures. \n  * Optimizes load balancing, traffic routing, and rate limiting for local and third-party LLMs to maintain service availability and enhance performance. \n  * Provides a single API interface that developers can use to access their AI model of choice. \n\n\n\n“F5’s AI Gateway is an integral part of our AI strategy,” said Austin Geraci, CTO of [WorldTech IT](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com%2F%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwtit.com%252F%26data%3D05%257C02%257CJ.Ramsay%2540f5.com%257C154512ddb74445041dab08dcf9b0a6e9%257Cdd3dfd2f6a3b40d19be0bf8327d81c50%257C0%257C0%257C638659784387416258%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%253D%253D%257C0%257C%257C%257C%26sdata%3D6QUqqD7qY2ep6Zm5rB8qNSONz1ThgtZgQ7rnti67DS0%253D%26reserved%3D0&esheet=54150607&newsitemid=20241112358635&lan=en-US&anchor=WorldTech+IT&index=6&md5=1cb34127dd75e2141ab43b7db6aed3c1). “With this technology, our customers are able to develop both internal and external-facing AI applications capable of handling a surge in queries without degradation to site and application performance. F5 brings leading app security and delivery capabilities to accelerate AI experiences at scale.

Additional information about non-GAAP financial information is included in this release.\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nFor fiscal year 2025, F5 expects to deliver total revenue growth of 4% to 5%, and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% over fiscal year 2024. On a tax-neutral basis, the midpoint of F5’s fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance reflects 10% growth year over year.\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, F5 expects to deliver revenue in the range of $705 million to $725 million, with non-GAAP earnings in the range of $3.29 to $3.41 per diluted share.\n\n**$1 Billion Authorized for Share Repurchases**\n\nF5 also announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized an additional $1 billion for its common stock repurchase program. This new authorization is incremental to the $422 million remaining in the existing program.\n\nAll forward-looking non-GAAP measures included in the Company’s business outlook exclude estimates for amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation expenses, significant effects of tax legislation and judicial or administrative interpretation of tax regulations (including the impact of income tax reform), non-recurring income tax adjustments, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP exclusions, and do not include the impact of any future acquisitions or divestitures, acquisition-related charges and write-downs, restructuring charges, facility exit costs, or other non-recurring charges that may occur in the period. F5 is unable to provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings guidance measures to corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability and low visibility of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future GAAP results. Certain exclusions, such as amortization of intangible assets and share-based compensation expenses, are generally incurred each quarter, but the amounts have historically varied and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\n\n**Live Webcast and Conference Call**\n\nF5 will host a live webcast to review its financial results and outlook today, October 28, 2024, at 4:30 pm ET.

All forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available as of the date hereof and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. F5 assumes no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements.\n\n**GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation**\n\nF5’s management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various operating measures. These measures are generally based on the revenues of its products, services operations, and certain costs of those operations, such as cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. One such measure is GAAP net income excluding, as applicable, stock-based compensation, amortization, and impairment of purchased intangible assets, facility-exit costs, acquisition-related charges, net of taxes, restructuring charges, and certain non-recurring tax expenses and benefits, which is a non-GAAP financial measure under Section 101 of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This measure of non-GAAP net income is adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefit that the Company would accrue if it used non-GAAP results instead of GAAP results to calculate the Company’s tax liability.\n\nThe non-GAAP adjustments, and F5's basis for excluding them from non-GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:\n\n_Stock-based compensation._ Stock-based compensation consists of expense for stock options, restricted stock, and employee stock purchases through the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Although stock-based compensation is an important aspect of the compensation of F5’s employees and executives, management believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expenses to better understand the long-term performance of the Company’s core business and to facilitate comparison of the Company’s results to those of peer companies.\n\n_Amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets._ Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. On a non-recurring basis, when certain events or circumstances are present, management may also be required to write down the carrying value of its purchased intangible assets and recognize impairment charges. Management does not believe these charges accurately reflect the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations; therefore, they are not considered by management in making operating decisions. However, investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to F5’s revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to F5’s future period revenues as well.\n\n_Facility-exit costs._ F5 has incurred certain non-recurring right-of-use asset impairment charges, and other related recurring costs in connection with the exit of its leased facilities. These charges are not representative of the ongoing activity or costs to the business. As a result, these charges are being excluded to provide investors with a more comparable measure of costs associated with ongoing operations.\n\n_Acquisition-related charges, net._ F5 does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle and the terms and scope of each transaction can vary significantly and are unique to each transaction. F5 excludes acquisition-related charges from its non-GAAP financial measures to provide a useful comparison of the Company’s operating results to prior periods and to its peer companies. Acquisition-related charges consist of planning, execution and integration costs incurred directly as a result of an acquisition.\n\n_Restructuring charges._ F5 has incurred restructuring charges that are included in its GAAP financial statements, primarily related to workforce reductions and costs associated with exiting facility-lease commitments. F5 excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating its continuing business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the restructuring action and do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of its business.\n\nManagement believes that non-GAAP net income per share provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the Company’s core business operations and facilitates comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results. Although F5’s management finds this non-GAAP measure to be useful in evaluating the performance of the core business, management’s reliance on this measure is limited because items excluded from such measures could have a material effect on F5’s earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, F5’s management will use its non-GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, in conjunction with GAAP earnings and earnings per share measures, to address these limitations when evaluating the performance of the Company’s core business. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.\n\nF5 believes that presenting its non-GAAP measures of earnings and earnings per share provides investors with an additional tool for evaluating the performance of the Company’s core business and is used by management in its own evaluation of the Company’s performance. Investors are encouraged to look at GAAP results as the best measure of financial performance. However, while the GAAP results are more complete, the Company provides investors these supplemental measures since, with reconciliation to GAAP, it may provide additional insight into the Company’s operational performance and financial results.\n\nFor reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please see the section in our attached Condensed Consolidated Income Statements entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n\n**About F5**\n\nF5 is a multicloud application security and delivery company committed to bringing a better digital world to life.​​​​​​​ F5 partners with the world’s largest, most advanced organizations to secure every app — on premises, in the cloud, or at the edge.
