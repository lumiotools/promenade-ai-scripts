(ii) New Forafric formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Globis NV Merger 2 Corp., a Nevada corporation (“** _Merger Sub_** ”); (iii) Globis merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving (the “** _Merger_** ”); (iv) an agent was appointed to act on behalf of Globis stockholders such that, subject to and immediately following the completion of the Merger, the agent entered into a contribution and subscription agreement with New Forafric (the “** _Contribution Agreement_** ”) pursuant to which the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Merger Sub issued pursuant to the Merger will be exchanged (the “** _Exchange_** ”), on a one-for-one basis, for ordinary shares, nominal value $0.001 per share, of New Forafric (the “** _Ordinary Shares_** ”); and (v) on June 9, 2022, New Forafric acquired 100% of the equity interests in FAHL from Lighthouse Capital Limited (“** _Seller_** ”) and FAHL became a direct subsidiary of New Forafric.\n\nIn connection with the special meeting of the stockholders of Globis held on June 7, 2022, which was adjourned and was reconvened on June 9, 2022 (the “** _Special Meeting_** ”) and the Business Combination, holders of 9,612,536 shares of Common Stock, exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of $10.30 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $99 million, which was paid from Globis’ trust account established at the consummation of its initial public offering (the “** _Trust Account_** ”).\n\nAs a result of the Business Combination, (i) Globis stockholders received one Ordinary Share for each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Globis (the “ **_Common Stock_** ”) held prior to the Merger; (ii) the issued and outstanding redeemable warrants that were registered pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-1 (SEC File No. 333-250939) of Globis automatically became redeemable warrants to acquire Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $11.50 per share on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement, dated December 10, 2020, between Globis and VStock Transfer, LLC (the “Warrant Agreement”), with the Warrant Agreement being assigned and novated by Globis to New Forafric but no other changes made to the terms of any issued and outstanding Public Warrants as a result of the Merger; (iii) each issued and outstanding warrant of Globis issued in a private placement automatically became warrants to acquire Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $11.50 per share on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement (no other changes were made to the terms of any issued and outstanding private placement warrants as a result of the Merger); and (iv) each issued and outstanding unit of Globis that had not been previously separated into the underlying Common Stock and underlying warrant upon the request of the holder thereof, were cancelled and entitled the holder thereof to one Ordinary Share and one redeemable warrant to acquire one Ordinary Share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement.\n\nFurther as a result of the Business Combination, the Seller will be paid the principal sum of $20,000,000 together with interest on the the outstanding amount from the Closing Date up to the date of payment (computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve (12) months of thirty (30) days) accrued but unpaid thereon at the fixed per annum rate of 8%. The payment shall be made on the first anniversary of the the closing of the Business Combination. If any amount of principal and/or interest thereon is unpaid after such due date, Globis shall pay the Seller additional interest on the outstanding amount at the per annum rate of 12% (or at such lower rate as shall be the highest rate permitted under applicable usury laws).\n\nAs of the opening of trading on June 10, Ordinary Shares of New Forafric and warrants redeemable into Ordinary Shares, began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“** _Nasdaq_** ”) as “AFRI” and “AFRIW”, respectively.\n\nA description of the Business Combination and the terms of the Business Combination Agreement are included in the proxy statement/prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “** _SEC_** ”) on May 12, 2022 in the section entitled “Proposal 3: The Business Combination Proposal” beginning on page 82 of the proxy statement/ prospectus incorporated herein by reference.\n\nAs previously disclosed, on December 31, 2021, Globis entered into a Subscription Agreement (the “** _PIPE Subscription Agreement_** ”) with an accredited investor (the “** _PIPE Investor_** ”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investor purchased Ordinary Share of New Forafric in a private placement following the Redomiciliation, Merger, and Exchange and prior to the closing of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the PIPE Subscription Agreement, the PIPE Investor purchased, at a purchase price of $10.50 per share, a number of Ordinary Shares (the “** _PIPE Shares_** ”) that was equal to lesser of (i) 4.99% of all issued and outstanding ordinary shares, after taking into account the completion of the Business Combination and all ordinary shares issued pursuant to the FAHL Bonds (defined below) and other related subscription agreements, if any, and (ii) 1,904,761 ordinary shares (the “** _PIPE Investment_** ”). The closing of the PIPE Investment was contingent upon, among other things, the substantially concurrent consummation of the Business Combination. On June 9, 2022, substantially concurrently with the Closing, the sale of the PIPE Shares was consummated, pursuant to which the PIPE Investor purchased an aggregate of 1,320,195 Ordinary Shares of New Forafric for total gross proceeds to New Forafric of approximately $13.9 million.\n\nA description of the PIPE Subscription Agreement is included in the proxy statement/prospectus beginning on page 128 of the proxy statement/prospectus.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in connection with the Business Combination, between December 31, 2021 and January 3, 2022, investors (each a “** _Bond Investor_** ”) subscribed for convertible bonds of FAHL, as issuer, in an aggregate principal amount of $11.5 million (the “** _FAHL Bonds_** ”) in a private placement, issued pursuant to a Bond Subscription Deed (the “** _Bond Subscription Deed_** ”), among FAHL, the Seller and the Bond Investors. Unless earlier converted or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the FAHL Bonds, the FAHL Bonds were to mature and be redeemed on June 15, 2026. Interest accrued on the FAHL Bonds at a rate of 6% per annum and the Bond Investors were entitled to certain customary information rights. Pursuant to the current terms of the FAHL Bonds, upon consummation of the Business Combination, the FAHL Bonds were novated to New Forafric and automatically convert into 1,248,426 Ordinary Shares of New Forafric (the “** _Bond Shares_** ”) at a price per share of $9.45, which was a 10% discount to the PIPE Investment. The number of Ordinary Shares was equal to the quotient that results from dividing the aggregate principal amount of the respective FAHL Bond plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon by $9.45, subject to certain adjustments. The Bond Investors include affiliates Up and Up Capital, LLC and Globis SPAC LLC, the sponsors of Globis, who subscribed for an aggregate principal amount of $9 million of the FAHL Bonds, which converted into 977,659 Ordinary Shares of New Forafric.\n\nAs previously disclosed, certain parties affiliated with FAHL held outstanding loans issued to FAHL (the “**FAHL Related Party Loans** ”), which, in the aggregate, equaled approximately $15.1 million as of the Closing of the Business Combination. The FAHL Related Party Loans were interest-free loans with no maturity date. Upon consummation of the Business Combination, all FAHL Related Party Loans were paid off or novated to New Forafric and converted into 1,445,164 Ordinary Shares of New Forafric at a price of $10.50 per share (the “** _Loan Shares_** ”).\n\nAs used hereafter in this Current Report on Form 8-K, unless otherwise stated or the context indicates otherwise, the terms the “Company,” “Registrant,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to New Forafric, after giving effect to the Business Combination.\n\n**Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.**\n\nForafric Maroc, a whollyowned subsidiary of FAHL, has entered into a Framework Agreement dated December 22, 2021 with ALAPALA Foreign Trade LLC. (ALAPALA), in for the extension of 3 existing mills and the construction of 3 new mills. This program will create a daily wheat and durum processing capacity of 2.370 metric tons within the next 30 months. Forafric Maroc’s present crushing capacity is 2.420 metric tons per day.\n\n**Item 1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement**\n\nOn June 9, 2022, in connection with the Business Combination, the FAHL Related Party Loans were repaid at the Closing of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the terms of the FAHL Related Party Loans, $15.1 million of the such loans was converted into 1,445,164 Ordinary Shares of New Forafric at a price of $10.50 per share at the option of the lender, the FAHL Related Party Loans were cancelled and terminated thereafter.\n\n**Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets**\n\nThe disclosure set forth in the “ _Introductory Note_ ” above is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.01.\n\nAt the Special Meeting, Globis’ stockholders approved the Business Combination. On June 9, 2022, the parties to the Business Combination Agreement completed the Business Combination. Immediately after giving effect to the completion of the Business Combination (including the redemption of 9,612,536 shares of Common Stock), and the issuance of the PIPE Shares, the Bond Shares and the Loan Shares, New Forafric had the following outstanding securities:\n\n● | approximately 26,456,844 Ordinary Shares;  \n---|---  \n● | approximately 15,789,722 warrants, each exercisable for one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per share.  \n  \nThe material terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement are described in the section “Proposal 3: The Business Combination Proposal” beginning on page 82 of the proxy statement/prospectus, which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**FORM 10 INFORMATION**\n\nItem 2.01(f) of this Current Report on Form 8-K states that if the predecessor registrant was a shell company, as Globis was immediately before the Business Combination, then the registrant must disclose the information that would be required if the registrant were filing a general form for registration of securities on Form 10.

Additionally, FAHL’s historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future._\n\n**Overview**\n\n**Key Factors Affecting Our Performance**\n\nThe key factors affecting the performance of our business are described below:\n\nCost of Raw material. The cost of wheat is almost 90% of total cost in our business. Fluctuation on the price of the wheat has a direct impact on our performance. The cost of wheat depends on weather, supply and demand and strategies of main international producers. The cost of raw material depends also on freight cost and currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nIndustrial cost. The crushing cost is the second main factor affecting our performance. This cost includes equipment, labor and interest over financing. To perform on our business, we have to maintain this cost below 30 USD per ton produced. To achieve this performance, we have to monitor energy, equipment usage, logistics, human resources and financial cost.\n\nAverage selling price. The average selling price is based on the two components:\n\n● | Price of flour/Semolina  \n---|---  \n● | Price of Bran  \n  \nBran is between 20% to 25% of the production of finished products. We have no impact on the price of the bran.\n\nOn the price of finished product, we can have a limited impact due to high concurrency on the market.\n\n**Impact of COVID-19**\n\nWe believe that COVID-19 did not have any material impact on our sales. We believe that this is because we produce a staple food product, the demand for which was not materially affected by the pandemic. During the first three months of 2022, we experienced increases in raw material, freight and shipping costs, which may be attributable to general increases in shipping and logistics costs during the pandemic as a result of higher global demand for wheat and inflationary pressures; however, due to our ability to increase sale prices and the subsidies provided by the Government of Morocco, these increases in our costs of goods did not have a material adverse impact on our business.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could impact our supply chain for products we sell, particularly as a result of mandatory shutdowns in locations where our products are manufactured or held for distribution. We could also see significant disruptions of the operations of our logistics, service providers, delays in shipments and negative impacts to pricing of certain of our products. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions of the operations of our logistics, service providers, or delays in shipments, and based on current trends, we do not anticipate supply chain disruptions through the end of 2022.\n\nAt this time, we do not foresee supply chain disruptions having a material adverse affect on our business goals, results of operations or capital resources.\n\n**The War in Ukraine**\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched an invasion in Ukraine. The invasion may severely disrupt or depress wheat harvests in Ukraine and Ukraine’s ability to export wheat. In addition, as a consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and other countries have imposed sanctions against and penalties for doing business in Russia and with certain Russian-owned businesses. These sanctions may limit Russia’s ability to export wheat. Because Ukraine accounts for approximately 10% of the world’s wheat exports and Russa accounts for approximately 16% of the world’s wheat exports, the continuation of the war between Ukraine and Russia could lead to a material reduction in the availability of wheat on the international market which could in turn affect our ability to obtain raw materials or result in substantial increases in prices of raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business.\n\nFAHL has not purchased, and has no contracts to purchase raw materials from either Ukraine or Russia in 2022. FAHL has also in recent years diversified its sources of supply, and purchases most of its raw materials from European countries, as well as Argentina and Brazil. New Forafric believes that as a result, it will have adequate sources of supply of raw materials for the 2022 calendar year. Although wheat prices have continued to rise since the beginning of 2022, New Forafric has not determined at this time that there is a clear trend that prices will continue to increase at the same pace for the remainder of 2022. Further, New Forafric its sales margins in Morocco. Further, because its products are staple food products, New Forafric believes it will be able to increase prices in other markets to offset currently anticipated changes in raw material and logistic costs in 2022.\n\nBecause New Forafric does not currently have any business operations in Russia and is not purchasing raw materials from suppliers in Russia in 2022, the sanctions regime imposed upon Russia does not currently directly impact New Forafric’s business.\n\n**Key Components of Results of Operations**\n\nNet sales, cost of goods sold and gross profit figures are calculated with the following method:\n\nNet sales: Total consolidated sales;\n\nCost of goods sold: includes cost of raw materials, cost of freight, cost of foreign exchange and cost of improvements used in the production; and\n\nGross profit: the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold.\n\nThe key components of our results of operation are:\n\nPrice of raw materials, which is affected by many factors, including global and regional supply, which in turn is impacted by factors such as weather conditions, local planting decisions, crop failure, reduced harvests, governmental policies (including both tariffs and subsidies), and other agricultural conditions, as well as local, regional, and international demand. The price of raw materials increased during the first three months of 2022 over the same period for 2021.\n\nCost of freight, which is impacted by shipping availability, international demand, labor shortages, strikes, regional conflicts, inadequate or obsolete port infrastructure and other factors.\n\nForeign exchange rates, which are continually fluctuating due to the relative economic strengths or governmental policies of different countries.\n\nHuman resources productivity, which may be impacted by the training and skills of the available workforce, the nature of tools and facilities in place, financial incentives and other factors over which we do not have any control.\n\nPower consumption and costs, which may be affected by governmental policies, including green energy initiatives and the age and efficiency of existing and newly acquired facilities.\n\nOur Results of Operations depends primarily on the cost of raw materials and on our industrial cost.\n\nIn our business, most raw materials are imported from Europe, South America, Black Sea and Canada (for durum). In Morocco, there is production of wheat but the quality is generally not high enough for industrial usage. The variation of the cost of raw materials has a huge impact on our business and can explain the changes in the result of operation form period to period.\n\nIndustrial cost is the second main component of our result of operation. The industrial cost includes human resources, cost of equipment, maintenance, power consumption and financial cost as main components.

As of December 31, 2021, FAHL had borrowed $79.5 million and had unused availability of $0.5 million under such credit lines. FAHL has also entered into credit agreements for asset-based credit facilities in order to fund wheat raw material purchases (“Wheat Credit Facilities”). The Wheat Credit Facilities provide the ability to borrow funds under consolidated lines of credit of up to approximately $105.0 million as of March 31, 2022 and $100.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The Wheat Credit Facilities are secured by inventory. The Wheat Credit Facilities must be renewed on a semi-annual basis.

As of March 31, 2022, FAHL has, in addition to its obligations under the working capital credit lines and the Wheat Credit Facilities, $6.4 million in lease obligations. FAHL believes it has sufficient capital available to it to fulfill such obligations.\n\n_Cash and Cash Equivalents -_ Cash and cash equivalents were $21.1 million and $14.4 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy, the objectives of which are to preserve the principal value of our cash assets, maintain a high degree of liquidity and deliver competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions.\n\n_Trade accounts receivable, net_ - Trade accounts receivable, net were $38.9 million and $32.3 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\n_Inventories -_ Inventories were $24.2 million and $37.6 million at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\n\n**COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\nThe Company has commitments with banks to finance its operating activities. FAHL has provided collateral and mortgages to banks of $25,464, as of March 31, 2022. From time to time FAHL has been involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. These matters may relate to employment and labor claims, patent and intellectual property claims, claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations. When applicable, FAHL has recorded accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Defense costs are expensed as incurred and are included in professional fees. While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against FAHL cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management, individually or in the aggregate, no such lawsuits and other proceedings had or are expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements in 2022 and 2021. As of the three months ended March 31, 2022, there were no lawsuits or other proceedings commenced against FAHL, that in the opinion of management, individually or in the aggregate, had or are expected to have a material effect on the unconsolidated financial statements of FAHL as of such date, and, no such lawsuits and other proceedings had or are expected to have a material effect on such unconsolidated financial statements.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nOur accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this S-4 Registration Statement. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make substantial judgment or estimation in their application that may significantly affect reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\n\nRevenue Recognition – FAHL follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The majority of FAHL’s contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less. FAHL applies the practical expedient in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) paragraph 606-10-50-14 of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. Trade discounts or volume rebates are recognized as a deduction in revenue. No payment terms beyond one year are granted at contract inception.\n\nRevenue related to the sale of goods and equipment is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer. FAHL recognizes revenue from these contracts at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer, generally when legal title and risks and rewards transfer to the customer. Sales terms typically provide for transfer of title at the time and point of delivery and acceptance of the product being sold.\n\nAmounts received from customers prior to revenue recognition on a contract are recorded as contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nShipping and Handling Costs – Shipping and handling costs related to contracts with customers for the sale of goods are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and are included in cost of sales. Accordingly, amounts billed to customers for such costs are included as a component of revenues.\n\nTaxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities – FAHL does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers, in the measurement of transactions prices or as a component of revenues and cost of sales.\n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Credit Losses – We provide credit terms to customers in-line with industry standards, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical experience recorded. We analyze the aging of customer accounts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Customer balances are written off after all collection efforts are exhausted. Estimated product returns, which have not been material, are deducted from sales at the time of shipment.\n\nOther Receivables – Other receivables include government subsidies for the production and sale of flour. The Moroccan government provides a fixed subsidy based on production and customer. Subsidies are paid by the Moroccan government twice a year based on sales of flour for the previous six months. The Company records the flour subsidies as a credit against the related costs that the subsidies were intended to offset in the same periods that the costs were incurred within the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nIncome Taxes – The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable in Morocco and local jurisdictions, and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period. We account for uncertain tax positions using a “more-likely-than-not” threshold. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position, or the statute of limitations concerning such issues lapses.\n\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions FAHL’s functional currency is the Moroccan dirham, and its presentation currency is the United States Dollar (“USD”). The functional currency is translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts using currency exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted-average exchange rate during the fiscal year. The transactions in foreign currency (that is a different currency than the functional currency of the entity) are converted at the exchange rate prevailing to the date of the transaction. The assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are evaluated in the current period on the date of the closing or at the opening rate, when applicable. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of equity in Accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and intercompany debt that is not of a long-term investment nature are included in (Gain) loss on foreign currency exchange in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\n\nInventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. FAHL’s inventory is valued using the weighted average cost method. The costs of finished goods inventories include raw materials, labor, and overhead costs.\n\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment - Property, plant, and equipment are stated at acquisition cost, plus capitalized interest on borrowings during the actual construction period of major capital projects. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\n**Assets** | **Useful Lives**  \n---|---  \nBuildings | 39 years  \nMachinery and equipment (technical installations) | 30-50 years  \nOther assets | 5-30 years  \n  \nBuilding improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets or the remaining useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful life or remaining lease term. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance, which do not improve or extend the life of the assets, are expensed as incurred.\n\nWe perform impairment tests when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment include deteriorations in operating cash flows, the anticipated sale or disposal of an asset group, and other significant changes in business conditions. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. FAHL’s assessment of recoverability of property, plant and equipment is performed on a reporting unit level. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of such asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of such asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n**Assets** | **Useful Lives**  \n---|---  \nTrademarks | Indefinite  \nCustomer relationships | 20 years  \nPatents and licenses | 5-10 years  \nComputer software | 5-10 years  \nOther intangible assets | 3-10 years  \n  \nRecognized intangible assets, exclusive of goodwill, are amortized over the useful lives of the assets unless that life is determined to be indefinite. All of our intangible assets, exclusive of goodwill, are finite lived. All amortization expense related to intangible assets is recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nGoodwill is evaluated annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances require an interim assessment. We assess goodwill for impairment (as of December 31) at the reporting unit level using income and market approaches, employing significant assumptions regarding growth, discount rates, and profitability at each reporting unit. Our estimates under the income approach are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. The market approach uses a market multiple methodologies employing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and applies a range of multiples to those amounts in determining the indicated fair value. In determining the multiples used in this approach, we obtain the multiples for selected peer companies using the most recent publicly available information. In determining the indicated fair value of each reporting unit, FAHL concludes based on the income approach, and uses the market approach to corroborate, as FAHL believes the income approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair value of the reporting units. The resulting value is then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if impairment is necessary.\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\n**_Adopted_**\n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance, which improves the transparency of government assistance received by most business entities by requiring the disclosure of: (1) the types of government assistance received; (2) the accounting for such assistance; and (3) the effect of the assistance on a business entity’s financial statements. This guidance is effective for the Company’s interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Adoption of the guidance had no impact on FAHL’s results of operations, balance sheet, or cash flows.\n\n**_Not Yet Adopted_**\n\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, _Business Combinations_ (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with ASC Topic 606, _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_. This guidance will be effective for the Company’s interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. FAHL is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn March 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides temporary optional guidance to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. These transactions include contract modifications, hedging relationships, and the sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. Entities may apply the ASU from March 12, 2021 through December 31, 2022. FAHL is currently evaluating the impact of this new ASU on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and expects no material impact.\n\n**Directors and Executive Officers**\n\nInformation with respect to New Forafric’s directors and executive officers after the Closing is set forth in the proxy statement/prospectus in the sections entitled “Management of New Forafric Following the Business Combination” beginning on page 189 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**_Directors_**\n\nAs previously disclosed, at the Special Meeting, on June 7, 2022, Saad Bendidi, Julien Benitah, Franco Cassar, James Lasry, Paul Packer, Ira Greenstein, and Rachel Bitan were elected to serve as directors of the Company for a term expiring at New Forafric’s 2025 annual general meeting or the earlier termination of his or her term of office.

The date of that determination is the Performance Measurement Date and (subject to rule 5.3 and rule 6.1), the Awards will be Released on the Release Date or lapse accordingly, in whole or in part.  \n  \n10  \n---  \n  \n5.3 | The Release Date shall be the later of the Performance Measurement Date, and the first Dealing Day following the end of the Employment Period.

and  \n---|---  \n(b) | rule 7.4 applies.  \n  \n11  \n---  \n  \n7.2 | This rule 7.2 applies in relation to an Award if the Board, at its discretion, determines that any of the following circumstances exist:  \n---|---  \n(a) | the Award Holder has participated in or was responsible for conduct which resulted in significant losses to a Group Company;  \n---|---  \n(b) | the Award Holder has failed to meet appropriate standards of fitness and propriety;  \n(c) | the Company has reasonable evidence of fraud or material dishonesty by the Award Holder;  \n(d) | the Company has become aware of any material wrongdoing on the part of the Award Holder;  \n(e) | the Award Holder has acted in any manner which in the opinion of the Board has brought or is likely to bring any Group Company into material disrepute or is materially adverse to the interests of any Group Company;  \n(f) | there is a breach of the Award Holder’s employment contract that is a potentially fair reason for dismissal;  \n(g) | the Award Holder is in breach of a fiduciary duty owed to any Group Company;  \n(h) | an Award Holder who has ceased to be an Employee was in breach of their employment contract or fiduciary duties in a manner that would have prevented the grant or Release of the Award had the Company been aware (or fully aware) of that breach, and of which the Company was not aware (or not fully aware) until after both:  \n(i) | the Award Holder’s ceasing to be an Employee; and  \n---|---  \n(ii) | the time (if any) when the Board decided to permit the Release of the Award or the exercise of the Option; or  \n(i) | there was a material error in:  \n---|---  \n(i) | determining whether the Award should be made;  \n---|---  \n(ii) | determining the size and nature of the Award; or  \n(iii) | assessing the extent to which any Performance Condition was satisfied on the Performance Measurement Date.  \n7.3 | This rule 7.3 applies in relation to an Award if the Board, at its discretion, determines that either of the following circumstances exist:  \n---|---  \n(a) | a Group Company mis-stated any financial information (whether or not audited) for any part of any Year that was taken into account in:  \n---|---  \n(i) | determining whether the Award should be made;  \n---|---  \n(ii) | determining the size and nature of the Award; or  \n(iii) | assessing the extent to which any Performance Condition was satisfied on the Performance Measurement Date; or  \n  \n12  \n---  \n  \n(b) | a Group Company or business unit that employs or employed the Award Holder, or for which the Award Holder is responsible, has suffered a material failure of risk management.  \n---|---  \n7.4 | This rule 7.4 applies in relation to an Award if the Board, at its discretion, determines that, if the circumstances mentioned in rule 7.2 or rule 7.3 had existed, and the Board had been fully aware that they existed:  \n---|---  \n(a) | at the Grant Date, or  \n---|---  \n(b) | in the case of an Award that has already been Released, at the Release Date,  \n  \nthen:\n\n(c) | the Board would not have granted the Award;  \n---|---  \n(d) | the Board would have granted the Award in relation to a smaller number of Shares; or  \n(e) | in the case of an Award that has already been Released:  \n(i) | it would not have been Released at all, or  \n---|---  \n(ii) | it would have been Released in relation to a smaller number of Shares.  \n7.5 | If the Board makes a determination in relation to an Award under rule 7, it must do so within three years of its becoming aware of the circumstances mentioned in rule 7.2 or rule 7.3.  \n---|---  \n**8.** | **Operation of malus and clawback**  \n8.1 | This rule 8 applies to an Award if rule 7 applies to the Award.  \n8.2 | If at the date of the determination under rule 7.4, an Option comprising an Award has not yet been exercised, the Board may determine to cancel the Award or reduce it by such number of Shares as the Board considers to be fair and reasonable, taking account of all circumstances that the Board considers to be relevant.  \n8.3 | If at the date of the determination under rule 7.4, an Option comprising an Award has been exercised, the Board may determine a Clawback Amount in relation to the Award.  \n  \n13  \n---  \n  \n8.4 | The Clawback Amount shall be such amount as the Board considers to be fair and reasonable, taking account of all circumstances that the Board considers to be relevant, but shall not be more than, in relation to an Option that has been exercised, the greater of:  \n---|---  \n(i) | the Market Value of the Shares measured on the date the Option was exercised, and  \n---|---  \n(ii) | the Market Value of the Shares measured on the date of the determination  \n  \nminus the Base Price or Exercise Price (as the case may be).\n\n8.5 | If the Award Holder has paid or is liable to pay any income tax or SICs in relation to the Award or the Shares and which cannot be recovered from or repaid by the Tax Authority (whether directly or indirectly), the Board may in its discretion decide to reduce the Clawback Amount to take account of this amount. In deciding whether to reduce the Clawback Amount, the Board shall take account of such factors it thinks fit, which may include market practice, corporate governance rules and guidelines, and the expectations of shareholders.  \n---|---  \n8.6 | For the avoidance of doubt, the Board is not obliged to determine a Clawback Amount in relation to any particular Award, even if the Board does determine a Clawback Amount in relation to other Awards to the same or other Award Holders which had the same Grant Date or Release Date.  \n8.7 | The Award Holder shall reimburse the Company for the Clawback Amount, in any way acceptable to the Board, on or as soon as possible after the Board determines a Clawback Amount in relation to the Award. If the Award Holder fails to reimburse the Company within 30 days after the determination, the Company shall obtain reimbursement from the Award Holder in any (or any combination) of the following ways:  \n(a) | by reducing or cancelling any Options that the Award Holder has not exercised;  \n---|---  \n(b) | by reducing or cancelling any cash bonus payable to the Award Holder by any Group Company;  \n(c) | by reducing or cancelling any future or existing award made or option granted to the Award Holder under any other Share Incentive Scheme or bonus scheme operated by any Group Company;  \n(d) | by requiring the Award Holder to make a cash payment to a Group Company; or  \n(e) | by reducing the Award Holder’s Salary.  \n  \n14  \n---  \n  \n8.8 | If the Award Holder participates in another Share Incentive Scheme or bonus scheme operated by a Group Company, and that other scheme contains a provision that has a similar effect to this rule 8, the Board may give effect to that provision by reducing or cancelling any Options that the Award Holder has not exercised.  \n---|---  \n8.9 | It is a condition of the exercise of an Option that the Award Holder sign an Exercise Notice declaring an irrevocable agreement to the terms of rule 8.  \n**9.** | **Exercise of Options**  \n9.1 | An Award Holder may not exercise an Option before the later of:  \n(a) | its Release Date;  \n---|---  \n(b) | the time when it becomes exercisable under rule 15; and  \n(c) | the time when it becomes exercisable under rule 16.  \n9.2 | An Award Holder may only exercise an Option to the extent that the relevant Performance Conditions are achieved, and any other condition stated in the Award Certificate is satisfied.  \n---|---  \n9.3 | An Award Holder may not exercise an Option at a time when its exercise is prohibited by, or would be a breach of, any applicable Listing Rules or GIB MAR or any other law or regulation with the force of law, or other rule, code or set of guidelines (such as a personal dealing code adopted by the Company).  \n9.4 | An Award Holder may not exercise an Option without having signed the Exercise Notice and made any arrangements, or entered into any agreements, that may be required and are referred to in rule 8 and rule 20.  \n**10.** | **Manner of exercise of Options**  \n10.1 | The Award Holder shall exercise an Option by giving an Exercise Notice to the Company setting out the number of Shares over which the Award Holder wishes to exercise the Option. If that number exceeds the number over which the Option may be validly exercised at the time, the Company shall:  \n(a) | treat the Option as exercised only in respect of that lesser number; and  \n---|---  \n(b) | refund any excess amount paid to exercise the Option or meet any Tax Liability.  \n  \n15  \n---  \n  \n10.2 | The Exercise Notice shall be accompanied by both of the following:  \n---|---  \n(a) | in relation to a Nominal Cost Option payment of an amount equal to the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Shares specified in the notice;  \n---|---  \n(b) | any payment required under rule 20,  \n  \nunless the Award Holder has entered into binding alternative arrangements to secure the payment of those amounts which are satisfactory to the Board.\n\n10.3 | The Exercise Notice shall contain or be accompanied by:  \n---|---  \n(a) | (if the Option is exercised before the end of an applicable Holding Period), the Nominee Agreement; and  \n---|---  \n(b) | any documents relating to arrangements or agreements required under rule 8 and rule 20.  \n10.4 | Any Exercise Notice shall be invalid:  \n---|---  \n(a) | to the extent that it is inconsistent with the Award Holder’s rights under these rules and the Award Certificate;  \n---|---  \n(b) | if any of the requirements of rule 10.1, rule 10.2 or rule 10.3 are not met; or  \n(c) | if any payment referred to in rule 10.2 is made by a cheque that is not honoured on first presentation or that fails in any other manner to transfer the expected value to the Company.  \n  \nThe Company may permit the Award Holder to correct any defect referred to in rule 10.4 (but shall not be obliged to do so). The date of any corrected Exercise Notice shall be the date of the correction rather than the original notice date for all other purposes of the Plan.\n\n**11.** | **Settlement of Awards**  \n---|---  \n11.1 | This rule 11 is subject to rule 13.  \n11.2 | Within 30 days after the valid exercise of a Nominal Cost Option, the Company shall allot and issue the relevant Shares to the Award Holder (or to the Nominee in the event that an Option is exercised prior to the expiry of an applicable Holding Period).  \n  \n16  \n---  \n  \n11.3 | If the Shares are listed or traded on any stock exchange, the Company shall apply to the appropriate body for any newly issued Shares allotted to be listed or admitted to trading on that exchange as soon as practicable.  \n---|---  \n11.4 | Within 30 days after the valid exercise of a Phantom Option, the Company shall pay (or procure the payment) to the Award Holder of the amount of cash due under the Award. The Company shall make such deductions from the payment as are required by law, including any withholding taxes, in accordance with rule 20.  \n**12.** | **Holding Period**  \nDuring a Holding Period, the Award Holder may not transfer, assign, charge or otherwise dispose of the beneficial interest in the Shares Released under a Share-settled Award (including any Shares acquired on the exercise of an Option) except:  \n(a) | with the permission of the Board;  \n---|---  \n(b) | in order to raise sufficient funds to pay a Tax Liability in relation to the Shares so Released;  \n(c) | in order to raise sufficient funds to pay the Exercise Price of a Nominal Cost Option; or  \n(d) | where rule 8, rule 16 or rule 18 apply.  \n**13.** | **Alternative methods of settlement of Awards**  \n---|---  \n13.1 | Instead of delivering the number of Shares specified in the relevant Exercise Notice the Company may settle the exercise of a Nominal Cost Option in cash in the following manner:  \n(a) | multiply the number of Shares in relation to which the Award has been Released by the Market Value of a Share on the Release Date;  \n---|---  \n(b) | deduct any Tax Liability and pay the resulting amount to the Award Holder; and  \n(c) | refund the amount of any payment the Award Holder may have made in respect of the Tax Liability.  \n**14.** | **Lapse of Awards**  \n---|---  \n14.1 | Other than pursuant to rule 12, an Award Holder may not transfer or assign, or create any charge or other security interest over an Award (or any right arising under it). An Award shall lapse if the Award Holder attempts to do any of those things. However, this rule 14.1 does not prevent the transmission of an Award to an Award Holder’s personal representatives on the death of the Award Holder.  \n  \n17  \n---  \n  \n14.2 | An Award shall lapse on the earliest of the following:  \n---|---  \n(a) | any attempted action by the Award Holder falling within rule 14.1;  \n---|---  \n(b) | when the Board decides in accordance with rule 3.6, to the extent that the Performance Condition has become wholly or partly incapable of being met;  \n(c) | any date on which the Award shall lapse, as specified in the Award Certificate;  \n(d) | to the extent necessary to give effect to any reduction or cancellation under rule 8;  \n(e) | to the extent required by rule 15, the date the Award Holder dies or ceases employment;  \n(f) | the first anniversary of the Award Holder’s death;  \n(g) | the end of the 90-day period, if rule 15.4 or rule 15.6 applies;  \n(h) | if the Board decides under rule 15.5 that it will not permit the Award Holder to exercise the Option, the date the Board so decides;  \n(i) | the end of the 90-day period during which exercise is permitted, if the Board decides under rule 15.5 that it will permit the Award Holder to exercise the Option;  \n(j) | if the Award Holder ceases to be an Employee during the Employment Period in circumstances where rule 15.5 applies, 90 days after the Award Holder so ceases to be an Employee, if the Board makes no decision under the applicable rule;  \n(k) | if the Award Holder ceases to be an Employee after the end of the Employment Period, 90 days after the later of:  \n(i) | the date of so ceasing; and  \n(ii) | the Release Date;  \n(l) | the time specified for the lapse of the Award under rule 16 if any part of that rule 16 applies;  \n(m) | If the Board so determines under rule 19.3; or  \n(n) | when the Award Holder becomes bankrupt, applies for an interim order, proposes or makes a voluntary arrangement under the Insolvency Act 2011 of Gibraltar, or takes similar steps or is similarly affected under the laws of any jurisdiction.  \n  \n18  \n---  \n  \n**15.** | **Termination of employment (Options)**  \n---|---  \n15.1 | rule 15 applies to Options.  \n15.2 | If an Award Holder:  \n(a) | dies while an Employee; or  \n---|---  \n(b) | ceases to be an Employee (whether or not following notice and for whatever reason)  \n  \nbefore the end of the Employment Period, the Option shall lapse immediately in respect of a number of Shares. That number is calculated in accordance with the formula N x (X/Y) where:\n\n(c) | N = the number of Shares in relation to which the Option was originally granted, less any Shares in respect of which it has already been exercised or has lapsed;  \n---|---  \n(d) | X = the number of days between the date of death or cessation and the end of the Employment Period; and  \n(e) | Y = the number of days in the Employment Period.  \n15.3 | The personal representatives of a deceased Award Holder may exercise the Option over a number of Shares during the period ending 12 months after the death. If the Option is not exercised, it will lapse at the end of that period. That number of Shares shall be determined as follows:  \n---|---  \n(a) | take the number of Shares that remain after part of the Option has lapsed under rule 15.2;  \n---|---  \n(b) | if the Award Holder dies during the Performance Period, the Board shall apply a further reduction to reflect the likelihood as at the date of death of the Performance Condition not being achieved by the end of the Performance Period and the Option shall lapse to that extent; and  \n(c) | if the Award Holder dies after the end of the Performance Period, the number shall be equal to the number of Shares that the Award Holder could have acquired on exercising the Option immediately before the death.  \n15.4 | This rule 15.4 applies if an Award Holder ceases to be an Employee before the Release Date due to any of the following reasons:  \n---|---  \n(a) | injury;  \n---|---  \n(b) | ill health;  \n  \n19  \n---  \n  \n(c) | disability; or  \n---|---  \n(d) | the Employer Company ceasing to be a Group Company.  \n  \nAn Award Holder who so ceases to be an Employee may exercise the remainder of the Option (after the application of rule 15.2 and subject to achieving the Performance Conditions) during the 90-day period beginning on the earlier of:\n\n(e) | the Release Date; and  \n---|---  \n(f) | the date on which the Option becomes exercisable under rule 16.  \n  \nIf the Option is not exercised during the relevant 90-day period, it will lapse at the end of that period.\n\n15.5 | This rule 15.5 applies if an Award Holder ceases to be an Employee before the Release Date for any reason other than death and the reasons set out in rule 15.4.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Board may in its absolute discretion permit the Award Holder to exercise the remainder of the Option (after the application of rule 15.2) during the 90-day period beginning on the earlier of:\n\n(a) | the Release Date; and  \n---|---  \n(b) | the date on which the Option becomes exercisable under rule 16.  \n  \nIf the Option is not exercised during the relevant 90-day period, it will lapse at the end of that period.\n\nAny decision by the Board to grant permission under this rule 15.5 shall be made in the 90-day period following the cessation of employment and if the Board does not make such a decision within that period, the Option will lapse immediately and in accordance with rule 14. The Award Holder may not exercise the Option before the Board makes such a decision.\n\n15.6 | An Award Holder who ceases to be an Employee on or after the Release Date may exercise the Option during the 90-day period following the date of cessation.  \n---|---  \n15.7 | The Board shall notify the relevant Award Holder of any decision made under rule 15, including any decision not to permit the exercise of an Option, within a reasonable time after making it.  \n  \n20  \n---  \n  \n15.8 | If the relevant Award Certificate specifies different Performance Periods or Employment Periods for different parts of an Option, each part of that Option shall be treated as a separate Option for the purposes of rule 15.  \n---|---  \n15.9 | An Award Holder who continues to be an employee or director of any Group Company shall not be regarded as ceasing to be an Employee.  \n**16.** | **Takeovers and liquidations**  \n16.1 | The **Releasable Number** of Shares in relation to an Award is the number of Shares that the Board shall determine as follows:  \n(a) | If the change of Control occurs during the Employment Period, multiply the number of Shares in relation to which the Award was originally granted, less any Shares in respect of which it has already been Released (or, in the case of an Option, has already been exercised) or has lapsed, by X/Y where:  \n---|---  \n(i) | X = the number of days between the Grant Date and the date (or expected date) of the change of Control; and  \n---|---  \n(ii) | Y = the number of days in the Employment Period.  \n(b) | If the change of Control occurs during the Performance Period, apply a further reduction to reflect the likelihood as at the date (or expected date) of the change of Control of the Performance Condition not being achieved by the end of the Performance Period.  \n---|---  \n16.2 | Where the Board is required by rule 16.1 to determine the Releasable Number, and the relevant Award Certificate specifies different Performance Periods or Employment Periods for different parts of an Award, the Board shall treat each part of that Award as a separate Award.  \n---|---  \n16.3 | If the Board considers that a change of Control is likely to occur, the Board may in its absolute discretion decide that:  \n(a) | all Awards shall be Released in relation to the Releasable Number of Shares; and  \n---|---  \n(b) | an Award Holder may exercise all or any part of any Option (but not in respect of more than the Releasable Number of Shares) within a reasonable period to be specified by the Board for that purpose and ending immediately before the Acquiror obtains Control of the Company. The Board shall have discretion to determine that an Option that is not exercised by the end of that period shall lapse.  \n  \n21  \n---  \n  \nThe Board may decide that the Release of Awards and exercise of Options shall be conditional on the change of Control actually occurring and shall be treated as having no effect if the change of Control does not occur.\n\n16.4 | rule 16.5, rule 16.6 and rule 16.7 apply if a change of Control occurs and the Acquiror declares that it is willing to make an agreement under rule 18.  \n---|---  \n16.5 | The Board may in its absolute discretion decide that an Award Holder may exercise all or any part of any Option (but not in respect of more than the Releasable Number of Shares) within a reasonable period to be specified by the Board for that purpose. Any part of an Option that is not either exchanged under rule 18 or exercised by the end of that period shall lapse.  \n16.6 | The Board may at any time during the Rollover Period exchange the Award under rule 18.  \n16.7 | The Board has discretion to determine at any time before the end of the Rollover Period that some or all of any Awards that are not so exchanged shall lapse at the end of the Rollover Period.  \n16.8 | If the Acquiror is not willing to exchange the award under rule 18:  \n(a) | all Awards shall be Released immediately following the change of Control in relation to the Releasable Number of Shares and lapse in relation to the balance; and  \n---|---  \n(b) | an Award Holder may exercise all or any part of any Option (but not in respect of more than the Releasable Number of Shares) within the period of 30 days following the change of Control. Any part of an Option that is not exercised by the end of that period shall lapse.  \n16.9 | If the court sanctions a compromise or arrangement under part VIII of the Companies Act 2014, the Board may decide that:  \n---|---  \n(a) | all Awards shall be Released in relation to the Releasable Number of Shares; and  \n---|---  \n(b) | an Award Holder may exercise all or any part of any Option (but not in respect of more than the Releasable Number of Shares) within a reasonable period to be specified by the Board for that purpose. The Board shall have discretion to determine that an Option that is not exercised by the end of that period shall lapse.  \n  \n22  \n---  \n  \n16.10 | If any Shares, in one or a series of transactions, are sold resulting in the buyer and persons acting in concert with the buyer together acquiring Control of the Company, but the buyer is a company and its shareholders and the proportion of its shares held by each of them following completion of the sale are substantially the same as the shareholders and their shareholdings in the Company immediately before the sale, the Board may determine that this does not constitute a change of Control.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf the buyer offers to make such arrangements as the Board, in its reasonable opinion, considers to be fair, for new awards to be offered under rule 18 in exchange for Awards, then the Board may decide that any Awards that are not so exchanged shall lapse on such date as the Board shall specify.\n\nIf the buyer does not offer to make arrangements that the Board considers to be fair within 30 days after the buyer has acquired Control, then:\n\n(a) | all Awards shall be Released on the 31st day following the buyer acquiring Control in relation to the Releasable Number of Shares and lapse in relation to the balance; and  \n---|---  \n(b) | an Award Holder may exercise all or any part of any Option (but not in respect of more than the Releasable Number of Shares) within the period starting 31 days and ending 90 days following the buyer acquiring Control. Any part of an Option that is not exercised by the end of that period shall lapse.  \n16.11 | In rule 16 and rule 18, a person shall be deemed to have obtained Control of a company if that person, and others acting in concert with that person, have obtained Control of it together.  \n---|---  \n16.12 | If the shareholders of the Company receive notice of a resolution for the voluntary winding up of the Company, any Award Holder may exercise an Option in respect of the Releasable Number of Shares at any time before that resolution is passed, conditional upon the passing of that resolution, and if the Award Holder does not exercise the Option, it shall lapse when the winding up begins.  \n16.13 | The Board shall notify Award Holders of any event that is relevant to Awards under this rule 16 within a reasonable period after the Board becomes aware of it.  \n16.14 | For the avoidance of doubt, rule 16 is subject to rule 6.4 and rule 6.5.  \n  \n23  \n---  \n  \n**17.** | **Forafric 2021 Long Term Employee Share Incentive Plan**  \n---|---  \n**17.1** | **The Board may at any time by notice in writing given to the holder require that the holders of an award made by Forafric Agro Holdings Limited under the Forafric 2021 Long Term Employee Share Incentive Plan adopted on 22 June 2022 (such holder a “2021 Award Holder”), to exchange the same for an Award under the Plan.**  \n**17.2** | **If the Board gives notice under clause 17.1 to a 2021 Award Holder, the said 2021 Award Holder shall surrender the same by way of a notice to Forafric Agro Holdings Limited and the Company, in a form to be determined by the Board, in exchange for the grant by the Company to him of a replacement right on substantially the same terms and in relation to such number of shares of the Company as the Board shall determine.**  \n**18.** | **Exchange of Awards**  \n**18.1** | **The Board may within the Rollover Period require that an Award Holder surrender any Award (“Old Award** ”**) in exchange for a replacement right (“New Award** ”**).**  \n**18.2** | **A New Award shall be granted on substantially the same terms as the Old Award and in relation to such shares of such company as the Board and Acquiror shall determine.**  \n**18.3** | **The Rollover Period is a period specified by the Board within which Award Holders may be required to surrender their Awards.**  \n**19.** | **Variation of share capital**  \n**19.1** | **This rule 19 applies where there is:**  \n(a) | a variation of share capital; or  \n---|---  \n(b) | an extraordinary distribution to shareholders.  \n19.2 | In this rule 19:  \n---|---  \n(a) | A variation of share capital includes a capitalisation issue, rights issue, consolidation, subdivision or reduction of capital, a vendor placing with clawback, a vendor rights offer or a cash open offer. However, a scrip dividend is not a variation of share capital.  \n---|---  \n(b) | An extraordinary distribution to shareholders includes a demerger or special dividend.  \n  \n24  \n---  \n  \n19.3 | If notice is given to shareholders of the Company of a proposed extraordinary distribution, the Board shall determine whether the interests of Award Holders would or might be substantially prejudiced by the proposed extraordinary distribution.  \n---|---  \n  \nIf the Board does so decide, it may determine that:\n\n(a) | some or all Awards shall be Released in relation to the Releasable Number of Shares; and  \n---|---  \n(b) | an Award Holder may exercise all or any part of any Option (but not in respect of more than the Releasable Number of Shares) within a reasonable period specified by the Board for that purpose and ending immediately before the record date for the extraordinary distribution. The Board shall have discretion to determine that an Option that is not exercised by the end of that period shall lapse.  \n  \nThe Board may decide that the Release of Awards and exercise of Options shall be conditional on the extraordinary distribution actually occurring and shall be treated as having no effect if the extraordinary distribution does not occur.\n\nThe Releasable Number shall be determined in accordance with rule 16.1 as if the extraordinary distribution were a change of Control.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, if the Board does not determine that Awards shall be Released and Options may be exercised, the Board may nevertheless make an adjustment to the Awards under rule 19.4.\n\n19.4 | If a variation of share capital or an extraordinary distribution occurs and the Board considers that it has affected the value of Awards, the Board shall consider whether it is fair to adjust the terms of the Awards and, if so, the Board shall make such adjustment as it considers appropriate to:  \n---|---  \n(a) | the number of Shares subject to the Award;  \n---|---  \n(b) | the class of Shares subject to the Award; and  \n(c) | subject to rule 19.5, the Exercise Price.  \n19.5 | The Board may not reduce the Exercise Price of an Option below the nominal value of a Share, if the Option will or may be satisfied by the issue of Shares, unless the Board is able, and resolves, to capitalise from reserves an amount sufficient (when aggregated with the reduced Exercise Price payable) to pay up the Shares in full on the Option’s exercise.  \n---|---  \n  \n25  \n---  \n  \n19.6 | The Board shall notify all affected Award Holders of any decision made under rule 19 within a reasonable time after making it.  \n---|---  \n**20.** | **Tax liabilities**  \n20.1 | The Award Holder shall, to the extent permissible under applicable law, indemnify the Employer Company in respect of any Tax Liability.  \n20.2 | The Exercise Notice shall include the Award Holder’s irrevocable agreement to:  \n(a) | pay the Tax Liability to the Employer Company; and  \n---|---  \n(b) | enter into arrangements to the satisfaction of the Company or Employer Company to pay the Tax Liability.  \n20.3 | If an Award Holder does not pay the Tax Liability within seven days of any Taxable Event, the Company or Employer Company (as appropriate) may, to the extent permissible under applicable law:  \n---|---  \n(a) | if the relevant Taxable Event is the exercise of an Option or the Release of an Award, and the Shares are readily saleable at the time, retain and sell such number of Shares on behalf of the Award Holder as is necessary to meet the Tax Liability, and any costs of sale; or  \n---|---  \n(b) | deduct the amount of any Tax Liability from any payments of remuneration made to the Award Holder on or after the date on which the Tax Liability arose.  \n  \nThe Award Holder’s obligations under rule 20.1 shall not be affected by any failure of the Company or Employer Company to withhold shares or deduct from payments of remuneration under this rule 20.3.\n\n20.4 | Each Award Holder agrees that it is their responsibility to settle their own tax affairs in connection with the exercise of an Option and, if required to do so by the Company or Employer Company, the Award Holder shall assist the Company or Employer Company in good faith for purposes of settling any tax matters relating to an Award Holder’s exercise of an Option (such assistance to include the signing of any relevant elections, documents or forms).  \n---|---  \n20.5 | The Exercise Notice in respect of a Share-settled Award shall include a power of attorney appointing the Company as the Award Holder’s agent and attorney for the purposes of rule 20.3.  \n  \n26  \n---  \n  \n**21.** | **Relationship with employment contract**  \n---|---  \n**21.1** | **The rights and obligations of any Award Holder under the terms of an office or employment with any Group Company or former Group Company shall not be affected by being an Award Holder.**  \n**21.2** | **The value of any benefit realised under the Plan by Award Holders shall not be taken into account in determining any pension or similar entitlements.**  \n**21.3** | **Award Holders and Employees shall have no rights to compensation or damages on account of any loss in respect of Awards or the Plan where this loss arises (or is claimed to arise), in whole or in part, from:**  \n(a) | termination of office or employment with; or  \n---|---  \n(b) | notice to terminate office or employment given by or to,  \n  \nany Group Company or any former Group Company. This exclusion of liability shall apply however termination of office or employment, or the giving of notice, is caused, and however compensation or damages are claimed.\n\n21.4 | Award Holders and Employees shall have no rights to compensation or damages from any Group Company or any former Group Company on account of any loss in respect of Awards or the Plan where this loss arises (or is claimed to arise), in whole or in part, from:  \n---|---  \n(a) | any company ceasing to be a Group Company; or  \n---|---  \n(b) | the transfer of any business from a Group Company to any person that is not a Group Company.  \n  \nThis exclusion of liability shall apply however the change of status of the relevant Group Company, or the transfer of the relevant business, is caused, and however compensation or damages are claimed.\n\n21.5 | An Employee shall not have any right to receive Awards, whether or not the Employee has previously been granted any.  \n---|---  \n  \n27  \n---  \n  \n**22.** | **Notices**  \n---|---  \n**22.1** | **Except as maintained in rule 22.3, any notice or other communication given under or in connection with the Plan shall be in writing and shall be:**  \n(a) | delivered by hand or by prepaid first-class post or other next working day delivery service at the **Appropriate Address** ;  \n---|---  \n  \nFor the purposes of this rule 22.1, the Appropriate Address means:\n\n(i) | Unit 5.3, Madison Building, Midtown, Queensway, Gibraltar;  \n---|---  \n(ii) | an Award Holder’s home address; and  \n(iii) | if the Award Holder has died, and notice of the appointment of personal representatives is given to the Company, any contact address specified in that notice.  \n(b) | sent by fax to the fax number notified in writing by the recipient to the sender; or  \n---|---  \n(c) | sent by email to the **Appropriate Email Address**.  \n  \nFor the purposes of this rule 22.1, Appropriate Email Address means:\n\n(i) | in the case of the Company, __swahnon@forafric.gi__ _;_ and  \n---|---  \n(ii) | in the case of an Award Holder, their relevant work email address or such personal email address agreed with the Company in writing.  \n22.2 | Any notice or other communication given under this rule 22 shall be deemed to have been received:  \n---|---  \n(a) | if delivered by hand, on signature of a delivery receipt, or at the time the notice is left at the appropriate address;  \n---|---  \n(b) | if sent by prepaid first-class post or other next working day delivery service, at 9.00 am on the second Business Day after posting, or at the time recorded by the delivery service;  \n(c) | if sent by fax, at 9.00 am on the next Business Day after transmission; and  \n(d) | if sent by email, at 9.00 am on the next Business Day after sending.  \n22.3 | This rule does not apply to:  \n---|---  \n(a) | the service of any Exercise Notice; and  \n---|---  \n(b) | the service of any proceedings or other documents in any legal action or, where applicable, any arbitration or other method of dispute resolution.  \n**23.** | **Administration and amendment**  \n---|---  \n**23.1** | **The Board shall administer the Plan.**  \n  \n28  \n---  \n  \n23.2 | The Plan is intended to comply with Listing Rules.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**MARCH 31, 2022**\n\n**1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION**\n\n_Nature of Operations_ - Forafric Agro Holdings Limited and Subsidiaries (the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) through its subsidiaries is a market leader in the milling industry in Morocco, with a complete offering of flours and semolina, secondary processing products including pasta and couscous, rice, and starches (“Milling Business”). The Company is wholly owned by Lighthouse Capital Limited (the “Parent” or “Parent Company”).\n\nDuring 2021, the Company owned common stock representing 100% ownership in Millcorp Geneva SA (“Millcorp”). Millcorp is a trading company that trades grains and oils for use as animal feed (“Grain Trading Business”). On June 1, 2021 (“Separation Date”), the Company distributed its 100% ownership in Millcorp to the Parent Company which resulted in the spin-off of its Grain Trading business (“Restructuring”). The Company did not receive any consideration from the Parent Company for distributing the 100% ownership in Millcorp. The assets, liabilities, and results of operations of Millcorp have been excluded from these condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nBased on an evaluation of the guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) Topic 5.Z.7, _Accounting for the spin-off of a subsidiary_ , it was determined that the Restructuring should be reflected as a change in reporting entity. As such, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company retroactively reflect the Restructuring, including all distributions and transactions in conjunction therewith, and exclude Millcorp for all periods presented. These condensed consolidated financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, each of which is controlled, and is based on the financial position and results of operations of the Company as a standalone company. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated. Refer to Note 17 — Related Parties for further information regarding the Company’s related party transactions.\n\nIn June 2021, the Company signed a letter of intent to be acquired by Globis Acquisition Corp. (“Globis”). Globis is a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) listed on the NASDAQ exchange in the United States. As of June 3, 2022, the transaction gained the approval by the SEC. The transaction is expected to close in June 2022, subject to approval by the shareholders of the SPAC.\n\nOn December 19, 2021, Globis and the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination”). The Business Combination Agreement provides for the consummation of the following transactions (collectively, the “Business Combination”): (i) Globis will merge with and into Globis NV Merger Corp., a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Globis (“Globis Nevada”), with Globis Nevada surviving (the “Merger”); (ii) Globis Nevada will change its jurisdiction of incorporation by transferring by way of a redomiciliation and domesticating as a Gibraltar public company limited by shares (the “Redomiciliation”) and change its name to “Forafric Global PLC” (referred to herein as “New Forafric”); and (iii) immediately following the effectiveness of the Redomiciliation, New Forafric will acquire 100% of the equity interests in the Company from the Lighthouse Capital Limited (“Seller”) and the Company will become a direct subsidiary of New Forafric.\n\nThe total consideration to be paid to the Seller in the Business Combination will be (i) 15,100,000 Ordinary Shares, subject to reduction to the extent that the Closing Payment (as defined below) is less than $0, provided that the Seller may be issued up to 1,904,762 additional Ordinary Shares determined based on the amount of Remaining Cash (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) at the Closing; plus (ii) an amount (the “Closing Payment”) equal to $20,000,000 minus the outstanding amount of all Funded Debt (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) as of the Closing (other than Permitted Debt); provided that Seller may receive up to an additional $20,000,000 determined based on the amount of Remaining Cash (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) at the Closing. The Closing Payment shall be funded by remaining funds in the Trust Account after giving effect to any Buyer Share Redemptions (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) and the proceeds of any potential private placement financing.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing consideration, the Seller shall be entitled to receive, as additional consideration, and without any action on behalf of the Company or the Company’s stockholders, additional Ordinary Shares (the “Earnout Shares”), to be issued as follows during the period from and after the Closing until the end of calendar year 2024 (A) 500,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2022, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) of the Company is equal to or greater than $27 million, (B) 500,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA of New Forafric is equal to or greater than $33 million, and (C) 1,000,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2024, the Buyer Trading Price (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) during the standard market trading hours of a trading day is greater than or equal to $16.50 for any 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC AGRO HOLDINGS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**MARCH 31, 2022**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n_Basis of Presentation_ - These condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are unaudited, and as permitted by the interim reporting rules and regulations set forth by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), exclude certain financial information and note disclosures normally included in annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all material adjustments of a normal recurring nature that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n**2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n_Significant Accounting Policies –_ The Company’s accounting policies used in the preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements do not differ from those used in the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, unless otherwise noted.\n\n_Use of Estimates_ - The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, allowance for credit losses, valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, and measurement of income tax assets. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment and the impact of COVID-19, our estimates could be significantly different than future performance. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n_Principles of Consolidation_ – The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include all entities controlled by the Company after reflecting the Restructuring previously described.\n\nControl exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits from its activities that could potentially be significant to the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\n_Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions_ - The Company’s functional currency is the Moroccan dirham, and its presentation currency is the United States Dollar (“USD”). The functional currency is translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts using currency exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted-average exchange rate during the period. The transactions in foreign currency (that is a different currency than the functional currency of the entity) are converted at the exchange rate prevailing to the date of the transaction. The assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are evaluated in the current period on the date of the closing or at the opening rate, when applicable. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and intercompany debt that is not of a long-term investment nature are included in (Gain) loss on foreign currency exchange in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\n\n_Government Subsidies_ – The Moroccan government provides certain subsidy programs based on production of affordable flour and import taxes. Subsidies are paid by the Moroccan government and are predicated on sales of flour and price of imported raw materials. The Company records the flour subsidies as a credit against the related costs that the subsidies were intended to offset in the same periods that the costs were incurred within the consolidated statement of operations. Outstanding government subsidies are included in other receivables on the balance sheet.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC AGRO HOLDINGS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**MARCH 31, 2022**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n_Credit Risk_ – Financial instruments potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. At times during the periods presented, the Company had funds in excess of Deposit Insurance programs in Morocco, on deposit at various financial institutions. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held.\n\nThe Company’s trade accounts receivable are unsecured and geographically dispersed. No single client’s trade accounts receivable balance as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 exceeded 10% of the Company’s consolidated accounts receivable, net.\n\n_Variable Interest Entities –_ Effective on October 7, 2021, the Company completed a share purchase acquisition of Moulins Sanabil SA (“Sanabil SA”) and has been since actively involved in their operations and has the power to direct the activities and significantly impact Sanabil SA’s economic performance. The Company also bears the risk of losses and has the right to receive 60% of the benefits from Sanabil SA. As such, in accordance with ASC 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J, Sanabil SA is considered a VIE of the Company and the financial statements of Sanabil SA were consolidated from the date that the control existed.\n\nEffective on July 30, 2021, the Company completed a share purchase acquisition of Moulin du Sahel Burkina (“MDS Burkina”) and has since significant economic exposure to MDS Burkina. The Company also bears the risk of losses and has the right to receive 78.21% of the benefits from MDS Burkina. As such, in accordance with ASC 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J, MDS Burkina is considered a VIE of the Company and the financial statements of MDS Burkina were consolidated from the date that the control existed.\n\nEffective on April 30, 2021, the Company completed a share purchase acquisition of MDS Mali and has been since actively involved in their operations and has the power to direct the activities and significantly impact MDS Mali’s economic performance. The Company also bears the risk of losses and has the right to receive 70.35% of the benefits from MDS Mali. As such, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810-10-25-38A through 25-38J, MDS Mali is considered a VIE of the Company and the financial statements of MDS Mali were consolidated from the date that the control existed.\n\n_Equity Method Accounting_ – As of September 30, 2021, the Company owned 37.10% of the outstanding capital stock of Grands Moulins du Tenere Niger (“GMT Niger”) which was accounted for as an equity method investment. The Company applies the equity method of accounting for the investment, as the Company owns less than a 50% ownership interest and cannot exert significant influence. As such, this entity is not considered a variable interest entity. The equity method investment is included in other assets, noncurrent, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n\n_Non-Controlling Interests_ – Non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income represent the portion of a majority-owned subsidiary’s net income or loss that is attributed by non-controlling stockholders. Non-controlling interests on the consolidated balance sheets represent the portion of equity in a consolidated subsidiary owned by non-controlling stockholders.\n\n**3. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS**\n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance, which improves the transparency of government assistance received by most business entities by requiring the disclosure of: (1) the types of government assistance received; (2) the accounting for such assistance; and (3) the effect of the assistance on a business entity’s financial statements. This guidance is effective for the Company’s interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Refer to Note 6 for additional information disclosed by the Company.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC AGRO HOLDINGS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**MARCH 31, 2022**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n**4. LEASES**\n\nThe Company has operating leases for real estate and vehicles. The Company has finance leases for equipment and construction land space. Leases are classified as finance leases because ownership of the underlying assets transfers at the end the lease term. Remaining lease terms for these leases range from less than one year to six years.\n\nThe Company does not record leases with a term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet.\n\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\n\nBalance Sheet | March 31, | December 31,  \n---|---|---  \nClassification | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nAssets  \nOperating leases | Right-of-use assets | $| 1,795 | $| 2,077  \nFinance leases | Right-of-use assets | 13,595 | 14,282  \nTotal assets | $| 15,390 | $| 16,359  \nLiabilities  \nCurrent liabilities  \nOperating leases | Current portion of long-term debt | $| 647 | $| 685  \nFinance leases | Current portion of long-term debt | 2,253 | 2,318  \nTotal current liabilities | 2,900 | 3,003  \nNoncurrent liabilities  \nOperating leases | Long-term debt | 1,299 | 1,529  \nFinance leases | Long-term debt | 2,228 | 2,923  \nTotal noncurrent liabilities | 3,527 | 4,452  \nTotal liabilities | $| 6,427 | $| 7,455  \n  \nRight-of-use assets and their corresponding lease liabilities are measured and recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date.\n\n_Discount Rates_\n\nFor the majority of its leases, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease. For leases without an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments for those leases.\n\nThe weighted-average discount rates for the Company’s leases were as follows:\n\nMarch 31, | December 31,  \n---|---  \n2022 | 2021  \nOperating leases | 5.0| % | 5.0| %  \nFinance leases | 6.2| % | 6.2| %  \n  \n_Lease Payments_\n\nThe Company includes lease payments under options to extend or terminate the lease in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise such options.

LINES OF CREDIT**\n\n_Lines of Credit – working capital_\n\nThe Company has entered into unsecured revolving credit agreements with several financial institutions to fund working capital requirements (“WC Lines of Credit”). The WC Lines of Credit provide the Company with the ability to borrow funds under consolidated lines of credit of up to approximately $60,000. Interest rates range from 5.6% to 6.4%. The WC Lines of Credit renew automatically on an annual basis. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are borrowers under the WC Lines of Credit, and their obligations are cross guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries.\n\n_Lines of Credit – wheat inventories_\n\nThe Company has entered into credit agreements with several financial institutions for asset-based credit facilities in order to fund wheat raw material purchases (“Wheat Credit Facilities”). The Wheat Credit Facilities provide the ability to borrow funds under consolidated lines of credit of up to approximately $105,000, subject to certain borrowing base criteria. The Wheat Credit Facilities are secured by the Company’s inventory. Interest rates range from 1.4% to 6.4% per annum. The Wheat Credit Facilities must be renewed on a semi-annual basis. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are borrowers under the Wheat Credit Facilities, and their obligations are cross guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries.\n\n**12.

The loan issuance costs and premiums are determined at inception and are amortized over the useful life of the loan via the effective interest rate.\n\n_Convertible Bonds_\n\nOn December 31, 2021 the Company authorized the issuance of convertible bonds of up to $40,000 with an annual interest rate of 6.00% through June 15, 2026. As of March 31, 2022, the Company issued $11,500 in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% convertible bonds (the “Convertible Bonds”). The Convertible Bonds bear cash interest at a rate of 6.00% payable annually on each 12-month anniversary of the date of issuance and on the final redemption date of June 15, 2026, unless earlier redeemed or converted in accordance with the terms of the Convertible Bonds. The Convertible Bonds are unsecured obligations of the Company and are not transferable without the consent of the Company.\n\nThe Convertible Bonds will be redeemable, in whole or in part at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Bonds to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest without premium or penalty.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC AGRO HOLDINGS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**MARCH 31, 2022**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Convertible Bonds, upon consummation of the Business Combination, the Convertible Bonds are subject to mandatory conversion into ordinary shares of New Forafric at a conversion price of $9.45 per share. The ordinary shares will be calculated by dividing the principal amount being converted, together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, but the conversion price of $9.45. The conversion price is subject to customary adjustments for stock dividends, stock splits, reclassifications, and the like, and is also subject to price-based adjustment, on a “full ratchet” basis, in the event of any issuances of common stock, or securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for, common stock at a price below the then-applicable conversion price (subject to certain exceptions).\n\nThe Convertible Bonds are accounted for in accordance with ASC 470-20, _Debt with Conversion and Other Options_ (“ASC 470-20”) and ASC 815-40, _Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity_ (“ASC 815-40”)_._ Under ASC 815-40, to qualify for equity classification (or nonbifurcation, if embedded) the instrument (or embedded feature) must be both (1) indexed to the issuer’s stock and (2) meet the requirements of the equity classification guidance. Based upon the Company’s analysis, it was determined the Convertible Bonds do contain embedded features indexed to its own stock, but do not meet the requirements for bifurcation and recognition as derivatives, and therefore do not need to be separately recognized. Accordingly, the proceeds received from the issuance of the Convertible Bonds were recorded as a single liability measured at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n_Term Loans_\n\nThe Company maintains term loans with several financial institutions (the “Term Loans”). The Term Loans are unsecured and have fixed monthly payments ranging from approximately $881. Interest on the Term Loans range from 5.8%-8.0% per annum. The Term Loans mature and will be fully repaid throughout 2022 and 2034.\n\n_Lease Obligations_\n\nThe Company owes $6,427 and $7,455 related to its leases as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Lease obligations are payable in monthly installments of principal and interest and are collateralized by the related assets financed. Refer to Note 5 for additional information regarding the Company’s leases.\n\nThe scheduled maturities of outstanding debt as of March 31, 2022 are as follows:\n\n(in thousands)  \n---  \nRemainder of 2022 | 7,812  \n2023 |  4,181  \n2024 | 2,322  \n2025 | 2,071  \n2026 | 1,055  \nThereafter | 13,503  \nTotal outstanding debt | $|  30,944  \n  \n**13. INCOME TAXES**\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was -39% and 20% for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate was lower than the Moroccan statutory rate primarily due to unrecognized tax losses and the minimum contribution due to the Moroccan tax authorities levied on turnover and other specific revenue.\n\nDuring the periods ended March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company has $6,161 and $7,265, respectively, as unrecognized net operating losses.\n\nIn assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized. The Company considers the level of historical taxable income, scheduled reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted.\n\nThe Company maintained a valuation allowance of $6,161 and $7,265 respectively as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 against its net operating losses.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC AGRO HOLDINGS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**MARCH 31, 2022**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n**14. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND ACQUISITIONS**\n\n_Sanabil SA_\n\nEffective on October 7, 2021, the Company completed a share purchase acquisition of Moulins Sanabil SA (“Sanabil SA”). By way of the acquisition, the Company acquired a 60% stake in a wheat milling business in the region of Meknes, Morocco.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the agreement, the purchase price of the acquisition was $331, fully paid in cash.\n\nThe following table represents the final allocation of the purchase consideration among assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values:\n\nConsideration paid:  \n---  \nCash |  $ |  332  \nAssumed debt |  6,548  \nNoncontrolling interest |  221  \nTotal consideration paid |  $ |  7,101  \nNet assets acquired:  \nCurrent assets |  4,665  \nCurrent liabilities |  (4,416 |  )  \nProperty, plant and equipment |  5,413  \nTradename |  323  \nCustomer relationship |  453  \nTotal net assets acquired |  6,438  \nGoodwill |  663  \nTotal consideration paid |  $ |  7,101  \n  \nThe valuation of the acquired intangible assets is inherently subjective and relies on significant unobservable inputs.

The valuation for each of these intangible assets was based on estimated projections of expected cash flows to be generated by the assets, discounted to the present value at discount rates commensurate with perceived risk. The valuation assumptions take into consideration the Company’s estimates of customer attrition and revenue growth projections. The Company is amortizing the identifiable intangible assets arising from the Sanabil SA acquisition in relation to the expected cash flows from the individual intangible assets over their respective useful lives, which have a weighted average life of 20 years (see Note 9). Goodwill represents Sanabil SA’s market presence and its experienced workforce as well as future potential to generate cash flows and other economic benefits and results from assets that are not separately identifiable as part of the transaction and is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThe Company incurred no material transaction costs for the acquisition of Sanabil SA.\n\nThe carrying amount of Sanabil SA’s assets and liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements are as follows at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:\n\nMarch 31, |  December 31,  \n---|---  \n2022 |  2021  \n(in thousands) |  (in thousands)  \nCash |  $ |  2,035 |  $ |  2,670  \nAccounts receivable |  1,664 |  1,944  \nInventory |  539 |  936  \nOther current assets |  2,762 |  3,950  \nProperty, plant, and equipment |  4,945 |  5,233  \nIntangible assets |  728 |  777  \nGoodwill |  621 |  636  \nTotal assets |  $ |  13,294 |  $ |  16,146  \nAccounts payable |  $ |  5,184 |  $ |  3,896  \nOther current liabilities |  1,727 |  6,807  \nLong-term debt |  1,270 |  1,061  \nTotal liabilities |  $ |  8,181 |  $ |  11,764  \n  \n17  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC AGRO HOLDINGS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**MARCH 31, 2022**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n_Pro Forma information_\n\nThe following unaudited pro forma information presents the impact of the results of operations of Sanabil SA on the Company revenue and net income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 as if the Sanabil SA acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2021, with adjustments to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the Sanabil SA acquisition.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma information does not reflect any operating efficiencies or potential cost savings that may result from the consolidation of the operations of the Company and Sanabil SA.

The valuation assumptions take into consideration the Company’s estimates of customer attrition and revenue growth projections.\n\nThe Company is amortizing the identifiable intangible assets arising from the MDS Mali acquisition in relation to the expected cash flows from the individual intangible assets over their respective useful lives, which have a weighted average life of 20 years (see Note 9).\n\nGoodwill represents MDS Mali’s market presence and its experienced workforce as well as future potential to generate cash flows and other economic benefits and results from assets that are not separately identifiable as part of the transaction and is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThe Company incurred no material transaction costs for the acquisition of MDS Mali.\n\nThe carrying amount of MDS Mali’s assets and liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements are as follows at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:\n\nMarch 31, |  December 31,  \n---|---  \n2022 |  2021  \n(in thousands) |  (in thousands)  \nCash |  $ |  1,545 |  $ |  1,011  \nAccounts receivable |  1,458 |  1,790  \nInventory |  4,223 |  3,132  \nOther current assets |  4,006 |  7,571  \nProperty, plant, and equipment |  7,042 |  7,320  \nIntangible assets |  2,228 |  2,287  \nGoodwill |  2,861 |  2,919  \nTotal assets |  $ |  23,363 |  $ |  26,030  \nAccounts payable |  $ |  3,918 |  $ |  4,493  \nOther current liabilities |  1,128 |  1,017  \nLong-term debt |  5,150 |  7,121  \nTotal liabilities |  $ |  10,196 |  $ |  12,631  \n  \n20  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC AGRO HOLDINGS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**MARCH 31, 2022**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n_Pro Forma information_\n\nThe following unaudited pro forma information presents the impact of the results of operations of MDS Mali on the Company revenue and net income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 as if the MDS Mali acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2021, with adjustments to give effect to pro forma events that are directly attributable to the MDS Mali acquisition.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma information does not reflect any operating efficiencies or potential cost savings that may result from the consolidation of the operations of the Company and MDS Mali. Accordingly, this unaudited pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes and are not intended to represent or be indicative of the actual impact on the results of operations of the Company that would have been achieved had the MDS Mali acquisition occurred at January 1, 2021, nor are they intended to represent or be indicative of impact on future results of operations:\n\nMarch 31, |  March 31,  \n---|---  \n2022 |  2021  \n(in thousands) |  (in thousands)  \nRevenues |  $ |  7,014 |  $ |  2,909  \nNet income |  $ |  35 |  $ |  8  \n  \n_Trigola_\n\nEffective on November 5, 2020, pursuant to an investment and shareholders agreement dated November 5, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Trigola, an entity incorporated in the Republic of Angola and owned by the Parent for a majority for a share in Trigola’s equity of 75%. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company will provide financial investments for the construction, commissioning and operation of a new industrial facility for the processing of wheat and the production of wheat flour, management services and other services on an exclusive basis in relation to Trigola’s business. The Company agrees to fund Trigola for operational cash flow needs and bear the risk of Trigola’s losses from operations and Trigola agreed that the Company has rights to 75% of Trigola’s net profits, if any.\n\nThe carrying amount of the Trigola’s assets and liabilities included in the consolidated financial statements are as follows at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:\n\nMarch 31, |  December 31,  \n---|---  \n2022 |  2021  \n(in thousands) |  (in thousands)  \nCash |  $ |  303 |  $ |  98  \nOther current assets |  254 |  400  \nProperty, plant, and equipment |  4,870 |  4,124  \nTotal assets |  $ |  5,427 |  $ |  4,622  \nAccounts payable |  $ |  5,067 |  $ |  4,122  \nOther current liabilities |  144 |  161  \nTotal liabilities |  $ |  5,211 |  $ |  4,283  \n  \nThe operating results of Trigola included in the consolidated financial statements are as follows for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021:\n\nMarch 31, |  March 31,  \n---|---  \n2022 |  2021  \n(in thousands) |  (in thousands)  \nRevenues |  $ |  - |  $ |  155  \nNet loss |  $ |  (178 |  ) |  $ |  125  \n  \n21  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC AGRO HOLDINGS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**MARCH 31, 2022**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nOn September 30, 2021, the Company acquired 37.10% of the capital stock of GMT Niger headquartered in Niger, which is a non-operational wheat milling facility. The Company has accounted for this investment as an equity method investment. GMT Niger was non-operational for the three months ending March 31, 2022, as such, no gain or loss representing the Company’s portion of ownership was recorded.\n\n**15. EARNINGS PER SHARE**\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the number of weighted average common shares outstanding during the reporting period. The Company’s weighted average number of shares outstanding used in calculating earnings per share are 120,000, for the periods ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Because there was no activity to cause dilution in the weighted average common shares, basic and diluted earnings per share are disclosed together in each of the reporting periods.\n\n**16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\nIn 2018, The Company entered into a five-year supply agreement with Millcorp, pursuant to which the Company is obligated to obtain at least 80% of the Company’s annual requirements of common wheat, durum wheat, or any other cereal, from Millcorp until March 31, 2023. Millcorp is currently providing 100% of the Company’s imported grain needs. The purchases incurred were $37,031 and $59,539 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe Company has commitments with banks to finance its operating activities. The Company has provided collateral and mortgages to banks of $25,464 as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\nFrom time to time the Company is involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. These matters may relate to employment and labor claims, patent and intellectual property claims, claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations. When applicable, the Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Defense costs are expensed as incurred and are included in professional fees. While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management, individually or in the aggregate, no such lawsuits and other proceedings had or are expected to have a material effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements at March 31, 2022.\n\n**17. SEGMENT INFORMATION**\n\nThe Company manages operations on a company-wide basis, thereby making determinations as to the allocation of resources in total rather than on a segment-level basis. The Company has designated reportable segments based on how management views its business. The Company does not segregate assets between segments for internal reporting. Therefore, asset-related information has not been presented. The reportable segments, as presented below, are consistent with the manner in which the Company reports its results to the CODM.\n\nThe principal products that comprise each segment are as follows:\n\n_Soft Wheat_ – The Soft Wheat segment includes the production and sale of soft wheat yielding flour that is used to make desserts and sauces.\n\n_Durum Wheat_ - The Durum Wheat segment includes the production and sale of hard wheat yielding flour that is used to make pasta.\n\n_Couscous and Pasta_ – The Couscous and Pasta segment includes the secondary processing of products including couscous and pasta sold to end customers.\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on sales and operating income. Operating income is defined as gross profit less sales & marketing costs, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses, and other operating expenses. The amounts in the following tables are obtained from reports used by senior management and do not include income taxes. Other expenses not allocated include unallocated corporate expenses (other operating expenses). The accounting policies of the Company’s segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies set forth in Note 2.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC AGRO HOLDINGS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**MARCH 31, 2022**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nFinancial information relating to the Company’s reportable segments is as follows:\n\nMarch 31, |  March 31,  \n---|---  \n2022 |  2021  \n(in thousands)  \nSales to external customers:  \nSoft Wheat |  $ |  62,579 |  $ |  40,191  \nDurum Wheat |  16,415 |  12,540  \nCouscous & Pasta |  10,077 |  7,891  \nTotal |  $ |  89,071 |  $ |  60,622  \nDirect operating income (loss):  \nSoft Wheat |  1,641 |  2,917  \nDurum Wheat |  (260 |  ) |  895  \nCouscous & Pasta |  (772 |  ) |  1,066  \nOperating income |  $ |  609 |  $ |  4,878  \n  \n_Geographic Information_ — The Company had net sales from customers outside of Morocco of approximately 11.7% (7.9% in Mali, 1.3% in Burkina and 2.5% in different other countries) and 3.5% of total consolidated net sales from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements through the March 31, 2022, the Company has evaluated subsequent events for recognition and disclosure through June 3, 2022, the date that these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes were available for issuance.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \n**Exhibit 99.2**\n\n**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\nOn June 9, 2022 (“Closing Date”), Globis consummated the previously announced business combination pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, dated December 19, 2021 (as amended, modified or waived from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”) which provides for the Business Combination (as defined below) between Globis and Forafric Agro Holdings Limited, a Gibraltar private company limited by shares (“FAHL”).\n\nIn accordance with the Business Combination Agreement, the consummation of the following series of separate transactions took place (collectively, the “Business Combination”): (i) Globis formed a new holding company, Globis NV Merger Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Globis Nevada”), which changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by transferring by way of a redomiciliation and domesticating as a Gibraltar private limited company known as “Forafric Global Limited” (the “Redomiciliation”) and, following the Redomiciliation, altered its authorized and issued share capital and thereafter re-registered as a Gibraltar public company limited by shares and changed its name to “Forafric Global PLC” (referred to herein as “New Forafric”); (ii) New Forafric formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Globis NV Merger 2 Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Merger Sub”); (iii) Globis merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving (the “Merger”); (iv) an agent was appointed to act on behalf of Globis stockholders such that, subject to and immediately following the completion of the Merger, the agent entered into a contribution and subscription agreement with New Forafric (the “Contribution Agreement”) pursuant to which the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Merger Sub issued pursuant to the Merger were exchanged (the “Exchange”), on a one-for-one basis, for ordinary shares, nominal value $0.001 per share, of New Forafric (the “Ordinary Shares”); and (v) New Forafric acquired 100% of the equity interests in FAHL from Lighthouse Capital Limited (“Seller”) and FAHL became a direct subsidiary of New Forafric.\n\nThe following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X, as amended by the final rule, Release No. 33-10786, “Amendments to Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses,” and presents the combination of the historical financial information of Globis and FAHL adjusted to give effect to the Business Combination, the PIPE Investment, the Forward Puchase Agreements and the purchase of the Convertible Bonds.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2022 combines the unaudited historical consolidated balance sheet of Globis as of March 31, 2022 with the unaudited historical consolidated balance sheet of FAHL as of March 31, 2022, giving effect to the Business Combination, the PIPE Investment, the Forward Purchase Agreements and the purchase of the Convertible Bonds, as if each had been consummated as of that date.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022 combines the unaudited historical consolidated statement of operations of Globis for the three months ended March 31, 2022 with the unaudited historical consolidated statement of operations of FAHL for the three months ended March 31, 2022, giving effect to the Business Combination, the PIPE Investment, the Forward Purchase Agreements and the purchase of the Convertible Bonds, as if each had been consummated as of January 1, 2021, the earliest period presented.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 combines the audited historical statement of operations of Globis for the year ended December 31, 2021 with the audited historical consolidated statement of operations of FAHL for the year ended December 31, 2021, giving effect to the Business Combination, the PIPE Investment, the Forward Purchase Agreements and the purchase of the Convertible Bonds, as if each had been consummated as of January 1, 2021, the earliest period presented.\n\nThe historical financial information has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to events that relate to material financing transactions consummated after March 31, 2022 and pro forma adjustments that are directly attributable to the Business Combination, the PIPE Investment, the Forward Purchase Agreements and the purchase of the Convertible Bonds. The adjustments presented on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of the combined company upon consummation of the Business Combination, the PIPE Investment, the Forward Purchase Agreements and the purchase of the Convertible Bonds.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different had the companies always been combined. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved had the companies always been combined or the future results that the combined company will experience. Globis and FAHL have not had any historical relationship prior to the Business Combination. Accordingly, no pro forma adjustments were required to eliminate activities between the companies. This information should be read together with the following:\n\n● | the historical unaudited consolidated financial statements of Globis as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021;  \n---|---  \n● | the historical audited financial statements of Globis as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021;  \n● | the historical unaudited consolidated financial statements of FAHL as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021;  \n● | the historical audited consolidated financial statements of FAHL as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020;  \n● | the sections titled “ _Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Globis_ ,” and “ _Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of FAHL_ ” and other financial information included elsewhere in this Current Report on Form 8-K; and  \n● | other information relating to Globis and FAHL included in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the Business Combination Agreement.   \n  \n**Description of the Business Combination**\n\nAs a result of the Business Combination, the Seller received (i) 17,004,762 Ordinary Shares and (b) will be paid the principal sum of $20,000,000 together with interest on the outstanding amount from the Closing Date up to the date of payment (computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve (12) months of thirty (30) days) accrued but unpaid thereon at the fixed per annum rate of 8%. The payment shall be made on the first anniversary of the Closing Date. \n\nIn addition to the foregoing consideration, the Seller shall be entitled to receive, as additional consideration, and without any action on behalf of the Company or the Company’s stockholders, additional Ordinary Shares (the “Earnout Shares”), to be issued as follows during the period from and after the Closing until the end of calendar year 2024 (A) 500,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2022, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) of the Company is equal to or greater than $27 million, (B) 500,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA of New Forafric is equal to or greater than $33 million, and (C) 1,000,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2024, the Buyer Trading Price (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) during the standard market trading hours of a trading day is greater than or equal to $16.50 for any 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days.\n\nOn June 9, 2022, substantially with the Closing, the sale of a number of ordinary shares of New Forafric at a purchase price of $10.50 per shares (the “the PIPE Shares”) was consummated, pursuant to which an accredited investor (the “PIPE Investor”) purchased an aggregate of 1,320,195 Ordinary Shares of New Forafric for total gross proceeds to New Forafric of approximately $13.9 million.\n\nIn connection with the Business Combination, between December 31, 2021 and January 3, 2022, investors (each a “Bond Investor”) subscribed for convertible bonds of FAHL, as issuer, in an aggregate principal amount of $11.5 million (the “FAHL Bonds”) in a private placement, issued pursuant to a Bond Subscription Deed (the “Bond Subscription Deed”), among FAHL, the Seller and the Bond Investors. Unless earlier converted or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the FAHL Bonds, the FAHL Bonds were to mature and be redeemed on June 15, 2026. Interest accrued on the FAHL Bonds at a rate of 6% per annum and the Bond Investors were entitled to certain customary information rights. Pursuant to the current terms of the FAHL Bonds, upon consummation of the Business Combination, the FAHL Bonds were novated to New Forafric and automatically converted into 1,248,426 Ordinary Shares of New Forafric (the “Bond Shares”) at a price per share of $9.45, which was a 10% discount to the PIPE Investment. The number of Ordinary Shares was equal to the quotient that results from dividing the aggregate principal amount of the respective FAHL Bond plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon by $9.45, subject to certain adjustments. The Bond Investors include affiliates Up and Up Capital, LLC and Globis SPAC LLC, the sponsors of Globis, who subscribed for an aggregate principal amount of $9 million of the FAHL Bonds, which converted into 977,659 Ordinary Shares of New Forafric.\n\n**Anticipated Accounting Treatment**\n\nThe Business Combination will be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Globis will be treated as the “acquired” company for accounting purposes and FAHL will be treated as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, the Business Combination will be treated as the equivalent of FAHL issuing shares at the closing of the Business Combination for the net assets of Globis as of the closing date, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Globis will be stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.\n\nFAHL has been determined to be the accounting acquirer based on evaluation of the following facts and circumstances:\n\n● | FAHL’s stockholders will have the largest voting interest in New Forafric under both the no redemption and maximum redemption scenarios;  \n---|---  \n● | The board of directors of the post-combination company has seven members, and FAHL stockholders have the ability to nominate at least the majority of the members of the board of directors;  \n● | FAHL’s senior management is the senior management of the post-combination company;  \n● | The business of FAHL will comprise the ongoing operations of New Forafric; and  \n● | FAHL is the larger entity, in terms of substantive operations and employee base.  \n  \n**Basis of Pro Forma Presentation**\n\nIncluded in the shares outstanding and weighted average shares outstanding as presented in the pro forma combined financial statements are the following:\n\n● | An aggregate of 17,004,762 combined company shares issued to the Seller; the PIPE Investment of $13.9 million in proceeds for the sale of 1,320,195 PIPE Shares to PIPE Investor and 1,248,426 shares issued upon the conversion of the FAHL Bonds upon the consummation of the Business Combination.  \n---|---  \n● | The Earnout Shares have not been included, as these have been deemed financial instruments to be issued upon the occurrence of contingent earn out provisions. The Earnout Shares will be accounted for under ASC Topic 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging”, pursuant to which the Earnout Shares are considered to be indexed to the Company’s own stock and therefore will be classified as equity instruments.  \n  \nThe following presents the calculation of basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. The computation of diluted loss per share excludes the effect of (1) 2,000,000 Earnout Shares and (2) warrants to purchase 15,789,722 shares to be issued because the inclusion of any of these securities would be anti-dilutive.\n\nWeighted average shares calculation, basic and diluted  \n---  \nGlobis public shares | 1,887,464  \nGlobis Sponsor and director shares | 3,148,333  \nGlobis underwriter shares | 402,500  \nPIPE Investor | 1,320,195  \nBond Investors | 1,248,426  \nConversion of Related Party Loans | 1,445,164  \nCombined company shares issued in Business Combination | 17,004,762  \nWeighted average shares outstanding | 26,456,844  \n  \n**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED BALANCE SHEET**\n\n**As of March 31, 2022**\n\n**(in thousands)**\n\n(A) | (B) | Transaction  \n---|---|---  \nFAHL | Globis | Accounting | Pro Forma  \n(Historical) | (Historical) | Adjustments | Combined  \nAssets  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 21,081 | $| -

Globis has been determined to be the accounting acquirer under both the no redemption and the maximum redemption scenarios. Under the reverse recapitalization model, the Business Combination will be treated as FAHL issuing equity for the net assets of Globis, with no goodwill or intangible assets recorded.\n\nThe pro forma adjustments have been prepared as if the Business Combination had been consummated on March 31, 2022, in the case of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet, and on January 1, 2021, the beginning of the earliest period presented, in the case of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.\n\nThe pro forma combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2022 has been prepared using the following:\n\n● | FAHL’s historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022, included as an Exhibit in this Form 8-K.  \n---|---  \n● | Globis’ historical unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2022, included in Globis’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on May 15, 2022.  \n  \nThe pro forma combined statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022 has been prepared using the following:\n\n● | FAHL’s historical unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, included as an Exhibit in this Form 8-K.  \n---|---  \n● | Globis’ historical unaudited consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, included in Globis’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on May 15, 2022.  \n  \nThe pro forma combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 has been prepared using the following:\n\n● | FAHL’s historical consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, included in Globis’proxy statement/prospectus filed on May 12, 2022.  \n---|---  \n● | Globis’ historical statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in Globis’proxy statement/prospectus filed on May 12, 2022.  \n  \nThe adjustments presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of New Forafric after giving effect to the Business Combination. Management has made significant estimates and assumptions in its determination of the pro forma adjustments. As the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared based on these preliminary estimates, the final amounts recorded may differ materially from the information presented.\n\nThe pro forma adjustments reflecting the consummation of the Business Combination are based on certain currently available information and certain assumptions and methodologies that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited condensed pro forma adjustments, which are described in the accompanying notes, may be revised as additional information becomes available and is evaluated. Therefore, it is likely that the actual adjustments will differ from the pro forma adjustments and it is possible the difference may be material. Management believes that its assumptions and methodologies provide a reasonable basis for presenting all of the significant effects of the Business Combination based on information available to management at this time and that the pro forma adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions and are properly applied in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations and financial position would have been had the Business Combination taken place on the dates indicated, nor are they indicative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial position of the post-combination company. They should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto of FAHL and Globis.\n\n**Unaudited Condensed Combined Pro Forma Adjustments to the Balance Sheet**\n\n**(in thousands, except share and per share data)**\n\n**2.** | **Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2022**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X.\n\nThe Transaction Accounting Adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of March 31, 2022 are as follows:\n\n(A) | Derived from the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of FAHL as of March 31, 2022.  \n---|---  \n(B) | Derived from the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Globis as of March 31, 2022.  \n(1) | To reflect the release of cash from marketable securities held in the Trust Account.  \n---|---  \n(2) | To reflect (a) the redemption of 9,612,536 shares of common stock for cash payment of $99.0 million and (b) the reclassification of 1,887,464 shares of common stock subject to redemption to permanent equity for stockholders who did not exercise their redemption rights.  \n(3) | To reflect proceeds received of $13.9 million from the PIPE Investor in exchange for the issuance of 1,320,195 PIPE Shares at a price of $10.50 per share. The PIPE Shares represent 5% of all issued and outstanding ordinary shares.  \n(4) | To reflect the payment of an aggregate of $4.3 million of legal, financial advisory and other professional fees related to the Business Combination, the prepayment of $0.45 million of directors and officers’ insurance premium and the payment of $0.05 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses. The direct, incremental costs of the Business Combination related to the legal, financial advisory, accounting and other professional fees of approximately $3.8 million is reflected as an adjustment to accumulated deficit.  \n(5) | To reflect the recapitalization of FAHL through (a) the contribution of all the share capital in FAHL to New Forafric ordinary shares (b) the issuance of 17,004,762 New Forafric shares, (c) the elimination of the historical accumulated deficit of Globis of $5.6 million, the legal acquiree, (d) the obligation to pay the Seller a cash payment of $20.0 million.  \n(6) | Reflects the conversion of the $11.5 million in FAHL Bonds, along with accrued interest of $0.3 million, into 1,248,426 ordinary shares of New Forafric at $9.45 per share.  \n(7) | Reflects the conversion of the $15.2 million in FAHL stockholder loans into 1,445,164 ordinary shares of New Forafric at $10.50 per share.  \n(8) | Reflects the additional funds received under the promissory note from related parties in the aggregate amount of $0.46 million.   \n(9) | Reflects the repayment of the promissory note due to related parties in the aggregate amount of $4.8 million.   \n(10) | Reflects the establishment of an escrow account ($16.2 million) and a derivative liability ($3.3 million) for New Forafric’s contingent obligation to purchase 1,500,000 Ordinay Shares at $10.80 from certain shareholders, if those shares are not sold in the open market during the three-month period from the close of the Business Combination.   \n  \n**Unaudited Condensed Combined Pro Forma Adjustments to the Statements of Operations**\n\n**(in thousands, except share and per share data)**\n\n**3.** | **Adjustments to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations for the Three and Twelve Months Ended March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe transaction accounting adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the three and twelve months ended March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 are as follows:\n\n(A) | Derived from the unaudited consolidated statement of operations of FAHL for the three months ended March 31, 2022.  \n---|---  \n(B) | Derived from the unaudited consolidated statement of operations of Globis for the three months ended March 31, 2022.  \n(C) | Derived from the audited consolidated statement of operations of FAHL for the year ended December 31, 2021.  \n(D) | Derived from the audited statement of operations of Globis for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.  \n(1) | Represents an adjustment to eliminate the effect of the pro forma balance sheet adjustment presented in Entry #2(4) above in the aggregate amount of $3.8 million for the direct, incremental costs of the Business Combination, assuming those adjustments were made as of the beginning of the fiscal year presented.  \n(2) | Represents an adjustment to eliminate interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account as of the beginning of the period.  \n(3) | Although the blended statutory rate for the redomesticated entity post business combination would be 21%, the consolidated combined pro forma information under both scenarios results in a net loss for tax purposes. As such, a full valuation allowance has been applied resulting in no adjustment.  \n(4) | The calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted net loss per share assumes that Globis’ initial public offering occurred as of the beginning of the earliest period presented. In addition, as the Business Combination is being reflected as if it had occurred at the beginning of the period presented, the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted net loss per share assumes that the shares have been outstanding for the entire period presented. This calculation is retroactively adjusted to eliminate the number of shares redeemed for the entire period.  \n**4.** | **Net Loss per Share**  \n  \nRepresents the net loss per share calculated using the historical weighted average shares outstanding, and the issuance of additional shares in connection with the Business Combination and related transactions, assuming the shares were outstanding since January 1, 2021. As the Business Combination and related transactions are being reflected as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period presented, the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding for basic and diluted net loss per share assumes that the shares issued in connection with the Business Combination have been outstanding for the entire period presented.\n\nThe unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared assuming two alternative levels of redemption of Globis’ public shares:\n\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2022  \n---  \nNet loss | $| (4,518| )  \nWeighted average shares outstanding – basic and diluted | 26,456,844  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share | $| (0.17| )  \nYear Ended December 31, 2021  \nNet loss | $| (14,276| )  \nWeighted average shares outstanding – basic and diluted | 26,456,844  \nBasic and diluted net loss per share | $| (0.54| )  \nWeighted average shares calculations, basic and diluted  \n---  \nGlobis public shares | 1,887,464  \nGlobis initial stockholders’ | 3,148,333  \nGlobis underwriters | 402,500  \nPIPE Investor | 1,320,195  \nBond Investors | 1,248,426  \nConversion of Related Party Loans | 1,445,164  \nFAHL stockholders | 17,004,762  \nWeighted average shares outstanding – basic and diluted | 26,456,844\n"

You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this annual report on Form 20-F and in our other filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including the following risk factors which we face and which are faced by our industry. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, as a result of certain factors including the risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report and our other SEC filings. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” below._\n\n**Summary Risk Factors**\n\nThe following summarizes some, but not all, of the risks provided below. Please carefully consider all of the information discussed in this Item 3.D. “Risk Factors” in this annual report for a more thorough description of these and other risks.\n\n● | Sales of a substantial number of our securities in the public market by the Selling Securityholders and/or by our existing securityholders could cause the price of our Ordinary Shares and Warrants to fall.  \n---|---  \n● | A certain number of our Warrants will become exercisable for our Ordinary Shares, which would increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our shareholders.  \n● | Future resales of our Ordinary Shares issued to our shareholders and other significant shareholders may cause the market price of our Ordinary Shares to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.  \n●  | There is no guarantee that the Warrants will be in the money, and they may expire worthless.  \n● | A market for our Ordinary Shares may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our Ordinary Shares.  \n  \n1  \n---  \n  \n● | The Warrant Agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of the Warrants, which could limit the ability of Warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us in connection with such Warrants.  \n---|---  \n● | The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.  \n● | We are an “emerging growth company,” and it cannot be certain if the reduced SEC reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Ordinary Shares and Warrants less attractive to investors, which could have a material and adverse effect on us, including our growth prospects.  \n● | We qualify as a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to United States domestic public companies.  \n● | We qualify as a “controlled company” within the meaning of the rules of Nasdaq and, as a result, we may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.  \n● | You may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through U.S. courts may be limited, because we are incorporated under the laws of Gibraltar, and we conduct substantially all of our operations, and a majority of our directors and executive officers reside, outside of the United States.  \n● | Severe adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes or severe storms, or the effects of global warming, may also result in extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries and other loss and damage to us.  \n● | Our business is subject to fluctuations in agricultural commodity and other raw material prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, in each case caused by factors outside of our control that could adversely affect our operating results.  \n● | Our business is dependent upon our ability to obtain quality raw materials.  \n● | We are dependent on a related party supplier from which we obtain substantially all of our raw material.  \n● | Our Business may be adversely affected by disruptions in its distribution and logistical systems.  \n● | Our Business is vulnerable to the effects of supply and demand imbalances in our industries.  \n● | We are subject to global and regional economic downturns and related risks.  \n● | The continuation of the war between Russia and Ukraine could led to raw material shortages or increases in raw material costs that could have a material adverse effect upon our business.  \n● | We are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may have an adverse effect on our business.  \n● | We are subject to economic, political and other risks of doing business globally and in emerging markets.  \n● | A natural disaster, economic depression or other adverse events affecting Morocco where most our facilities and customers are located facilities could adversely affect our business.  \n  \n2  \n---  \n  \n● | We are dependent upon a small group of key executives and employees - If we fail to retain and motivate members of our management team and other key employees or fail to attract, train and retain additional employees to support our operations, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed.  \n---|---  \n● | We are subject to industry and other risks that could adversely affect our reputation and financial results.  \n● | We may be subject to significant liability that is not covered by insurance.  \n● | Our risk management strategies may not be effective.  \n● | We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures.  \n● | Agricultural commodity production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry can influence industry profitability, the planting of certain crops versus other uses of agricultural resources, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded and the volume and types of imports and exports.  \n● | Legal claims, government investigations or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penalties.  \n● | Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation or business.  \n● | We face significant competition in each of our businesses and we have numerous competitors, some of which are larger and have greater financial resources than we have.  \n● | Our business and operations would suffer in the event of IT system failures, cybersecurity attacks, data breaches, or vulnerabilities in our or our third-party vendors’ information security program or defenses.  \n● | We are a capital intensive business and depend on cash provided by our operations as well as access to external financing to operate and expand our business.  \n● | You will have limited ability to bring an action against us against our directors and officers, or to enforce a judgment against us or them, because we are incorporated in Gibraltar, because we conduct our operations primarily outside of the United States and because a majority of our directors and officers reside outside the United States.  \n● | Risks relating to our disclosure controls and procedures and internal financial reporting controls.  \n  \n**Risks Related to the Company’s Securities**\n\n**_Issuances by us of additional securities, could affect ownership and voting rights over us. In addition, the issuance of preferred shares, or options or warrants to purchase those preferred shares, could negatively impact the value of the Ordinary Shares as the result of preferential dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption rights and liquidation provisions granted to the stockholders of such preferred shares._**\n\nFrom time to time, we may issue in public or private sales additional securities to third party investors. Such securities may provide holders with ownership and voting rights that could provide the holders thereof with substantial influence over our business. Any preferred shares that may be issued shall have such rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions as may be designated from time-to-time by our board, including preferential dividend rights, voting rights, conversion rights, redemption rights and liquidation provisions. There cannot be any assurance that we will not issue preferred securities with rights and preferences that are more beneficial than those provided to our Ordinary Shares.\n\n3  \n---  \n  \n**_Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our shareholders._**\n\nWe may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements, strategic alliances and marketing or distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a holder of our Ordinary Shares. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations, and could also result in certain additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license IP rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. In addition, issuance of additional equity securities, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our Ordinary Shares to decline. In the event that we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms, including relinquishing or licensing to another party on unfavorable terms our rights to technology or drug and diagnostics technology candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves or potentially reserve for future potential arrangements when we might be able to achieve more favorable terms.\n\n**_Certain of the shareholders acquired their securities at a price that was less than the market price of our Ordinary Shares as of the date they were registered, may earn a positive rate of return even if the price of our Ordinary Shares declines and may be willing to sell their shares at a price less than shareholders that acquired our shares in the public market._**\n\nCertain of our securityholders purchased their respective Ordinary Shares at prices lower than then-current market prices and may therefore experience a positive rate of return on their investment, even if our public securityholders experience a negative rate of return on their investment. In particular, prior to the consummation of Globis’ IPO, Sponsors purchased 3,047,500 shares of common stock of Globis, which were converted into Ordinary Shares at the closing of the Business Combination, for an aggregate purchase price of $26,500, or approximately $0.0087 per share. Based on the closing price of our Ordinary Shares on Nasdaq on August 12, 2022, or $10.36 per share, selling of all 3,047,500 Ordinary Shares would generate a profit of $10.3513 per share, or approximately $31,545,600 in the aggregate. Further, Selling Securityholders acquired an additional 1,349,259 Ordinary Shares at less than $10.36 per share. Upon the resale of all 1,349,259 Ordinary Shares, such Selling Securityholders would generate an average profit of $0.87 per share, or approximately $1,172,367 in the aggregate. As a result, the Sponsor and other shareholders are able to recognize a greater return on their investment than shareholders or holders of warrants that purchased shares of Globis’ common stock in Globis’ IPO, in the public market thereafter, or our Ordinary Shares after the closing of the Business Combination. Furthermore, such shareholders may earn a positive rate of return even if the price of our Ordinary Shares declines significantly. As a result, such securityholders may be willing to sell their shares at a price less than shareholders that acquired our shares in the public market or at higher prices than the price paid by such securityholders. The sale or possibility of sale of these Ordinary Shares, could have the effect of increasing the volatility in the price of the Ordinary Shares or putting significant downward pressure on the price of the Ordinary Shares.\n\n**_Warrants for our Ordinary Shares, if exercised, will increase the number of shares eligible for future resale in the public market and result in dilution to our shareholders._**\n\nWarrants to purchase up to 15,789,722 Ordinary Shares became exercisable in 2022 in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement governing those securities. The exercise price of the Warrants is $11.50 per Ordinary Share, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, we had a total of 15,750,842 warrants outstanding. To the extent such Warrants are exercised, additional Ordinary Shares will be issued, which will result in dilution to the existing holders of Ordinary Shares and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market or the fact that such Warrants may be exercised could adversely affect the market price of Ordinary Shares.\n\n4  \n---  \n  \n**_There is no guarantee that the Warrants will be in the money, and they may expire worthless._**\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Warrants will expire five years from the consummation of our business combination, or June 2027. The exercise price of our Warrants is $11.50 per Ordinary Share. Assuming the exercise of all outstanding warrants for cash, we would receive aggregate proceeds of approximately $181 million. However, we will only receive such proceeds if all the Warrant holders exercise all of their Warrants. We believe that the likelihood that warrant holders determine to exercise their warrants, and therefore the amount of cash proceeds that we would receive, is dependent upon the market price of our Ordinary Shares. If the market price for our Ordinary Shares is less than the exercise price of the warrants (on a per share basis), we believe that warrant holders will be very unlikely to exercise any of their warrants, and accordingly, we will not receive any such proceeds. There is no guarantee that the Warrants will ever be “in the money” prior to their expiration, and as such, the Warrants may expire worthless.\n\n**_Future resales of our Ordinary Shares issued to our shareholders and other significant shareholders may cause the market price of our Ordinary Shares to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well._**\n\nCertain of our shareholders party thereto may sell Ordinary Shares pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if available. In these cases, the resales must meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of that rule.\n\nUpon satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, certain of our shareholders and certain other significant shareholders may sell large amounts of Ordinary Shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, which could have the effect of increasing the volatility in our share price or putting significant downward pressure on the price of our Ordinary Shares.\n\n**_A market for our Ordinary Shares may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our Ordinary Shares._**\n\nAn active trading market for our Ordinary Shares may never develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your Ordinary Shares unless a market can be established and sustained.\n\nThe trading prices of Ordinary Shares and Warrants may be volatile and may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\n● | changes in the sectors in which we operate;  \n---|---  \n● | changes in its projected operating and financial results;  \n● | changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;  \n● | ability to continue to innovate and bring products to market in a timely manner;  \n● | changes in our senior management team, our board of directors or key personnel;  \n● | our involvement in litigation or investigations;  \n● | negative publicity about us or our products;  \n● | the volume of Ordinary Shares available for public sale;  \n● | announcements of significant business developments, acquisitions, or new offerings;  \n● | general economic, political, regulatory, industry, and market conditions; and  \n● | natural disasters or major catastrophic events.  \n  \nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our Ordinary Shares to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of Ordinary Shares or Warrants. Following periods of such volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Because of the potential volatility of Ordinary Shares or Warrants, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources from our business.\n\n5  \n---  \n  \n**_The Warrant Agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of the Warrants, which could limit the ability of Warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us in connection with such Warrants._**\n\nThe Warrant Agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the Warrant Agreement, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) we irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We have waived any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the Warrant Agreement do not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any Warrants under the Warrant Agreement shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions of the Warrant Agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope of the forum provisions of the Warrant Agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a “foreign action”) in the name of any holder of the warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an “enforcement action”), and (y) having service of process made upon such holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder’s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such holder.\n\nThe choice-of-forum provision limits a Warrant holder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of the Warrant Agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\n\n**_The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert our management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members._**\n\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, NASDAQ listing requirements and other applicable securities rules and regulations. As such, we incur relevant legal, accounting and other expenses, and these expenses may increase even more if we no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We may need to hire more employees or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.\n\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We expect these laws and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to render some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty.\n\nMany members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage the transition to being a public company subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and regulations and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. The need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert the management’s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and consequently we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and, even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could cause an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and reputation.\n\n**_We are an “emerging growth company,” and it cannot be certain if the reduced SEC reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Ordinary Shares and Warrants less attractive to investors, which could have a material and adverse effect on us, including our growth prospects._**\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Business Combination, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which we issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We intend to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to most other public companies, whether or not they are classified as “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, an exemption from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.\n\nIn addition, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts “emerging growth companies” from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and we have different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with certain other public companies difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\n\nFurthermore, even after we no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as long as we continue to qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we will be exempt from certain provisions of the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. domestic public companies, including, but not limited to, the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q containing unaudited financial and other specified information, or current reports on Form 8-K, upon the occurrence of specified significant events. In addition, we will not be required to file annual reports and financial statements with the SEC as promptly as U.S. domestic companies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act, and are not required to comply with Regulation FD, which restricts the selective disclosure of material information.\n\nAs a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they deem important or at the same time if we were not a foreign private issuer. We cannot predict if investors will find our Ordinary Shares and Warrants less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Ordinary Shares and Warrants less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market and share price for our Ordinary Shares and Warrants may be more volatile.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \n**_We qualify as a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange Act, and as such we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to United States domestic public companies._**\n\nBecause we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the securities rules and regulations in the United States that are applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including: (i) the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K with the SEC; (ii) the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents, or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; (iii) the sections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from trades made in a short period of time; and (iv) the selective disclosure rules by issuers of material nonpublic information under Regulation FD.\n\nWe will be required to file an annual report on Form 20-F within four months of the end of each fiscal year. In addition, we intend to publish our results on a quarterly basis through press releases, distributed pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Press releases relating to financial results and material events will also be furnished to the SEC on Form 6-K. However, the information we are required to file with or furnish to the SEC will be less extensive and less timely compared to that required to be filed with the SEC by U.S. domestic issuers. Accordingly, you may receive less or different information about us than you would receive about a U.S. domestic public company.\n\nWe could lose our status as a foreign private issuer under current SEC rules and regulations if more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities become directly or indirectly held of record by U.S. holders and any one of the following is true: (i) the majority of our directors or executive officers are U.S. citizens or residents; (ii) more than 50% of our assets are located in the United States; or (iii) our business is administered principally in the United States. If we lose our status as a foreign private issuer in the future, we will no longer be exempt from the rules described above and, among other things, will be required to file periodic reports and annual and quarterly financial statements as if we were a company incorporated in the United States. If this were to happen, we would likely incur substantial costs in fulfilling these additional regulatory requirements, and members of our management would likely have to divert time and resources from other responsibilities to ensuring these additional regulatory requirements are fulfilled.\n\n**_We are a “controlled company” as that term is defined in the rules of Nasdaq and, as a result, qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. To the extent that we elect to rely on these exemptions, shareholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements._**\n\nAs a result of the completion of the Business Combination, Seller controls a majority of the voting power (approximately 69.3%) of the outstanding Ordinary Shares. The ultimate beneficial owner of Seller is Lighthouse Corporation PTC, as trustee of the Lighthouse Settlement, the sole shareholder of Seller. The Lighthouse Settlement is a discretionary trust of which Yariv Elbaz and his family are the named potential beneficiaries. The trustee, Lighthouse Corporation PTC Limited, controls the affairs of the trust.\n\nAs a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq. Under these rules, a listed company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\n● | the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;  \n---|---  \n● | the requirement that our nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors; and  \n● | the requirement that our compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors.  \n  \nTo the extent that we continue to meet the definition of a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq, we may rely on these exemptions and, to the extent that we choose to do so, we may not have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors and our corporate governance and compensation committees may not consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**_You may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through U.S. courts may be limited, because we are incorporated under the laws of Gibraltar, and we conduct substantially all of our operations, and a majority of our directors and executive officers reside, outside of the United States._**\n\nWe are an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of Gibraltar and we conduct a majority of our operations outside the United States. Substantially all of our assets are located outside the United States. A majority of our officers and directors reside outside the United States, and a substantial portion of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or officers who reside outside the United States, to bring original actions outside the United States based on the securities laws of the United States against our directors or officers who reside outside the United States, or to enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against our directors or officers outside the United States.\n\nOur corporate affairs will be governed by our Memorandum and Articles of Association and the Companies Act 2014 of the Laws of Gibraltar. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors under Gibraltar law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, Gibraltar has a different body of securities laws than the United States and some U.S. states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than Gibraltar. In addition, shareholders of Gibraltar companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the United States.\n\nCertain corporate governance practices in Gibraltar, which is our home country, differ significantly from requirements for companies incorporated in other jurisdictions such as the United States. As a foreign private issuer whose securities are listed on the NASDAQ, we are permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices in lieu of the requirements of the NASDAQ Rules pursuant to NASDAQ Rule 5615(a)(3), which provides for such exemption to compliance with the NASDAQ Rule 5600 Series. Since Gibraltar does not have any rules regarding the following, we intend to rely on the exemption available to foreign private issuers for the requirement that the compensation committee be comprised of independent directors and the requirement that we obtain shareholder approval to issue 20% or more of our outstanding Ordinary Shares in a private offering. To the extent we choose to follow home country practice with respect to corporate governance matters, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they otherwise would under rules and regulations applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.\n\nAs a result of all of the above, our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a company incorporated in the United States.\n\n**_We do not anticipate paying dividends for the foreseeable future._**\n\nIt is expected that we will continue to operate at loss in the foreseeable future, and will retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, it is not expected that we will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\nOur board of directors will have discretion as to whether to distribute dividends. Even if the board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on the future results of operations and cash flow, capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from subsidiaries, our financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, you may need to rely on sales of our Ordinary Shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on your investment. There is no guarantee that our Ordinary Shares will appreciate in value or that the market price of our Ordinary Shares will not decline.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to Our Business**\n\n**_Severe adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes or severe storms, or the effects of global warming, may also result in extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries and other loss and damage to us._**\n\nThe international price of wheat is the main risk in our operations. Fluctuation of wheat cost depends on weather and strategies of the main producers of wheat based in North America, Central Europe and around the Black Sea. Adverse weather conditions have historically caused volatility in the agricultural commodity industry by causing crop failures or significantly reduced harvests, which may affect the supply and pricing of the agricultural commodities that we sell and use in our business, negatively affect the creditworthiness of agricultural producers who do business with us or impact our ability to obtain sufficient unprocessed grains to meet demand. The variation in the acquisition price of the wheat cannot be directly impacted on our average selling price of flour, semolina, pasta and couscous.\n\nSevere adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes or severe storms, may also result in extensive property damage, extended business interruption, personal injuries and other loss and damage to us. Our operations also rely on dependable and efficient transportation services. A disruption in transportation services, as a result of weather conditions or otherwise, may also significantly adversely impact our operations.\n\nAdditionally, the potential physical impacts of climate change are uncertain and may vary by region. These potential effects could include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels that could adversely impact our costs and business operations, the location and costs of global agricultural commodity production and the supply and demand for agricultural commodities. Climate change could also lead to stronger production variability than today which could result in price volatility. Climate change could cause temperature increases and rainfall changes that could lead to lower yields in Morocco and other semi-arid Mediterranean countries in the future, which could impact raw material costs, availability and quality. These effects could be material to our results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\n\n**_Our business is subject to fluctuations in agricultural commodity and other raw material prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, in each case caused by factors outside of our control that could adversely affect our operating results._**\n\nAs we cannot control the average selling price of our finished products, any increase in the cost of raw materials has a direct impact on our margins.\n\nOur business is subject to fluctuations in agricultural commodity and other raw material prices caused by other factors outside of our control such as currency exchange rate fluctuations, local and international changes in supply and demand caused by factors outside of our control, including farmer planting and selling decisions, government agriculture programs and policies, global inventory levels, demand for biofuels, weather and crop conditions and demand for and supply of, competing commodities and substitutes, that could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n**_Our business is dependent upon our ability to obtain quality raw materials._**\n\nThe quality of our products depends upon the quality of raw materials. If we do not have access to high quality of wheat, we have to use enhancers such as enzymes, ascorbic acid and gluten, to reach a higher level of quality. Such additional costs will negatively impact our results.\n\n**_We are dependent on a related party supplier from which we obtain substantially all of our raw material._**\n\nIn 2018, we entered into a five-year supply agreement with Millcorp Geneve SA (“Millcorp”) a wholly owned subsidiary of the Seller, pursuant to which we are obligated to obtain at least 80% of our annual requirements of common wheat, durum wheat, or any other cereal, from Millcorp which expired in March 31, 2023 and subsequently extended 3 years through March 31, 2026. Any disruption of Millcorp’s operations or its inability to perform its supply obligations could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nAlthough we believe our transactions with Millcorp contain fair market value terms, such transactions with an entity in which related parties hold ownership interests present potential for conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest may also arise in connection with the exercise of contractual remedies under these transactions, such as the treatment of events of default.\n\n10  \n---  \n  \n**_Our Business may be adversely affected by disruptions in its distribution and logistical systems._**\n\nThe cost of wheat is affected not only by the wheat market but also by the cost of freight. Significant increases in shipping and freight cost could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n**_Our Business is vulnerable to the effects of supply and demand imbalances in our industries._**\n\nHistorically, the market of flour mills in Morocco is imbalanced, with periods of high demand and period of low demand and with a supply capacity exceeding the demand. To maintain our market shares, we must compete on price and reduce margin.\n\n**_We are subject to global and regional economic downturns and related risks._**\n\nThe level of demand for our products is affected by global and regional demographic and macroeconomic conditions, including population growth rates and changes in standards of living. A significant downturn in global economic growth, or recessionary conditions in major geographic regions, may lead to reduced demand for agricultural commodities, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\n**_The continuation of the war between Russia and Ukraine could led to raw material shortages or increases in raw material costs that could have a material adverse effect upon our business._**\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched an invasion in Ukraine. The invasion may severely disrupt or depress wheat harvests in Ukraine and impair Ukraine’s ability to export wheat. In addition, as a consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and other countries have imposed sanctions against and penalties for doing business in Russia and with certain Russian-owned businesses. These sanctions may limit Russia’s ability to export wheat. We do not currently have any business operations in Russia and is not purchasing raw materials from suppliers in Russia thus the sanctions regime imposed upon Russia does not currently directly impact the Company’s business. However, Ukraine accounts for approximately 10% of the world’s wheat exports and Russia accounts for approximately 16% of the world’s wheat exports. Therefore, the continuation of the war between the Ukraine and Russia could lead to a material reduction in the availability of wheat on the international market which could in turn affect our ability to obtain raw materials or result in substantial increases in prices of raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business.\n\n**_We are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may have an adverse effect on our business._**\n\nDue to the international nature of our business, we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, particularly the Angolan Kwanza and the Euro affect our revenues and expenses that are denominated in local currencies and may also have a negative impact on the value of our assets.\n\n**_We are subject to economic, political and other risks of doing business globally and in emerging markets._**\n\nWe are a global business with all of our assets and operations located outside the United States. In addition, part of our strategy involves expanding our business in several emerging market regions, including Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. Volatile international economic, political and market conditions may have a negative impact on our operating results and our ability to achieve our business strategies.\n\nWe are also exposed to other risks of international operations, including:\n\n● | changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation or enforcement in the countries where we operate, such as tax laws,   \n---|---  \n● | sovereign risk;  \n  \n11  \n---  \n  \n● | exchange controls or other currency restrictions and limitations on the movement of funds, such as on the remittance of dividends by subsidiaries;  \n---|---  \n● | challenges in maintaining an effective internal control environment with operations in multiple international locations, including language differences, varying levels of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) expertise in international locations; and  \n● | labor disruptions, civil unrest, significant political instability, wars or other armed conflict or acts of terrorism.  \n● | adverse trade policies or trade barriers on agricultural commodities and commodity products  \n● | inflation and hyperinflationary economic conditions and adverse economic effects resulting from governmental attempts to control inflation, such as imposition of wage and price controls and higher interest rates;   \n● | difficulties in enforcing agreements or judgments and collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;  \n● | government intervention, including through expropriation, or regulation of the economy or natural resources, including restrictions on foreign ownership of land or other assets;  \n  \nThese risks could adversely affect our operations, business strategies and operating results.\n\n**_A natural disaster, economic depression or other adverse events affecting Morocco where most our facilities and customers are located facilities could adversely affect our business._**\n\nA significant portion of our operations and sales are in Morocco. A natural disaster, economic downturn or depression, civil unrest, significant political instability, wars or other armed conflict or acts of terrorism affecting the country could have a negative adverse impact on our operations and business.\n\n**_We are dependent upon a small group of key executives and employees - If we fail to retain and motivate members of our management team and other key employees or fail to attract, train and retain additional employees to support our operations, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed._**\n\nOur success and future growth depend largely upon the continued services of our executive officers as well as our other key employees. These executives and certain key employees members have been primarily responsible for the success and growth of our Company and development of our brands, reputation and relationships with our customers. None of such persons is subject to long term written employment arrangements. The loss of any such persons could adversely affect our business and ability to grow. In addition, our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees and managers who understand and appreciate our culture and can represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners and consumers. An inability to either replace departing personnel or attract and retain new qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\n\n**_We are subject to industry and other risks that could adversely affect our reputation and financial results._**\n\nWe are subject to food and feed industry risks which include, but are not limited to, crop disease, spoilage, contamination, tampering or other adulteration of products, product liability claims and recalls and government regulation regarding matters such as food and feed safety, nutritional standards and genetically modified organisms. We are also subject to shifts in customer and consumer preferences. These risks could not only adversely affect our business and operating results but also our corporate reputation.\n\nAs a company whose products comprise staple food and feed products sold globally, maintaining a good corporate reputation is critical to our continued success. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions, which can shift rapidly in response to negative incidents. The failure or alleged failure to maintain high standards for quality, safety, integrity, environmental sustainability and social responsibility, including with respect to raw materials, even if untrue, may result in adverse tangible effects, such as reduced demand for our products.\n\n12  \n---  \n  \n**_We may be subject to significant liability that is not covered by insurance._**\n\nWe believe that our insurance coverage is consistent with industry practice, and is sufficient for our needs. However, claims under our insurance policies may be subject to certain exceptions, may not be honored fully, in a timely manner, or at all, or we may incur severe, unexpected losses that are not fully covered by our insurance. If we were to incur substantial liabilities or if our business operations were interrupted for a substantial period of time, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\n**_Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud._**\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.\n\nWe believe that any disclosure controls and procedures, or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\n\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, harm our results of operations, and lead to a decline in the trading price of our Ordinary Shares. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods.\n\n**_If we fail to establish and maintain proper internal financial reporting controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired._**\n\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to file a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. The presence of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could result in financial statement errors which, in turn, could lead to errors in our financial reports and/or delays in our financial reporting, which could require us to restate our operating results.\n\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, our management and our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. Investors may lose confidence in our operating results, the price of the Ordinary Shares could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. In addition, if we are unable to meet the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Ordinary Shares may not be able to remain listed on the NASDAQ Global Market.\n\n13  \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to Our Ability To Retain Existing Customers, Attract New Customers, Expand Product Offerings, and Increase Processed Volumes and Revenue from Both New and Existing Customers.**\n\nThe future growth of our business depends on our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers as well as getting existing customers and new customers to increase the volumes of purchases and therefore grow revenue.\n\nA customer’s purchase of our products may decrease for a variety of reasons, including the customer’s level of satisfaction with our products and services, the expansion of business to offer new products and services, the effectiveness of our support services, the pricing of our products and services, the pricing, range and quality of competing products or services, the effects of global economic conditions, regulatory or financial institution limitations, trust, and our ability to deliver quality products at competitive prices in a timely fashion.\n\nAny failure by us to retain existing customers, attract new customers, and increase revenue from both new and existing customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These efforts may require substantial financial expenditures, commitments of resources, developments of our processes, and other investments and innovations.\n\n**Risks Related to Our Growth**\n\n**_Our risk management strategies may not be effective._**\n\nWe may not be able to achieve the efficiencies, savings and other benefits anticipated from our cost reduction, margin improvement and other business optimization initiatives.\n\nWe are continually implementing programs to reduce costs, increase efficiencies and enhance our business. Initiatives implemented in the past years have included the outsourcing of certain activities in several regions and the rationalization of manufacturing operations globally, including the implementation of an operational improvement program. Unexpected delays, increased costs, adverse effects on our internal control environment, inability to retain and motivate employees or other challenges arising from these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated savings or other intended benefits of these activities.\n\n**_We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures._**\n\nWe are an active acquirer of other companies, and we have joint ventures partners. Part of our strategy involves acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures designed to expand and enhance our business. Our ability to benefit from acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances depends on many factors, including our ability to identify suitable prospects, negotiate favorable transaction terms and successfully consummate and integrate any businesses we acquire.\n\nOur acquisition activities may involve unanticipated delays, costs and other problems. If we encounter unexpected problems with one of our acquisitions, our senior management may be required to divert attention away from other aspects of our businesses to address these problems. Additionally, we may fail to consummate proposed acquisitions, after incurring expenses and devoting substantial resources, including management time, to such transactions.\n\nAcquisitions also pose the risk that we may be exposed to successor liability relating to actions by an acquired company and its management before the acquisition. The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition, and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies, may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities. A material liability associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations and reduce the benefits of the acquisition. Additionally, acquisitions involve other risks, such as differing levels of management and internal control effectiveness at the acquired entities, systems integration risks, the risk of impairment charges relating to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, the risk of significant accounting charges resulting from the completion and integration of a sizeable acquisition, the need to fund increased capital expenditures and working capital requirements, our ability to retain and motivate employees of acquired entities and other unanticipated problems and liabilities.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to Government Regulation**\n\nAgricultural commodity production and trade flows are significantly affected by government policies and regulations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products and energy policies (including biofuels mandates), can influence industry profitability, the planting of certain crops versus other uses of agricultural resources, the location and size of crop production, whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded and the volume and types of imports and exports. In addition, international trade disputes can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions.\n\nThe Moroccan market where the bulk of our business originates and where we operate eight milling plants, is highly regulated by the Moroccan government. In particular:\n\n1. | Soft wheat cannot be freely imported during the calendar year. All our soft wheat must be imported before end of April and from beginning of September or October depending on the harvests of local wheat in Morocco. This is designed to protect local Moroccan producers of wheat by enabling them to sell their production on the local market. For an industrial producer, the quality of local wheat is not high enough to ensure a good quality of finished products.  \n---|---  \n2. | Part of the flour on the Moroccan market is subsidized by the government. This mechanism is to disappear in the next few months which may change the competition on the market.  \n3. | All soft wheat imported to Morocco must be certificated for import by the National Office for Food Safety in Morocco (Office National de Securité Sanitaire des Produits Alimentaires or “ONSSA”). Our subsidiaries have generally been successful in obtaining ONSSA certification of the export of wheat to Morocco. Any failure or delay in our ability to obtain ONSSA certification in the future cold have a material adverse effect on our business.   \n  \n**_Legal claims, government investigations or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penalties._**\n\nSince we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks, we are subject to the risk of legal claims, government investigations or other regulatory enforcement actions. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our suppliers and distributors will not violate our policies and procedures. Moreover, a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. Legal claims, government investigations or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales, reputation, financial condition and operating results. In addition, the costs and other effects of defending potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us may be difficult to determine and could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\n**_Litigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation or business._**\n\nFrom time to time, we may be party to various claims and litigation proceedings. We evaluate these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates. Although we carry insurance for certain potential liabilities, such coverage may be insufficient or may not cover the potential liabilities with which we may be faced. We are not currently party to any material litigation.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to Competition**\n\nWe face significant competition in each of our businesses and we have numerous competitors, some of which are larger and have greater financial resources than we have. As many of the products we sell are global commodities, the markets for our products are highly price competitive and in many cases sensitive to product substitution. In addition, to compete effectively, we must continuously focus on improving efficiency in our production and distribution operations, as well as developing and maintaining appropriate market share and customer relationships. Competition could cause us to lose market share or reduce pricing, which could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability.\n\n**Risks Related to Data Security and Intellectual Property**\n\n**_Our business and operations would suffer in the event of IT system failures, cybersecurity attacks, data breaches, or vulnerabilities in our or our third-party vendors’ information security program or defenses._**\n\nOur business relies upon information technology systems operated by us and by our third-party service providers. These systems may fail or experience operational disruption, experience cybersecurity attacks, or be damaged by computer viruses and unauthorized access. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit confidential information (including but not limited to intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information). It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. While we are currently in the process of developing and implementing policies and procedures to ensure the security and integrity of our information technology systems and confidential and proprietary information, we do not currently have any written policies and procedures in place. If we fail to maintain adequate policies and procedures for the protection of our information technology systems and confidential and proprietary information, we may be vulnerable to security breaches or disruptions and system breakdowns or other damage or interruptions.\n\nWe do not conduct audits or formal evaluations of our third-party vendors’ information technology systems and cannot be sure that our third-party vendors have sufficient measures in place to ensure the security and integrity of their information technology systems and our confidential and proprietary information. If our third-party vendors fail to protect their information technology systems and our confidential and proprietary information, we may be vulnerable to disruptions in service and unauthorized access to our confidential or proprietary information and we could incur liability and reputational damage and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. We have not, to our knowledge, experienced any material IT system failures or any material cybersecurity attacks to date. We cannot assure you that our data protection efforts and our investment in information technology will prevent significant breakdowns, data leakages, breaches in our systems or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants, or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations or financial condition. Furthermore, cyberattacks and security incidents are expected to accelerate in both frequency and impact as the use of AI increases and attackers become increasingly sophisticated and utilize tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence.\n\nIf such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs, business operations, a breach of sensitive personal information or a loss or corruption of critical data assets including trade secrets or other proprietary information. Such IT system failures, cybersecurity attacks or vulnerabilities to our or our third-party vendors’ information security programs or defenses could result in legal liability, reputational damage, business interruption, and our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our products or any future products could be delayed or disrupted. Moreover, containing and remediating any IT system failure, cybersecurity attack or vulnerability may require significant investment of resources. Furthermore, significant security breaches or disruptions of our internal information technology systems or those of our third-party vendors and other contractors and consultants could result in the loss, misappropriation and/or unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information), which could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us.\n\n16  \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to Our Capital Requirements**\n\n**_We are a capital intensive business and depend on cash provided by our operations as well as access to external financing to operate and expand our business._**\n\nWe require significant amounts of capital to operate our business and fund capital expenditures. In addition, our working capital needs are directly affected by the prices of agricultural commodities, with increases in commodity prices generally causing increases in our borrowing levels. Furthermore, the expansion of our business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require us to have access to significant amounts of capital and working capital. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or raise sufficient external financing to fund these activities and their working capital, we may be forced to limit our operations and growth plans, which may adversely impact our competitiveness and, therefore, our results of operations.\n\n**Risks Related to Incorporation in Gibraltar**\n\n**_You will have limited ability to bring an action against us against our directors and officers, or to enforce a judgment against us or them, because we are incorporated in Gibraltar, because we conduct our operations primarily outside of the United States and because a majority of our directors and officers reside outside the United States._**\n\nWe are a Gibraltar public company limited by shares and, as a result, the rights of the holders of our Ordinary Shares are governed by Gibraltar law and our Memorandum and Articles of Association. We conduct our operations through subsidiaries which are located primarily outside the United States. All of our assets are located outside the United States, and substantially all of our business is conducted outside the United States. All of our officers and a majority of our directors will reside outside the United States and a substantial portion of the assets of those persons are located outside of the United States. As a result, it could be difficult or impossible for you to effect service of process on these individuals in the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under applicable securities laws or otherwise or to enforce in the United States judgments obtained in U.S. courts against us or those persons based on civil liability provisions of the U.S. securities laws. It is doubtful whether the courts in Gibraltar will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions, including the U.S., against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in against us or our directors or officers under the securities laws of other jurisdictions. As a result, public shareholders might have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a U.S. company.\n\n**Item 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY**\n\nA. History and Development of the Company\n\nWe are an integrated, global business involved in the purchase, storage, transport, processing and sale of agricultural commodities and commodity products. The principal agricultural commodities that we handle are flour and semolina, and secondary processing products such as pasta and couscous.\n\nOur subsidiary Forafric Maroc is the combination of two former family owned businesses, Forafric (Maymouna) and Tria Group. Forafric (Maymouna) was acquired by FAHL in April 2015 and the Tria Group was acquired by us in January 2016. Today, we sell processed commodity products to customers in approximately forty-five countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The principal purchasers of our products are wholesale foods manufacturers and distributors. We have developed an extensive global logistics network including storage facilities with direct access to ports by rail.\n\nOn June 9, 2022, we completed a Business Combination, in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement, by and among Globis, the Company, and Lighthouse Capital Limited, a Gibraltar private company limited by shares.\n\nOn June 9, 2022, as contemplated in the Business Combination Agreement: (i) Globis merged with and into Globis NV Merger 2 Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Merger Sub”), with Merger Sub surviving (the “Merger”); (ii) immediately following the effectiveness of the Merger, all of the common stock of Merger Sub issued pursuant to the Merger were contributed to the Company; and (iii) thereafter the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in FAHL from the Seller and FAHL became a direct subsidiary of the Company.\n\n17  \n---  \n  \nAs a result of the Business Combination, (i) Globis stockholders received one ordinary share, nominal value $0.001 per share, of the Company (each, an “Ordinary Share”) for each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Globis (the “Common Stock”) held prior to the Merger; (ii) the issued and outstanding redeemable warrants that were registered pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-1 (SEC File No. 333-250939) of Globis automatically became redeemable warrants to acquire Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $11.50 per share on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable warrant agreement (which Warrant Agreement was assigned and novated by Globis to the Company with no other changes having been made to the terms of any issued and outstanding Public Warrants as a result of the Merger); (iii) each issued and outstanding warrant of Globis issued in a private placement automatically became warrants to acquire Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of $11.50 per share on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable warrant agreement (with no other changes having been made to the terms of any issued and outstanding private placement warrants as a result of the Merger); and (iv) each issued and outstanding unit of Globis that had not been previously separated into the underlying Common Stock and underlying warrant upon the request of the holder thereof, was cancelled and entitled the holder thereof to one Ordinary Share and one redeemable warrant to acquire one Ordinary Share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable warrant agreement.\n\nThe Business Combination was consummated on June 9, 2022. The transaction was approved by the Globis Board and was approved at the Special Meeting of Globis’ shareholders held on June 9, 2022. Globis’ shareholders also voted to approve all other proposals presented at the Special Meeting. As a result of the Business Combination, on June 10, 2022, our Ordinary Shares and Warrants commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbols of “AFRI” and “AFRIW,” respectively.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates our corporate structure as of the date of this annual report:\n\n![](https://cdn.kscope.io/3dbd92ba410681c341d0b685f7cc8e9f-form20-f_004.jpg)\n\nOn July 26, 2023, we acquired 90% of Société Industrielle de Minoterie du Sud (“SIMS”),a soft wheat milling company with primary operations in Marrakesh, for cash consideration and noncontrolling interest in the amount of approximately $56 thousand and the assumption of SIMS' outstanding debts in the amount of approximately $5.3 million.\n\n18  \n---  \n  \n**Emerging Growth Company Status**\n\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and financial disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies, that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these exemptions.\n\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\n\nWe could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (1) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.235 billion, (2) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our Ordinary Shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months, or (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\n\n**Foreign Private Issuer Status**\n\nWe are a foreign private issuer within the meaning of the rules under the Exchange. As such, we are exempt from certain provisions applicable to United States domestic public companies. For example:\n\n● | we are not required to provide as many Exchange Act reports, or as frequently, as a domestic public company;  \n---|---  \n● | for interim reporting, we are permitted to comply solely with our home country requirements, which are less rigorous than the rules that apply to domestic public companies;  \n● | we are not required to provide the same level of disclosure on certain issues, such as executive compensation;  \n● | we are exempt from provisions of Regulation FD aimed at preventing issuers from making selective disclosures of material information;  \n● | we are not required to comply with the sections of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; and  \n● | we are not required to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their share ownership and trading activities and establishing insider liability for profits realized from any “short-swing” trading transaction.  \n  \nB. Business Overview\n\n_Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references in this section to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” the “group” and other similar terms refer to FAHL and its subsidiaries prior to the Business Combination and to Forafric Global PLC and its consolidated subsidiaries after giving effect to the Business Combination as the context may require._\n\n**Overview**\n\nWe operate through Forafric Agro Holdings Limited (“FAHL”), our fully owned subsidiary, which is a private company limited by shares incorporated in Gibraltar under the laws of Gibraltar. FAHL is registered with the Registrar of Companies in Gibraltar under registration number 114436. FAHL is a holding company, and substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Our corporate headquarters is located at Madison Building, Midtown, Queensway, Gibraltar GX11 1AA. Our registered office is located at 57/63 Line Wall Road, Gibraltar GX11 1AA.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \nWe are an integrated, global business involved in the purchase, storage, transport, processing and sale of agricultural commodities and commodity products. The principal agricultural commodities that we handle are flour and semolina, and secondary processing products such as pasta and couscous.\n\nOur subsidiary Forafric Maroc is the combination of two former family owned businesses, Forafric (Maymouna) and Tria Group. Forafric (Maymouna) was acquired by FAHL in April 2015 and the Tria Group was acquired by FAHL in January 2016.\n\nTria Group was established in 1923 in Morocco under the name Minoterie Biscuiterie d’Anfa. The brand Tria was created in 1949. Tria Group was purchased by Mr. Mohammed Jamaleddine (father of Mustapha Jamaleddine, CEO of the group) in 1974. At this time the group had only one mill with a total capacity of 70 tons per day. In 1981, a first investment was made to increase the capacity to 150T/day. The production of pasta and couscous was launched in 1989. In 1995, a second investment to increase the capacity was made. In 2004, Tria formed the Ceraelis trading company, and in 2008, Finalog, a logistics company, with storage facilities in Casablanca. Tria Group was managed by the Jamaleddine family until 2016 and its acquisition by Forafric.\n\nForafric (Maymouna) was created in 1943. It initially specialized in the import-export of cereals and various other food and plant products (e.g., legumes, sugar, tea, aromatic plants, etc.) which in 1997 evolved into industrial flour milling by buying and then building its own mills. In 2003, Forafric decided to market its own brand, MayMouna.\n\nIn 2021, we acquired a majority ownership interest in MDS Mali and MDS Burkina Faso, both of which are based in Western Africa and are dedicated to soft wheat crushing. In addition, we acquired a majority ownership interest in Sanabil SA, a wheat milling business in the region of Meknes, Morocco.\n\nOur subsidiary based in Angola is a greenfield project to develop soft wheat activity.\n\n**Industry Overview**\n\nWe operate primarily in the large and growing African food market, providing base products such as flour, semolina pasta and couscous, which are staple products for most consumers in this and other developing markets. We foresee continued market growth with the projected demographical increase and urbanization in the region. The African population was approximately 1.3 billion in 2020 and, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), will reach approximately 2.5 billion by 2050. Urbanization in Africa is projected to reach 1.5 billion by 2050, adding 950 million people since 2015. 36% of the world’s undernourished population is in Africa. This projected increase in urbanization is expected to lead to increased demand for more processed products.\n\nWheat is unique as a source of the gluten proteins that alone have the dough-forming properties needed to make the variety of foods that rely on the rheology of dough, namely, leavened breads, pasta, noodles, flat/pocket breads, steamed breads, biscuits, cakes, pastries and various food ingredients. Therefore wheat, an essential part of the diet of most of the world’s population, is prominent in world trade. Its quality traits are the most critical of all the grains.\n\nResearch has shown that fiber may play a large role in maintaining bowel health, lowering cholesterol, stabilizing blood glucose levels and controlling weight gain. In recent years, the awareness of the health benefits of high fiber diets has increased. Whole grain wheat flour is known for its high fiber, and enriched wheat flour is also a source of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin E. Wheat is also considered to be a good source of several minerals such as iron, calcium, selenium, manganese, copper, phosphorous, and folate. It offers a number of health benefits, which has led to increased demand for wheat flour among end users. Skin protection, nourishment, and energy are some of the basic health benefits offered by the consumption of wheat flour.\n\n20  \n---  \n  \nThe high fiber content in whole grain wheat is known to promote gut health. Consumption of whole grain wheat flour has also showed positive effects on blood sugar levels. These are some of the reasons that are contributing to change in dietary preferences of individuals. We do not believe that concerns regarding gluten intolerance and celiac disease, which impact only small percentages of the population, will have any appreciable impact on projected sales growth.\n\nMost of our assets are based in Morocco. The total wheat production for Morocco for the 2022-2023 season was 5.25 million of metric tons (MT) of wheat and 0.8 million of MT of durum. The total consumption of wheat-based product per person in Morocco is the second highest in the world, with 200kg per person per year. This is 3 times the average consumption per person per year of the rest of the world, as bread remains a staple of both the Moroccan diet and of Moroccan culture. The population of Morocco is projected to grow from approximately 38 million in 2024 to 46 million by 2050.\n\n**Our Strengths**\n\nLeader in the Moroccan market\n\nWe are a leader in the Moroccan market in respect of the wheat milling business, with a milling capacity of 3,000 tons per day (Vs 2.200 in 2022). This position enables us to have better access to raw materials, to improve its productivity and to benefit from the power of our two main brands, Maymouna and Tria _(See Our Brands and Products)._\n\nRaw materials are the key to profitability in our industry. Raw material accounts for up to 90% of total cost. With a total volume of 725,000 tons per year, the group has great bargaining power, ahead of many international providers of wheat, and has, accordingly, had access to excellent conditions of purchasing.\n\nAs with every industrial business, productivity is key to performance. With eight milling plants in Morocco, we improved our productivity over the past 3 years and reduced our industrial cost. We consider ourselves to be among the top performing industrial units in our industry.\n\nMayMouna and Tria are our two main brands in the Moroccan market. MayMouna is our most popular brand for Moroccan households and Tria is our most popular brand for industrial clients in Morocco.\n\nStable Product Demand\n\nOur products are basic food staples in Morocco and Africa. Accordingly, demand for our products has been stable in Morocco and fast-growing in Sub-Saharan Africa and Angola, even in periods of economic uncertainty.\n\n**Near-term and long-term Opportunities**\n\nNear-term opportunities\n\nThe Moroccan flour sector is changing. Though in the 1960s Morocco was largely self-sufficient, producing more than 80% of the wheat for domestic consumption, only 60% of the total domestic demand for wheat was met by the end the 20th century. Despite the introduction of improved wheat varieties and significant increases in yields, yield levels remain below both the global average of over 3 metric tons per Hectare (t/ha) and the African average of 2.3 t/ha. Consequently, Morocco continued to import large volumes, making wheat the most important (in both volume and value terms) of all agricultural imports. Governmental efforts to support yield growth are expected to continue, including the use of new technologies for better seed-delivery and to increase crop yield. The transformation of the sector will create immediate opportunities to grow and gain market share. As the leader on this market, we expect to benefit from this transformation. With abundant rains, wheat production in Morocco is expected to triple to 7.54 million tons, according to a recent Global Agricultural Information Network report from the US Department of Agriculture and the Company is expected to benefit from this increase.\n\n21  \n---  \n  \nLong-term opportunities\n\nWe believe that the market in which we operate is sustainable and growing. We expect future growth in our market will be led by:\n\n● | Continued demographical growth in the African continent from approximately 1.3 billion in 2020 to approximately 2.5 billion by 2050;  \n---|---  \n● | Increasing urbanization in Africa, projected to reach 1.5 billion by 2050, adding 950 million people since 2015; and  \n● | The continued growth in the consumption of our products in the region, which the Company expects to not only remain staple products, but to gain further traction with increasing urbanization.  \n  \n**Our Business Strategy**\n\nWe consider sustainable growth to be the pillar of its business management strategy, through which it consolidates its position as a benchmark business group in its areas of activity and as a sound, innovative, sustainable, responsible enterprise, committed to: (i) social well-being, diversity, environmental balance and social and economic progress; and (ii) tax responsibility, respect of human rights and prevention of corruption and other illegal conduct.\n\nThis entails developing a business model focusing on the generation of value, taking into consideration the interests of its human team, shareholders and investors, customers, suppliers, the media, the communities in which we operate and the environment.\n\nIn this regard, we look beyond the exclusive goal of achieving financial yield and includes environmental, social and ethical criteria alongside economic variables in its decision-making processes.\n\nWe thus undertake, as an essential principle in its actions, the creation of a business model that is respectful of and sustainable for the environment and society overall and, while ensuring value, profitability and competitiveness, it promotes diversity, respect for human rights, tax responsibility and the prevention of corruption, thus contributing towards the progress of society and generating trust among our stakeholders.\n\n**Our Fundamental Values**\n\nNutrition: We ensure the supply of products essential for human nutrition by contributing to the health and well-being of consumers. Our brands are symbols of quality and good nutrition.\n\nProximity: We maintain lasting relationships with consumers, our customers and suppliers, by constantly listening to them. We build relationships of trust based on mutual respect. We support the social and economic well-being of our growers, suppliers and local communities.\n\nIntegrity: We are responsible for our actions and performance. We expect similar behavior from our partners.\n\nExcellence: We aim for the best quality for our products, and process for the contribution of our teams. We are aware of our responsibility to provide high quality product and product our customers from damaging additives and chemical residues.\n\nSustainability: We always act with respect for our environment, and incorporate sustainability in all areas of our business, from operation of our facilities, to engagement with customers, suppliers and communities. Long term sustainability and environmental responsibility are fundamental to the future of our business. We are dedicated to reducing our carbon footprint by reduction of power consumption.\n\n22  \n---  \n  \n**Our Business Model**\n\nWe have established itself as a leading wheat milling player in Morocco. With the recent acquisition of SIMS, we now own eight milling plants across Morocco (six of which are dedicated to common wheat and two are dedicated to durum wheat) with total processing capacity of 3,000 tons per day and a total milling capacity of 900,000 tons per year. We also have 1 secondary processing unit, 2 logistics platforms, and 300,000 tons of grain storage facilities in Morocco. We are also the owner of PRODELA, an animal feed processing company in Morocco, which was established in 1991 to commercialize the bran created by the mills.\n\nOur products are exported to 45 countries. Our primary activities include the production and sale of a variety of wheat flours, Semolina and Pasta and Couscous in Morocco and outside Morocco. Our two main brands in Morocco are MAYMOUNA and TRIA (see Our Brands and Products).\n\n**Our Brands and Products**\n\nForafric owns two leading brands: Tria and MayMouna.\n\n_Tria_\n\n![](https://cdn.kscope.io/3dbd92ba410681c341d0b685f7cc8e9f-form20-f_002.jpg)\n\nTria brand was born more than 60 years ago from a family that had a passion for the transmission of Moroccan culinary traditions, associated with a high level of quality.\n\n23  \n---  \n  \nAs a result, Tria brand quickly established itself as a key player in the flour milling sector and in the transformation of wheat grains into pasta and couscous. The Company believes its success in Morocco was the result of strong commitments from the brand to offer products of constant quality and taste.\n\nFor several generations, Tria has strived to keep intact the fundamentals that have made its reputation, from the selection of a high quality raw materials, and seeks to reinventing its products in order to support changing consumer needs.\n\nTria continues to be a highly respected brand for packaged flour, precooked couscous and packaged pasta on the Moroccan market. Today, Tria combines modernity and tradition, which makes it one of the favorite brands of Moroccans. Tria has approximately 15% of the overall market in Morocco of couscous and approximately 28% in the market of packaged couscous. Tria also has approximately 9% of the overall market of pasta in Morocco.\n\nTria branded products include:\n\n● | TRIA DAKIK MINE NAWH MOUMTAZ for Flour, Pasta and Couscous  \n---|---  \n● | TRIA COUSCOUS DE QUALITE SUPERIEURE for Couscous  \n● | TRIA PATES DE QUALITE SUPERIEURE for Pasta  \n● | TRIA FARINE DE QUALITE SUPERIEURE for Flour  \n  \n_MayMouna_\n\n![](https://cdn.kscope.io/3dbd92ba410681c341d0b685f7cc8e9f-form20-f_003.jpg)\n\nMaymouna, whose Arabic name derives from “Youmn” which intimates values of kindness and blessing, has been a success story since its initial launch.\n\nWe believe that MayMouna is recognized as an innovative brand which strives to make life easier for the average consumer. The MayMouna brand has redefined the rules on the Moroccan market, by adopting a marketing strategy reflected in its unique packaging and establishing a color code allowing the clear identification of each of its products. The brand also integrates into its packaging culinary presentations allowing each household to easily recognize the right product capable of meeting its needs.\n\n24  \n---  \n  \nMayMouna is appreciated for its quality but also for the richness of its range. The brand has, on a regular basis, introduced new products to attract the average household, its primary consumer (e.g., under the registered trademark Finette) and meet the needs of professionals (e.g., Farine Boulangère). This has enabled MayMouna to maintain its popularity and reputation.\n\nIn 2014, MayMouna was nominated at the Morocco’s National Agricultural Fair (SIAM) for an award in the Innovation Brand category, and it was awarded the prize of best price and quality at the SIAM 2014 and 2016 editions.\n\nMayMouna offers a diversified range of products segmented into two categories: soft wheat products and durum wheat products. In order to meet market demands, the products intended for the traditional consumer market (i.e., wholesalers, groceries), are sold in polypropylene packaging for the modern retail and in kraft paper for mass distribution. The industry, on the other hand, is delivered in bulk by tanker.\n\nSoft wheat products: Soft wheat is the most widely used and cultivated variety of wheat in the world. It is used to produce flour, particularly for making bread and pastries. All our soft wheat flours are enriched with iron and vitamins. Our soft wheat products include:\n\n● | Pastry flour - Soft wheat flour comes from the heart of the grain (the wheat kernel), the extraction of which is milled to produce a flour powder. Thanks to its milling know-how, MayMouna has developed a pastry flour with a very fine texture and without lumps, with a mineralization rate not exceeding 0.38%. Our pastry flour meets the daily needs of the average household, and is suitable for fine culinary preparations of pastries, béchamel, sauces, and harira, a traditional Moroccan soup. MayMouna pastry flour is available in 1kg, 2kg, 5kg and 10kg kraft packaging.  \n---|---  \n● | Extra white - Used mainly by pastry and bakery professionals, MayMouna Extra white flour is very fluid.

BRIO is also used for export to Europe.  \n  \nDurum wheat products: As in most Mediterranean countries and the Maghreb, durum wheat is part of the traditional meal in Morocco. Naturally rich in fiber, it benefits from recognized digestive virtues. Durum wheat can be transformed into semolina for the production of pasta and couscous, but also into flour for making bread. In Morocco, the main use of durum wheat is in breadmaking and couscous. Our durum wheat products include:\n\n● | Whole meal Flour - Naturally rich in fiber, MayMouna Whole meal flour has the particularity of giving a whole hard wheat bread with recognized digestive and dietary virtues. MayMouna Whole meal Flour is available in 2kg, 5kg and 10kg kraft, 5kg, 10kg and 25kg polypropylene packaging.  \n---|---  \n● | Finot - A flagship product of the entire range, this very fine semolina is ideal for delicate preparations, for golden and well-leavened homemade bread. MayMouna Finot also makes it possible to achieve flaky and crispy _msemens_ , a traditional Moroccan type of pancake. MayMouna Finot is available in kraft 5kg and in 10kg, polypropylene 5kg, 10kg and 20kg packaging.  \n● | Fine semolina - This semolina is used mainly by industrial manufacturers of couscous and pasta.

Recognized for its baking qualities, Finette is very fluid. Finette by MayMouna is available in 5kg, 10kg and 25kg polypropylene packaging.  \n  \nThough Tria and Maymouna are our most popular and well-known brands, our products are sold under a number of other brand names, including:\n\nLES GRANDES SEMOULERIES DU MAROC : Semolina\n\nLAMSAMDA: Flour\n\nTARGA: Flour\n\nEXTRA BLANCHE: Flour\n\nHOUYAM: Flour\n\nAL FADANE: Flour\n\nEL GHALA: Flour\n\nFARINOR: Flour\n\nSANABIL: Semolina\n\nLMLIH, EL FEN: Semolina\n\nDIAMANDA : Flour\n\nSABA: Pasta and Couscous\n\nJAWDA: Flour\n\nBADIA: Flour\n\nLA BELLA, ZERDA: Pasta and Couscous\n\nSANABIL: Semolina\n\nCH’RIFA: Flour\n\nAL BACHA: Flour\n\nAYLA: Flour\n\nF’DILA: Flour\n\nCH’MICHA: Flour\n\nSOUIRA: Flour\n\nFERANE : Flour\n\nAL BAROUK : Flour\n\n26  \n---  \n  \n**Sourcing and Processing**\n\nWe are dedicated to providing our customers with high quality, nutritious and healthy products and our production process is designed to achieve these goals:\n\n_Supply:_ In addition to the choice of excellent raw materials, at harvest time, samples are tested for the quality and quantity of protein and for the presence of heavy metals, pesticide residues, and other harmful chemicals.\n\n_Reception:_ On delivery of the wheat, a representative sample undergoes a battery of analyzes ensuring compliance with the Company’s quality standards. From the pit, the wheat then undergoes a pre-cleaning to eliminate any large waste.\n\n_Cleaning_ : At this stage, the wheat undergoes a second cleaning which consists of eliminating the impurities (foreign seeds, straw, dust, etc.). The stone remover makes it possible to remove the stones by density difference.\n\nThe wheat is then wet in order to facilitate its grinding and damaged grains or those whose color does not conform are removed using a machine equipped with a camera.\n\n_Grinding_ : The wheat then goes to milling. This operation dissociates the bran and the floury part thanks to a succession of grinding and sieving. The various finished products are evaluated according to their grain size, protein level, humidity, color, etc. These analyzes are supplemented by use tests in the bakery, in particular to test the breadmaking. A series of sanitary analyzes is added to ensure the wholesomeness of each product in compliance with the required standards.\n\n_Conditioning_ : The various flours and semolina obtained are packaged in food packaging suitable for their good conservation. Each batch is strictly controlled to ensure compliance with specifications and standards in force.\n\n**Trading and Storage**\n\nThe Company has a unique storage infrastructure in Morocco. The group has 2 units dedicated to storage and more than 250,000 tons of grain storage capacity in Morocco. This organization allows it to optimize and best meet the needs of all of its mills and to effectively manage the costs of its supply chain.\n\nTwo of our trading companies, Forafric and Cerelis, aim to import and sell wheat. Cerelis is based in Morocco and dedicated to meet the needs of the group in raw materials.\n\nOur Finalog subsidiary, with a capacity of 79,000 metric tons, which is based in Casablanca, manages transport, handling and storage activities. The Finalog’s multimodal platform (Road / Rail) is devoted 100% to cereals and is linked to the port of Casablanca by rail. Finalog has a daily reception capacity of 7,000 tons and 3,000 tons per day for delivery. Though most of its revenues are generated by the Company, Finalog also rents part of its facilities to other companies.\n\n27  \n---  \n  \n**Significant Events and Transactions**\n\nDue to our strong crushing volume in 2023, we have emerged as the leading wheat milling player in Morocco through the acquisition and consolidation of well-known businesses Forafric (MayMouna) and the Tria Group. Forafric (MayMouna) was created in 1943 with focus on imports, repositioning its core activity on milling in the 2000s and recently developing its branding strategy to becoming a leading wheat flour brand in Morocco. Forafric (MayMouna) was acquired by us in April 2015. The Tria group was created in 1949 under the name Minoterie Biscuiterie d’Anfa, with focus on milling activity, and was acquired by us in January 2016.\n\nCompany | 2023 Crushing | Market Share  \n---|---|---  \nIZDA* | 703,926 | 13.49| %  \nForafric | 600,633 | 11.51| %  \nGromic | 505,655 | 9.69| %  \nZine Cereales | 394,822 | 7.57| %  \nFandy | 371,933 | 7.13| %  \nCasa Grains | 283,009 | 5.42| %  \nOthers | 2,358,431 | 45.19| %  \nTotal | 5,218,409 | 100.00| %  \n  \nSource ONICL Morocco\n\n*IZDA: not a company but a group with common purchasing interest\n\nEffective on November 5, 2020, pursuant to an investment and shareholders agreement (“Trigola Agreement”) dated November 5, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Trigola, SU, LDA (“Trigola”), an entity incorporated in the Republic of Angola and owned by the Parent for a majority share in Trigola’s equity of 75%. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we would provide financial investments in Trigola for the construction, commissioning and operation of a new industrial facility for the processing of wheat and the production of wheat flour, management services and other services on an exclusive basis in relation to Trigola’s business. We agreed to fund Trigola for operational cash flow needs and bear the risk of Trigola’s losses from operations and Trigola agreed that we would be entitled to 75% of Trigola’s net profits, if any.\n\nEffective on April 30, 2021, we completed a share purchase acquisition of Moulins du Sahel Mali S.A. (“MDS Mali”). By way of the acquisition, we acquired a 70.35% stake in a wheat milling business in Mali. The investment in MDS Mali enables us to obtain a strategic footprint in west Africa. Details of the acquisition are included in the footnotes to the financial statements.\n\nEffective on July 30, 2021, we completed a share purchase acquisition of Moulin du Sahel Burkina (“MDS Burkina”). By way of the acquisition, the Company acquired a 78.21% stake in a wheat milling business in Burkina. Details of the acquisition are included in the footnotes to the financial statements.\n\nOn July 30, 2021, we acquired 37.10% of the capital stock of GMT Niger headquartered in Niger, which is a non-operational wheat milling facility. We have accounted for this investment as an equity method investment.\n\nIn October 2021, we acquired a majority stake in Moulin Sanabil based in Meknes Morocco. The strategy of the group in Morocco is to expand its capacity to reach 20% of market share and to expand geographically to reach all important customers in Morocco. Meknes is based in the center region of Morocco where we did not have mills. This opportunity enables the group to enter into this region with a huge capacity to expand. This region is also the main producer of wheat in Morocco so thanks to this new acquisition, the whole group will benefit from good conditions on the acquisition of local wheat produced in this region. In October 2023, we increased our stake in Sanibil to 80% of the shares after a capital increase.\n\nIn July 2023, we acquired a majority stake in Société Industrielle des Moulins du Sud based in Marrakech. This acquisition enabled the group to expand its market share in Morocco to reach the target of 20%. With this acquisition, the group is leader in the Marrakech Region.\n\nIn 2023, the price of raw materials decreased significantly but has remained higher than the normative level of the years 2018-2021.\n\n28  \n---  \n  \n**Key Factors Affecting Operating Results**\n\n**Government Regulation**\n\nWe are subject to a variety of laws in each of the countries in which we operate which govern various aspects of our business, including the processing, handling, storage, transport and sale of our products; risk management activities; land-use and ownership of land, including laws regulating the acquisition or leasing of rural properties by certain entities and individuals; and environmental, health and safety matters. To operate our facilities, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, licenses and approvals from governmental agencies and our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental agencies. In addition, we are subject to other laws and government policies affecting the food and agriculture industries, including food and feed safety, nutritional and labeling requirements and food security policies. In particular, the National Office for Food Safety in Morocco ONSSA requires various certifications for the export of products to Morocco. ONSSA certifications have been obtained for the following subsidiaries of the Company: Forafric SA; Finalog; Maymouna GrainLes Grands Moulins de Tensift; Les Grandes Semouleries de Casablanca; Les Grandes Semouleries de Safi; Tria Group; and Arzak.\n\nFrom time to time, agricultural production shortfalls in certain regions and growing demand for agricultural commodities for feed, food and fuel use have caused prices for relevant agricultural commodities to rise. High commodity prices and regional crop shortfalls have led, and in the future may lead, governments to impose price controls, tariffs, export restrictions and other measures designed to assure adequate domestic supplies and/or mitigate price increases in their domestic markets, as well as increase the scrutiny of competitive conditions in their markets.\n\n**Environmental Matters**\n\nWe are subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Our operations may emit or release certain substances, which may be regulated or limited by applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we handle and dispose of materials and wastes classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies. Our operations are also subject to laws relating to environmental licensing of facilities, restrictions on land use in certain protected areas and water use. We incur costs to comply with health, safety and environmental regulations applicable to our activities and have made and expect to make substantial capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to continue to ensure our compliance with environmental laws and regulations. However, due to our extensive operations across multiple industries and jurisdictions globally, we are exposed to the risk of claims and liabilities under environmental regulations. Violation of these laws and regulations can result in substantial fines, administrative sanctions, criminal penalties, revocations of operating permits and/or shutdowns of our facilities.\n\nAdditionally, our business could be affected in the future by regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas emissions, or policies related to national emission reduction plans. It is difficult to assess the potential impact of any resulting regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and we may be required to make additional investments to modify our facilities, equipment and processes. Climate change could also lead to stronger production variability than today which could result in price volatility. Climate change could cause temperature increases and rainfall changes that could lead to lower yields in Morocco and other semi-arid Mediterranean countries in the future. In response to such concerns, the effects of additional climate change regulatory initiatives could have adverse impacts on our business and results of operations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations did not materially affect our earnings or competitive position in 2023.\n\n**Competition**\n\nThe markets for our products are highly price competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors, including delivered price, product offering and quality, location, raw material procurement, production efficiency, brand recognition, nutritional profile, dietary trends, logistics and distribution capabilities, and customer service, including, in some cases, customer financing terms. The Company faces competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors. Competition is based on a variety of factors, including price, raw material procurement, brand recognition, nutritional profile, dietary trends and distribution capabilities. Our major competitors in Morocco include: Moulins du Maghreb, Zine Cereales, Rica Maroc, Casagrains and Dari Couspate. These competitors would be at an advantage if they are able to obtain superior financing capabilities. In addition, other regional or international Agribusinesses may expand into our marketplaces increasing competition.\n\n29  \n---  \n  \nTo compete effectively, we must continuously focus on improving efficiency in our production and distribution operations, as well as developing and maintaining appropriate market share and customer relationships, and brand reputations for quality.\n\n**Legal Proceedings**\n\nFrom time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to various legal proceedings. There are currently three separate actions pending against the Company for unfair dismissal by former employees; however, none of such proceedings, individually, or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Company or its operations if decided adversely against the Company.\n\n**Insurance**\n\nIn each country where the Company conducts business, our operations and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. We insure our businesses and assets in each country in a manner that it deems appropriate for a company of our size and activities, based on an analysis of the relative risks and costs. If we were to incur a significant loss or liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company believes that it maintains adequate policies of insurance to insure its operations against such risks as can be reasonably anticipated in the markets in which it operates.\n\n**Seasonality**\n\nThere is a degree of seasonality in the growing season and procurement of our principal raw materials. Further, in the Moroccan market where the bulk of our business originates and where we operate four flour mills, soft wheat cannot be freely imported during the calendar year. All our soft wheat must be imported before end of April and from beginning of September or October depending on the harvests of local wheat in Morocco. This is designed to protect local Moroccan producers of wheat by enabling them to sell their production on the local market. Accordingly, the third fiscal quarters of the year have generally been our weakest in terms of financial results.\n\n**Intellectual Property**\n\nOur material intellectual property consists of approximately 25 trademarks and logos relating to our two main brands, Maymouna and Tria, and our other brands and products. These intellectual property rights are registered in Morocco. Under Moroccan law, such registrations are valid for 10 years from the date of filing the application, and are renewable for additional periods of 10 years. There is also a grace period for late renewals and a registration is not canceled unless it is not renewed within six months of the end of the registration period.\n\nC. Organizational Structure\n\nSee “Item 4. Information on the Company – A. History and Development of the Company.”\n\nD. Property, plant and equipment\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company owns and leases 12 refining, packing and milling facilities throughout the world with an aggregate production capacity of 3,750 metric tons per day, including eight milling plants in Morocco with an aggregate capacity of 3,000 metric tons per day. We also have two storage facilities in Morocco with an aggregate storage capacity of 250,000 metric tons.\n\nOur corporate headquarters in Gibraltar, occupies approximately 1,200 square feet of space under a lease that expires in June 2025. We also own or lease other office space for our operations worldwide.\n\nWe believe our current facilities are sufficient to meet our needs.\n\n30  \n---  \n  \n**Item 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS**\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS**\n\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their related notes included in this annual report.\n\nThis annual report includes consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. However, as permitted by Instruction 6 to Item 5 of Form 20-F, a discussion of the changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 has been omitted from this annual report, but may be found in “Management’s Discussion And Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of FAHL” in our registration statement on Form S-4 filed with the SEC on May 6, 2022.\n\nThis annual report contains forward-looking statements that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\n\nYou can identify these forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “aim,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “potential,” “continue,” “is/are likely to” or other similar expressions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements relating to:\n\n● | our goals and strategies;  \n---|---  \n● | our future business development, financial conditions and results of operations;  \n● | our expectations regarding demand for and market acceptance of our products once available;  \n---|---  \n● | our expectations regarding our development and commercialization of our therapeutics;  \n---|---  \n● | competition in our industry; and  \n---|---  \n● | relevant government policies and regulations relating to our industry.  \n---|---  \n  \nYou should thoroughly read this annual report and the documents that we refer to in this annual report with the understanding that our actual results in the future may be materially different from or worse than what we expect. We qualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. Other sections of this annual report include additional factors which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Important risks and factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from our expectations are generally set forth in “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this annual report. We caution you that our businesses and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe forward-looking statements made in this annual report relate only to events or information as of the date on which these statements are made in this annual report. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this annual report.

The following discussion and analysis summarize the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of the Company as of and for the periods presented below._\n\n31  \n---  \n  \n**Overview**\n\n**Key Factors Affecting Our Performance**\n\nThe key factors affecting the performance of our business are described below:\n\n_Cost of Raw material_. The cost of wheat is almost 90% of total cost in our business. Fluctuation on the price of the wheat has a direct impact on our performance. The cost of wheat depends on weather, supply and demand and strategies of main international producers. The cost of raw material depends also on freight cost and currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n_Industrial cost_. The crushing cost is the second main factor affecting our performance. This cost includes equipment, labor and interest over financing. To perform on our business, we have to maintain this cost below 30 USD per ton produced. To achieve this performance, we have to monitor energy, equipment usage, logistics, human resources and financial cost.\n\n_Average selling price_. The average selling price is based on the two components:\n\n● | Price of flour/Semolina  \n---|---  \n● | Price of Bran  \n  \nBran is between 20% to 25% of the production of finished products. We have no impact on the price of the bran.\n\nOn the price of finished product, we can have a limited impact due to high concurrency on the market.\n\n**The War in Ukraine**\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched an invasion in Ukraine. The invasion may severely disrupt or depress wheat harvests in Ukraine and Ukraine’s ability to export wheat. In addition, as a consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and other countries have imposed sanctions against and penalties for doing business in Russia and with certain Russian-owned businesses. These sanctions may limit Russia’s ability to export wheat. Because Ukraine accounts for approximately 10% of the world’s wheat exports and Russa accounts for approximately 16% of the world’s wheat exports, the continuation of the war between Ukraine and Russia could lead to a material reduction in the availability of wheat on the international market which could in turn affect our ability to obtain raw materials or result in substantial increases in prices of raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business.\n\nThe Company has not purchased, and has no contracts to purchase raw materials from either Ukraine or Russia in 2023. The Company has also in recent years diversified its sources of supply, and purchases most of its raw materials from European countries, as well as Argentina and Brazil. The Company believes that as a result, it will have adequate sources of supply of raw materials for the 2024 calendar year.\n\nBecause the Company does not currently have any business operations in Russia and is not purchasing raw materials from suppliers in Russia in 2023, the sanctions regime imposed upon Russia does not currently directly impact the Company’s business.\n\n**Key Components of Results of Operations**\n\nNet sales, cost of sales and gross profit figures are calculated with the following method:\n\nNet sales: Total consolidated sales;\n\n32  \n---  \n  \nCost of sales: includes cost of raw materials, cost of freight, depreciation expense, cost of foreign exchange and cost of improvements used in the production; and\n\nGross profit: the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold.\n\nThe key components of our results of operation are:\n\nPrice of raw materials, which is affected by many factors, including global and regional supply, which in turn is impacted by factors such as weather conditions, local planting decisions, crop failure, reduced harvests, governmental policies (including both tariffs and subsidies), and other agricultural conditions, as well as local, regional, and international demand. The price of raw materials decreased during the first three months of 2023 over the same period for 2022.\n\nCost of freight, which is impacted by shipping availability, international demand, labor shortages, strikes, regional conflicts, inadequate or obsolete port infrastructure and other factors.\n\nForeign exchange rates, which are continually fluctuating due to the relative economic strengths or governmental policies of different countries.\n\nHuman resources productivity, which may be impacted by the training and skills of the available workforce, the nature of tools and facilities in place, financial incentives and other factors over which we do not have any control.\n\nPower consumption and costs, which may be affected by governmental policies, including green energy initiatives and the age and efficiency of existing and newly acquired facilities.\n\nOur Results of Operations depends primarily on the cost of raw materials and on our industrial cost.\n\nIn our business, most raw materials are imported from Europe, South America, Black Sea and Canada (for durum). In Morocco, there is production of wheat but the quality is generally not high enough for industrial usage. The variation of the cost of raw materials has a huge impact on our business and can explain the changes in the result of operation form period to period.\n\nIndustrial cost is the second main component of our result of operation. The industrial cost includes human resources, cost of equipment, maintenance, power consumption and financial cost as main components. We launched a huge restructuring plan in 2018 to reduce our industrial cost with success. We successfully reduced the industrial cost by 50% over the last four years.\n\n**_Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022_**\n\nOperating Results\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,  \n---  \nIn thousands of USD | 2023 | 2022 | $ Change  \nRevenues | $| 305,476 | $| 289,772 | $| 15,704  \nCost of sales | 274,878 | 260,399 | 14,479  \nGross profit | 30,598 | 29,373 | 1,225  \nOperating expenses:  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses | 29,465 | 30,795 | (1,330| )  \nTotal operating expenses | 29,465 | 30,795 | (1,330| )  \nOperating income (loss)  | 1,133 | (1,422| ) | 2,555  \nOther expense (income):  \nInterest income | (37| ) | (34| ) | (3| )  \nInterest expense | 14,016 | 12,513 | 1,503  \nChange in fair value of derivatives and contingent consideration | (25| ) | (4,733| ) | 4,708  \nForeign exchange (gain) loss | (207| ) | 10,369 | (10,576| )  \nOther non-operating expenses | - | 1,691 | (1,691| )  \nTotal other expense | 13,747 | 19,806 | (6,059| )  \nLoss before income taxes | (12,614| ) | (21,228| ) | 8,614  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense | (106| ) | (2,058| ) | 1,952  \nNet loss | $| (12,508| ) | $| (19,170| ) | $| (6,662| )  \n  \n33  \n---  \n  \n_Revenues_\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net revenues totaled $305.5 million, increasing $15.7 million or 5.4% year over year. The increase in revenues when compared year over year is a direct result of an increase in sales volume.\n\n_Cost of Sales_\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, cost of sales totaled $274.9 million, increasing $14.5 million or 5.6% year over year. The increase in cost of sales when compared year over year is a direct result of the increase in crushed volume and higher cost of freight on raw material.\n\nAs a result, gross profits increased by $1.2 million or 4.2% when compared year over year.\n\n_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $29.5 million, decreasing $1.3 million or 4.3% year over year. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to expenses activity with decrease of compensation cost and lease cost.\n\n_Other Expense (Income)_\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, other expense (income) totaled $13.7 million, decreasing $6.0 million or 30.6% year over year. The decrease in other expense is primarily attributable to decrease in foreign exchange (gain) loss.\n\n_Segments_\n\nThe following table presents revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,  \n---  \nIn thousands of USD | 2023 | 2022 | $ Change  \nSales to external customers:  \nSoft wheat | $| 218,761 | $| 213,775 | $| 4,986  \nDurum wheat | 51,755 | 44,447 | 7,308  \nCouscous and pasta | 31,410 | 27,159 | 4,251  \nAll other | 3,550 | 4,391 | (841| )  \nTotal | $| 305,476 | $| 289,772 | $| 15,704  \nDirect operating income (loss):  \nSoft wheat | $| 2,288 | $| 8,957 | $| (6,669| )  \nDurum wheat | 327 | (4,508| ) | 4,835  \nCouscous and pasta | 1,666 | (1,924| ) | 3,590  \nAll other | (3,148| ) | (3,947| ) | 799  \nOperating income (loss)  | $| 1,133 | $| (1,422| ) | $| 2,555  \n  \n34  \n---  \n  \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net revenues of soft wheat totaled $218.8 million, increasing 2.3% from $213.8 million during the comparable period in 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volume of sales coupled with capacity extension in two Moroccan regions and the acquisition of SIMS during 2023.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net sales of durum wheat totaled $51.8 million, increasing 16.4% from $44.4 million during the comparable period in 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in volume during fiscal 2023.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net sales of couscous and pasta totaled $31.4 million, increasing 15.7% from $27.2 million during the comparable period in 2022.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\n_Working Capital and Working Capital Facilities_ – Working capital deficits were $132.0 million and $94.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nThe Company had available to it revolving working capital credit lines in the amount of $50.0 million and $48.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had borrowed $48.5 million and had unused availability of $1.5 million under such credit lines. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had borrowed $47.4 million and had unused availability of $0.6 million under such credit lines. The Company has also entered into credit agreements for asset-based credit facilities in order to fund wheat raw material purchases (“Wheat Credit Facilities”). The Wheat Credit Facilities provide the ability to borrow funds under consolidated lines of credit of up to approximately $142.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and $148.0 million as of December 31, 2022. The Wheat Credit Facilities are secured by inventory. The Wheat Credit Facilities must be renewed on a semi-annual basis. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had borrowed $126.5 million under the Wheat Credit Facilities, with unused availability of approximately $15.5 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had borrowed $137.0 million under the Wheat Credit Facilities, with unused availability of approximately $11.0 million.\n\nPursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, the Company’s Related Party Loans converted into Ordinary Shares upon consummation of the Business Combination. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has, in addition to its obligations under the working capital credit lines and the Wheat Credit Facilities, $4.5 million in lease obligations. The Company believes it has sufficient capital available to it to fulfill such obligations.\n\n_Cash and Cash Equivalents_ - Cash and cash equivalents were $24.0 million and $24.8 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy, the objectives of which are to preserve the principal value of our cash assets, maintain a high degree of liquidity and deliver competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions.\n\n_Trade accounts receivable, net_ - Trade accounts receivable, net were $34.7 million and $30.9 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\n_Inventories_ - Inventories were $28.4 million and $27.2 million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\n35  \n---  \n  \n_Liquidity and Capital Resources Relating to the Closing of the Business Combination_ – Prior to the closing of the Business Combination, holders of 9,612,536 shares of Globis’ common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for cash at a price of approximately $10.30 per share for aggregate payments of approximately $99 million. As a result, upon closing of the Business Combination, approximately $19.4 million in gross proceeds was released from the Trust Account. Approximately $16.2 million was deposited into an escrow account for the benefit of the Forward Purchase Investors (as defined below) and approximately $3.2 million was released to the Company. In addition, substantially concurrently with the Closing, the sale of the PIPE Shares was consummated, pursuant to which the PIPE Investor purchased an aggregate of 1,320,195 Ordinary Shares of the Company for total gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $13.9 million.\n\nAs a result of the Business Combination, the Seller received (i) 17,004,762 Ordinary Shares on the Closing Date, (ii) 1,550,000 Ordinary shares pursuant to a subscription agreement dated September 9, 2022 and (iii) will be paid the principal sum of $8,000,000 together with interest on the outstanding amount from the Closing Date up to the date of payment (computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve (12) months of thirty (30) days) accrued but unpaid thereon at the fixed per annum rate of 8%.\n\nIn addition, on September 9, 2022, the Company entered into a Warrant Agreement (the “Warrant Agreement”) with the Seller, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue 516,666 warrants to the Seller, each of which entitles the holder to purchase one ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.001, at an exercise price of $11.50 per share in cash for a period of 5 years.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing consideration, the Seller is entitled to receive, as additional consideration, and without any action on behalf of the Company or the Company’s shareholders, additional Ordinary Shares (the “Earnout Shares”), to be issued as follows during the period from and after the Closing until the end of calendar year 2024 (A) 500,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2022, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) of the Company is equal to or greater than $27 million, (B) 500,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA of the Company is equal to or greater than $33 million, and (C) 1,000,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2024, the Buyer Trading Price (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) during the standard market trading hours of a trading day is greater than or equal to $16.50 for any 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days.\n\n_Warrant Proceeds_ - The Company has 15,750,842 outstanding Warrants to purchase 15,750,842 Ordinary Shares, exercisable at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, which expire on June 9, 2027, at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time.\n\nThe exercise of the Warrants, and any proceeds the Company may receive from their exercise, are highly dependent on the price of our Ordinary Share and the spread between the exercise price of the Warrant and the price of Ordinary Share at the time of exercise. For example, to the extent that the trading price of the Ordinary Shares exceeds $11.50 per share, it is more likely that holders of our Warrants will exercise their Warrants. If the trading price of the Ordinary Shares is less than $11.50 per share, it is unlikely that such holders will exercise their Warrants. As of December 29, 2023, the closing price of the Ordinary Shares was $10.59 per share. There can be no assurance that all of our Warrants will be in the money prior to their expiration and, as such, any or all of our Warrants may expire worthless. As such, it is possible that the Company may never generate any cash proceeds from the exercise of our Warrants. The Company will continue to evaluate the probability of warrant exercise over the life of our Warrants and the merit of including potential cash proceeds from the exercise thereof in our liquidity projections.\n\nTo the extent such Warrants are exercised, additional Ordinary Shares will be issued, which will result in dilution to the holders of our Ordinary Shares and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the Ordinary Shares.\n\n_Forward Share Purchase Agreements_ - On June 8, 2022, Globis and certain unaffiliated investors (the “Forward Purchase Investors”) entered into Forward Share Purchase Agreements (the “Forward Purchase Agreements”) pursuant to which, on the three month anniversary of the date of the Closing (“Investor Shares Closing Date”), the Forward Purchase Investors may elect to sell and transfer to the Company, and the Company will purchase, in the aggregate up to 1,500,000 Ordinary Shares (the “Forward Investor Shares”), consisting of (i) Ordinary Shares then held by the Forward Purchase Investors and/or (ii) any additional Ordinary Shares that the Forward Purchase Investors may acquire prior to the closing of the Business Combination. The Company will acquire the Forward Investor Shares at a price of $10.80 per share (the “Forward Shares Purchase Price”). Upon the closing of the Business Combination, $16.2 million was deposited into an escrow account for the benefit of the investors for payment of the Forward Shares Purchase Price for all Forward Investor Shares.\n\n36  \n---  \n  \nOn September 9, 2022, the Company entered into three Buy Back Contracts with the Forward Purchase Investors: (i) a Buy Back Contract by and among the Company, Nomis Bay Ltd and BPY Limited, pursuant to which the Company bought back up to 500,000 ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share; (ii) a Buy Back Contract by and between the Company and K2 Principal Fund L.P., pursuant to which the Company bought back 448,651 ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share; and (iii) a Buy Back Contract by and between the Company and Polar Multi-Strategy Master Fund, pursuant to which the Company bought back 231,071 ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share (together “Buy Back Contracts”). As a result of the Buy Back Contracts, 1,179,722 ordinary shares were bought by the company and cancelled in full satisfaction of the Forward Purchase Agreements.\n\nThe Company has historically met its cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities (when available), term loans, convertible bonds, working capital and inventory lines of credit and sales of equity.\n\nThe Company believes that cash on hand, as well as cash from operations and proceeds from extended credit lines will provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. This projection is based on the Company’s current expectations regarding product sales, cost structure, cash burn rate and other operating assumptions.\n\n**_Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021_**\n\nOperating Results\n\nFor the Years Ended December 31,  \n---  \nIn thousands of USD | 2022 | 2021 | $ Change  \nRevenues | $| 289,772 | $| 261,679 | $| 28,093  \nCost of sales | 260,399 | 219,311 | 41,088  \nGross profit | 29,373 | 42,368 | (12,955| )  \nOperating expenses:  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses | 30,795 | 38,982 | (8,187| )  \nTotal operating expenses | 30,795 | 38,982 | (8,187| )  \nOperating (loss) income | (1,422| ) | 3,386 | (4,808| )  \nOther expense (income):  \nInterest income | (34| ) | (543| ) | 509  \nInterest expense | 12,513 | 10,362 | 2,151  \nChange in fair value of derivative and contingent consideration | (4,733| ) | - | (4,733| )  \nForeign Exchange loss | 10,369 | 1,440 | 8,929  \nOther non-operative expenses | 1,691 | - | 1,691  \nTotal other expense | 19,806 | 11,259 | 8,547  \nLoss before income taxes | (21,228| ) | (7,873| ) | (13,355| )  \nIncome tax (benefit) expense | (2,058| ) | (89| ) | (1,969| )  \nNet loss | $| (19,170| ) | $| (7,784| ) | $| (11,386| )  \n  \n_Revenues_\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, net revenues totaled $289.8 million, increasing $28.1 million from $261.7 million during in the same period in 2021.\n\n37  \n---  \n  \n_Cost of Sales_\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, cost of sales totaled $260.4 million, increasing $41.1 million from $219.3 million during the same period in 2021, reflecting increases in raw material and shipping costs.\n\nGross profits for the year ended December 31, 2022, totaled $29.4 million, decreasing $13.0 million from $42.4 million during the same period in 2021.\n\n_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022, totaled $30.8 million, as compared to $39.0 million for the same period in 2021.

The Wheat Credit Facilities provide the ability to borrow funds under consolidated lines of credit of up to approximately $148.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and $100.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The Wheat Credit Facilities are secured by the Company’s inventory. The Wheat Credit Facilities must be renewed on a semi-annual basis.

Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Intellectual Property.”\n\nTrend Information\n\nOther than as disclosed below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 20-F, we are not aware of any trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments, or events for the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our net revenue, income, profitability, liquidity, or capital resources, or that caused the disclosed financial information to be not necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial condition.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nAs disclosed in Note 2, the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements were applied on a basis consistent with those reflected in our consolidated financial statements that are included in this annual report. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\n\nRevenue Recognition – the Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company’s contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less. The Company applies the practical expedient in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) paragraph 606-10-50-14 of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. Trade discounts or volume rebates are recognized as a deduction in revenue. No payment terms beyond one year are granted at contract inception.\n\n39  \n---  \n  \nRevenue related to the sale of goods and equipment is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer. the Company recognizes revenue from these contracts at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer, generally when legal title and risks and rewards transfer to the customer. Sales terms typically provide for transfer of title at the time and point of delivery and acceptance of the product being sold.\n\nAmounts received from customers prior to revenue recognition on a contract are recorded as contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nShipping and Handling Costs – Shipping and handling costs related to contracts with customers for the sale of goods are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and are included in cost of sales. Accordingly, amounts billed to customers for such costs are included as a component of revenues.\n\nTaxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities – the Company does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers, in the measurement of transactions prices or as a component of revenues and cost of sales.\n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Credit Losses – We provide credit terms to customers in-line with industry standards, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical experience recorded. We analyze the aging of customer accounts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Customer balances are written off after all collection efforts are exhausted. Estimated product returns, which have not been material, are deducted from sales at the time of shipment.\n\nOther Receivables – Other receivables include government subsidies for the production and sale of flour. The Moroccan government provides a fixed subsidy based on production and customer. Subsidies are paid by the Moroccan government twice a year based on sales of flour for the previous six months. The Company records the flour subsidies as a credit against the related costs that the subsidies were intended to offset in the same periods that the costs were incurred within the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nIncome Taxes – The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable in Morocco and local jurisdictions, and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period. We account for uncertain tax positions using a “more-likely-than-not” threshold. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position, or the statute of limitations concerning such issues lapses.\n\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions - The Company’s reporting currency is the US dollar (“USD”). The functional currency of the Company’s operating subsidiaries is generally the same as the corresponding local currency. Assets and liabilities of the operating subsidiaries are translated at the spot rate in effect at the applicable reporting date. Revenues and expenses of the operating subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is reflected as a separate component of Stockholders’ equity. The functional currency is translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts using currency exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted-average exchange rate during the fiscal year. The transactions in foreign currency (that is a different currency than the functional currency of the entity) are converted at the exchange rate prevailing to the date of the transaction. The assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are evaluated in the current period on the date of the closing or at the opening rate, when applicable. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of equity in “Accumulated other comprehensive income”. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and intercompany debt that is not of a long-term investment nature are included in (Gain) loss on foreign currency exchange in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\n40  \n---  \n  \nForeign currency forward contracts –The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of its business, which the Company at times manages through the use of foreign currency forward contracts. The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts and accounts for these instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The Company’s foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815; accordingly, changes in the fair value are recorded in current period earnings.\n\nShare-Based Compensation - Share-based awards principally comprise of stock options and cash-settled stock options, referred to as “phantom options”. Share-based awards are generally issued to certain senior management personnel. Share-based compensation cost (other than phantom options) is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. Our phantom options are accounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period with compensation expense being recognized over the requisite service period.\n\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of its stock options and phantom options, respectively, as well as the fair value at each reporting period for liability classified awards. This model requires the Company to estimate the expected volatility and the expected term of the stock options, which are highly complex and subjective variables. The Company uses an expected volatility of its stock price during the expected life of the options that is based on the historical performance of the Company’s stock price as well as including an estimate using similar companies. The expected term is computed using the simplified method as the Company’s best estimate given its lack of actual exercise history. The Company has selected a risk-free rate based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity equivalent to the expected exercise term of the stock option. The inputs to the valuation of phantom options are observable in the market, and as such are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company accounts for forfeitures of share-based awards as the occur.\n\nInventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. the Company’s inventory is valued using the weighted average cost method. The costs of finished goods inventories include raw materials, labor, and overhead costs.\n\nBusiness Combinations and Asset Acquisitions – The Company accounts for acquisitions that qualify as business combinations by applying the acquisition method according to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Transaction costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred and excluded from the fair value of consideration transferred. The identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity are recognized and measured at their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity, net of the fair value of any previously held interest in the acquired entity, is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions.\n\nThe Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If so, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If not, further determination is required as to whether the Company has acquired inputs and processes that can create outputs that would meet the definition of a business. When applying the screen test, significant judgment is required to determine whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets. Accounting for asset acquisitions falls under the guidance of Topic 805, Business Combinations, specifically Subtopic 805-50. A cost accumulation model is used to determine an asset acquisition’s cost. Assets acquired are based on their cost, generally allocated to them on a relative fair value basis. Direct acquisition-related costs are included in the cost of the acquired assets.\n\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment - Property, plant, and equipment are stated at acquisition cost, plus capitalized interest on borrowings during the actual construction period of major capital projects. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\n**Assets** | **Useful Lives**  \n---|---  \nBuildings | 39 years  \nMachinery and equipment (technical installations) | 30-50 years  \nOther assets | 5-30 years  \n  \nBuilding improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets or the remaining useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful life or remaining lease term. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance, which do not improve or extend the life of the assets, are expensed as incurred.\n\n41  \n---  \n  \nWe perform impairment tests when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment include deteriorations in operating cash flows, the anticipated sale or disposal of an asset group, and other significant changes in business conditions. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company’s assessment of recoverability of property, plant and equipment is performed on a reporting unit level. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of such asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of such asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n**Assets** | **Useful Lives**  \n---|---  \nTrademarks | Indefinite  \nCustomer relationships | 20 years  \nPatents and licenses | 5-10 years  \nComputer software | 5-10 years  \nOther intangible assets | 3-10 years  \n  \nRecognized intangible assets, exclusive of goodwill, are amortized over the useful lives of the assets unless that life is determined to be indefinite. All of our intangible assets, exclusive of goodwill, are finite lived. All amortization expense related to intangible assets is recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual impairment evaluation is conducted during our fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nIn accordance with the accounting standards, an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test, and if impaired, the associated assets must be written down to fair value.\n\nThe quantitative impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company’s operations, for the amount in which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. We determine fair values for each reporting unit using the market approach, when available and appropriate, the income approach, or a combination of both. The income approach involves forecasting projected financial information (such as revenue growth rates, profit margins, tax rates, and capital expenditures) and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market data. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.\n\n42  \n---  \n  \n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nOther than as described below, no new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. All public entities will be required to report segment information in accordance with the new guidance starting in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company is determining the impact of the ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by requiring; (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. For public business entities, the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is determining the impact of the ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Item 6. DIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES**\n\nA.

Under the rules of the Nasdaq, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company’s board of directors. In addition, the rules of the Nasdaq require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company’s audit, compensation and nominating committees be independent. Audit committee members must also satisfy the additional independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and the rules of the Nasdaq. Compensation committee members must also satisfy the additional independence criteria set forth in Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act and the rules of the Nasdaq.\n\n45  \n---  \n  \nIn order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and under the rules of the Nasdaq, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the committee, the board of directors, or any other board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries.\n\nTo be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act and under the rules of Nasdaq, the board of directors must affirmatively determine that the member of the compensation committee is independent, including a consideration of all factors specifically relevant to determining whether the director has a relationship to the company which is material to that director’s ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including, but not limited to: (i) the source of compensation of such director, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by the company to such director; and (ii) whether such director is affiliated with the company, a subsidiary of the company or an affiliate of a subsidiary of the company.\n\nThe Board has undertaken a review of the independence of each director and considered whether each director of the Company has a material relationship with the Company that could compromise his or her ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. As a result of this review, the Company believes that Franco Cassar, Ira Greenstein, and Rachel Bitan are “independent directors” as defined under the listing requirements and rules of the Nasdaq and the applicable rules of the Exchange Act.\n\n**_Controlled Company Exception_**\n\nWe meet the definition of a “controlled company” under the Nasdaq listing standards, and thus we are qualified for the “controlled company” exemption to the board of directors and committee composition requirements under the Nasdaq listing standards. If we were to rely on this exemption, we would be exempt from the requirements that (1) our board of directors be comprised of a majority of independent directors, (2) we have a nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors, and (3) our compensation committee be comprised solely of independent directors. The “controlled company” exception does not modify the independence requirements for the audit committee, and we intend to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Nasdaq listing standards.\n\nWe have taken all actions necessary to comply with the Nasdaq listing standards without reliance on the “controlled company” exemption, including appointing a majority of independent directors to the board and establishing certain committees composed entirely of independent directors within the time frames set forth under the Nasdaq listing standards. However, as long as the Company remains, a “controlled company,” these requirements will not apply to the Company and the Company may, in the future, seek to utilize some or all of these exemptions.\n\nB. Compensation of Executive Directors and Executive Officers\n\nThis section discusses the material components of the executive compensation program offered to the executive officers of FAHL who were “named executive officers” for 2023 and who serve as executive officers of the Company.

Actual compensation programs that the Company adopts in the future could vary significantly from our historical practices and currently planned programs summarized in this discussion.\n\n**2023 Summary Compensation Table**\n\nThe following table presents information regarding the compensation earned or received by our NEOs for services rendered during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nName and Principal Position | Year | Salary ($) | Bonus ($) | **All Other Compensation ($)(1)** | Total ($)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSaad Bendidi, | 2023 | 182,201 | 21,872 | 204,073  \nChairman | —  \nMustapha Jamaleddine, | 2023 | 392,000 | 97,254 | 489,254  \nChief Executive Officer | —  \nJulien Benitah, | 2023 | 249,166 | 0 | 14,076 | 263,242  \nChief Financial Officer  \n(1) | Other compensation includes employer contributions and social security paid by FAHL, a car allowance, and the value of other perquisites.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table**\n\n**_Base Salaries_**\n\nEach of the NEOs is paid a base salary commensurate with the executive’s skill set, experience, role and responsibilities. For Fiscal Year 2023, the annual base salaries Messers Bendidi, Jaamleddine and Benitah were $182,201, $392,000 and $249,166, respectively.\n\n**_Annual Cash Bonuses_**\n\nBased on the performance of the Company, no bonuses have been awarded in 2023.\n\n47  \n---  \n  \n**Outstanding Equity Awards at 2023 Fiscal Year-End**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the following awards have been granted under the Equity Incentive Plan:\n\nMustapha Jamal Eddine: 36,975 phantom options\n\nJulien Benitah: 27,731 share options\n\nOury Marciano: 18,487 share options\n\nJohann Elbaz: 18,487 share options\n\nMustapha Ghazzali: 9,244 phantom options\n\nMustapha Abaid: 3,697 phantom options\n\nFahd Sahli: 3,697 phantom options\n\n**Employee Benefit and Equity Compensation Plans and Arrangements**\n\nThe Forafric 2022 Long Term Employee Share Incentive Plan (the “Equity Incentive Plan”) was adopted on June 9, 2022. The Equity Incentive Plan allows for the grant of awards, consisting of nominal cost options or phantom options to employees, directors and consultants of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\n\nOur Board is responsible for the administration of the Equity Incentive Plan and may, from time to time, make or amend regulations for the administration of the Equity Incentive Plan. The decision of our Board on all matters relating to the administration of the Equity Incentive Plan, including the resolution of any ambiguity of the rules in the Equity Incentive Plan, is final and binding. Our Board may also terminate or, from time to time, suspend the grant of awards. Our Board may also make, subject to certain restrictions, amendments to the rules of the Equity Incentive Plan or any subplans.\n\nGenerally, an award is granted by the execution by the Company of an award certificate, which provides information regarding the award’s date of grant, the number of Ordinary Shares in respect of which an option is granted pursuant to the award, vesting schedule, and exercisability. The exercise price for nominal cost options is 50% of the nominal value of the shares, and in the case of phantom options is the market value of the shares less 50% of their nominal value.\n\nWith the exception of an individual’s death or in the event of a corporate transaction, awards are not capable of being transferred, charged or otherwise alienated. Any time an award holder purports to make one of these transfers, the award shall lapse immediately.\n\nThe maximum number of Shares which may be the subject of awards under the Equity Incentive Plan may not exceed 2,645,684 Ordinary Shares. Subject to certain provisions of the Equity Incentive Plan, no award can be exercised after the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. With the exception of certain special circumstances, an award can only be exercised while the award holder is employed or engaged by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Subject to certain provisions, a vested award may be exercised in whole or in part at any time after its date of grant.\n\nWhen there are certain corporate transactions related to the Company, such as a compulsory acquisition, a general offer, a reconstruction, a merger or division of the Company, the winding up of the Company, or the sale of the Company’s business or subsidiary, our Board has discretion (subject to certain requirements) to allow all awards (vested or unvested) to be exercised in whole or in part. In certain circumstances, if our Board exercises such discretion and the awards are not exercised, they will instead lapse. If the Company is acquired, all award holders are required to release their awards in consideration of the grant of a new award.\n\n48  \n---  \n  \nAn award can lapse when it has not been exercised after the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. It can also lapse when the award holder ceases to be a director, an employee, or a consultant with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. An award will lapse when an order is made by a court (or when a resolution is passed) for the compulsory winding up of the Company. Finally, an award lapses when the award holder becomes bankrupt, enters into a compromise with their creditors generally except as permitted under certain circumstances. Prior to the exercise of an award, an award holder has no rights in respect of any shares.\n\nIn the event of a reorganization, vesting conditions may be adjusted by our Board, subject to an auditors’ confirmation that the adjustment is fair and reasonable and notice to the award holder.\n\nAn award may not vest or be exercised until our Board is satisfied that the award holder will be able to pay for any tax or social security liability that is owed by the holder.\n\nWhen permitted by SEC rules, we intend to file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the Ordinary Shares issuable under the Equity Incentive Plan.\n\nGrants of awards under the Equity Incentive Plan are subject to the discretion of the plan administrator. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the future benefits that will be received by participants under the Equity Incentive Plan.\n\n**_Director Compensation_**\n\nThe following table presents the total compensation for each person who served as a non-employee director of the Board during fiscal year 2023.\n\nName | Fees earned or paid in cash ($) | Total ($)  \n---|---|---  \nFranco Cassar | $| 40,000 | $| 40,000  \nJames Lasry | $| 40,000 | $| 40,000  \nPaul Packer | $| 40,000 | $| 40,000  \nIra Greenstein | $| 40,000 | $| 40,000  \nRachel Bitan | $| 40,000 | $| 40,000  \n  \nWe have a Director Service Agreement with each of our directors (the “Director Agreements”). The Director Agreements lay out the terms and conditions of each person’s directorship and also sets forth each director’s compensation. Each director will be compensated with $40,000 per annum, payable quarterly in advance and shall receive that number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to $25,000, based on the market price of the Common Stock on the date such director starts his/her directorship (the “Commencement Date”). Directors shall also receive an equivalent amount of stock on each anniversary of his/her Commencement Date, based on the market price of the Common Stock on such corresponding anniversary date.\n\nIn addition to the compensation above, directors are entitled to $1,500 for each board meeting they attend, an additional $2,500 shall be paid to the director serving as chairperson of the Audit committee and an additional $1,500 shall be paid to the director serving as chairperson of the Compensation committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance committee. The Company shall reimburse (or procure the reimbursement of) all reasonable expenses wholly, properly and necessarily incurred by the Director in the course of his/her term, subject to production of receipts or other appropriate evidence of payment. The Directors Agreements contain customary confidentiality and indemnification provisions.\n\nC. Board Practices\n\nOur Board of Directors currently consists of seven members, all of whom were elected pursuant to our current Memorandum and Articles. Our nominating and governance committee and board of directors will consider a broad range of factors relating to the qualifications and background of nominees, which may include diversity and is not limited to race, gender or national origin.

Related Party Transactions\n\n**Business Combination**\n\nOn June 9, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), the Company consummated the transaction contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, which provides for the Business Combination between Globis and FAHL.\n\nIn accordance with the Business Combination Agreement, the consummation of the following series of separate transactions took place: (i) Globis formed a new holding company, Globis NV Merger Corp., a Nevada corporation (“** _Globis Nevada_** ”), which changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by transferring by way of a redomiciliation and domesticating as a Gibraltar private limited company known as “Forafric Global Limited” (the “** _Redomiciliation_** ”) and, following the Redomiciliation, altered its authorized and issued share capital and thereafter re-registering as a Gibraltar public company limited by shares and changed its name to “Forafric Global PLC”; (ii) the Company formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Globis NV Merger 2 Corp., a Nevada corporation (“** _Merger Sub_** ”); (iii) Globis merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving (the “** _Merger_** ”); (iv) an agent was appointed to act on behalf of Globis stockholders such that, subject to and immediately following the completion of the Merger, the agent entered into a contribution and subscription agreement with the Company (the “** _Contribution Agreement_** ”) pursuant to which the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Merger Sub issued pursuant to the Merger will be exchanged (the “** _Exchange_** ”), on a one-for-one basis, for ordinary shares, nominal value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the “** _Ordinary Shares_** ”); and (v) on June 9, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in FAHL from Lighthouse Capital Limited (“** _Seller_** ”) and FAHL became a direct subsidiary of the Company.\n\nAs a result of the Business Combination, the Seller received (i) 17,004,762 Ordinary Shares on the Closing Date, (ii) 1,550,000 Ordinary shares pursuant to a subscription agreement dated 9 September 2022, and (iii) will be paid the principal sum of $8,000,000 together with interest on the outstanding amount from the Closing Date up to the date of payment (computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve (12) months of thirty (30) days) accrued but unpaid thereon at the fixed per annum rate of 8%.\n\n54  \n---  \n  \nIn addition, on September 9, 2022, the Company entered into a Warrant Agreement (the “Warrant Agreement”) with the Seller, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue 516,666 warrants to the Seller, each of which entitles the holder to purchase one ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.001, at an exercise price of $11.50 per share in cash for a period of 5 years.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing consideration, the Seller is entitled to receive, as additional consideration, and without any action on behalf of the Company or the Company’s shareholders, additional Ordinary Shares (the “Earnout Shares”), to be issued as follows during the period from and after the Closing until the end of calendar year 2024 (A) 500,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2022, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) of the Company is equal to or greater than $27 million, (B) 500,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA of the Company is equal to or greater than $33 million, and (C) 1,000,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2024, the Buyer Trading Price (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) during the standard market trading hours of a trading day is greater than or equal to $16.50 for any 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days.\n\n**Related Agreements**\n\nThis section describes the material provisions of certain additional agreements entered into pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement (the “Related Agreements”) but does not purport to describe all of the terms thereof. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of each of the Related Agreements, and you are urged to read such Related Agreements in their entirety.\n\n**_PIPE Financing_**\n\nOn December 31, 2021, Globis entered into a Subscription Agreement (the “** _PIPE Subscription Agreement_** ”) with an accredited investor (the “** _PIPE Investor_** ”), pursuant to which the PIPE Investor purchased Ordinary Share of the Company in a private placement following the Redomiciliation, Merger, and Exchange and prior to the closing of the Business Combination. Pursuant to the PIPE Subscription Agreement, the PIPE Investor purchased, at a purchase price of $10.50 per share, a number of Ordinary Shares (the “** _PIPE Shares_** ”) that was equal to lesser of (i) 4.99% of all issued and outstanding ordinary shares, after taking into account the completion of the Business Combination and all ordinary shares issued pursuant to the FAHL Bonds (defined below) and other related subscription agreements, if any, and (ii) 1,904,761 ordinary shares (the “** _PIPE Investment_** ”). The closing of the PIPE Investment was contingent upon, among other things, the substantially concurrent consummation of the Business Combination. On June 9, 2022, substantially concurrently with the Closing, the sale of the PIPE Shares was consummated, pursuant to which the PIPE Investor purchased an aggregate of 1,320,195 Ordinary Shares of the Company for total gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $14.0 million.\n\n**_FAHL Bonds_**\n\nIn connection with the Business Combination, between December 31, 2021 and January 3, 2022, investors (each a “** _Bond Investor_** ”) subscribed for convertible bonds of FAHL, as issuer, in an aggregate principal amount of $11.5 million (the “** _FAHL Bonds_** ”) in a private placement, issued pursuant to a Bond Subscription Deed (the “** _Bond Subscription Deed_** ”), among FAHL, the Seller and the Bond Investors. Unless earlier converted or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the FAHL Bonds, the FAHL Bonds were to mature and be redeemed on June 15, 2026. Interest accrued on the FAHL Bonds at a rate of 6% per annum and the Bond Investors were entitled to certain customary information rights. Pursuant to the current terms of the FAHL Bonds, upon consummation of the Business Combination, the FAHL Bonds were novated to the Company and automatically convert into 1,248,426 Ordinary Shares of the Company (the “** _Bond Shares_** ”) at a price per share of $9.45, which was a 10% discount to the PIPE Investment. The number of Ordinary Shares was equal to the quotient that results from dividing the aggregate principal amount of the respective FAHL Bond plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon by $9.45, subject to certain adjustments. The Bond Investors include affiliates Up and Up Capital, LLC and Globis SPAC LLC, the sponsors of Globis, who subscribed for an aggregate principal amount of $9 million of the FAHL Bonds, which converted into 977,659 Ordinary Shares of the Company.\n\n55  \n---  \n  \n**_FAHL Related Party Loans_**\n\nAs previously disclosed, certain parties affiliated with FAHL held outstanding loans issued to FAHL (the “**FAHL Related Party Loans** ”), which, in the aggregate, equaled approximately $15.1 million as of the Closing of the Business Combination. The FAHL Related Party Loans were interest-free loans with no maturity date. Upon consummation of the Business Combination, all FAHL Related Party Loans were paid off or novated to the Company and converted into 1,445,164 Ordinary Shares of the Company at a price of $10.50 per share (the “** _Loan Shares_** ”).\n\n**_Lock-Up Agreement_**\n\nAt the Closing, Seller and the Sponsors executed and delivered to the Company the Lock-Up Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, the Seller and Sponsors will agree not to, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Lock-Up Agreement, during the period commencing from the Closing and through the date that is the earlier of: (i) 180 days following the Closing Date; (ii) the date on which the sales price of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $11.50 per share (as the same may be adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations, and the like) during the standard market trading hours for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading-day period commencing after the Closing Date; and (iii) the date that Company consummates a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, or other similar transaction that results in all of the holders of Ordinary Shares having the right to exchange their Ordinary Shares for cash, securities, or other property (the “**Lock-Up Period** ”): (i) sell, offer to sell, contract, or agree to sell, hypothecate, pledge, grant any option to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of or agree to transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to, any portion of Ordinary Shares, or (ii) enter into any swap or other contract that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of the Ordinary Shares, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of Ordinary Shares or such other equity securities, in cash or otherwise, or (iii) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (i) or (ii). Any waiver by the Company of the provisions of the Lock-Up Agreement requires the approval of a committee consisting of (a) Paul Packer and another individual designated by Paul Packer, and (b) two “independent” directors of the Company as of after the Closing, who shall be agreed to by each of Globis and FAHL before the Closing.\n\n**_Forward Share Purchase Agreements_**\n\nOn June 8, 2022, Globis and the _Forward Purchase Investors_ entered into Forward Share Purchase Agreements pursuant to which, on the three month anniversary of the date of the Closing, the Forward Purchase Investors may elect to sell and transfer to the Company, and the Company will purchase, in the aggregate up to 1,500,000 Ordinary Shares, or the Forward Investor Shares, consisting of (i) Ordinary Shares then held by the Forward Purchase Investors and/or (ii) any additional Ordinary Shares that the Forward Purchase Investors may acquire prior to the closing of the Business Combination. The Company will acquire the Forward Investor Shares at a price of $10.80 per share, or the _Forward Shares Purchase Price_\n\nOn September 9, 2022, the Company entered into three Buy Back Contracts with the Forward Purchase Investors: (i) a Buy Back Contract by and among the Company, NOMIS BAY LTD and BPY LIMITED, pursuant to which the Company bought back up to 500,000 ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share; (ii) a Buy Back Contract by and between the Company and K2 PRINCIPAL FUND L.P., pursuant to which the Company bought back 448,651 ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share; and (iii) a Buy Back Contract by and between the Company and POLAR MULTI-STRATEGY MASTER FUND, pursuant to which the Company bought back 231,071 ordinary shares, par value $0.001 per share (together “Buy Back Contracts”). As a result of the Buy Back Contracts, 1,179,722 ordinary shares were bought by the company and cancelled in full satisfaction of the Forward Purchase Agreements _._\n\n56  \n---  \n  \n**FAHL Related Person Transactions**\n\n**_Lease agreement_**\n\nIn 2015, FAHL entered into a building lease agreement for the headquarters of Forafric Maroc, a wholly owned subsidiary, with a lease term through 2024. The Seller owns 100% of the company that owns the building. Total rent is approximately $420,000 per year.\n\n**_Exclusive Supply Agreement_**\n\nPursuant to Framework Contract for Delegation of Purchases and Terms of Application, between Forafric Maroc and Millcorp Geneve SA (“Millcorp”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Seller, FAHL is obligated to obtain at least 80% of its annual requirements of common wheat, durum wheat, or any other cereal, for the five year period which began on April 1, 2018 and ended on March 31, 2023. The agreement was subsequently extended 3 years through March 31, 2026 as agreed upon by the parties. Millcorp is currently providing 100% of the imported grain to FAHL. The purchases incurred were $147,284 million and $207,188 million, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n**_Other Related Party Transactions_**\n\nAs a result of the Business Combination, the Seller will be paid the principal sum of $8,000,000 together with interest on the outstanding amount from the Closing Date up to the date of payment (computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve (12) months of thirty (30) days) accrued but unpaid thereon at the fixed per annum rate of 8%.\n\nThe Company’s amounts due from related parties were $1.4 million and $2.4 million as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe Company’s loans due to related parties were $1.5 million and $1.8 million as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively\n\n**Statement of Policy Regarding Transactions with Related Persons Following the Business Combination**\n\nThe Company adopted a formal written policy that will be effective upon the completion of the Business Combination providing that the Company’s officers, directors, nominees for election as directors, beneficial owners of more than 5% of any class of the Company’s capital stock, any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons and any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a 5% or greater beneficial ownership interest, are not permitted to enter into a related party transaction with the Company without the approval of the Company’s audit committee, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nSee “Item 6.

Reference is made to our M&A, forms of which are filed as Exhibit 3.1 to this Annual Report.\n\nWe were registered as a public company limited by shares in Gibraltar on May 26, 2022 pursuant to the Companies Act.\n\n**Authorized and Outstanding Share Capital**\n\nSee “Exhibit 2.2 — Description of Securities” attached to this Form 20-F.\n\n**Ordinary Shares**\n\nSee “Exhibit 2.2 — Description of Securities” attached to this Form 20-F.\n\n**Preferred Shares**\n\nSee “Exhibit 2.2 — Description of Securities” attached to this Form 20-F.\n\n**Class Z non-redeemable and non-convertible ordinary shares**\n\nSee “Exhibit 2.2 — Description of Securities” attached to this Form 20-F.\n\n**Redeemable Warrants**\n\nSee “Exhibit 2.2 — Description of Securities” attached to this Form 20-F.\n\n**Director meetings**\n\nAny director may call a directors’ meeting. The Company secretary must call a directors’ meeting if a director so requests. The quorum for directors’ meetings shall be half of the number of directors appointed to the board from time to time, rounded up to the nearest whole number. In the event that there is only one director, the quorum shall be one. Each director participating in a directors’ meeting has one vote. If a directors’ meeting, or part of a directors’ meeting, is concerned with an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the Company in which a director is interested, that director is not to be counted as participating in that meeting, or part of a meeting, for quorum or voting purposes. An interest of a person who is connected with a director shall be treated as an interest of the director and, in relation to an alternate director, an interest of his appointor shall be treated as an interest of the alternate director without prejudice to any interest which the alternate director has otherwise.\n\nHowever, a director who is interested in an actual or proposed transaction or arrangement with the Company is to be counted as participating in a decision at a directors’ meeting, or part of a directors’ meeting, relating to it for quorum and voting purposes, when (i) the Company by ordinary resolution disapplies the provision of the M&A which would otherwise prevent a director from being counted as participating in, or voting at, a directors’ meeting; (ii) the director’s interest cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest; or (iii) the director’s conflict of interest arises from a permitted cause as set forth in the M&A.\n\nAt every annual general meeting any director who has at the start of the annual general meeting been in office for three calendar years or more since his last appointment or re-appointment shall retire at that annual general meeting, but he may offer himself for reappointment by the members.\n\n59  \n---  \n  \n**Shareholder Meetings**\n\nThe Company will call annual general meetings pursuant to the provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of Association in accordance with the Companies Act. The Board may call extraordinary general meetings whenever they see fit in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act and the Memorandum and Articles of Association. A general meeting of the Company, other than a meeting for the passing of a special resolution, may be called by 7 days’ prior written notice. A general meeting of the Company for the passing of a special resolution may be called by giving at least 21 days’ prior written notice and specifying in the notice the resolution that will be proposed as a special resolution.\n\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, shareholders entitled to participate and vote at general meetings are the shareholders of record on a date to be decided by the board of directors, which may be between four and forty days prior to the date of the meeting.\n\n_Appointment of Directors, Election of Directors and Vacancies_\n\nAny person who is willing to act as a director, is permitted by law to do so may be appointed to be a director of the Company by ordinary resolution, or by a decision of the Board.\n\nDirectors of the Company are generally appointed for periods of three calendar years, save as provided below. At every annual general meeting of the Company, any director who has at the start of the annual general meeting been in office for three calendar years or more since his last appointment or re-appointment shall retire at that annual general meeting but he may offer himself for reappointment by the shareholders. If the Company does not fill the vacancy in the Board at the meeting at which a director retires by rotation or otherwise, the retiring director shall, if willing to act, be deemed to have been re-appointed unless at the meeting it is resolved not to fill the vacancy or unless a resolution for the re-appointment of the director is put to the meeting and lost. The appointment of any person proposed as a director shall be effected by a separate resolution.\n\nNo person other than a director retiring by rotation shall be appointed a director at any general meeting unless he is recommended by the Board or, not less than three nor more than forty-two days before the date appointed for the general meeting, a notice executed by any shareholder qualified to vote at the meeting (not being the person to be proposed) has been received by the Company of the intention to propose that person for appointment stating the particulars of that nominee, together with confirmation in writing executed by that person of his willingness to be appointed.\n\nSave as provided above, the Company may by ordinary resolution appoint a person who is willing to act to be a director either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director and may also determine the rotation in which any additional directors are to retire. The appointment of a person to fill a vacancy or as an additional director shall take effect from the end of the meeting. The Board may also appoint a person who is willing to act to be a director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director and in either case whether or not for a fixed term. Irrespective of the terms of his appointment, a director appointed by the Board shall hold office only until the next annual general meeting and shall be taken into account in determining the directors who are to retire by rotation at the meeting. If not re-appointed at such annual general meeting, he shall vacate office at its conclusion. A director who retires at an annual general meeting may, if willing to act, be re-appointed. If he is not re-appointed, he shall retain office until the meeting appoints someone in his place, or if it does not do so, until the end of the meeting.\n\nDirectors of the Company are not required to hold any shares in the capital of the Company by way of qualification.\n\nSubject to the following paragraph, the Company may by ordinary resolution of which special notice has been given, or by special resolution, remove from office a director appointed by ordinary resolution or by a decision of the directors, notwithstanding any provisions of the articles of association or of any agreement between the Company and such director, but without prejudice to any claim the director may make for damages for breach of such agreement. The Company may, by ordinary resolution, appoint another person to be a director in the place of a director so removed from office. In default of such appointment the vacancy so arising may be filled by the Board as a casual vacancy.\n\n60  \n---  \n  \nDuring the first three calendar years commencing from the date of adoption of the articles of association of The Company, the company may only by special resolution or extraordinary resolution, remove from office a director appointed by ordinary resolution or by a decision of the directors, notwithstanding any provisions of the articles of association or of any agreement between The Company and such director, but without prejudice to any claim such director may make for damages for breach of such agreement.\n\n_Quorum_\n\nThe Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that the holders of 33 1/3% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the business to be transacted, shall be a quorum.\n\n_Vote Requirements_\n\nAn ordinary resolution of the shareholders (or of a class of shareholders) of the Company means a resolution that is passed by members representing a simple majority (more than 50%) of the total voting rights of the shareholders or, as the case may be, of the class of shareholders. An extraordinary resolution of the shareholders means a resolution that is passed by shareholders representing a majority of not less than 75% of those shareholders at a general meeting of which notice specifying the terms of the resolution and the intention to propose the resolution as an extraordinary resolution has been given.\n\n**Rights of Non-Resident or Foreign Shareholders**\n\nThere are no limitations imposed by our memorandum and articles on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders to hold or exercise voting rights on our shares. In addition, there are no provisions in our memorandum and articles governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed.\n\n**Changes in Share Capital**\n\nThe Company may by ordinary resolution (i) increase its share capital by such sum to be divided into shares of such amount as the resolution prescribes; (ii) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount than its existing shares; (iii) sub-divide its shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by the Company’s memorandum of association and the resolution may determine that, as between the shares resulting from the sub-division, any of them may have any preference or advantage as compared with the others; and (iv) cancel shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person and diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled. The Company may by special resolution reduce its share capital, capital redemption reserve and share premium account in any way.\n\n**Anti-Takeover Measures; Regulation of Takeovers of Gibraltar Companies**\n\n_Companies (Cross-Border Mergers) Regulations 2010_\n\nThe Company is incorporated in Gibraltar and it is governed by Gibraltar legislation which regulates the takeover of Gibraltar registered companies. The Companies (Cross-Border Mergers) Regulations 2010, or the Regulations, transpose Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on cross border mergers of limited liability companies into the law of Gibraltar. This EC Directive has been incorporated into the laws of other EC member states, including in the United Kingdom by the Companies (Cross-Border Mergers) Regulations 2007. The Regulations in force in Gibraltar, or the Regulations, in effect, are broadly similar but not identical to those in place in the United Kingdom. These Regulations are designed to facilitate cross-border mergers of limited liability companies registered in European Member States and to thereby allow for cross-border merger of a national limited liability company of one Member State with a limited liability company of another Member State. Under the Regulations, a Gibraltar merging company has to make an application to the court to obtain a pre-merger certificate prior to any merger taking place (“Pre-Merger Certificate”). In order to obtain such a certificate, the Gibraltar company must provide the court, inter alia, with the following:\n\n● | draft terms of the proposed merger (indicating, inter alia, details for the companies involved, share exchange ratios, effects of the merger on employees, rights or restrictions on shares, articles of association, employee participation rights, assets and liabilities transferred and account dates) (the “Draft Terms”). The Draft Terms must be approved by 75% of the members of the company;  \n---|---  \n  \n61  \n---  \n  \n● | a directors’ report (indicating, inter alia, the effects of a cross-border merger for members, creditors and employees, legal and economic grounds for the Draft Terms and any material interests of the directors). The report must be delivered to the employees of the company; and  \n---|---  \n● | an independent expert’s report (indicating, inter alia, details of share exchange ratios and valuation difficulties). Employees of the Gibraltar company must be able to inspect and make copies of these documents.  \n  \nThe courts of Gibraltar may make an order approving the completion of a cross-border merger on the joint application of all the merging companies if:\n\n● | an order for a Pre-Merger Certificate (either granted by the courts in Gibraltar or another competent authority in another member state) has been made within 6 months;  \n---|---  \n● | the Draft Terms presented for acquiring the Pre-Merger Certificate have not been amended; and  \n● | there are appropriate arrangements for employee participation in the transferee company in accordance with part 4 of the Regulations. Such an order will specify the date on which the consequences of the cross-border merger are to have effect. A copy of this order must be provided to the Registrar of Companies of Gibraltar within 7 days of the order if this has been made in Gibraltar or within 14 days if this has been made in another Member State.  \n  \nThe Companies (Cross-Border Mergers) Regulations 2010 only apply to mergers between companies in different European Member States. More commonly, takeovers of a Gibraltar registered company can also take place via a scheme of arrangement pursuant to the Companies Act.\n\n_The Gibraltar Companies Act 2014_\n\nThe takeover of a Gibraltar registered company can take place via a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act. The relevant sections of the Companies Act provide, inter alia, that an application must be made to court in order to convene a meeting of members of such company where such an arrangement can be proposed between a company and its members. Draft terms of the merger as well as other reports and accounting statements would need to be prepared, filed with the Companies Registrar and published prior to such a meeting being convened. At such meeting, at least 75% of the members present in person or by proxy must approve the arrangement in order for a court to thereafter be able to sanction the same. If sanctioned, the court may also order the transfer of undertaking, property and/or liabilities of the transferor company in accordance with the terms of the scheme.\n\nIn addition to the above, another mechanism exists under s.208 of the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 and s.352(A) of the Companies Act (commonly referred to as the “Squeeze Out provisions”) which provides for the situation where a bidder proposes a scheme or contract to take over the shares of a Gibraltar registered company and certain shareholders do not consent to the proposal. If within four months from making such a proposal more than 90% of shareholders of a target company agree to the terms of such a scheme or contract, then the bidding company may within two months after the expiration of said four months give notice to the dissenting members of the target company that it will acquire the shares and certain shareholders do not consent to the proposal on the same terms of the scheme or contract. A Gibraltar scheme of arrangement, therefore, eliminates the risk that a minority of less than 10% of the target company’s shareholders may resist the transfer of their shares to the bidder. It should be noted, however, that such a scheme can be subject to the sanction of the court as any dissenting members may apply to court for an order seeking relief from such a scheme or contract.\n\n62  \n---  \n  \n_Financial Services Act 2019 – Part 20 Acquisitions_\n\nPart 20 of the Financial Services Act 2019 applies to takeover bids for the securities of companies governed by the law of Gibraltar, where all or some of those securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in Gibraltar. However, Gibraltar does not, as yet, have a regulated market. The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission is designated as the competent authority for the purposes of Part 20. Part 20 contains provisions on the conduct of bids, squeeze outs and sell outs, and applicable offences.\n\nC. Material Contracts\n\nWe have not entered into any material contracts other than in the ordinary course of business and other than those described in “Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions – B. Related Party Transactions” or elsewhere in this annual report.\n\nD. Exchange Controls\n\nThere are currently no currency control restrictions on remittances of dividends on Ordinary Shares, proceeds from the sale of the shares or interest or other payments to non-residents of Gibraltar.\n\nE. Taxation\n\n**CERTAIN MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**\n\nThe following is an analysis of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares and the Company Warrants. This analysis applies only to the Ordinary Shares and the Company Warrants, as the case may be, that are held as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “**Code** ”) (generally, property held for investment).\n\nThe following does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects arising in connection with the ownership and disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares and the Company Warrants. The effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local, or non-U.S. tax laws are not analyzed. This analysis is based on the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “**IRS** ”), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect the tax consequences analyzed below. The Company has not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters analyzed below. There can be no assurance the IRS will not take, or a court will not sustain, a contrary position regarding the tax consequences analyzed below.\n\nThis analysis does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income and the alternative minimum tax. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation:\n\n● | banks, insurance companies, and certain other financial institutions;  \n---|---  \n● | regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;  \n● | brokers, dealers, or traders in securities;  \n● | traders in securities that elect to mark to market;  \n● | tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;  \n● | U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the U.S.;  \n  \n63  \n---  \n  \n● | persons holding the Company Ordinary Shares and/or the Company Warrants, as the case may be, as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated or similar transaction;  \n---|---  \n● | persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Company Ordinary Shares and/or the Company Warrants, as the case may be, being taken into account in an applicable financial statement;  \n● | persons that actually or constructively own 5% or more (by vote or value) of the outstanding Ordinary Shares;  \n● | founders, sponsors, officers or directors of the Company or holders of private placement warrants;  \n● | “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax (and their shareholders);  \n● | S corporations, partnerships, or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or other flow-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein);  \n● | U.S. Holders having a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;  \n● | persons who hold or received the Company Ordinary Shares and/or the Company Warrants, as the case may be, pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise as compensation; and  \n● | tax-qualified retirement plans.  \n  \nIn addition, this analysis does not address any tax consequences to investors that directly or indirectly held equity interests in FAHL prior to the Business Combination, including holders of the Company Ordinary Shares and/or the Company Warrants that also held, directly or indirectly, equity interests in FAHL.\n\nIf an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes held or holds the Company Ordinary Shares and/or the Company Warrants, the tax treatment of an owner of such entity will depend on the status of the owner or participant in the arrangement, the activities of the entity or arrangement, and certain determinations made at the owner or participant level. Accordingly, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.\n\nFor purposes of this analysis, a “**U.S. Holder** ” is any beneficial owner of shares of Globis securities, the Company Ordinary Shares and/or the Company Warrants, as the case may be, that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n\n● | an individual who is a citizen or resident of the U.S.;  \n---|---  \n● | a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized in, or under the laws of, the U.S., any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;  \n● | an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or  \n● | a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) or (2) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  \n  \n**THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION AND THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT TO HOLDERS OF Globis UNITS OR Globis SECURITIES DEPEND IN SOME INSTANCES ON DETERMINATIONS OF FACT AND INTERPRETATIONS OF COMPLEX PROVISIONS OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW FOR WHICH NO CLEAR PRECEDENT OR AUTHORITY MAY BE AVAILABLE. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION, THE EXERCISE OF REDEMPTION RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO Globis COMMON STOCK, AND THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY ORDINARY SHARES AND/OR THE COMPANY WARRANTS TO ANY PARTICULAR HOLDER WILL DEPEND ON THE HOLDER’S PARTICULAR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU ARE URGED TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU, IN LIGHT OF YOUR PARTICULAR INVESTMENT OR TAX CIRCUMSTANCES, OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION, THE EXERCISE OF YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO Globis COMMON STOCK, AND THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY ORDINARY SHARES AND/OR THE COMPANY WARRANTS.**\n\n64  \n---  \n  \n**U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of The Company**\n\n**_Tax Residence of The Company for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes._**\n\nAlthough the Company is incorporated and tax resident in Gibraltar, following the closing of the Business Combination the IRS may assert that it should be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Code. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation is generally considered a U.S. “domestic” corporation if it is created or organized in or under the laws of the U.S., any state thereof, or the District of Columbia. Because the Company is not so created or organized (but is instead incorporated only in Gibraltar), it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (that is, a corporation other than a U.S. “domestic” corporation) under these rules. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception under which a corporation created or organized only under foreign law may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Section 7874 rules are complex and require analysis of all relevant facts, and there is limited guidance and significant uncertainties as to their application.\n\nUnder Code Section 7874, a corporation created or organized outside the U.S. (i.e., a foreign corporation) will nevertheless be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes when (i) the foreign corporation directly or indirectly acquires substantially all of the assets held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation (including the indirect acquisition of assets of the U.S. corporation by acquiring the outstanding shares of the U.S. corporation), (ii) the shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold, by vote or value, at least 80% of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding shares in the U.S. acquired corporation (the “Section 7874 Percentage”), and (iii) the foreign corporation’s “expanded affiliated group” does not have substantial business activities in the foreign corporation’s country of creation or organization relative to such expanded affiliated group’s worldwide activities (the “Substantial Business Activities Exception”). In order to satisfy the Substantial Business Activities Exception, at least 25% of the employees (by headcount and compensation), real and tangible assets, and gross income of the foreign acquiring corporation’s “expanded affiliated group” must be based, incurred, located, and derived, respectively, in the country in which the foreign acquiring corporation is created or organized. The Section 7874 Regulations further provide for a number of special rules that aggregate multiple acquisitions of U.S. corporations for purposes of Code Section 7874 that are made as part of a plan or made over a 36-month period, making it more likely that Code Section 7874 will apply to a foreign acquiring corporation.\n\nThe Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Globis through the Business Combination. As a result, Section 7874 of the Code may apply to cause the Company to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the Business Combination depending on whether the Section 7874 Percentage equals or exceeds 80%, subject to the applicability of the Substantial Business Activities Exception.\n\nBased upon the terms of the Business Combination, the rules for determining share ownership under Code Section 7874 and the Section 7874 Regulations, and certain factual assumptions, the Section 7874 Percentage of Globis stockholders in the Company should be less than 80% after the Business Combination. Accordingly, the Company is not expected to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code. The calculation of the Section 7874 Percentage is complex, is subject to detailed regulations (the application of which is uncertain in various respects and could be impacted by changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations with possible retroactive effect), and is subject to certain factual uncertainties. Moreover, former holders of Globis Common Stock may be deemed to own an amount of the Company Ordinary Shares in respect to certain redemptions by former holders of Globis Common Stock prior to the Business Combination for purposes of determining the ownership percentage of former holders of Globis Common Stock under Section 7874 of the Code. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the status of the Company as a foreign corporation under Code Section 7874 or that such challenge would not be sustained by a court.\n\n65  \n---  \n  \nIf the IRS were to successfully challenge under Code Section 7874 the Company’s status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company and certain the Company shareholders could be subject to significant adverse tax consequences, including a higher effective corporate income tax rate on the Company and future withholding taxes on certain the Company shareholders. In particular, holders of the Company Ordinary Shares and/or the Company Warrants would be treated as holders of stock and warrants of a U.S. corporation.\n\nHowever, even if the Section 7874 Percentage were such that the Company were still respected as a foreign corporation under Code Section 7874, the Company may be limited in using its equity to engage in future acquisitions of U.S. corporations over the 36-month period following the Business Combination. If the Company were to be treated as acquiring substantially all of the assets of a U.S. corporation within the 36-month period after the Business Combination, the Section 7874 Regulations would exclude certain shares of the Company attributable to the Business Combination for purposes of determining the Section 7874 Percentage of that subsequent acquisition, making it more likely that Code Section 7874 would apply to such subsequent acquisition.\n\nThe remainder of this analysis assumes that the Company will not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7874 of the Code.\n\n**_Utilization of Globis’ Tax Attributes and Certain Other Adverse Tax Consequences to The Company and The Company’s Shareholders._**\n\nFollowing the acquisition of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, Code Section 7874 can limit the ability of the acquired U.S. corporation and its U.S. affiliates to use U.S. tax attributes (including net operating losses and certain tax credits) to offset U.S. taxable income resulting from certain transactions, as well as result in certain other adverse tax consequences, even if the acquiring foreign corporation is respected as a foreign corporation for purposes of Code Section 7874. Specifically, Code Section 7874 can apply in this manner if (i) the foreign corporation acquires, directly or indirectly, substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a U.S. corporation, (ii) after the acquisition, the former shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation hold at least 60% (by either vote or value) but less than 80% (by vote and value) of the shares of the foreign acquiring corporation by reason of holding shares in the acquired U.S. corporation, and (iii) the foreign corporation’s “expanded affiliated group” does not meet the Substantial Business Activities Exception.\n\nBased upon the terms of the Business Combination, the rules for determining share ownership under Section 7874 of the Code and the Section 7874 Regulations, and certain factual assumptions, the Section 7874 Percentage should be less than 60% after the Business Combination. Accordingly, the limitations and other rules described above are not expected to apply to the Company or Globis after the Business Combination.\n\nIf the Section 7874 Percentage applicable to the Business Combination were at least 60% but less than 80%, the Company and certain of the Company’s shareholders may be subject to adverse tax consequences including, but not limited to, restrictions on the use of tax attributes with respect to “inversion gain” recognized over a 10-year period following the transaction, disqualification of dividends paid from preferential “qualified dividend income” rates, and the requirement that any U.S. corporation owned by the Company include as “base erosion payments” that may be subject to a minimum U.S. federal income tax any amounts treated as reductions in gross income paid to certain related foreign persons. Furthermore, certain “disqualified individuals” (including officers and directors of a U.S. corporation) may be subject to an excise tax on certain stock-based compensation at a rate of 20%. However, as a blank check company whose assets are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents, it is not expected that Globis will have a significant amount of inversion gain as a result of the Business Combination.\n\nThe determination that the Section 7874 Percentage should be less than 60% after the Business Combination is subject to detailed regulations (the application of which is uncertain in various respects and would be impacted by future changes in tax laws and regulations, with possible retroactive effect) and is subject to certain factual uncertainties. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge whether the Company is subject to the above rules or that such a challenge would not be sustained by a court. If the IRS successfully applied these rules to the Company, significant adverse tax consequences could result for the Company and for certain the Company shareholders, including a higher effective corporate tax rate on the Company U.S. Holders.\n\n66  \n---  \n  \n**_U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of The Company Ordinary Shares and The Company Warrants to U.S. Holders._**\n\n_Distributions on The Company Ordinary Shares_\n\nSubject to the analysis below under “— _Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_ ,” if the Company makes distributions of cash or property on the Company Ordinary Shares, such distributions will be treated first as a dividend to the extent of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes), and then as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s tax basis, with any excess treated as gain from the sale or exchange of the shares. The amount of any such distribution will include any amounts withheld by the Company (or another applicable withholding agent). If the Company does not provide calculations of its earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, a U.S. Holder should expect all cash distributions to be reported as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any dividend will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations in respect of dividends received from U.S. corporations.\n\nSubject to the analysis above under “— _Utilization of Globis’ Tax Attributes and Certain Other Adverse Tax Consequences to_ the Company _and_ the Company’s _Shareholders_ ” and below under “— _Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_ ,” dividends received by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) may be “qualified dividend income,” which is taxed at the lower applicable capital gains rate, provided that:\n\n● | either (a) the shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the U.S. or (b) the Company is eligible for the benefits of a qualifying income tax treaty with the U.S. that includes an exchange of information program;  \n---|---  \n● | the Company is neither a PFIC (as analyzed below under below under “— _Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_ ”) nor treated as such with respect to the U.S. Holder for the Company’s taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year;  \n● | the U.S. Holder satisfies certain holding period requirements;  \n● | the U.S. Holder is not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property; and  \n● | the taxpayer does not take the dividends into account as investment income under Code Section 163(d)(4)(B).  \n  \nThere is no comprehensive income tax treaty between the U.S. and Gibraltar, thus the Company will not be eligible for benefits of an applicable comprehensive income tax treaty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company Ordinary Shares will be considered “readily tradable” on an established securities market in accordance with applicable legal authorities. Furthermore, the Company will not constitute a qualified foreign corporation for purposes of these rules if it is a PFIC for the taxable year in which it pays a dividend or for the preceding taxable year. See “— _Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules._ ” U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the lower rate for dividends paid with respect to the Company Ordinary Shares.\n\nThe amount of any dividend distribution paid in foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the applicable exchange rate in effect on the date of actual or constructive receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at that time. A U.S. Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars after the date of receipt.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions, dividends on the Company Ordinary Shares will constitute foreign source income for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. If the dividends are qualified dividend income (as analyzed above), the amount of the dividend taken into account for purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit limitation will be limited to the gross amount of the dividend, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the reduced rate applicable to qualified dividend income and the denominator of which is the highest rate of tax normally applicable to dividends. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. For this purpose, dividends distributed by the Company with respect to the Company Ordinary Shares generally will constitute “passive category income” but could, in the case of certain U.S. Holders, constitute “general category income.” The rules governing foreign tax credits are complex and U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability of foreign taxes in their particular circumstances. In lieu of claiming a foreign tax credit, a U.S. Holder may, in certain circumstances, deduct foreign taxes in computing the holder’s taxable income, subject to generally applicable limitations under U.S. law. Generally, an election to deduct foreign taxes instead of claiming foreign tax credits applies to all foreign taxes paid or accrued in the taxable year.\n\n67  \n---  \n  \n_Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of The Company Ordinary Shares and The Company Warrants_\n\nSubject to the analysis below under “— _Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_ ,” a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss on any sale, exchange, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Warrants in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount realized on the disposition and (ii) such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares and/or warrants. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a taxable disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Warrants generally will be capital gain or loss. A non-corporate U.S. Holder, including an individual, who has held the Company Ordinary Shares and/or the Company Warrants for more than one year generally will be eligible for reduced tax rates for such long-term capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\nAny such gain or loss recognized generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss. Accordingly, in the event any Gibraltar tax (including withholding tax) is imposed upon such sale or other disposition, a U.S. Holder may not be able to utilize foreign tax credits unless such holder has foreign source income or gain in the same category from other sources. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisor regarding the ability to claim a foreign tax credit.\n\n_Exercise, Lapse, or Redemption of a The Company Warrant_\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of a Company Ordinary Share on the exercise of a Company Warrant for cash. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in a Company Ordinary Shares received upon exercise of the Company Warrant generally should be an amount equal to the sum of the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Globis Warrant exchanged therefor (assuming the Business Combination is not a taxable transaction, as discussed above) and the exercise price. The U.S. Holder’s holding period for a Company Ordinary Share received upon exercise of the Company Warrant will begin on the date following the date of exercise (or possibly the date of exercise) of the Company Warrant and will not include the period during which the U.S. Holder held the Company Warrant. If a Company Warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder’s tax basis in the Company Warrant.\n\nThe tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a Company Warrant are not clear under current tax law. Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a cashless exercise may be tax-deferred, either because the exercise is not a gain realization event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In either tax-deferred situation, a U.S. Holder’s basis in The Company Ordinary Shares received generally would equal the U.S. Holder’s basis in The Company Warrants exercised therefor. If the cashless exercise is not treated as a gain realization event, a U.S. Holder’s holding period in The Company Ordinary Shares would be treated as commencing on the date following the date of exercise (or possibly the date of exercise) of The Company Warrants and will not include the period during which the U.S. Holder held The Company Warrants. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of The Company Ordinary Shares would include the holding period of The Company Warrants exercised therefor.\n\nIt is also possible that a cashless exercise of a Company Warrant could be treated in part as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized in the manner set forth above under “— _Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of The Company Ordinary Shares and The Company Warrants_.” In such event, a U.S. Holder could be deemed to have surrendered warrants equal to the number of the Company Ordinary Shares having an aggregate fair market value equal to the exercise price for the total number of warrants to be exercised. Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, the U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss with respect to the Company Warrants deemed surrendered in an amount generally equal to the difference between (i) the fair market value of the Company Ordinary Shares that would have been received in a regular exercise of the Company Warrants deemed surrendered, net of the aggregate exercise price of such the Company Warrants and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such the Company Warrants. In this case, a U.S. Holder’s aggregate tax basis in the Company Ordinary Shares received would equal the sum of (i) U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Company Warrants deemed exercised and (ii) the aggregate exercise price of such the Company Warrants. A U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Company Ordinary Shares received in such case generally would commence on the date following the date of exercise (or possibly the date of exercise) of the Company Warrants and will not include the period during which the U.S. Holder held the Company Warrants.\n\n68  \n---  \n  \nDue to the absence of authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise of warrants, including when a U.S. Holder’s holding period would commence with respect to the Company Ordinary Share received, there can be no assurance regarding which, if any, of the alternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise of the Company Warrants.\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules described below, if the Company redeems the Company Warrants for cash pursuant to the redemption provisions described in the section of this registration statement entitled “ _— Exercise, Lapse, or Redemption of a The Company Warrant_ ” or if the Company purchases the Company Warrants in an open market transaction, such redemption or purchase generally will be treated as a taxable disposition to the U.S. Holder, taxed as described above under “— _Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares and the Company Warrants_.”\n\n_Possible Constructive Distributions_\n\nThe terms of each the Company Warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of the Company Ordinary Shares for which the Company Warrant may be exercised or to the exercise price of the Company Warrant in certain events. An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. A U.S. Holder of a Company Warrant would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from the Company if, for example, the adjustment increases the holder’s proportionate interest in the Company’s assets or earnings and profits (for instance, through an increase in the number of the Company Ordinary Shares that would be obtained upon exercise of such warrant) as a result of a distribution of cash or other property such as other securities to the holders of the Company Ordinary Shares which is taxable to the U.S. Holders of such shares as described under “— _Distributions on The Company Ordinary Shares_ ” above. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the same manner as if the U.S. Holder of such The Company Warrant received a cash distribution from the Company equal to the fair market value of such increase in interest.\n\n_Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules_\n\nThe treatment of U.S. Holders of the Company Ordinary Shares and the Company Warrants could be materially different from that described above, if the Company is treated as a “passive foreign investment company,” or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An entity treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally will be a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year if either:\n\n● | at least 75% of its gross income for such year is passive income (such as interest, dividends, rents and royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of assets giving rise to passive income); or  \n---|---  \n● | at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets) during such year is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income.  \n  \nFor this purpose, the Company will be treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets and earning its proportionate share of the income of any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which the Company own, directly or indirectly, 25% or more (by value) of the stock.\n\n69  \n---  \n  \nBased on the current and anticipated composition of the income, assets and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Company does not believe it is a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for its current taxable year, which includes the Business Combination, and does not expect to become one for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the near future.\n\nNevertheless, whether the Company is treated as a PFIC is determined on an annual basis. The determination of whether a non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC is a factual determination that depends on, among other things, the composition of the Company’s income and assets, and the market value of its shares and assets, including the composition of income and assets and the market value of shares and assets of its subsidiaries, from time to time, and thus the determination can only be made annually after the close of each taxable year. Thus, no assurance can be given as to whether the Company will be a PFIC in 20232023 or for any future taxable year. 2023\n\nUnder the PFIC rules, if the Company were considered a PFIC at any time that a U.S. Holder owns the Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Warrants, the Company would generally continue to be treated as a PFIC with respect to such holder in a particular year unless (i) the Company has ceased to be a PFIC and (ii) (a) the U.S. Holder has made a valid “QEF election” (as described below) for the first taxable year in which the holder owned such holder’s the Company Ordinary Shares in which the Company was a PFIC, (b) a valid mark-to-market election (as described below) is in effect for the particular year, or (c) the U.S. Holder has made a “deemed sale” election under the PFIC rules. If such a “deemed sale” election is made, a U.S. Holder will be deemed to have sold its the Company Ordinary Shares at their fair market value on the last day of the last taxable year in which the Company is classified as a PFIC, and any gain from such deemed sale would be subject to the consequences described below. After the “deemed sale” election, the Company Ordinary Shares with respect to which the “deemed sale” election was made will not be treated as shares in a PFIC unless the Company subsequently becomes a PFIC.\n\nFor each taxable year that the Company is treated as a PFIC with respect to a U.S. Holder’s the Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Warrants, the U.S. Holder will be subject to special tax rules with respect to any “excess distribution” (as defined below) received and any gain realized from a sale or disposition (including a pledge of the Company Ordinary Shares and under proposed regulations transfers of the Company Warrants and certain transfers of the Company Ordinary Shares that would otherwise qualify as nonrecognition transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of its the Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Warrants (collectively the “ _excess distribution rules_ ”), unless, with respect to the Company Ordinary Shares, the U.S. Holder makes a valid QEF or mark-to-market election as discussed below. Generally, distributions received by a U.S. Holder in a taxable year that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder during the shorter of the three preceding taxable years or the portion of such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Warrants that preceded the taxable year of the distribution will be treated as excess distributions. Under these special tax rules:\n\n● | the excess distribution or gain will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Warrants;  \n---|---  \n● | the amount allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution or to the period in the U.S. Holder’s holding period before the first day of the Company’s first taxable year in which the Company is a PFIC, will be treated as ordinary income; and  \n● | the amount allocated to each other taxable year (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in such holder’s holding period will be subject to the highest tax rate in effect for individuals or corporations, as applicable, for each such year without regard to the U.S. Holder’s other items of income and loss for such year; and  \n● | the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the U.S. Holder with respect to the resulting tax attributable to each such year.  \n  \nUnder the excess distribution rules, the tax liability for amounts allocated to taxable years prior to the year of disposition or excess distribution cannot be offset by any net operating losses, and gains (but not losses) realized on the sale of the Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Warrants cannot be treated as capital gains, even though the U.S. Holder holds the Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Warrants as capital assets.\n\n70  \n---  \n  \nCertain of the PFIC rules may impact U.S. Holders with respect to equity interests in subsidiaries and other entities which the Company may hold, directly or indirectly, that are PFICs (collectively, “Lower-Tier PFICs”). There can be no assurance, however, that the Company does not own, or will not in the future acquire, an interest in a subsidiary or other entity that is or would be treated as a Lower-Tier PFIC. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to any of the Company’s subsidiaries.\n\nIf the Company is a PFIC, a U.S. Holder of shares in the Company may avoid taxation under the excess distribution rules described above in respect to the Company Ordinary Shares by making a timely and valid “qualified electing fund” (“QEF”) election (if eligible to do so). However, a U.S. Holder may make a QEF election with respect to its the Company Ordinary Shares only if the Company provides U.S. Holders on an annual basis with certain financial information specified under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations, including the information provided in a PFIC Annual Information Statement. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will have timely knowledge of its status as a PFIC in the future or that the Company will timely provide such information for such years. The failure to provide such information on an annual basis could prevent a U.S. Holder from making a QEF election or result in the invalidation or termination of a U.S. Holder’s prior QEF election.\n\nA U.S. Holder that makes a QEF election with respect to its the Company Ordinary Shares would generally be required to include in income for each year that the Company is treated as a PFIC the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of the Company’s ordinary earnings for the year (which would be subject to tax as ordinary income) and net capital gains for the year (which would be subject to tax at the rates applicable to long-term capital gains), without regard to the amount of any distributions made in respect of the Company Ordinary Shares. Any net deficits or net capital losses of the Company for a taxable year, however, would not be passed through and included on the tax return of the U.S. Holder. A U.S. Holder’s basis in the Company Ordinary Shares would be increased by the amount of income inclusions under the QEF rules. Dividends actually paid on the Company Ordinary Shares generally would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent of prior income inclusions and would reduce the U.S. Holder’s basis in the Company Ordinary Shares by a corresponding amount. If the Company owns any interests in a Lower-Tier PFIC, a U.S. Holder generally must make a separate QEF election for each Lower-Tier PFIC, subject to the Company’s providing the relevant tax information for each Lower-Tier PFIC on an annual basis. There can be no assurance that the Company will have timely knowledge of the status of any such Lower-Tier PFIC. In addition, the Company may not hold a controlling interest in any such Lower-Tier PFIC and thus there can be no assurance the Company will be able to cause the Lower-Tier PFIC to provide such required information.\n\nIf a U.S. Holder does not make a QEF election effective from the first taxable year of a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Company Ordinary Shares in which the Company is a PFIC (or a mark-to-market election, as discussed below), then the U.S. Holder generally will remain subject to the excess distribution rules. A U.S. Holder that first makes a QEF election in a later year may avoid the continued application of the excess distribution rules to its the Company Ordinary Shares by making a “deemed sale” election. In that case, the U.S. Holder will be deemed to have sold the Company Ordinary Shares at their fair market value on the first day of the taxable year in which the QEF election becomes effective, and any gain from such deemed sale would be subject to the excess distribution rules described above. As a result of the “deemed sale” election, the U.S. Holder will have additional basis (to the extent of any gain recognized on the deemed sale) and, solely for purposes of the PFIC rules, a new holding period in the Company Ordinary Shares.\n\nIt is not entirely clear how various aspects of the PFIC rules apply to the Company Warrants. However, a U.S. Holder may not be eligible to make a QEF election with respect to its the Company Warrants. As a result, if a U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of such warrants (other than upon exercise of such warrants) and the Company was a PFIC at any time during the U.S. Holder’s holding period of such warrants, any gain recognized generally will be treated as an excess distribution, taxed as described above.\n\nIf a U.S. Holder that exercises such warrants properly makes and maintains a QEF election with respect to the newly acquired the Company Ordinary Shares (or has previously made a QEF election with respect to the Company Ordinary Shares), the QEF election will apply to the newly acquired the Company Ordinary Shares. Notwithstanding such QEF election, the rules relating to “excess distributions” discussed above, adjusted to take into account the current income inclusions resulting from the QEF election, will continue to apply with respect to such newly acquired the Company Ordinary Shares (which under proposed regulations will be deemed to have a holding period for purposes of the PFIC rules that includes the period the U.S. Holder held the Company Warrants), unless the U.S. Holder makes a “deemed sale” election under the PFIC rules. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the application of the rules governing “deemed sale” elections to their particular circumstances.\n\n71  \n---  \n  \nThe QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and, once made, can be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder that is eligible to make a QEF election with respect to its the Company Ordinary Shares generally may do so by providing the appropriate information to the IRS in the U.S. Holder’s timely filed tax return for the year in which the election becomes effective. Retroactive QEF elections generally may be made only by filing a protective statement with such return and if certain other conditions are met or with the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a retroactive QEF election under their particular circumstances.\n\nAlternatively, if the Company is a PFIC and the Company Ordinary Shares constitute “marketable stock” (as defined below), a U.S. Holder may make a mark-to-market election for such holder’s the Company Ordinary Shares with respect to such shares for the first taxable year in which it holds (or is deemed to hold) the Company Ordinary Shares and each subsequent taxable year to elect out of the excess distribution rules discussed above. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election with respect to its the Company Ordinary Shares, such U.S. Holder generally will include in income for each year that the Company is treated as a PFIC with respect to such the Company Ordinary Shares an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of The Company Ordinary Shares as of the close of the U.S. Holder’s taxable year over the adjusted basis in The Company Ordinary Shares as of the beginning of such taxable year. A U.S. Holder will be allowed a deduction for the excess, if any, of the adjusted basis of the Company Ordinary Shares over their fair market value as of the close of the taxable year. However, deductions will be allowed only to the extent of any net mark-to-market gains on the Company Ordinary Shares included in the U.S. Holder’s income for prior taxable years. Amounts included in income under a mark-to-market election, as well as gain on the actual sale or other disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares, will be treated as ordinary income. Ordinary loss treatment will also apply to the deductible portion of any mark-to-market loss on the Company Ordinary Shares, as well as to any loss realized on the actual sale or disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares, to the extent the amount of such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains for such the Company Ordinary Shares previously included in income. A U.S. Holder’s basis in the Company Ordinary Shares will be adjusted to reflect any mark-to-market gain or loss. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election, any distributions the Company makes would generally be subject to the rules discussed above under “ _— Distributions on The Company Ordinary Shares_ ,” except the lower rates applicable to qualified dividend income would not apply. Currently, U.S. Holders of the Company Warrants may not be able to make a mark-to-market election with respect to their the Company Warrants.\n\nThe mark-to-market election is available only for “marketable stock,” which is stock that is regularly traded on a qualified exchange or other market, as defined in applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. The Company Ordinary Shares, which are expected to be listed on Nasdaq, are expected to qualify as marketable stock for purposes of the PFIC rules, but there can be no assurance that The Company Ordinary Shares will be “regularly traded” for purposes of these rules. If made, a mark-to-market election would be effective for the taxable year for which the election was made and for all subsequent taxable years unless The Company Ordinary Shares cease to qualify as “marketable stock” for purposes of the PFIC rules or the IRS consents to the revocation of the election. Because a mark-to-market election cannot be made for equity interests in any Lower-Tier PFICs, a U.S. Holder that does not make the applicable QEF elections generally will continue to be subject to the excess distribution rules with respect to its indirect interest in any Lower-Tier PFICs as described above, even if a mark-to-market election is made for The Company Ordinary Shares.\n\nIf a U.S. Holder does not make a mark-to-market election (or a QEF election, as discussed above) effective from the first taxable year of a U.S. Holder’s holding period for The Company Ordinary Shares in which The Company is a PFIC, then the U.S. Holder generally will remain subject to the excess distribution rules. A U.S. Holder that first makes a mark-to-market election with respect to The Company Ordinary Shares in a later year will continue to be subject to the excess distribution rules during the taxable year for which the mark-to-market election becomes effective, including with respect to any mark-to-market gain recognized at the end of that year. In subsequent years for which a valid mark-to-mark election remains in effect, the excess distribution rules generally will not apply. A U.S. Holder that is eligible to make a mark-to-market with respect to such holder’s The Company Ordinary Shares may do so by providing the appropriate information on IRS Form 8621 and timely filing that form with the U.S. Holder’s tax return for the year in which the election becomes effective.\n\n72  \n---  \n  \nU.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors as to the availability and desirability of a mark-to-market election, as well as the impact of such election on interests in any Lower-Tier PFICs.\n\nA U.S. Holder of a PFIC may be required to file an IRS Form 8621 on an annual basis and to provide such other information as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department. Failure to do so, if required, will extend the statute of limitations applicable to such U.S. Holder until such required information is furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any reporting requirements that may apply to them if the Company is a PFIC.\n\nThe rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF, “deemed sale,” and mark-to-market elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those described above. U.S. Holders are strongly encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to their particular circumstances.\n\n**Non-U.S. Holders**\n\nThe section applies to Non-U.S. Holders of the Company Ordinary Shares and the Company Warrants. For purposes of this analysis, a Non-U.S. Holder means a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or an entity or arrangement so characterized for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of the Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Warrants that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes not a U.S. Holder, including:\n\n● | a nonresident alien individual, other than certain former citizens and residents of the U.S. subject to U.S. tax as expatriates;  \n---|---  \n● | a foreign corporation; or  \n● | a foreign estate or trust;  \n  \nbut generally does not include a beneficial owner who has been or is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. or an individual who is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Warrants (except to the extent analyzed below). If you are such an individual, you should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of exercising redemption rights with respect to Globis Common Stock or the ownership and disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares or the Company Warrants.\n\n_Non-U.S. Holders Exercising Redemption Rights with Respect to Globis Common Stock_\n\nThe characterization for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the redemption of a Non-U.S. Holder’s Globis Common Stock generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax characterization of such a redemption of a U.S. Holder’s Globis Common Stock, as described above under _“— U.S. Holders Exercising Redemption Rights with Respect to Globis Common Stock_.”\n\nSubject to the analysis below concerning backup withholding, if such a redemption qualifies as a sale of the Globis Common Stock, any redeeming Non-U.S. Holder will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain recognized as a result of the redemption or be able to utilize a loss in computing U.S. federal income tax liability unless one of the exceptions described below under “— _U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares and the Company Warrants to Non-U.S. Holders_ ” applies in respect of gain from the disposition of Globis Common Stock. Moreover, redeeming Non-U.S. Holders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized as a result of the redemption if Globis Common Stock constitutes a U.S. real property interest by reason of Globis’ status as a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Globis believes that it is not and has not been at any time since its formation a U.S. real property holding corporation.\n\n73  \n---  \n  \nIf a Non-U.S. Holder receives cash for Globis Common Stock, and the redemption is treated as a corporate distribution (rather than a sale of stock under Section 302 of the Code), the Non-U.S. Holder will be subject to a 30% withholding tax (unless otherwise reduced by an applicable income tax treaty and the Non-U.S. Holder provides a proper certificate of its eligibility for such reduced rate (usually on an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable)) on the gross amount of the distribution to the extent the distribution is paid from current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, and treated as dividends, provided such dividends are not effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. Any distribution not constituting a dividend will be treated first as reducing (but not below zero) the Non-U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Globis Common Stock and then, to the extent such distribution exceeds the Non-U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis, as gain realized from the sale or other disposition of such Globis Common Stock, which will be treated as described in the paragraph immediately above. A redemption treated as a dividend by Globis to a Non-U.S. Holder that is effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and if an income tax treaty applies, are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the Non-U.S. Holder in the U.S.) will generally not be subject to U.S. withholding tax, provided such Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification and disclosure requirements (usually by providing an IRS Form W-8ECI). Instead, such dividends will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax, net of certain deductions, at the same corporate or graduated individual rates applicable to U.S. Holders (together with branch profits tax, at a 30% rate, or such lower rate specified by an applicable tax treaty, as adjusted for certain items, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation).\n\n**IF YOU ARE A NON-U.S. HOLDER OF Globis COMMON STOCK CONTEMPLATING EXERCISE OF YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS, WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES THEREOF.**\n\n_U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares and the Company Warrants to Non-U.S. Holders_\n\nSubject to the analysis below concerning backup withholding, any (i) dividends of cash or property (including constructive distributions treated as dividends as further described under the heading “ _U.S. Holders — U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares and the Company Warrants to U.S. Holders — Possible Constructive Distributions_ ”) paid or deemed paid to a Non-U.S. Holder in respect of the Company Ordinary Shares or (ii) gain realized upon the sale or other taxable disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares and/or the Company Warrants by a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation or withholding tax unless:\n\n● | the gain or dividend is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the Non-U.S. Holder maintains a permanent establishment or a “fixed base” in the United States to which such gain is attributable); or  \n---|---  \n● | in the case of any gain, the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition and certain other requirements are met.  \n  \nGain or distributions described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular rates. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain items.\n\nGain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.\n\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of a Non-U.S. Holder’s exercise of the Company Warrant, or the lapse of the Company Warrant held by a Non-U.S. Holder, generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the exercise or lapse of the Company Warrant by a U.S. Holder, as described under “ _U.S. Holders — U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares and the Company Warrants to U.S. Holders — Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of the Company Warrant_ ” above, although to the extent a cashless exercise or lapse results in a taxable exchange, the consequences would be similar to those described in the preceding paragraphs above for a Non-U.S. Holder’s gain on the sale or other disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares and the Company Warrants.\n\n74  \n---  \n  \nThe characterization for U.S. federal income tax purposes of the redemption of the Non-U.S. Holder’s The Company Warrants generally will correspond to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of such a redemption of a U.S. Holder’s warrants, as described under “ _U.S. Holders — U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of The Company Ordinary Shares and The Company Warrants to U.S. Holders — Exercise, Lapse or Redemption of a Company Warrant_ ” above, and the consequences of the redemption to the Non-U.S. Holder will be as described in the first paragraph above under the heading “— _U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Ownership and Disposition of The Company Ordinary Shares and The Company Warrants to Non-U.S. Holders_ ” based on such characterization.\n\nNon-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.\n\n**Information Reporting and Backup Withholding**\n\nInformation reporting requirements may apply to cash received in redemption of Globis Common Stock, dividends received by U.S. Holders of the Company Ordinary Shares, and the proceeds received on the disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares effected within the U.S. (and, in certain cases, outside the U.S.), in each case other than U.S. Holders that are exempt recipients (such as corporations). Backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) may apply to such amounts if the U.S. Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number (generally on an IRS Form W-9 provided to the paying agent of the U.S. Holder’s broker) or is otherwise subject to backup withholding. Any redemptions treated as dividend payments with respect to Globis Common Stock or the Company Ordinary Shares and proceeds from the sale, exchange, redemption or other disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and possible U.S. backup withholding. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the U.S. information reporting and backup withholding rules.\n\nInformation returns may be required to be filed with the IRS in connection with, and Non-U.S. Holders may be subject to backup withholding on amounts received in respect of, a Non-U.S. Holder’s disposition of Globis securities or their The Company Ordinary Shares, unless the Non-U.S. Holder furnishes to the applicable withholding agent the required certification as to its non-U.S. status, such as by providing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E or IRS Form W-8ECI, as applicable, or the Non-U.S. Holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Dividends paid with respect to the Company Ordinary Shares and proceeds from the sale of other disposition of the Company Ordinary Shares received in the U.S. by a Non-U.S. Holder through certain U.S.-related financial intermediaries may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless such Non-U.S. Holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or complies with certain certification procedures described above, and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules.\n\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against the taxpayer’s U.S. federal income tax liability, and a taxpayer may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.\n\n**THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX ANALYSIS SET FORTH ABOVE IS INCLUDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE TO YOU DEPENDING UPON YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION.

Documents on Display\n\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting and other informational requirements of the Exchange Act. Under the Exchange Act, we are required to file reports and other information with the SEC. Specifically, we are required to file annually a Form 20-F within four months after the end of each fiscal year. Copies of reports and other information, when so filed, may be inspected without charge and may be obtained at prescribed rates at the public reference facilities maintained by the SEC at Judiciary Plaza, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information regarding the Washington, D.C. Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains a web site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding registrants that make electronic filings with the SEC using its EDGAR system. As a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules of the Exchange Act prescribing, among other things, the furnishing and content of proxy statements to shareholders, and our executive officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and short-swing profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act.\n\nWe also maintain a corporate website at https://www.forafric.com.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**\n\n**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**\n\nThe Company’s functional currency is the Moroccan dirham (“MAD”), and its presentation currency is the United States Dollar (“USD”). Our global operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets. Our primary foreign currency exposures are the Moroccan Dirham, US Dollar and Euro. To reduce the risk arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, we may enter into derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts, swaps, and options. The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the related currency exposures. Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Moroccan Dirham to the U.S. dollar and Euro. Substantial changes in the exchange rate could have a material effect on our clients, our business and our profitability. From the beginning of 2023, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n76  \n---  \n  \n**_Credit Risk_**\n\nThrough our normal business activities, we are subject to significant credit and counterparty risks that arise through commercial sales and purchases. We define credit and counterparty risk as a potential financial loss due to the failure of a counterparty to honor its obligations. The exposure is measured based upon several factors, including unpaid accounts receivable from counterparties. Credit and counterparty risk also includes sovereign credit risk. We actively monitor credit and counterparty risk through a regular review of exposures and credit analysis by regional credit teams, as well as a review by corporate committees that monitor counterparty performance. We record provisions for counterparty losses from time to time as a result of our credit and counterparty analysis.\n\nDuring periods of tight conditions in global credit markets, downturns in regional or global economic conditions, and/or significant price volatility, credit and counterparty risks are heightened. This increased risk is monitored through, among other things, exposure reporting, increased communication with key counterparties, management reviews, and specific focus on counterparties or groups of counterparties that we may determine as high risk.\n\n**_Commodities Risk_**\n\nWe operate in many areas of the food industry, from agricultural raw materials to the production and sale of branded food products. As a result, we purchase and produce various materials, many of which are agricultural commodities, including: Flour, Semolina, Pasta and Couscous\n\nAgricultural commodities are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of unpredictable factors that may create price risk.\n\n**_Interest Rate Risk_**\n\nInflationary factors generally affect us by increasing our labor and overhead costs, as well as costs related to those items associated with certain risks identified above, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We have historically been able to recover the impacts of inflation through sales price increases, however we cannot reasonably estimate our ability to successfully recover any impact of inflation through price increases in the future. Our inability to do so could harm our results of operations and financial position.\n\n**_Inflation Risk_**\n\nIn recent years, inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations.\n\n**Item 12.

Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of December 31, 2023, were effective.\n\n**(b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) as of December 31, 2023. Based on that evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. As all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\n\n**(c) Attestation Report of the Company’s Registered Public Accounting Firm**\n\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for emerging growth companies.\n\n**(d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this annual report on Form 20-F that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n**Item 16.

CHANGE IN REGISTRANT’S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT**\n\nOn June 9, 2022, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Globis dismissed Marcum LLP (“Marcum”), who served as Globis’ independent registered public accounting firm prior to the Business Combination, and approved the engagement of UHY LLP (“UHY”) as New Forafric’s independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. UHY had previously served as the independent registered public accounting firm for FAHL, which was acquired by New Forafric on June 9, 2022.\n\nMarcum’s report on Globis’ financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from August 21, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2020 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were such reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the period of Marcum’s engagement by the Company, there were no disagreements with Marcum on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of Marcum, would have caused it to make a reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports covering such periods. In addition, no “reportable events,” as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, occurred within the period of Marcum’s engagement and subsequent interim period preceding Marcum’s dismissal.\n\n79  \n---  \n  \nDuring the period from August 21, 2020 (inception) through December 31, 2021, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted UHY regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Globis’ financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to the Company or oral advice was provided that UHY concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing, or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was the subject of a disagreement (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) or a “reportable event,” as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.\n\n**Item 16G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE**\n\nUnder the Companies Act, all companies incorporated under the laws of Gibraltar, including companies whose shares whose shares are publicly traded and listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, are required to comply with various corporate governance requirements under Gibraltar law and the Articles of Association of such company. The requirements relate to such matters as the composition of the board of directors, the convening of board and shareholder meetings, proceedings at the same, and the issuance of shares. These requirements are in addition to the corporate governance requirements imposed by the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and other applicable provisions of U.S. securities laws to which we are subject as a foreign private issuer due to the listing of our ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Market.\n\nCertain corporate governance practices in Gibraltar, which is our home country, differ significantly from requirements for companies incorporated in other jurisdictions such as the United States.\n\nAs a foreign private issuer whose securities are listed on the NASDAQ, we are permitted to follow certain home country corporate governance practices in lieu of the comparable requirements of the NASDAQ Rules pursuant to NASDAQ Rule 5615(a)(3), which provides for such exemption to compliance with the NASDAQ Rule 5600 Series, except for certain matters including (among others) the composition and responsibilities of the audit committee and the independence of its members within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the SEC.\n\nBy way of example, we have relied on this exemption in respect of the following:\n\n●  | **an exemption from the rule that a majority of our board of directors must be independent directors** : There is no requirement in the Companies Act that the board of directors of the Company must be comprised of Independent Directors as defined in Rule 5605(a)(2).   \n---|---  \n●  | **an exemption from the rule that director nominees must be selected or recommended solely by independent directors** : There is no such restriction in the Company’s Act or the Articles of Association of the Company. Therefore, director nominees do not have to be selected by or recommended solely by Independent Directors.   \n●  | **composition of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Remuneration Committee** : There is no requirement in the Companies Act that the members of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Remuneration Committee be Independent Directors. As such, even though not an Independent Director, James Lasry was appointed as a member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Remuneration Committee.   \n●  | **notice, quorum, all procedural requirements in respect of each EGM and the Company’s AGM** : As permitted, the Company has elected to follow the notice, quorum and procedural requirements in respect of each EGM and AGM stipulated in the Companies Act.   \n●  | **adoption of the ESOP** : There is no requirement in the Companies Act for a share scheme to require the approval of the shareholders. The ESOP was therefore adopted by the board of directors of the Company in accordance with home country practice and the Company’s Articles of Association.   \n●  | **Issuance of Shares** : Under the Companies Act, there is no restriction on the Company’s directors from allotting shares to the non-executive directors on the terms of the Directors Services Agreements, in accordance with the powers granted to them for 5 years under the Articles of Association.   \n  \n80  \n---  \n  \nTo the extent we choose to follow home country practice with respect to additional corporate governance matters, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they otherwise would under rules and regulations applicable to U.S. domestic issuers. As a result of all of the above, our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a company incorporated in the United States.\n\n**Item 16H. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURE**\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**Item 16I. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS**\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**ITEM 16J. INSIDER TRADING POLICIES**\n\nPursuant to applicable SEC transition guidance, the disclosure required by Item 16J will only be applicable to the Company from the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2024.\n\n**ITEM 16K. CYBERSECURITY**\n\nWe are developing a cybersecurity risk management program, consisting of cybersecurity policies, procedures, compliance and awareness programs to mitigate risk and to ensure compliance with security, availability and confidentiality trust principles. The aforementioned policies are substantially in place, but not yet committed to writing or formally approved. The cybersecurity process has been integrated into our overall risk management system and process, and is solely internally managed. Management is responsible for identifying risks that threaten achievement of the control activities stated in the management’s description of the services organizations systems. Management has implemented a process for identifying relevant risks that could affect the organization’s ability to provide secure and reliable service to its users. The risk assessment occurs annually, or as business needs change, and covers identification of risks that could act against the company’s objectives as well as specific risks related to a compromise to the security of data. See “Item 3.D — Risk Factors Risks Related to Data Security and Intellectual Property — Our business and operations would suffer in the event of IT system failures, cybersecurity attacks, data breaches, or vulnerabilities in our or our third-party vendors’ information security program or defenses.”\n\nThe level of each identified risk is determined by considering the impact of the risk itself and the likelihood of the risk materializing and high scoring risks are actioned upon. Risks are analyzed to determine whether the risk meets company risk acceptance criteria to be accepted or whether a mitigation plan will be applied. Mitigation plans include both the individual or department responsible for the plan and may include budget considerations.\n\nThe oversight of cybersecurity threats is undertaken by our Chief Information Officer, who holds over two decades of experience in information technology and the design and architecture of information systems, and is supported by management. Our audit committee is responsible for cybersecurity oversight and monitoring risk. Management informs the audit and investment committee of such risk by committee meetings.\n\nWe have not, to our knowledge, experienced any material IT system failures or any material cybersecurity attacks to date. See “Item 3.D — Risk Factors Risks Related to Data Security and Intellectual Property — Our business and operations would suffer in the event of IT system failures, cybersecurity attacks, data breaches, or vulnerabilities in our or our third-party vendors’ information security program or defenses.”\n\nAs of the date of this report, we are not aware of any material risks from cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\n\n81  \n---  \n  \n**Part III**\n\n**Item 17.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n**Basis for opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal controls over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal controls over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n/s/ UHY LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\n\nMelville, New York\n\nApril 30, 2024\n\nF-2  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n\n_(In thousands, except share and per share data)_\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nDecember 31,  \n2023 | 2022  \nASSETS  \nCurrent assets:  \nCash and cash equivalents | $| 24,021 | $| 24,827  \nAccounts receivable, net | 34,716 | 30,858  \nAmount due from related parties | 1,358 | 2,366  \nOther receivables | 17,115 | 41,958  \nInventories | 28,378 | 27,218  \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets | 15,654 | 16,345  \nTotal current assets | 121,242 | 143,572  \nProperty, plant, and equipment, net | 116,920 | 100,527  \nRight-of-use assets | 13,385 | 10,430  \nGoodwill | 48,488 | 45,898  \nIntangible assets, net | 4,648 | 3,723  \nOther assets, noncurrent | 4,767 | 3,014  \nTotal assets | $| 309,450 | $| 307,164  \nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY  \nCurrent liabilities:  \nLines of credit – working capital | $| 48,517 | $| 47,371  \nLines of credit – wheat inventories | 126,452 | 137,040  \nAccounts payable | 46,461 | 27,295  \nAccrued expenses | 18,115 | 18,974  \nContract liabilities | 1,272 | 540  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt | 10,471 | 5,417  \nContingent consideration liability | 1,326 | 1,260  \nOther liabilities, current | 645 | 284  \nTotal current liabilities | 253,259 | 238,181  \nLong-term debt | 11,841 | 9,828  \nLoan from related party | 1,486 | 1,801  \nDeferred tax liabilities, net | 10,982 | 12,399  \nOther liabilities | 2,676 | -

Forafric Global PLC and Subsidiaries (the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), formerly known as Forafric Agro Holdings Limited, through its subsidiaries is a market leader in the milling industry in Morocco, with a complete offering of flours and semolina, secondary processing products including pasta and couscous, rice, and starches.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, each of which is controlled, and is based on the financial position and results of operations of the Company as a standalone company. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated. Refer to Note 22 — Related Parties for further information regarding the Company’s related party transactions.\n\nOn June 9, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), Forafric Agro Holdings Limited (“FAHL”), consummated the previously announced business combination and related transactions pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, dated December 19, 2021 (“Business Combination Agreement”) which provides for the Business Combination (as defined below) between FAHL and Globis Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Globis”).\n\n_Description of the Business Combination_ - In accordance with the Business Combination Agreement, the consummation of the following series of separate transactions took place (collectively, the “Business Combination”): (i) Globis formed a new holding company, Globis NV Merger Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Globis Nevada”), which changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by transferring by way of a redomiciliation and domesticating as a Gibraltar private limited company known as “Forafric Global Limited” (the “Redomiciliation”) and, following the Redomiciliation, altered its authorized and issued share capital and thereafter re-registering as a Gibraltar public company limited by shares and changed its name to “Forafric Global PLC” (referred to herein as “New Forafric”); (ii) New Forafric formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Globis NV Merger 2 Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Merger Sub”); (iii) Globis merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving (the “Merger”); (iv) an agent was appointed to act on behalf of Globis stockholders such that, subject to and immediately following the completion of the Merger, the agent entered into a contribution and subscription agreement with New Forafric (the “Contribution Agreement”) pursuant to which the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Merger Sub issued pursuant to the Merger will be exchanged (the “Exchange”), on a one-for-one basis, for ordinary shares, nominal value $0.001 per share, of New Forafric (the “Ordinary Shares”); and (v) on June 9, 2022, New Forafric acquired 100% of the equity interests in FAHL from Lighthouse Capital Limited (“Seller”) and FAHL became a direct subsidiary of New Forafric.\n\n_Accounting Treatment_ - While the legal acquirer in the Business Combination is Globis, for financial accounting and reporting purposes under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), FAHL is the accounting acquirer with the Business Combination accounted for as a “reverse recapitalization.” A reverse recapitalization does not result in a new basis of accounting, and the financial statements of the combined entity represent the continuation of the financial statements of FAHL. Under this accounting method, Globis is treated as the “acquired” company and FAHL is the accounting acquirer, with the transaction treated as a recapitalization of FAHL. Globis’ assets, liabilities and results of operations were consolidated with FAHL beginning on the date of the Business Combination.\n\nF-7  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nExcept for certain derivative liabilities. the assets and liabilities of Globis were recognized at historical cost and were not material, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The derivative liabilities, which are related to forward share purchase agreements and contingent consideration, were recorded at fair value. The consolidated assets, liabilities, and results of operations of FAHL became the historical financial statements, and operations prior to the closing of the Business Combination presented for comparative purposes are those of FAHL. Pre-Combination shares of common stock were converted to shares of common stock of the combined company using the conversion ratio of 0.1713 and for comparative purposes, the shares and net loss per share of FAHL, prior to the Business Combination, have been retroactively restated using the conversion ratio.\n\n_Basis of Presentation_ - These consolidated financial statements reflect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\n**2.** **SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n_Use of Estimates _- The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to use judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, allowance for credit losses, valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, and measurement of income tax assets. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment, our estimates could be significantly different than future performance. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n_Principles of Consolidation _– The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all entities controlled by the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.\n\nControl exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits from its activities that could potentially be significant to the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered. The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\n_Cash Equivalents _- We consider temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\n\n_Accounts Receivable and Allowances for Credit Losses_ – We provide credit terms to customers in-line with industry standards, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical experience recorded. We analyze the aging of customer accounts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Customer balances are written off after all collection efforts are exhausted. Estimated product returns, which have not been material, are deducted from sales at the time of shipment.\n\n_Inventories _- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company’s inventory is valued using the weighted average cost method. The costs of finished goods inventories include raw materials, labor, and overhead costs.\n\n_Other Receivables_ – Other receivables include government subsidies for the production and sale of flour. The Moroccan government provides a fixed subsidy based on production and customer. Subsidies are paid by the Moroccan government twice a year based on sales of flour for the previous six months. The Company records the flour subsidies as a credit against the related costs that the subsidies were intended to offset in the same periods that the costs were incurred within the consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company received $99,453 and $38,364, respectively, in the aggregate of government subsidies for the production of affordable flour and relief from import tax on foreign sourced raw materials from the Moroccan government.\n\nF-8  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n_Property, Plant, and Equipment _- Property, plant, and equipment are stated at acquisition cost, plus capitalized interest on borrowings during the actual construction period of major capital projects. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\n\nAssets | Useful Lives  \n---|---  \nBuildings | 39 years  \nMachinery and equipment (technical installations) | 30-50 years  \nOther assets | 5-30 years  \n  \nBuilding improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets or the remaining useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful life or remaining lease term. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance, which do not improve or extend the life of the assets, are expensed as incurred.\n\nWe perform impairment tests when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment include deteriorations in operating cash flows, the anticipated sale or disposal of an asset group, and other significant changes in business conditions. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company’s assessment of recoverability of property, plant and equipment is performed on a reporting unit level. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of such asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of such asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.\n\n_Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets _- Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nAssets | Useful Lives  \n---|---  \nTrademarks | Indefinite  \nCustomer relationships | 20 years  \nPatents and licenses | 5-10 years  \nComputer software | 5-10 years  \nOther intangible assets | 3-10 years  \n  \nRecognized intangible assets, exclusive of goodwill, are amortized over the useful lives of the assets unless that life is determined to be indefinite. All of our intangible assets, exclusive of goodwill and trademarks, are finite lived. All amortization expense related to intangible assets is recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our annual impairment evaluation is conducted during our fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nIn accordance with the accounting standards, an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test, and if impaired, the associated assets must be written down to fair value.\n\nF-9  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nThe quantitative impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying value of its net assets, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge would be recorded to the Company’s operations, for the amount in which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. We determine fair values for each reporting unit using the market approach, when available and appropriate, the income approach, or a combination of both. The income approach involves forecasting projected financial information (such as revenue growth rates, profit margins, tax rates, and capital expenditures) and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market data. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.\n\n_Segment Reporting - _The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments. Management has identified Soft Wheat, Durum Wheat, and Couscous and Pasta as separate operating segments. Refer to Note 21 for further information regarding the Company’s segment information.\n\n_Advertising -_ The Company has elected to expense all advertising costs as incurred. The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred and such expenses totaled $258, $19, and $536 for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n_Leases _- We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Our assessment is based on (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period and (3) whether we have the right to direct the use of the asset. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria are met: the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset or the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any one of these criteria. The lease classification affects the expense recognition in the income statement. Operating lease costs are recorded entirely in operating expenses. Finance lease costs are split, where amortization of the ROU asset is recorded in operating expenses and an implied interest component is recorded in interest expense.\n\n_Share-Based Compensation_ - Share-based awards principally comprise of stock options and cash-settled stock options, referred to as “phantom options”. Share-based awards are generally issued to certain senior management personnel. Share-based compensation cost (other than phantom options) is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. Our phantom options are accounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period with compensation expense being recognized over the requisite service period.\n\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of its stock options and phantom options, respectively, as well as the fair value at each reporting period for liability classified awards. This model requires the Company to estimate the expected volatility and the expected term of the stock options, which are highly complex and subjective variables. The Company uses an expected volatility of its stock price during the expected life of the options that is based on the historical performance of the Company’s stock price as well as including an estimate using similar companies. The expected term is computed using the simplified method as the Company’s best estimate given its lack of actual exercise history. The Company has selected a risk-free rate based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity equivalent to the expected exercise term of the stock option. The inputs to the valuation of phantom options are observable in the market, and as such are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company accounts for forfeitures of share-based awards as the occur.\n\nF-10  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n_Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions – _The Company accounts for acquisitions that qualify as business combinations by applying the acquisition method according to Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”). Transaction costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred and excluded from the fair value of consideration transferred. The identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity are recognized and measured at their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair values of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in an acquired entity, net of the fair value of any previously held interest in the acquired entity, is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions.\n\nThe Company evaluates acquisitions of assets and other similar transactions to assess whether the transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition by first applying a screen test to determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If so, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If not, further determination is required as to whether the Company has acquired inputs and processes that can create outputs that would meet the definition of a business. When applying the screen test, significant judgment is required to determine whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets. Accounting for asset acquisitions falls under the guidance of Topic 805, Business Combinations, specifically Subtopic 805-50. A cost accumulation model is used to determine an asset acquisition’s cost. Assets acquired are based on their cost, generally allocated to them on a relative fair value basis. Direct acquisition-related costs are included in the cost of the acquired assets.\n\n_Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions_ - The Company’s reporting currency is the US dollar (“USD”). The functional currency of the Company’s operating subsidiaries is generally the same as the corresponding local currency. Assets and liabilities of the operating subsidiaries are translated at the spot rate in effect at the applicable reporting date. Revenues and expenses of the operating subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the applicable period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is reflected as a separate component of Stockholders’ equity. The functional currency is translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts using currency exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted-average exchange rate during the fiscal year. The transactions in foreign currency (that is a different currency than the functional currency of the entity) are converted at the exchange rate prevailing to the date of the transaction. The assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are evaluated in the current period on the date of the closing or at the opening rate, when applicable. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of equity in “Accumulated other comprehensive income”. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and intercompany debt that is not of a long-term investment nature are included in (Gain) loss on foreign currency exchange in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\n_Credit Risk_ – Financial instruments potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. At times during the periods presented, the Company had funds in excess of Deposit Insurance programs in Morocco, on deposit at various financial institutions. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held.\n\n_Revenue Recognition – _The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The majority of the Company’s contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less. The Company applies the practical expedient in AASC paragraph 10-50-14 of ASC Topic 606, _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_ and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. Trade discounts or volume rebates are recognized as a deduction in revenue. No payment terms beyond one year are granted at contract inception.\n\nRevenue related to the sale of goods is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue from these contracts at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer, generally when legal title and risks and rewards transfer to the customer. Sales terms typically provide for transfer of title at the time and point of delivery and acceptance of the product being sold.\n\nF-11  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nAmounts received from customers prior to revenue recognition on a contract are recorded as contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nAmounts paid to suppliers prior to purchase recognition are recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n_Shipping and Handling Costs_ – Shipping and handling costs related to contracts with customers for the sale of goods are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and are included in cost of sales. Accordingly, amounts billed to customers for such costs are included as a component of revenues.\n\n_Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities_ – The Company does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers, in the measurement of transactions prices or as a component of revenues and cost of sales.\n\n_Transaction Costs _- The Company incurred significant costs direct and incremental to the Business Combination and therefore to the recapitalization of the Company. Direct transaction costs were allocated between equity and liability instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis that were newly issued in the recapitalization.\n\n_Income Taxes_ – The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable in Morocco and local jurisdictions, and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period. We account for uncertain tax positions using a “more-likely-than-not” threshold. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position, or the statute of limitations concerning such issues lapses.\n\n_Accounting for Warrants _– The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the instruments’ specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (“ASC 480”) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The assessment considers whether the instruments are free standing financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the instruments all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the instruments are indexed to the Company’s own ordinary shares and whether the instrument holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent period end date while the instruments are outstanding. Management has concluded that the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants issued pursuant to the Business Combination qualify for equity accounting treatment. For further detail on the Company’s Warrants (Public and Private), refer to Note 17 - Stockholders’ Equity.\n\n_Foreign Currency Forward Contracts_ –The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of its business, which the Company at times manages through the use of foreign currency forward contracts. The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts and accounts for these instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The Company’s foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815; accordingly, changes in the fair value are recorded in current period earnings. For more information, refer to Note 13 - Foreign currency forward contracts.\n\n_Fair Value Measurements _– The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period. The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).\n\nF-12  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nThe following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used to value the assets and liabilities:\n\n- | Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  \n---|---  \n- | Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.  \n- | Level 3: Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  \n  \nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash equivalents, accounts receivable from customers, other receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, all of which are typically short-term in nature. The Company believes that the carrying amounts of these financial instruments reasonably approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.\n\nThe Company measures the derivative liability and asset related to foreign currency forward contracts at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Note 13 – Foreign currency forward contracts.\n\nThe Company measures the contingent consideration liability at fair value on a recurring basis on each reporting date. Refer to Note 14 — Contingent Consideration Liability for further information.\n\n_Non-Controlling Interests_ – Non-controlling interests on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss represent the portion of a majority-owned subsidiary’s net income or loss that is attributed by non-controlling stockholders. Non-controlling interests on the consolidated balance sheets represent the portion of equity in a consolidated subsidiary owned by non-controlling stockholders.\n\n_Emerging Growth Company Status – _the Company is an emerging growth company (“EGC”), as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, EGCs can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period. In providing this relief, the JOBS Act does not preclude the Company from adopting a new or revised accounting standard earlier than the time that such standard applies to private companies. The Company will continue to use this relief until the earlier of the date that it (a) is no longer an emerging growth company or (b) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act.\n\n_Reclassifications _– Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\n\n_Liquidity and going concern_ - The Company believes that cash on hand, as well as cash from operations and proceeds from extended credit lines will provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. This projection is based on the Company’s current expectations regarding product sales, cost structure, cash burn rate and other operating assumptions.\n\n**3.** **RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS**\n\nOther than as described below, no new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year has had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. All public entities will be required to report segment information in accordance with the new guidance starting in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company is determining the impact of the ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nF-13  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by requiring; (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. For public business entities, the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is determining the impact of the ASU 2023-09 on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n**4.** **LEASES**\n\nThe Company has operating leases for real estate and vehicles. The Company has finance leases for equipment and construction land space. Leases are classified as finance leases because ownership of the underlying assets transfers at the end the lease term. Remaining lease terms for these leases range from less than one year to six years.\n\nThe Company does not record leases with a term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet.\n\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION\n\nBalance Sheet | December 31,  \n---|---  \nClassification | 2023 | 2022  \n(in thousands)  \nAssets  \nOperating leases | Right-of-use assets | $| 3,377 | $| 1,816  \nFinance leases | Right-of-use assets | 10,008 | 8,614  \nTotal assets | $| 13,385 | $| 10,430  \nLiabilities  \nCurrent liabilities  \nOperating leases | Current portion of long-term debt | $| 625 | $| 621  \nFinance leases | Current portion of long-term debt | 1,009 | 1,380  \nTotal current liabilities | 1,634 | 2,001  \nNoncurrent liabilities  \nOperating leases | Long-term debt | 2,191 | 665  \nFinance leases | Long-term debt | 642 | 235  \nTotal noncurrent liabilities | 2,833 | 900  \nTotal liabilities | $| 4,467 | $| 2,901  \n  \nRight-of-use assets and their corresponding lease liabilities are measured and recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date.\n\n_Discount Rates_\n\nFor the majority of its leases, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease. For leases without an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments for those leases.\n\nThe weighted-average discount rates for the Company’s leases were as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF WEIGHTED AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATES OF LEASES\n\nDecember 31,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022  \nOperating leases | 5.0| % | 5.0| %  \nFinance leases | 7.0| % | 6.1| %  \n  \nF-14  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n_Lease Payments_\n\nThe Company includes lease payments under options to extend or terminate the lease in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise such options. Fixed lease costs represent the explicitly quantified lease payments prescribed by the lease agreement and are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability.\n\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term of the Company’s leases were as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING LEASE TERM\n\n**December 31,**  \n---  \n2023 | 2022

The WC Lines of Credit provide the Company with the ability to borrow funds under consolidated lines of credit of up to approximately $50,000. Interest rates range from 5.6% to 7.5%. The WC Lines of Credit renew automatically on an annual basis. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are borrowers under the WC Lines of Credit, and their obligations are cross guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries.\n\nF-18  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n_Lines of Credit – wheat inventories_\n\nThe Company has entered into credit agreements with several financial institutions for asset-based credit facilities in order to fund wheat raw material purchases (“Wheat Credit Facilities”).

The loan issuance costs and premiums, if any, are determined at inception and are amortized over the useful life of the loan via the effective interest rate.\n\n_Term Loans_\n\nThe Company maintains term loans with several financial institutions (the “Term Loans”). The Term Loans are unsecured and have fixed monthly payments ranging from approximately $14 to $104. Interest on the Term Loans range from 5.5%-5.9% per annum.

From the beginning of 2023, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nWe do not utilize hedge accounting and as such value open foreign currency forward contracts at fair value with the change in unrealized gain or loss recorded in “Change in fair value of derivatives and contingent consideration” on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\n\nF-19  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nThe Company had 50 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2023, with a notional value of $14,100 and €40,200 ($36,400), respectively. All of these contracts will expire by December 31, 2024. These instruments are typically short term in duration.\n\nForeign currency forward contracts are marked-to-market based on the difference between the forward rate and the exchange rate as of the reporting period; thus, the Company measures the fair value of these contracts under a Level 2 input.\n\nThe foreign currency forward contract assets and liabilities totaled $430 and $337, respectively at December 31, 2023. These assets and liabilities are recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets, and other liabilities, current, respectively on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded a gain on foreign exchange forward contracts of $91 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n**14.** **CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY**\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company will pay to the Seller 20% of any cash proceeds received by Company before the five-year anniversary of the Closing resulting from the exercise of Company Warrants outstanding as of the Signing Date. \n\nThe contingent consideration liability is included in “Contingent consideration liability” on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the liability are included in “Change in fair value of derivatives and contingent consideration” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe Company utilized a probability weighted scenario-based model under a level 3 input to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration. Based on this valuation model, the Company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration to be $1,326 and $1,260 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The assumptions used in the analysis are inherently subjective; therefore, the ultimate amount of the liability may differ materially from the current estimate.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability are measures of the estimated payouts over a five-year period based on internally generated financial projections on a probability-weighted basis and a discount rate which was in a range of 4.49% to 5.47% with a weighted average of 4.94% As of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability:\n\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY\n\n(in thousands)  \n---  \nJune 9, 2022 | $| 1,308  \nChange in fair value | (48| )  \nDecember 31, 2022 | $| 1,260  \nChange in fair value | 66  \nDecember 31, 2023 | $| 1,326  \n  \n**15.** **INCOME TAXES**\n\nThe following table presents the components of the December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 provision for income taxes:\n\nSCHEDULE OF COMPONENTS OF PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX\n\n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---  \nDecember 31,  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nCurrent | $| 1,987 | $| 2,228 | $| 2,104  \nDeferred | (2,093| ) | (4,286| ) | (2,193| )  \nTotal income tax expense | $| (106| ) | $| (2,058| ) | $| (89| )  \n  \nF-20  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was 1%, 10%, and 1% for the year ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate was lower than the Moroccan statutory rate primarily due to unrecognized tax losses and the minimum contribution due to the Moroccan tax authorities levied on revenue and other specific income items.\n\nThe current tax expense corresponds to the amounts paid or pending of payment in short-term to the Moroccan tax authorities for the period, according to the Law and Regulations of Morocco. The Company’s filed tax returns from the 2019 through 2023 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities under the normal statute of limitations.\n\nAccording to tax legislation in Morocco, companies are taxed on the difference between their trading income and expenditure. Business expenses incurred in the operation of the business are generally deductible unless specifically excluded. The Moroccan 2023 Tax Code enacted a tax reform by fixing two target rates as follows:\n\n- | 20% for companies with a net tax income lower than MAD 100 million.  \n---|---  \n- | 35% for companies with a net tax income equal to or higher than MAD 100 million.  \n  \nAll the group’s entities in Morocco will be progressively subject to the 20% income tax rate.\n\nCompanies in Mali and Burkina are subject to an income tax of 30% and 27.5% respectively.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of income tax expense computed at the Moroccan statutory tax rate to the income tax benefit reported in the consolidated statements of operations:\n\nSCHEDULE OF RECONCILIATION OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE\n\n2022 | 2021 | 2020  \n---|---|---  \nDecember 31,  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nNet loss | $| (12,508| ) | $| (19,170| ) | $| (7,784| )  \nIncome tax expense for the period | (106| ) | (2,058| ) | (89| )  \nIncome (loss) before tax | (12,614| ) | (21,228| ) | (7,873| )  \nEffective tax rate | 1| % | 10| % | 1| %  \nPermanent differences not deductible (taxable) for tax purposes | 3,942 | (1,799| ) | (971| )  \nUnrecognized tax losses | 695 | 6,322 | 3,323  \nChange in the valuation allowance | (2,221| ) | - | -  \nRecalculated tax expense | $| (2,523| ) | $| (6,581| ) | $| (2,441| )  \nStatutory tax rate in Morocco | 20| % | 31| % | 31| %  \n  \nThe tax effects of temporary differences giving rise to deferred income tax assets (liabilities) were:\n\nSCHEDULE OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nDecember 31,  \n2023 | 2022  \n(in thousands)  \nFixed assets and intangible assets | (10,810| ) | (10,292| )  \nLoss carryforward | 7,446 | 12,021  \nLeases | (2,344| ) | (2,078| )  \nOthers | (102| ) | (29| )  \nLess: valuation allowance | (5,172| ) | (12,021| )  \nDeferred tax liabilities, net | $| (10,982| ) | $| (12,399| )  \n  \nF-21  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company has $37,228 and $48,684, respectively, as cumulative net operating losses of which $23,546 and $36,663 that begin to expire within four years, respectively.\n\nIn assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized. The Company considers the level of historical taxable income, scheduled reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted. \n\nThe Company maintains a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets that may not be realizable in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reassessed its deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the valuation allowance, in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” \n\nAs a result of this assessment, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of the previously established valuation allowance is no longer necessary. Therefore, the Company released a portion of the valuation allowance, resulting in a decrease in income tax expense of $2,221 for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nAs of each reporting date, we consider existing evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. Following the release of the aforementioned valuation allowance, we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the benefit for certain net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we continue to provide a partial valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to these carryforwards in the amount of $5,172 as of December 31, 2023.\n\n**16.** **VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND ACQUISITIONS**\n\n**_Asset acquisitions_**\n\nOn July 26, 2023, Forafric acquired 90% of Société Industrielle de Minoterie du Sud (“SIMS”), a soft wheat milling company with primary operations in Marrakesh, for cash consideration and noncontrolling interest in the amount of approximately $56 and the assumption of SIMS' outstanding debts in the amount of approximately $5,318.\n\nThe transaction met the screen test and was accounted for as an acquisition of assets under U.S. GAAP.

The valuation for each of these intangible assets was based on estimated projections of expected cash flows to be generated by the assets, discounted to the present value at discount rates commensurate with perceived risk. The valuation assumptions take into consideration the Company’s estimates of customer attrition and revenue growth projections. The Company is amortizing the identifiable intangible assets arising from the Sanabil SA acquisition in relation to the expected cash flows from the individual intangible assets over their respective useful lives, which have a weighted average life of 20 years.

The Company’s weighted average number of shares outstanding used in calculating earnings per share are 26,879,159 and 26,604,710 and 20,555,595 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Because there was no activity to cause dilution in the weighted average ordinary shares, basic and diluted earnings per share are disclosed together in each of the reporting periods.\n\nThe computation of diluted loss per share excludes the effect of earnout and option shares and warrants to purchase the Company’s shares because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\n\n**20.** **COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\nSince February 2022, the quantity of soft wheat available on the international market has decreased by 35% due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, causing the price of raw materials to increase. Despite this situation, we have not had any shortages on raw materials, and do not project to have any issuing fulfilling future orders. We have no firm and irrevocable commitments that will be affected by the war in Ukraine, and we will continue to assess the impact the war may have on our business. \n\nThe Company entered into a five-year supply agreement with Millcorp Geneva SA (“Millcorp”), pursuant to which the Company is obligated to obtain at least 80% of the Company’s annual requirements of common wheat, durum wheat, or any other cereal, from Millcorp. The agreement expired on March 31, 2023 and was subsequently amended to extend through March 2026. Millcorp is currently providing 100% of the Company’s imported grain needs. The purchases incurred were $147,284, $207,188, and $141,565 for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe Company has commitments with banks to finance its operating activities. The Company has provided collateral and mortgages to banks of $25,464 As of December 31, 2023.\n\nFrom time to time the Company is involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. These matters may relate to employment and labor claims, patent and intellectual property claims, claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations. When applicable, the Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Defense costs are expensed as incurred and are included in professional fees. While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management, individually or in the aggregate, no such lawsuits and other proceedings had or are expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2023.\n\n**21.** **SEGMENT INFORMATION**\n\nThe Company manages operations on a company-wide basis, thereby making determinations as to the allocation of resources in total rather than on a segment-level basis. The Company has designated reportable segments based on how management views its business. The Company does not segregate assets between segments for internal reporting. Therefore, asset-related information has not been presented. The reportable segments, as presented below, are consistent with the way the Company reports its results to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”).\n\nThe principal products that comprise each segment are as follows:\n\n_Soft Wheat_ – The Soft Wheat segment includes the production and sale of soft wheat yielding flour that is used to make desserts and sauces.\n\n_Durum Wheat_ - The Durum Wheat segment includes the production and sale of hard wheat yielding flour that is used to make pasta.\n\n_Couscous and Pasta_ – The Couscous and Pasta segment includes the secondary processing of products including couscous and pasta sold to end customers.\n\nThe “all other” category includes activities and items not allocated to reportable segments, such as non-operating entities, non-significant activities and centrally incurred corporate overhead expenses.\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on sales and operating income. Operating income (loss) is defined as gross profit less sales & marketing costs, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses, and other operating expenses. The amounts in the following tables are obtained from reports used by senior management and do not include income taxes.\n\nF-28  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nFinancial information relating to the Company’s reportable segments is as follows:\n\nSCHEDULE OF COMPANY REPORTABLE SEGMENTS\n\n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n---|---|---  \nDecember 31,  \n2023 | 2022 | 2021  \n(in thousands)  \nSales to external customers:  \nSoft Wheat | $| 218,761 | $| 213,775 | $| 173,085  \nDurum Wheat | 51,755 | 44,447 | 53,546  \nCouscous & Pasta | 31,410 | 27,159 | 28,819  \nAll other | 3,550 | 4,391 | 6,229  \nTotal | $| 305,476 | $| 289,772 | $| 261,679  \nOperating income (loss)  \nSoft Wheat | $| 2,288 | $| 8,957 | $| 1,233  \nDurum Wheat | 327 | (4,508| ) | 600  \nCouscous & Pasta | 1,666 | (1,924| ) | 1,734  \nAll other | (3,148| ) | (3,947| ) | (181| )  \nOperating income (loss) | $| 1,133 | $| (1,422| ) | $| 3,386  \n  \n_Geographic Information_ — The Company had net sales from customers outside of Morocco of approximately 12.7% (8.5% in Mali, 2.2% in Burkina and 2.0% in other countries) and 10.9% of total consolidated net sales from operations for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

A Financial Reporting Measure need not be presented within the Company’s financial statements or included in a Company filing with the SEC.  \n---|---  \n(j)| “** _Incentive-Based Compensation_** ” shall have the meaning set forth in Section III below.  \n---|---  \n(k)| “** _Nasdaq_** ” shall mean The Nasdaq Stock Market.  \n---|---  \n(l)| “** _Nasdaq Effective Date_** ” shall mean October 2, 2023.  \n---|---  \n(m)| “** _Policy_** ” shall mean this Executive Officer Clawback Policy, as the same may be amended and/or restated from time to time.  \n---|---  \n  \n2  \n---  \n  \n(n)| “** _Received_** ” shall mean Incentive-Based Compensation received, or deemed to be received, in the Company’s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive-Based Compensation is attained, even if the payment or grant occurs after the fiscal period.  \n---|---  \n(o)| “** _Repayment Agreement_** ” shall have the meaning set forth in Section V below.  \n---|---  \n(p)| “** _Restatement Date_** ” shall mean the earlier of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board or the officers of the Company authorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (ii) the date that a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement.  \n---|---  \n(q)| “** _SARs_** ” shall mean stock appreciation rights.  \n---|---  \n(r)| “** _SEC_** ” shall mean the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  \n---|---  \n**III.**| **_Incentive-Based Compensation_**  \n---|---  \n  \n“Incentive-Based Compensation” shall mean any compensation that is granted, earned or vested wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.\n\nFor purposes of this Policy, specific examples of Incentive-Based Compensation include, but are not limited to:\n\n●| Non-equity incentive plan awards that are earned based, wholly or in part, based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal;  \n---|---  \n●| Bonuses paid from a “bonus pool,” the size of which is determined, wholly or in part, based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal;  \n●| Other cash awards based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal;  \n●| Restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units, stock options and SARs that are granted or become vested, wholly or in part, on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal; and  \n●| Proceeds received upon the sale of shares acquired through an incentive plan that were granted or vested based, wholly or in part, on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal.  \n  \nFor purposes of this Policy, Incentive-Based Compensation excludes:\n\n●| Any base salaries (except with respect to any salary increases earned, wholly or in part, based on satisfaction of a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal);  \n---|---  \n●| Bonuses paid solely at the discretion of the Committee or Board that are not paid from a “bonus pool” that is determined by satisfying a Financial Reporting Measure performance goal;  \n●| Bonuses paid solely upon satisfying one or more subjective standards and/or completion of a specified employment period;  \n●| Non-equity incentive plan awards earned solely upon satisfying one or more strategic measures or operational measures; and  \n●| Equity awards that vest solely based on the passage of time and/or satisfaction of one or more non-Financial Reporting Measures.  \n  \n3  \n---  \n  \n**IV.**| **_Determination and Calculation of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation_**  \n---|---  \n  \nIn the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Committee shall promptly determine the amount of any Erroneously-Awarded Compensation for each Executive Officer in connection with such Accounting Restatement and shall promptly thereafter provide each Executive Officer with a written notice containing the amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment, forfeiture or return thereof, as applicable.\n\n(a)| **_Cash Awards_**. With respect to cash awards, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the difference between the amount of the cash award (whether payable as a lump sum or over time) that was Received and the amount that should have been Received applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure.  \n---|---  \n(b)| **_Cash Awards Paid From Bonus Pools_**. With respect to cash awards paid from bonus pools, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the pro rata portion of any deficiency that results from the aggregate bonus pool that is reduced based on applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure.  \n---|---  \n(c)| **_Equity Awards_**. With respect to equity awards, if the shares, options, SARs or other equity awards are still held at the time of recovery, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the number of such securities Received in excess of the number that should have been received applying the restated Financial Reporting Measure (or the value in excess of that number). If the options, SARs or other equity awards have been exercised, vested, settled or otherwise converted into underlying shares, but the underlying shares have not been sold, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the number of shares underlying the excess options or SARs (or the value thereof). If the underlying shares have already been sold, the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is the higher of the value of the stock upon vesting, exercise or sale.  \n---|---  \n(d)| **_Compensation Based on Stock Price or Total Shareholder Return_**. For Incentive-Based Compensation based on (or derived from) stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable Accounting Restatement, the amount shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return upon which the Incentive-Based Compensation was Received (in which case, the Committee shall maintain documentation of such determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to Nasdaq in accordance with applicable listing standards).  \n---|---  \n**V.**| **_Recovery of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation_**  \n---|---  \n  \nOnce the Committee has determined the amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation recoverable from the applicable Covered Person, the Committee shall take all necessary actions to recover the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Committee shall pursue the recovery of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in accordance with the below:\n\n(a)| **_Cash Awards_**. With respect to cash awards, the Committee shall either (i) require the Covered Person to repay the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in a lump sum in cash (or such property as the Committee agrees to accept with a value equal to such Erroneously-Awarded Compensation) reasonably promptly following the Restatement Date or (ii) if approved by the Committee, offer to enter into a Repayment Agreement. If the Covered Person accepts such offer and signs the Repayment Agreement within a reasonable time as determined by the Committee, the Company shall countersign such Repayment Agreement.  \n---|---  \n(b)| **_Unvested Equity Awards_**. With respect to those equity awards that have not yet vested, the Committee shall take all necessary action to cancel, or otherwise cause to be forfeited, the awards in the amount of the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation.  \n---|---  \n  \n4  \n---  \n  \n(c)| **_Vested Equity Awards_**. With respect to those equity awards that have vested and the underlying shares have not been sold, the Committee shall take all necessary action to cause the Covered Person to deliver and surrender the underlying shares in the amount of the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn the event that the Covered Person has sold the underlying shares, the Committee shall either (i) require the Covered Person to repay the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in a lump sum in cash (or such property as the Committee agrees to accept with a value equal to such Erroneously-Awarded Compensation) reasonably promptly following the Restatement Date or (ii) if approved by the Committee, offer to enter into a Repayment Agreement. If the Covered Person accepts such offer and signs the Repayment Agreement within a reasonable time as determined by the Committee, the Company shall countersign such Repayment Agreement.\n\n(d)| **_Repayment Agreement_**. “Repayment Agreement” shall mean an agreement (in a form reasonably acceptable to the Committee) with the Covered Person for the repayment of the Erroneously-Awarded Compensation as promptly as possible without unreasonable economic hardship to the Covered Person.  \n---|---  \n(e)| **_Effect of Non-Repayment_**. To the extent that a Covered Person fails to repay all Erroneously-Awarded Compensation to the Company when due (as determined in accordance with this Policy), the Company shall, or shall cause one or more other members of the Company to, take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such Erroneously-Awarded Compensation from the applicable Covered Person. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its discretion, the applicable Covered Person shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Committee shall have broad discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovery of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation based on all applicable facts and circumstances and taking into account the time value of money and the cost to shareholders of delaying recovery. However, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of a Covered Person’s obligations hereunder.\n\n**VI.**| **_Discretionary Recovery_**  \n---|---  \n  \nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take action to recover Erroneously-Awarded Compensation if any one of the following conditions are met and the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable:\n\n(i)| The direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy against a Covered Person would exceed the amount to be recovered, after the Company has made a reasonable attempt to recover the applicable Erroneously-Awarded Compensation, documented such attempts and provided such documentation to Nasdaq;  \n---|---  \n(ii)| Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, provided that, before determining that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company has obtained an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to Nasdaq; or  \n---|---  \n  \n5  \n---  \n  \n(iii)| Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.  \n---|---  \n**VII.**| **_Reporting and Disclosure Requirements_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the federal securities laws, including the disclosure required by the applicable filings required to be made with the SEC.\n\n**VIII.**| **_Effective Date_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThis Policy shall apply to any Incentive-Based Compensation Received on or after the Nasdaq Effective Date.\n\n**IX.**| **_No Indemnification_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company shall not indemnify any Covered Person against the loss of Erroneously-Awarded Compensation and shall not pay, or reimburse any Covered Persons for premiums, for any insurance policy to fund such Covered Person’s potential recovery obligations.\n\n**X.**| **_Administration_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Committee has the sole discretion to administer this Policy and ensure compliance with Nasdaq Rules and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq promulgated or issued in connection therewith. Actions of the Committee pursuant to this Policy shall be taken by the vote of a majority of its members. The Committee shall, subject to the provisions of this Policy, make such determinations and interpretations and take such actions as it deems necessary, appropriate or advisable. All determinations and interpretations made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive.\n\n**XI.**| **_Amendment; Termination_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary, including as and when it determines that it is legally required by any federal securities laws, SEC rule or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company’s securities are then listed. The Committee may terminate this Policy at any time. Notwithstanding anything in this Section XI to the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the Company contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule, or the rules of any national securities exchange or national securities association on which the Company’s securities are then listed.\n\n**XII.**| **_Other Recoupment Rights; No Additional Payments_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Committee intends that this Policy will be applied to the fullest extent of the law. The Committee may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement or any other agreement entered into on or after the Adoption Date shall, as a condition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require a Covered Person to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy. Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights under applicable law, regulation or rule or pursuant to any similar policy in any employment agreement, equity plan, compensation policy, equity award agreement or similar arrangement and any other legal remedies available to the Company. However, this Policy shall not provide for recovery of Incentive-Based Compensation that the Company has already recovered pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or other recovery obligations.\n\n**XIII.**| **_Successors_**  \n---|---  \n  \nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Covered Persons and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal representatives.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \n**Exhibit A**\n\n**ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT**\n\n**TO THE**\n\n**EXECUTIVE OFFICER CLAWBACK POLICY**\n\n**OF**\n\n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC**\n\nBy signing below, the undersigned acknowledges and confirms that the undersigned has received and reviewed a copy of Forafric Global PLC Executive Officer Clawback Policy (the “Policy”).

NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION**\n\n_Nature of Operations_ - Forafric Global PLC and Subsidiaries (the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), formerly known as Forafric Agro Holdings Limited, through its subsidiaries is a market leader in the milling industry in Morocco, with a complete offering of flours and semolina, secondary processing products including pasta and couscous, rice, and starches (“Milling Business”).\n\nThese condensed consolidated financial statements are the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, each of which is controlled, and is based on the financial position and results of operations of the Company as a standalone company. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated. Refer to Note 21 — Related Parties for further information regarding the Company’s related party transactions.\n\nOn June 9, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), Forafric Agro Holdings Limited (“FAHL”), consummated the previously announced business combination and related transactions pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, dated December 19, 2021 (“Business Combination Agreement”) which provides for the Business Combination (as defined below) between FAHL and Globis Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Globis”).\n\n_Description of the Business Combination_ - In accordance with the Business Combination Agreement, the consummation of the following series of separate transactions took place (collectively, the “Business Combination”): (i) Globis formed a new holding company, Globis NV Merger Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Globis Nevada”), which changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by transferring by way of a redomiciliation and domesticating as a Gibraltar private limited company known as “Forafric Global Limited” (the “Redomiciliation”) and, following the Redomiciliation, altered its authorized and issued share capital and thereafter re-registering as a Gibraltar public company limited by shares and changed its name to “Forafric Global PLC” (referred to herein as “New Forafric”); (ii) New Forafric formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Globis NV Merger 2 Corp., a Nevada corporation (“Merger Sub”); (iii) Globis merged with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving (the “Merger”); (iv) an agent was appointed to act on behalf of Globis stockholders such that, subject to and immediately following the completion of the Merger, the agent entered into a contribution and subscription agreement with New Forafric (the “Contribution Agreement”) pursuant to which the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Merger Sub issued pursuant to the Merger will be exchanged (the “Exchange”), on a one-for-one basis, for ordinary shares, nominal value $0.001 per share, of New Forafric (the “Ordinary Shares”); and (v) on June 9, 2022, New Forafric acquired 100% of the equity interests in FAHL from Lighthouse Capital Limited (“Seller”) and FAHL became a direct subsidiary of New Forafric.\n\n_Accounting Treatment_ - While the legal acquirer in the Business Combination is Globis, for financial accounting and reporting purposes under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), FAHL is the accounting acquirer with the Business Combination accounted for as a “reverse recapitalization.” A reverse recapitalization does not result in a new basis of accounting, and the financial statements of the combined entity represent the continuation of the financial statements of FAHL. Under this accounting method, Globis is treated as the “acquired” company and FAHL is the accounting acquirer, with the transaction treated as a recapitalization of FAHL. Globis’ assets, liabilities and results of operations were consolidated with FAHL beginning on the date of the Business Combination.\n\nExcept for certain derivative liabilities the assets and liabilities of Globis were recognized at historical cost and were not material, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. The derivative liabilities, which are related to forward share purchase agreements and contingent consideration, were recorded at fair value. The consolidated assets, liabilities, and results of operations of FAHL became the historical financial statements, and operations prior to the closing of the Business Combination presented for comparative purposes are those of FAHL. Pre-Combination shares of common stock were converted to shares of common stock of the combined company using the conversion ratio of 0.1713 and for comparative purposes, the shares and net loss per share of FAHL, prior to the Business Combination, have been retroactively restated using the conversion ratio.\n\n6  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n_Basis of Presentation_ - The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) which are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022. The results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. It is suggested that these Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022, has been derived from the Company’s audited Financial Statements.\n\n**2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n_Significant Accounting Policies_ – The significant accounting policies used in preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements were applied on a basis consistent with those reflected in our consolidated financial statements that are included in the annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022 that was filed with the SEC on May 1, 2023.\n\n_Use of Estimates_ - The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, allowance for credit losses, valuation assumptions of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, and measurement of income tax assets. Given the uncertainty of the global economic environment and the impact of COVID-19, our estimates could be significantly different than future performance. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n_Principles of Consolidation_ – The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all entities controlled by the Company after reflecting the Restructuring previously described.\n\nControl exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive the benefits from its activities that could potentially be significant to the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered. The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\n_Share-Based Compensation -_ Share-based awards principally comprise of stock options and cash-settled stock options, referred to as “phantom options”. Share-based awards are generally issued to certain senior management personnel. Share-based compensation cost (other than phantom options) is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. Our phantom options are accounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period with compensation expense being recognized over the requisite service period.\n\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of its stock options and phantom options, respectively, as well as the fair value at each reporting period for liability classified awards. This model requires the Company to estimate the expected volatility and the expected term of the stock options, which are highly complex and subjective variables. The Company uses an expected volatility of its stock price during the expected life of the options that is based on the historical performance of the Company’s stock price as well as including an estimate using similar companies. The expected term is computed using the simplified method as the Company’s best estimate given its lack of actual exercise history. The Company has selected a risk-free rate based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity equivalent to the expected exercise term of the stock option. The inputs to the valuation of phantom options are observable in the market, and as such are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company accounts for forfeitures of share-based awards as the occur.\n\n7  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n_Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions_ - The Company’s functional currency is the Moroccan dirham (“MAD”), and its presentation currency is the United States Dollar (“USD”). The functional currency is translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts using currency exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted-average exchange rate during the fiscal year. The transactions in foreign currency (that is a different currency than the functional currency of the entity) are converted at the exchange rate prevailing to the date of the transaction. The assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are evaluated in the current period on the date of the closing or at the opening rate, when applicable. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of equity in “Accumulated other comprehensive income”. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and intercompany debt that is not of a long-term investment nature are included in (Gain) loss on foreign currency exchange in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n\n_Credit Risk_ – Financial instruments potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. At times during the periods presented, the Company had funds in excess of Deposit Insurance programs in Morocco, on deposit at various financial institutions. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held.\n\n_Foreign currency forward contracts_ –The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of its business, which the Company at times manages through the use of foreign currency forward contracts. The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts and accounts for these instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The Company’s foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815; accordingly, changes in the fair value are recorded in current period earnings. For more information, refer to Note 13 - Foreign currency forward contracts.\n\n_Fair Value Measurements_ – The Company follows the guidance in accounting standards codification (“ASC”) 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period. The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities).\n\nThe following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used to value the assets and liabilities:\n\n-  | Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  \n---|---  \n-  | Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.  \n-  | Level 3: Unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  \n  \nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash equivalents, accounts receivable from customers, other receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, all of which are typically short-term in nature. The Company believes that the carrying amounts of these financial instruments reasonably approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.\n\nThe Company measures the derivative liability / asset related to foreign currency forward contracts at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Note 13 – Foreign currency forward contracts.\n\n8  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nThe Company measures the contingent consideration liability at fair value on a recurring basis beginning June 9, 2022 (the date of closing of the Business Combination) and December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Refer to Note 14 – Contingent Consideration Liability for further information.\n\n_Emerging Growth Company Status –_ the Company is an emerging growth company (“EGC”), as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”). Under the JOBS Act, EGCs can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued until such time as those standards apply to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period. In providing this relief, the JOBS Act does not preclude the Company from adopting a new or revised accounting standard earlier than the time that such standard applies to private companies. The Company will continue to use this relief until the earlier of the date that it (a) is no longer an emerging growth company or (b) affirmatively and irrevocably opts out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act.\n\n_Reclassifications_ – Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\n\n_Liquidity and going concern_ - We incurred losses and had an accumulated deficit of $111,300 and $102,678 on June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. Historically, the Company’s primary sources of liquidity have been cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations (when available), and cash flows from financing activities, including funding under credit agreements.\n\nThe Company believes that cash on hand, as well as cash from operations and proceeds from extended credit lines will provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least one year after the date the financial statements are issued. This projection is based on the Company’s current expectations regarding product sales, cost structure, cash burn rate and other operating assumptions.\n\n**3. RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS**\n\nNo accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the six months ended June 30, 2023 has had or is expected to have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n**4. LEASES**\n\nThe Company has operating leases for real estate and vehicles. The Company has finance leases for equipment and construction land space. Leases are classified as finance leases because ownership of the underlying assets transfers at the end the lease term. Remaining lease terms for these leases range from less than one year to six years.\n\nThe Company does not record leases with a term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet.\n\n9  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\n\nJune 30, | December 31,  \n---|---  \nBalance Sheet | 2023 | 2022  \nClassification | (in thousands)  \nAssets  \nOperating leases | Right-of-use assets | $| 3,036 | $| 1,816  \nFinance leases | Right-of-use assets | 9,149 | 8,614  \nTotal assets | $| 12,185 | $| 10,430  \nLiabilities  \nCurrent liabilities  \nOperating leases | Current portion of long-term debt | $| 1,507 | $| 621  \nFinance leases | Current portion of long-term debt | 642 | 1,380  \nTotal current liabilities | 2,149 | 2,001  \nNoncurrent liabilities  \nOperating leases | Long-term debt | 970 | 665  \nFinance leases | Long-term debt | 370 | 235  \nTotal noncurrent liabilities | 1,340 | 900  \nTotal liabilities | $| 3,489 | $| 2,901  \n  \nRight-of-use assets and their corresponding lease liabilities are measured and recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date.\n\n_Discount Rates_\n\nFor the majority of its leases, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease. For leases without an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments for those leases.\n\nThe weighted-average discount rates for the Company’s leases were as follows:\n\nJune 30, | December 31,  \n---|---  \n2023 | 2022  \nOperating leases | 5.0| % | 5.0| %  \nFinance leases  | 3.8| % | 6.1| %  \n  \n_Lease Payments_\n\nThe Company includes lease payments under options to extend or terminate the lease in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise such options. Fixed lease costs represent the explicitly quantified lease payments prescribed by the lease agreement and are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability.\n\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term of the Company’s leases were as follows:\n\nJune 30, | December 31,  \n---|---  \n2023 | 2022  \nOperating leases | 5.3 years | 6.4 years  \nFinance leases  | 0.8 years | 0.8 years  \n  \n10  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nThe components of lease expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n\nJune 30,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022  \n(in thousands)  \nOperating lease cost | $| 246 | $| 342  \nFinance lease cost:  \nAmortization of right-of-use assets | 242 | 214  \nInterest on lease liabilities | 36 | 157  \nTotal lease cost | $| 524 | $| 713  \n  \nAs of June 30, 2023, future maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\n\nOperating Leases | Finance Leases  \n---|---  \n(in thousands)  \nRemainder of 2023 | $| 344 | $| 681  \n2024 | 622 | 229  \n2025 | 495 | 103  \n2026 | 464 | 83  \n2027 | 447 | 65  \nThereafter | 428 | 19  \nTotal lease payments | 2,800 | 1,180  \nLess: Interest | (323| ) | (168| )  \nPresent value of lease liabilities | $| 2,477 | $| 1,012  \n  \n11  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nOther information related to leases for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n\nJune 30,  \n---  \n2023 | 2022  \n(in thousands)  \nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:  \nOperating cash flows used for operating leases | $| 246 | $| 342  \nOperating cash flows for finance leases | $| 242 | $| 214  \nFinancing cash flows for finance leases  | $| 36 | $| 157  \n  \n**5.

LINES OF CREDIT**\n\n_Lines of Credit – working capital_\n\nThe Company has entered into unsecured revolving credit agreements with several financial institutions to fund working capital requirements (“WC Lines of Credit”). The WC Lines of Credit provide the Company with the ability to borrow funds under consolidated lines of credit of up to approximately $51,000. Interest rates range from 5.6% to 7.5%. The WC Lines of Credit renew automatically on an annual basis. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are borrowers under the WC Lines of Credit, and their obligations are cross guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries.\n\n14  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\n_Lines of Credit – wheat inventories_\n\nThe Company has entered into credit agreements with several financial institutions for asset-based credit facilities in order to fund wheat raw material purchases (“Wheat Credit Facilities”). The Wheat Credit Facilities provide the ability to borrow funds under consolidated lines of credit of up to approximately $166,000, subject to certain borrowing base criteria. The Wheat Credit Facilities are secured by the Company’s inventory. Interest rates range from 1.4% to 7.5% per annum. The Wheat Credit Facilities must be renewed on a semi-annual basis. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are borrowers under the Wheat Credit Facilities, and their obligations are cross guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries.\n\n**12.

The loan issuance costs and premiums are determined at inception and are amortized over the useful life of the loan via the effective interest rate.\n\n_Term Loans_\n\nThe Company maintains term loans with several financial institutions (the “Term Loans”). The Term Loans are unsecured and have fixed monthly payments ranging from approximately $66 to $368. Interest on the Term Loans range from 5.5%-7.5% per annum. The Term Loans mature through 2034.\n\n_Lease Obligations_\n\nThe Company owes $3,489 and $2,901 related to its leases as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Lease obligations are payable in monthly installments of principal and interest and are collateralized by the related assets financed. Refer to Note 4 for additional information regarding the Company’s leases.\n\nThe scheduled maturities of outstanding debt as of June 30, 2023, are as follows:\n\n(in thousands)  \n---  \nRemainder of 2023 | $| 3,268  \n2024 | 3,831  \n2025 | 2,799  \n2026 | 2,331  \n2027 | 1,728  \nThereafter | 1,311  \nTotal outstanding debt | $| 15,268  \n  \n**13. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS**\n\nOur global operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets. From the beginning of 2023, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nWe do not utilize hedge accounting and as such value open foreign currency forward contracts at fair value with the change in unrealized gain or loss recorded in “Change in fair value of derivatives and contingent consideration” on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\n\n15  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nThe Company had 58 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of June 30, 2023, with a notional value of $31.6 million and €32.4 million ($35.2 million), respectively. All of these contracts will expire by December 31, 2023. These instruments are typically short term in duration and as such are presented within current liabilities.\n\nForeign currency forward contracts are marked-to-market based on the difference between the forward rate and the exchange rate as of the reporting period; thus, the Company measures the fair value of these contracts under a Level 2 input.\n\nThe foreign currency forward contract liabilities totaled $1,614 at June 30, 2023. The Company recorded a loss on foreign exchange forward contracts of $1,614 for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n**14. CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY**\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company will pay to the Seller 20% of any cash proceeds received by Company before the five-year anniversary of the Closing resulting from the exercise of Company Warrants outstanding as of the Signing Date.\n\nThe contingent consideration liability is included in “Contingent consideration liability” on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of the liability are included in “Change in fair value of derivatives and contingent consideration” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nThe Company utilized a probability weighted scenario-based model under level 3 to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration. Based on this valuation model, the Company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration to be $1,308 as of the Closing date and $1,268 as of June 30, 2023. The assumptions used in the analysis are inherently subjective; therefore, the ultimate amount of the liability may differ materially from the current estimate.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liability are measures of the estimated payouts over a five-year period based on internally generated financial projections on a probability-weighted basis and a discount rate which was in a range of 4.49% to 5.47% with a weighted average of 4.94% as of June 30, 2023.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability:\n\n(in thousands)  \n---  \nJune 9, 2022 | $| 1,308  \nChange in fair value | (48| )  \nDecember 31, 2022 | $| 1,260  \nChange in fair value | 8  \nJune 30, 2023 | $| 1,268  \n  \n**15. INCOME TAXES**\n\nThe following table presents the components of the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 provision for income taxes:\n\n2023 | 2022  \n---|---  \nCurrent | $| 522 | $| 1,366  \nDeferred | 124 | 239  \nTotal income tax (benefit) expense | $| 646 | $| 1,605  \n  \n16  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was -8% and -21% for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate was lower than the Moroccan statutory rate primarily due to unrecognized tax losses and the minimum contribution due to the Moroccan tax authorities levied on turnover and other specific revenue.\n\nDuring the six months ended as of June 30, 2023, and the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has $12,313 and $12,021, respectively, as net operating losses that begin to expire within four years.\n\nIn assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized. The Company considers the level of historical taxable income, scheduled reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted. The Company maintained a valuation allowance for all losses to be carried forward indefinitely.\n\n**16.

If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement.\n\n_Private Warrants_ - At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were 4,289,722 private warrants outstanding. Each private warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share.\n\n**_Stockholder Earn-Out Rights_**\n\nAs a part of the Business Combination consideration, the selling stockholder shall be entitled to receive, as additional consideration, and without any action on behalf of the Company or the Company’s stockholders, additional ordinary shares (the “Earnout Shares”), to be issued as follows during the period from and after the Closing until the end of calendar year 2024 (A) 500,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2022, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) of the Company is equal to or greater than $27 million, (B) 500,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA of the Company is equal to or greater than $33 million, and (C) 1,000,000 Earnout Shares, if, during calendar year 2024, the Buyer Trading Price (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) during the standard market trading hours of a trading day is greater than or equal to $16.50 for any 20 trading days within any period of 30 consecutive trading days.

The Earnout Shares are accounted for under ASC Topic 815-40, “Derivatives and Hedging”, pursuant to which the Earnout Shares are considered to be indexed to the Company’s own stock and therefore will be classified as equity instruments.\n\n**17. EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN**\n\nIn connection with the Business Combination, the Stockholders of the Company considered and approved the Forafric 2022 Long Term Employee Share Incentive Plan (the “Equity Incentive Plan”) which provides for the grant of awards, consisting of nominal cost options or phantom options to employees, directors and consultants of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The maximum number of shares which may be the subject of awards under the Equity Incentive Plan may not exceed 10% of the issued share capital of the Company from time to time and the maximum number of shares reserved and available for issuance shall not exceed 2,645,684. No award can be exercised after the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.

EARNINGS PER SHARE**\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the number of weighted average ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period. The Company’s weighted average number of shares outstanding used in calculating earnings per share are 26,879,114 and 21,566,289 for the periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Because there was no activity to cause dilution in the weighted average ordinary shares, basic and diluted earnings per share are disclosed together in each of the reporting periods.\n\nThe computation of diluted loss per share excludes the effect of earnout and option shares and warrants to purchase the Company’s shares because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\n\n**19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\nSince February 2022, the quantity of soft wheat available on the international market has decreased by 35% due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, causing the price of raw materials to increase. Despite this situation, we have not had any shortages on raw materials, and do not project to have any issuing fulfilling future orders. We have no firm and irrevocable commitments that will be affected by the war in Ukraine, and we will continue to assess the impact the war may have on our business.\n\nThe Company entered into a five-year supply agreement with Millcorp Geneva SA (“Millcorp”), pursuant to which the Company is obligated to obtain at least 80% of the Company’s annual requirements of common wheat, durum wheat, or any other cereal, from Millcorp. The agreement expired on March 31, 2023 and was subsequently amended to extend through March 2026. Millcorp is currently providing 100% of the Company’s imported grain needs. The purchases incurred were $97,641, $126,065, and $90,302 for the periods ended June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe Company has commitments with banks to finance its operating activities. The Company has provided collateral and mortgages to banks of $25,464 as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\n19  \n---  \n  \n**FORAFRIC GLOBAL PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)**\n\n**(Continued)**\n\nFrom time to time the Company is involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. These matters may relate to employment and labor claims, patent and intellectual property claims, claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations. When applicable, the Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Defense costs are expensed as incurred and are included in professional fees. While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management, individually or in the aggregate, no such lawsuits and other proceedings had or are expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements at June 30, 2023.\n\nDuring 2022, we incurred expenses and losses of $4,708 related to damages caused by the non-conforming quality of imported wheat. Our insurance policies provide coverage and reimbursement for expenses and costs that have been incurred relating to the damages and losses suffered. We are currently working closely with our claims adjusters to ascertain the amount of insurance recoveries due to us. Independent experts have confirmed the damages for the Company in presence of the insurance company. The amounts due to us are accounted as “Insurance recoveries” within current assets– Refer to the note 6, Prepaid expenses and other current assets.\n\n**20. SEGMENT INFORMATION**\n\nThe Company manages operations on a company-wide basis, thereby making determinations as to the allocation of resources in total rather than on a segment-level basis. The Company has designated reportable segments based on how management views its business. The Company does not segregate assets between segments for internal reporting. Therefore, asset-related information has not been presented. The reportable segments, as presented below, are consistent with the manner in which the Company reports its results to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”).\n\nThe principal products that comprise each segment are as follows:\n\n_Soft Wheat_ – The Soft Wheat segment includes the production and sale of soft wheat yielding flour that is used to make desserts and sauces.\n\n_Durum Wheat_ - The Durum Wheat segment includes the production and sale of hard wheat yielding flour that is used to make pasta.\n\n_Couscous and Pasta_ – The Couscous and Pasta segment includes the secondary processing of products including couscous and pasta sold to end customers.\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on sales and operating income. Operating income is defined as gross profit less sales & marketing costs, direct selling, general, and administrative expenses, and other operating expenses. The amounts in the following tables are obtained from reports used by senior management and do not include income taxes.

Unless otherwise specified herein, references to the “Company”, “FG”, “we” or “our” shall include Forafric Global PLC (NASDAQ: AFRI) and its subsidiaries. You should read the following discussion and analysis together with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as at June 30, 2023 and for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the accompanying notes thereto, included elsewhere in this report. For additional information relating to our management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations, please see our Annual Report on Form 20-F, which includes the consolidated audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on May 1, 2023. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and in the Registration Statement, particularly in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future._\n\n**Overview**\n\n**Key Factors Affecting Our Performance**\n\nThe key factors affecting the performance of our business, which are discussed in further detail below, are cost of raw materials, industrial costs and the average selling price of our product, which is based on the price of flour and bran.\n\nBran is between 20% to 25% of the production of finished products. We have no control over the price of these items.\n\nWe do not believe we have a significant impact on the price of our finished products.\n\n**The War in Ukraine**\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia launched an invasion in Ukraine. Thus far, the invasion has dramatically reduced the quantity of wheat available on the international market and may continue to disrupt or depress wheat harvests in Ukraine and Ukraine’s ability to export wheat. In addition, as a consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and other countries have imposed sanctions against and penalties for doing business in Russia and with certain Russian-owned businesses. These sanctions may limit Russia’s ability to export wheat. Because Ukraine accounts for approximately 10% of the world’s wheat exports and Russia accounts for approximately 16% of the world’s wheat exports, the continuation of the war between Ukraine and Russia could continue to negatively impact the availability of wheat on the international market, which could in turn affect our ability to obtain raw materials or result in substantial increases in prices of raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business.\n\nFG has not purchased, and has no contracts to purchase raw materials from either Ukraine or Russia in 2023. FG has also in recent years diversified its sources of supply, and purchases most of its raw materials from European countries, as well as Argentina and Brazil. The Company believes that as a result, it will have adequate sources of supply of raw materials for the remainder of the 2023 calendar year. Wheat prices have stopped rising in 2023 but remain very high. Soft wheat imports are still subsidized in Morocco and Durum prices remain upper 480 USD per ton versus 350 USD per ton in 2022. The Company has not determined at this time that there is a clear trend that prices will continue to increase in 2023. Moreover, because its products are staple food products, the Company believes it will be able to increase prices in other markets to offset currently anticipated changes in raw material and logistic costs in 2023.\n\nBecause the Company does not currently have any business operations in Russia and is not purchasing raw materials from suppliers in Russia in 2023, the sanctions regime imposed upon Russia does not currently directly impact the Company’s business.\n\n**Key Components of Results of Operations**\n\nNet sales, cost of goods sold and gross profit figures are calculated with the following method:\n\nNet sales: Total consolidated sales;\n\nCost of goods sold: includes cost of raw materials, cost of freight, cost of foreign exchange and cost of improvements used in the production; and\n\nGross profit: the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold.\n\nThe key components of our results of operation are:\n\n_Price of raw materials_ , which is affected by many factors, including global and regional supply, which in turn is impacted by factors such as weather conditions, local planting decisions, crop failure, reduced harvests, governmental policies (including both tariffs and subsidies), and other agricultural conditions, as well as local, regional, and international demand. The price of raw materials almost doubled in 2021, when compared to 2020 because of bad weather conditions in Europe and Canada and because of the War in Ukraine, which dramatically reduced the quantity of wheat available on the international market. In 2023, the price of Soft Wheat decreased but is still higher than in 2020 and the imports are still subsidized by the Moroccan Government. The cost of wheat is almost 90% of the total cost in our business and therefore fluctuations in the price of wheat has a direct impact on our performance. This cost can be heavily affected by geopolitical situations. The cost of raw material also depends on freight cost and currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n_Industrial cost_. The crushing cost is the second main factor affecting our performance. This cost includes equipment, labor and interest expense. To execute our business model, we have to maintain this cost below 30 USD per ton produced. To achieve this performance, we have to monitor energy, equipment usage, logistics, human resources and financial cost.\n\n● | _Cost of freight_ , which is impacted by shipping availability, international demand, labor shortages, strikes, regional conflicts, inadequate or obsolete port infrastructure and other factors.  \n---|---  \n● | _Foreign exchange rates_ , which are continually fluctuating due to the economies and/or governmental policies of different countries.  \n● | _Human resources productivity_ , which may be impacted by the training and skills of the available workforce, the nature of tools and facilities in place and availability of financial incentives.  \n● | _Power consumption and costs_ , which may be affected by governmental policies, including green energy initiatives and the age and efficiency of existing and newly acquired facilities.  \n  \nOur Results of Operations depend primarily on the cost of raw materials and on our industrial cost.\n\nIn our business, we import most of our raw materials from Europe, South America, the Black Sea region and Canada (for durum). Morocco produces some wheat, but the quality is generally not sufficient for industrial usage and therefore we have to mix it with the wheat we import. The variation of the cost of raw materials among these countries has a huge impact on our business and can explain the changes in the results of operation from period to period.\n\nThe main components of our industrial costs include human resources, cost of equipment, maintenance, power consumption and financial cost. We launched a successful restructuring plan in 2018 that reduced the industrial cost by 40% over the last three years. The main economy went from a large decrease of human resource cost (1200 employees in 2018 vs 700 employees in 2023) while we increased the crushing capacity by 350 tons per day and a large decrease of logistics cost (we outsourced our logistics).\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**_Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2022_**\n\nThe following table presents our condensed unaudited interim consolidated results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\n\nSix months ended June 30,  \n---  \nIn thousands of USD | 2023 | 2022 | $ Change  \nRevenues | $| 145,616 | $| 154,992 | $| (9,376| )  \nCost of sales | 131,969 | 139,881 | (7,912| )  \nGross profit | 13,647 | 15,111 | (1,464| )  \nOperating expenses:  \nSelling, general and administrative expenses | 15,024 | 14,696 | 328  \nTotal operating expenses | 15,024 | 14,696 | 328  \nOperating income | (1,377| ) | 415 | (1,792| )  \nOther expense (income):  \nInterest income | (55| ) | (55| )  \nInterest expense | 6,529 | 4,857 | 1,672  \nChange in fair value of derivative | 1,579 | 405 | 1,174  \nForeign exchange loss | (1,500| ) | 1,913 | (3,413| )  \nTotal other expense | 6,553 | 7,175 | (622| )  \nLoss before income taxes | (7,930| ) | (6,760| ) | (1,170| )  \nIncome tax expense | 646 | 1,605 | (959| )  \nNet loss | $| (8,576| ) | $| (8,365| ) | $| (211| )  \n  \nNet sales decreased 6.0% to $146.0 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 compared to $155.0 million for the same period in 2022, due to decreased average selling price primarily on flour.\n\nCost of goods sold decreased 5.7% to $132 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 compared to $139.9 million for the same period in 2022 as a result of higher volume of commodities acquired and decrease in the average global price of wheat in 2023 compared to 2022.\n\nGross profit decreased 9.7% to $13.7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 compared to $15.1 million for the same period in 2022, primarily driven by the volatility of prices of raw materials.\n\nSG&A expenses were $15.0 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 compared to $14.7 million for the same period in 2022, an increase of 2.2%. SG&A expenses increased for the six-months ended June 30, 2023 as a result of an increase the new costs in 2023 of the Public Company compared to 2022 when it was still privately owned.\n\nOther income (expenses) – Other expenses decreased to $6.6 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2022, a decrease of 8.7%, resulting from a decrease in forex exchange Loss.\n\n_Segments_\n\nThe following table presents revenue and operating income by segment for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022:\n\nSix Months Ended  \n---  \nJune 30,  \n2023 | 2022  \nIn thousands of USD  \nSales to external customers:  \nSoft Wheat | $| 105,386 | $| 115,856  \nDurum Wheat | 25,347 | 22,316  \nCouscous & Pasta | 14,883 | 16,820  \nTotal | $| 145,616 | $| 154,992  \nDirect operating income (loss):  \nSoft Wheat | (187| ) | 2,884  \nDurum Wheat | (225| ) | (653| )  \nCouscous & Pasta | (965| ) | (1,816| )  \nOperating income | $| (1,377| ) | $| 415  \n  \nNet sales of soft wheat products decreased 9.0% to $105.4 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 compared to $115.9 million for the same period in 2022, due to decreased selling prices primarily in Morocco.\n\nNet sales of durum wheat products increased 13.6% to $25.3 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 compared to $22.3 million for the same period in 2022, due to an increase in sales volume.\n\nNet sales of couscous and pasta products decreased 11.5% to $14.9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2023 compared to $16.8 million for the same period in 2022, due to decreased selling prices in Morocco.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\n_Working Capital and Working Capital Facilities._ Working capital deficits were $118.1 million and $94.6 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nFG has revolving working capital credit lines available in the amount of $51.0 million $48.0 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, FG had borrowed $50.4 million and had unused availability of $0.6 million under such credit lines. As of December 31, 2022, FG had borrowed $47.0 million and had unused availability of $1.0 million under such credit lines. FG has also entered into credit agreements for asset-based credit facilities in order to fund wheat raw material purchases (“Wheat Credit Facilities”). The Wheat Credit Facilities provide the ability to borrow funds under consolidated lines of credit of up to approximately $166.0 million as of June 30, 2022 and $148.0 million as of December 31, 2022. The Wheat Credit Facilities are secured by the Company’s inventory. The Wheat Credit Facilities must be renewed on a semi-annual basis. As of June 30, 2023, FG had borrowed $139.7 million under the Wheat Credit Facilities, with unused availability of approximately $26.3 million. As of December 31, 2022, FG had borrowed $137.4 million under the Wheat Credit Facilities, with unused availability of approximately $10.6 million.\n\nAs of June 30, 2022, FG has, in addition to its obligations under the working capital credit lines and the Wheat Credit Facilities, $3.5 million in lease obligations. FG believes it has sufficient capital available to it to fulfill such obligations.\n\n_Cash and Cash Equivalents -_ Cash and cash equivalents were $25.2 million and $24.8 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Cash balances are managed in accordance with our investment policy, the objectives of which are to preserve the principal value of our cash assets, maintain a high degree of liquidity and deliver competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions.\n\n_Trade accounts receivable, net_ - Trade accounts receivable, net was $30.4 million and $30.9 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\n_Inventories -_ Inventories were $66.5 million and $27.2 million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nFG incurred losses and had an accumulated deficit of $111.3 and $102.7 at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Historically, FG’s primary sources of liquidity have been cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and cash flows from financing activities, including funding under credit agreements.\n\nWe believe that cash on hand, as well as proceeds from anticipated debt offerings will provide sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least one year after the date the financial statements are issued. However, there is no assurance that future funding will be available if and when required or on terms acceptable to FG. This projection is based on our current expectations regarding product sales, cost structure, cash burn rate and other operating assumptions.\n\n**COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**\n\nFG has commitments with banks to finance its operating activities. FG has provided collateral and mortgages to banks of $25,464, as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. From time to time, FG is involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. These matters may relate to employment and labor claims, patent and intellectual property claims, claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations. When applicable, FG records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Defense costs are expensed as incurred and are included in professional fees. While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against FG cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of management, individually or in the aggregate, no such lawsuits and other proceedings had or are expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements in 2023 and 2022. As of the six months ended June 30, 2023, there were no lawsuits or other proceedings commenced against FG, that in the opinion of management, individually or in the aggregate, had or are expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of FG as of such date, and, no such lawsuits and other proceedings had or are expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**\n\nAs disclosed in Note 2, the significant accounting policies used in preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements were applied on a basis consistent with those reflected in our consolidated financial statements that are included in the annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022 that was filed with the SEC on May 1, 2023. We believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\n\nRevenue Recognition – FG follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The majority of FG’s contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less. FG applies the practical expedient in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) paragraph 606-10-50-14 of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. Trade discounts or volume rebates are recognized as a deduction in revenue. No payment terms beyond one year are granted at contract inception.\n\nRevenue related to the sale of goods and equipment is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer. FG recognizes revenue from these contracts at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer, generally when legal title and risks and rewards transfer to the customer. Sales terms typically provide for transfer of title at the time and point of delivery and acceptance of the product being sold.\n\nAmounts received from customers prior to revenue recognition on a contract are recorded as contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nShipping and Handling Costs – Shipping and handling costs related to contracts with customers for the sale of goods are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and are included in cost of sales. Accordingly, amounts billed to customers for such costs are included as a component of revenues.\n\nTaxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities – FG does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers, in the measurement of transactions prices or as a component of revenues and cost of sales.\n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Credit Losses – We provide credit terms to customers in-line with industry standards, perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on historical experience recorded. We analyze the aging of customer accounts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. Customer balances are written off after all collection efforts are exhausted. Estimated product returns, which have not been material, are deducted from sales at the time of shipment.\n\nOther Receivables – Other receivables include government subsidies for the production and sale of flour. The Moroccan government provides a fixed subsidy based on production and customer. Subsidies are paid by the Moroccan government twice a year based on sales of flour for the previous six months. The Company records the flour subsidies as a credit against the related costs, that the subsidies were intended to offset, in the same periods that the costs were incurred within the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nIncome Taxes – The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable in Morocco and local jurisdictions, and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period. We account for uncertain tax positions using a “more-likely-than-not” threshold. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position, or the statute of limitations concerning such issues lapses.\n\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions FG’s functional currency is the Moroccan dirham, and its presentation currency is the United States Dollar (“USD”). The functional currency is translated into U.S. dollars for balance sheet accounts using currency exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted-average exchange rate during the fiscal year. The transactions in foreign currency (that is a different currency than the functional currency of the entity) are converted at the exchange rate prevailing to the date of the transaction. The assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are evaluated in the current period on the date of the closing or at the opening rate, when applicable. The translation adjustments are deferred as a separate component of equity in Accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and intercompany debt that is not of a long-term investment nature are included in (Gain) loss on foreign currency exchange in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\n\nForeign currency forward contracts –The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of its business, which the Company at times manages through the use of foreign currency forward contracts. The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts and accounts for these instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” which establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The Company’s foreign currency contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815; accordingly, changes in the fair value are recorded in current period earnings.\n\nShare-Based Compensation - Share-based awards principally comprise of stock options and cash-settled stock options, referred to as “phantom options”. Share-based awards are generally issued to certain senior management personnel. Share-based compensation cost (other than phantom options) is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period, on a straight-line basis. Our phantom options are accounted for as liability awards and are re-measured at fair value each reporting period with compensation expense being recognized over the requisite service period.\n\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of its stock options and phantom options, respectively, as well as the fair value at each reporting period for liability classified awards. This model requires the Company to estimate the expected volatility and the expected term of the stock options, which are highly complex and subjective variables. The Company uses an expected volatility of its stock price during the expected life of the options that is based on the historical performance of the Company’s stock price as well as including an estimate using similar companies. The expected term is computed using the simplified method as the Company’s best estimate given its lack of actual exercise history. The Company has selected a risk-free rate based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity equivalent to the expected exercise term of the stock option. The inputs to the valuation of phantom options are observable in the market, and as such are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company accounts for forfeitures of share-based awards as the occur.\n\nInventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. FG ‘s inventory is valued using the weighted average cost method. The costs of finished goods inventories include raw materials, labor, and overhead costs.\n\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment - Property, plant, and equipment are stated at acquisition cost, plus capitalized interest on borrowings during the actual construction period of major capital projects. Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\n**Assets** | **Useful Lives**  \n---|---  \nBuildings | 39 years  \nMachinery and equipment (technical installations) | 30-50 years  \nOther assets | 5-30 years  \n  \nBuilding improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets or the remaining useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful life or remaining lease term. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance, which do not improve or extend the life of the assets, are expensed as incurred.\n\nWe perform impairment tests when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Indicators of impairment include deteriorations in operating cash flows, the anticipated sale or disposal of an asset group, and other significant changes in business conditions. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. FG’s assessment of recoverability of property, plant and equipment is performed on a reporting unit level. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of such asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of such asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n**Assets** | **Useful Lives**  \n---|---  \nTrademarks | Indefinite  \nCustomer relationships | 20 years  \nPatents and licenses | 5-10 years  \nComputer software | 5-10 years  \nOther intangible assets | 3-10 years  \n  \nRecognized intangible assets, exclusive of goodwill, are amortized over the useful lives of the assets unless that life is determined to be indefinite. All of our intangible assets, exclusive of goodwill, are finite lived. All amortization expense related to intangible assets is recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is generally based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nGoodwill is evaluated annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances require an interim assessment. We assess goodwill for impairment (as of December 31) at the reporting unit level using income and market approaches, employing significant assumptions regarding growth, discount rates, and profitability at each reporting unit. Our estimates under the income approach are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. The market approach uses a market multiple methodologies employing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) and applies a range of multiples to those amounts in determining the indicated fair value. In determining the multiples used in this approach, we obtain the multiples for selected peer companies using the most recent publicly available information. In determining the indicated fair value of each reporting unit, FG concludes based on the income approach, and uses the market approach to corroborate, as FG believes the income approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair value of the reporting units. The resulting value is then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if impairment is necessary.\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nNo accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the six months ended June 30, 2023 has had or is expected to have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements.\n"
