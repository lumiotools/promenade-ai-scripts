\"Partnered\") with Hitachi Systems, Ltd. to offer combined package of HeartCore CMS and GRED Web Security Assessment Cloud\n\n\n\n**Management Commentary** “I am pleased to announce the strongest quarter of HeartCore’s history, supported by the progress made across our Go IPO business,” said HeartCore CEO Sumitaka Kanno. “The third quarter saw two new Go IPO clients successfully listed on the Nasdaq. The warrants and ordinary shares received from these deals contributed to our highest financial results since the inception of the service, driving us into profitable operations for the quarter and year-to-date. This quarter’s results showcased the immense value of our consulting business, and with an optimistic outlook on the U.S. IPO market for Japanese companies, we anticipate closing additional deals over the next several months that will further support the growth of our Go IPO business. We continue to remain in serious discussions with prospective Go IPO clients and look forward to sharing future wins as they come.”\n\n“We also accomplished key developments in our software business, positioning us for sustained and predictable growth in the coming quarters. First, we transitioned towards offering multi-year software licensing agreements to our customers, a move designed to generate recurring revenue streams and enhance our margin profile. Furthermore, we added a SaaS delivery model for our CMS platform designed to support our sales and marketing team to tap into a new pool of prospective customers. While Go IPO contains the prospect of significant upside, our adjustments in the software business model are intended to create more stable, durable, and long-term revenue for future quarters. We look forward to continuing driving growth across both arms of the business and carrying this momentum into 2025.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Revenues increased 281% to $17.9 million compared to $4.7 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to revenue from warrants and ordinary shares associated with the successful listing of two Go IPO consulting service clients.\n\nGross profit increased 1,640% to $14.4 million compared to $0.8 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the aforementioned reason above.\n\nOperating expenses decreased to $2.3 million compared to $2.6 million in the same period last year. The improvement was primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative, and research and development expenses.\n\nNet income increased 526% to $10.8 million or $0.53 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $2.5 million or $(0.11) per diluted share, in the same period last year.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.2 million compared to $1.0 million on December 31, 2023.\n\n**Nine-Months 2024 Financial Results** Revenues increased 46% to $27.0 million compared to $18.5 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily because revenue recognized from warrants and ordinary shares associated with the successful listing of two Go IPO consulting service clients in current periods was greater than that of recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nGross profit increased 117% to $17.3 million compared to $8.0 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the aforementioned reason above.\n\nOperating expenses decreased to $7.3 million compared to $8.9 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower selling and general and administrative expenses.\n\nNet income increased 506% to $7.1 million or $0.37 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $1.8 million or $(0.07) per diluted share, in the same period last year.\n\n**About HeartCore Enterprises, Inc.** Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, HeartCore Enterprises is a leading enterprise software and consulting services company.

(Nasdaq: HTCR) (“HeartCore” or “the Company”),** a leading enterprise software and data consulting services company based in Tokyo, announced today that it has received written notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC that the Company demonstrated compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Requirement”) and that the Company is therefore in compliance with the Nasdaq Capital Market’s listing requirements. As a result, the Company’s securities will continue to be listed and traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\nAs previously disclosed, on October 22, 2024, the Company received written notice from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department indicating that it was then not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. HeartCore was set to appeal the determination at hearing scheduled for December 17, 2024. The hearing has now been cancelled as the Company regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\n\n**About HeartCore Enterprises, Inc.** Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, HeartCore Enterprises is a leading enterprise software and consulting services company.
