In line with our stated strategic objective, inventory was down 4% year-over-year. Our Adventure business performed in line with expectations for the first two months of the quarter, but results were ultimately affected by market softness in September in both North America and Australia/New Zealand.”\n\nMr. Kanders added, “There remains significant work outstanding to execute our multi-year growth initiatives, but we believe we are on track at Outdoor as we continue to simplify the business operationally and drive SKU rationalization, despite the challenging global market conditions. Our objective to scale the Adventure segment to a global footprint has not yet come to fruition. We have established a strategic roadmap that we are executing on and remain confident that the significant investments we have made in 2024 will enable our Adventure businesses to accelerate traction, particularly in the US and international markets, and strengthen our global OEM initiatives. All of this is supported by a debt-free balance sheet, to take the next steps in our turnaround.”\n\n**Third** **Quarter** **2024** **Financial** **Results** Sales in the third quarter were $67.1 million compared to $81.3 million in the same year‐ago quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by softness across all selling channels in Outdoor, as well as the effect from the product line simplification strategy. The decrease was further driven by lower Adventure segment sales, specifically in the OEM channel and challenging wholesale markets globally, partially offset by the benefit from the TRED Outdoors acquisition.\n\nSales in the Outdoor segment were $49.3 million, compared to $61.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Sales in the Adventure segment decreased 11.9% to $17.8 million, or $17.5 million on a constant currency basis, compared to $20.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin in the third quarter was 35.0% compared to 33.6% in the year‐ago quarter. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to favorable product mix at the Outdoor segment as a result of product simplification and SKU rationalization efforts, as well as a favorable channel mix due to lower OEM sales and higher MAXTRAX revenue at the Adventure segment. This was partially offset by an increase in polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) related inventory reserve expenses at the Outdoor segment, as well as sales return reserve and rebate expenses at the Adventure segment. Adjusted gross margin reflecting the PFAS related inventory reserve was 37.8% for the quarter.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $27.9 million compared to $28.4 million in the same year‐ago quarter. The decrease was primarily a result of lower retail expenses due to store closures and other expense reduction initiatives to manage costs at the Outdoor segment. These decreases were partially offset by investments in global marketing and e-commerce initiatives to accelerate growth at the Adventure segment and incremental SG&A from the TRED Outdoors acquisition.\n\nThe loss from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2024 was $3.2 million, or $(0.08) per diluted share, compared to loss from continuing operations of $2.2 million, or $(0.06) per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Loss from continuing operations in the third quarter included $0.4 million of charges relating to legal cost and regulatory matter expenses and $1.9 million of PFAS inventory reserves.\n\nAdjusted income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2024 was $1.9 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of $1.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted income from continuing operations excludes legal cost and regulatory matters expenses, PFAS inventory reserves, restructuring charges and transaction costs, as well as non-cash items for intangible amortization and stock-based compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the third quarter was $2.4 million, or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.6%, compared to adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $3.6 million, or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 4.5%, in the same year‐ago quarter.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was $8.3 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $0.1 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2024 were $1.1 million compared to $1.2 million in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2024 was an outflow of $9.4 million compared to an outflow of $1.1 million in the prior year quarter.\n\n**Liquidity** **at** **September** **30,** **2024** **vs.** **December** **31,** **2023**\n\n  * Cash and cash equivalents totaled $36.4 million compared to $11.3 million.\n  * Total debt of $0.0 million compared to $119.8 million.\n\n\n\n**2024** **Outlook** The Company now expects fiscal year 2024 sales to range between $260 million to $266 million. Due to softer global revenue and the continued investments in the Adventure segment to scale the business, the Company now expects adjusted EBITDA of approximately $7 million to $9 million, or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.0% at the mid-point of revenue and adjusted EBITDA. In addition, the Company now expects capital expenditures to range between $5.0 million to $6.0 million, of which $0.9 million related to Precision Sport prior to disposal, and free cash flow to range between $(6) million to $(8) million for the full year 2024, which includes approximately $7.0 of cash outflow related to the Precision Sport disposal.\n\n**Net** **Operating** **Loss** **(NOL)** The Company has net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes of $7.7 million which we expect to fully utilize in 2024.\n\n**Conference** **Call** The Company will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its third quarter 2024 results.\n\nDate: Thursday, November 7, 2024Time: 5:00 pm ETRegistration Link: [https://register.vevent.com/register/BI55fc3dd7523c4a8e885ce228015f2987](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2TTsHm2YF65DQlchlkn2Y5bEpGX47TI2RIiKFBWcxKMM826AEAt93q0jSwfBypN1HWk4zn4kWeTfjqux6ZnZICfWVqieW2RVj7q2dBiFT10N0WTMd2Whs6R8vN7MfmxR2yocafnEohxrew3yutResbxUk2ZMEpN3WvSv8az9oYPjRivRfFGsDkAIVr3EKkpnd2oV7C6eIxsm5pYG6AgLz7pTBmLneMCfihKZEzewk4Y=)\n\nTo access the call by phone, please register via the live call registration link above and you will be provided with dial-in instructions and details.

Driven by our rich history of engineering and innovation, our objective is to provide safe, simple, effective and beautiful products so that our customers can maximize their outdoor pursuits and adventures. Each of our brands has a long history of continuous product innovation for core and everyday users alike. The Company’s products are principally sold globally under the Black Diamond®, Rhino-Rack®, MAXTRAX®, TRED Outdoors® brand names through outdoor specialty and online retailers, our own websites, distributors, and original equipment manufacturers.\n\n**Use of Non‐GAAP Measures** The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). This press release contains the non-GAAP measures: (i) adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit, (ii) adjusted (loss) income from continuing operations and related earnings (loss) per diluted share, (iii) earnings before interest, taxes, other income or expense, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin, and (iv) free cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures). The Company believes that the presentation of certain non-GAAP measures, i.e.: (i) adjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit, (ii) adjusted (loss) income from continuing operations and related earnings (loss) per diluted share , (iii) EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, and (iv) free cash flow, provide useful information for the understanding of its ongoing operations and enables investors to focus on period-over-period operating performance, and thereby enhances the user's overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance relative to past performance and provides, along with the nearest GAAP measures, a baseline for modeling future earnings expectations. Non-GAAP measures are reconciled to comparable GAAP financial measures within this press release. We do not provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP guidance measures Adjusted EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the fiscal year 2024 to net income for the fiscal year 2024, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting certain types of expenses and gains, without unreasonable effort, which affect net income but not Adjusted EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDA Margin. The Company cautions that non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the Company's reported GAAP results. Additionally, the Company notes that there can be no assurance that the above referenced non-GAAP financial measures are comparable to similarly titled financial measures used by other publicly traded companies.\n\n**Forward-Looking** **Statements** Please note that in this press release we may use words such as “appears,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends,” “future,” and similar expressions which constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

          "content": "November 7, 2024\nClarus Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\nContinues to Advance Strategic Plan to Capitalize on Long-Term Growth\nOpportunities\nSALT LAKE CITY, Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clarus Corporation (NASDAQ:\nCLAR) (“Clarus” and/or the “Company”), a global company focused on the outdoor\nenthusiast markets, reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30,\n2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Summary vs. Same Year‐Ago Quarter (adjusted to reflect\nthe reclassification of the Precision Sport segment as discontinued operations)\nSales of $67.1 million compared to $81.3 million.\nGross margin was 35.0% compared to 33.6%; adjusted gross margin of 37.8%\ncompared to 33.6%.\nNet loss, which includes the impact of discontinued operations, of $3.2 million, or\n$(0.08) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $1.3 million, or $(0.03) per diluted\nshare.\nLoss from continuing operations of $3.2 million, or $(0.08) per diluted share, compared\nto loss from continuing operations of $2.2 million, or $(0.06) per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $2.4 million with an adjusted EBITDA\nmargin of 3.6% compared to $3.6 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 4.5%.\nManagement Commentary\n“While macroeconomic headwinds have continued to limit consumer demand in the near-\nterm, our focus in the third quarter was on advancing our strategic plan to position Clarus for\nlong-term profitable growth,” said Warren Kanders, Clarus’ Executive Chairman.\n“Specifically, in the Outdoor segment we continued to improve the quality and composition\nof our inventory to focus on the best and most profitable styles across categories. In line with\nour stated strategic objective, inventory was down 4% year-over-year. Our Adventure\nbusiness performed in line with expectations for the first two months of the quarter, but\nresults were ultimately affected by market softness in September in both North America and\nAustralia/New Zealand.”\nMr. Kanders added, “There remains significant work outstanding to execute our multi-year\ngrowth initiatives, but we believe we are on track at Outdoor as we continue to simplify the\nbusiness operationally and drive SKU rationalization, despite the challenging global market\nconditions. Our objective to scale the Adventure segment to a global footprint has not yet\ncome to fruition. We have established a strategic roadmap that we are executing on and\nremain confident that the significant investments we have made in 2024 will enable our\nAdventure businesses to accelerate traction, particularly in the US and international markets,\nand strengthen our global OEM initiatives. All of this is supported by a debt-free balance\nsheet, to take the next steps in our turnaround.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results\nSales in the third quarter were $67.1 million compared to $81.3 million in the same year‐ago\nquarter. This decrease was primarily driven by softness across all selling channels in\nOutdoor, as well as the effect from the product line simplification strategy. The decrease was\nfurther driven by lower Adventure segment sales, specifically in the OEM channel and\nchallenging wholesale markets globally, partially offset by the benefit from the TRED\nOutdoors acquisition.\nSales in the Outdoor segment were $49.3 million, compared to $61.1 million in the year-ago\nquarter. Sales in the Adventure segment decreased 11.9% to $17.8 million, or $17.5 million\non a constant currency basis, compared to $20.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross\nmargin in the third quarter was 35.0% compared to 33.6% in the year‐ago quarter. The\nincrease in gross margin was primarily due to favorable product mix at the Outdoor segment\nas a result of product simplification and SKU rationalization efforts, as well as a favorable\nchannel mix due to lower OEM sales and higher MAXTRAX revenue at the Adventure\nsegment. This was partially offset by an increase in polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”)\nrelated inventory reserve expenses at the Outdoor segment, as well as sales return reserve\nand rebate expenses at the Adventure segment. Adjusted gross margin reflecting the PFAS\nrelated inventory reserve was 37.8% for the quarter.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter were $27.9 million\ncompared to $28.4 million in the same year‐ago quarter. The decrease was primarily a result\nof lower retail expenses due to store closures and other expense reduction initiatives to\nmanage costs at the Outdoor segment. These decreases were partially offset by\ninvestments in global marketing and e-commerce initiatives to accelerate growth at the\nAdventure segment and incremental SG&A from the TRED Outdoors acquisition.\nThe loss from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2024 was $3.2 million, or $(0.08)\nper diluted share, compared to loss from continuing operations of $2.2 million, or $(0.06) per\ndiluted share in the year-ago quarter. Loss from continuing operations in the third quarter\nincluded $0.4 million of charges relating to legal cost and regulatory matter expenses and\n$1.9 million of PFAS inventory reserves.\nAdjusted income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2024 was $1.9 million, or\n$0.05 per diluted share, compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of $1.8\nmillion, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted income from continuing\noperations excludes legal cost and regulatory matters expenses, PFAS inventory reserves,\nrestructuring charges and transaction costs, as well as non-cash items for intangible\namortization and stock-based compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the third quarter was $2.4 million, or an\nadjusted EBITDA margin of 3.6%, compared to adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations\nof $3.6 million, or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 4.5%, in the same year‐ago quarter.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was\n$8.3 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $0.1 million in the prior\nyear quarter. Capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2024 were $1.1 million compared to\n$1.2 million in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2024 was an\noutflow of $9.4 million compared to an outflow of $1.1 million in the prior year quarter.\nLiquidity at September 30, 2024 vs. December 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $36.4 million compared to $11.3 million.\nTotal debt of $0.0 million compared to $119.8 million.\n2024 Outlook\nThe Company now expects fiscal year 2024 sales to range between $260 million to $266\nmillion. Due to softer global revenue and the continued investments in the Adventure\nsegment to scale the business, the Company now expects adjusted EBITDA of\napproximately $7 million to $9 million, or an adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.0% at the mid-\npoint of revenue and adjusted EBITDA. In addition, the Company now expects capital\nexpenditures to range between $5.0 million to $6.0 million, of which $0.9 million related to\nPrecision Sport prior to disposal, and free cash flow to range between $(6) million to $(8)\nmillion for the full year 2024, which includes approximately $7.0 of cash outflow related to\nthe Precision Sport disposal.\nNet Operating Loss (NOL)\nThe Company has net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes of $7.7 million which we expect to fully utilize in 2024.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time to discuss its third\nquarter 2024 results.\nDate: Thursday, November 7, 2024\nTime: 5:00 pm ET\nRegistration Link:\nhttps://register.vevent.com/register/BI55fc3dd7523c4a8e885ce228015f2987\nTo access the call by phone, please register via the live call registration link above and you\nwill be provided with dial-in instructions and details.

The Company’s products are principally sold\nglobally under the Black Diamond®, Rhino-Rack®, MAXTRAX®, TRED Outdoors® brand\nnames through outdoor specialty and online retailers, our own websites, distributors, and\noriginal equipment manufacturers.\nUse of Non‐GAAP Measures\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“GAAP”). This press release contains the non-GAAP measures: (i)\nadjusted gross margin and adjusted gross profit, (ii) adjusted (loss) income from continuing\noperations and related earnings (loss) per diluted share, (iii) earnings before interest, taxes,\nother income or expense, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), EBITDA margin,\nadjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin, and (iv) free cash flow (defined as net cash\nprovided by operating activities less capital expenditures). The Company believes that the\npresentation of certain non-GAAP measures, i.e.: (i) adjusted gross margin and adjusted\ngross profit, (ii) adjusted (loss) income from continuing operations and related earnings (loss)\nper diluted share , (iii) EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA\nmargin, and (iv) free cash flow, provide useful information for the understanding of its\nongoing operations and enables investors to focus on period-over-period operating\nperformance, and thereby enhances the user's overall understanding of the Company's\ncurrent financial performance relative to past performance and provides, along with the\nnearest GAAP measures, a baseline for modeling future earnings expectations. Non-GAAP\nmeasures are reconciled to comparable GAAP financial measures within this press release.\nWe do not provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP guidance measures Adjusted EBITDA\nand/or Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the fiscal year 2024 to net income for the fiscal year\n2024, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, due to the inherent difficulty of\nforecasting certain types of expenses and gains, without unreasonable effort, which affect\nnet income but not Adjusted EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDA Margin. The Company\ncautions that non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a\nsubstitute for, the Company's reported GAAP results. Additionally, the Company notes that\nthere can be no assurance that the above referenced non-GAAP financial measures are\ncomparable to similarly titled financial measures used by other publicly traded companies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nPlease note that in this press release we may use words such as “appears,” “anticipates,”\n“believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends,” “future,” and similar expressions which constitute\nforward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Clarus Corporation and subsidiaries (which may be referred\nto as the “Company,” “Clarus,” “we,” “us” or “our”) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America (“GAAP”), instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not\ninclude all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all\nadjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, except otherwise disclosed) necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements have been included. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are\nnot necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for the year ending December 31, 2024. These interim financial statements should be\nread in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on\nMarch 7, 2024.\nNature of Business\nHeadquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, we are a global leader in the design and development of best-in-class equipment and lifestyle\nproducts for outdoor enthusiasts. Driven by our rich history of engineering and innovation, our objective is to provide safe, simple,\neffective and beautiful products so that our customers can maximize their outdoor pursuits and adventures. Each of our brands has a long\nhistory of continuous product innovation for core and everyday users alike. The Company’s products are principally sold globally under the\nBlack Diamond®, Rhino-Rack®, MAXTRAX®, and TRED Outdoors® brand names through outdoor specialty and online retailers, our\nown websites, distributors and original equipment manufacturers.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. The more significant estimates relate to the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations,\nprovision for excess or obsolete inventory, allowance for credit losses, and valuation of contingent consideration liabilities, deferred tax\nassets, long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and other intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience, projected future cash flows, and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results\ncould differ from these estimates.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation. Specifically,\nlegal costs associated with specific legal matters which were recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses are now presented in\nlegal costs and regulatory matter expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See Note 16 for discussion\nregarding legal matters.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Pronouncements issued and not yet adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures, which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an\nannual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable\n9\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nsegment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are effective for all public entities\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early\nadoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the enhanced disclosure requirements; however, it does not anticipate a\nmaterial change to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires a\npublic entity to disclose in its rate reconciliation table additional categories of information about federal, state and foreign income taxes and\nprovide more details about the reconciling items in some categories if items meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance will require all\nentities to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds, disaggregated by federal (national), state and foreign taxes for annual periods and to\ndisaggregate the information by jurisdiction based on a quantitative threshold. The guidance makes several other changes to the disclosure\nrequirements. All entities are required to apply the guidance prospectively, with the option to apply it retrospectively. The guidance is\neffective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is\ncurrently evaluating the enhanced disclosure requirements; however, it does not anticipate a material change to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\nNOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS\nTRED\nOn September 13, 2023, Clarus entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “TRED Purchase Agreement”) to acquire TRED Outdoors\nPty Ltd. (“TRED”), which subsequently closed on October 9, 2023. All United States dollar amounts contained herein are based on the\nexchange rates in effect for Australian dollars ($AUD) and the market value of the Company’s common stock at the time of closing of the\nacquisition of TRED (the “TRED Acquisition”).\nThe Company acquired TRED for an aggregate purchase price of $AUD 10,741 (approximately $6,849), subject to a post-closing\nadjustment, comprised of $AUD 8,875 (approximately $5,659) cash, 179 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $1,069, and\nadditional consideration described below. The TRED Purchase Agreement provides for the payment of additional contingent consideration\nof up to $AUD 1,000 (approximately $638) in cash upon the satisfaction of certain net sales targets (the “TRED Contingent\nConsideration”). The Company estimated the initial fair value of the TRED Contingent Consideration to be $AUD 189 (approximately\n$121) and recorded this liability within accrued liabilities. See Note 11 for discussion regarding the valuation of the TRED Contingent\nConsideration as of September 30, 2024. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.\nThe Company believes the acquisition of TRED will provide the Company with a greater combined global revenue base, increased gross\nmargins, profitability and free cash flows, and access to increased liquidity to further acquire and grow businesses.\nThe following table is a reconciliation to the fair value of the purchase consideration and how the purchase consideration is allocated to\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed which have been estimated at their fair values. The fair value measurements for the acquisition of\nTRED have been completed. The excess of purchase consideration over the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill for TRED is included in the Adventure segment. The goodwill consists largely of the growth and profitability expected from the\nacquisition.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nTRED\nOctober 9, 2023\nNumber of Shares Estimated Fair Value\nCash paid - $ 5,659\nIssuance of shares of Clarus Corporation 179 1,069\nContingent consideration - 121\nTotal purchase consideration 179 $ 6,849\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed\nAssets\nCash $ 11\nAccounts receivable 1,000\nInventories 1,006\nPrepaid and other current assets 11\nProperty and equipment 195\nOther intangible assets 3,305\nGoodwill 2,832\nTotal assets 8,360\nLiabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 638\nDeferred income taxes 873\nTotal liabilities 1,511\nNet Book Value Acquired $ 6,849\nThe estimated fair value of inventory was recorded at expected sales price less cost to sell plus a reasonable profit margin for selling\nefforts.\n11\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nIn connection with the acquisitions, the Company acquired exclusive rights to TRED’s trademarks, customer relationships, product\ntechnologies, and tradenames.

No pre-existing relationships existed between the Company and\nTRED or its sellers prior to the acquisition. TRED revenue and operating income are included in the Adventure segment. Total revenue and\nnet income of TRED from the date of acquisition to December 31, 2023 were not material to the Company’s condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nNOTE 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company and Everest/Sapphire Acquisition, LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the sale to Bullseye\nAcquisitions, LLC, an affiliate of JDH Capital Company, of all of the equity associated with the Company’s Precision Sport segment,\ncomprised of the Company’s subsidiaries Sierra and Barnes, pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of December 29, 2023, by\nand among, Bullseye Acquisitions, LLC, Everest/Sapphire Acquisition, LLC and the Company (the “Precision Sport Purchase\nAgreement”). The Precision Sport segment engaged in the business of designing, developing, manufacturing, and marketing bullets and\nammunition to the military, law enforcement, and commercial/consumer markets. Under the terms of the Precision Sport Purchase\nAgreement, the Buyer agreed to pay $175,000 in cash, which was subject to a customary working capital adjustment. The Company\nreceived $175,674 in cash under the terms of the Precision Sport Purchase Agreement, which included a preliminary working capital\nadjustment. As of September 30, 2024, the working capital adjustment had been finalized, with no changes from the preliminary working\ncapital adjustment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain on such sale of $40,585.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company’s primary exchange rate risk management objective is to mitigate the uncertainty of anticipated cash flows attributable to\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company primarily focuses on mitigating changes in cash flows resulting from sales\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages this risk primarily by using currency forward and option\ncontracts. If the anticipated transactions are deemed probable, the resulting relationships are formally designated as cash flow hedges. The\nCompany accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges and tests effectiveness by determining whether changes in the expected cash\nflow of the derivative offset, within a range, changes in the expected cash flow of the hedged item.\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company’s derivative contracts had remaining maturities of less than one year. The counterparties to these\ntransactions had both long-term and short-term investment grade credit ratings. The maximum net exposure of the Company’s credit risk to\nthe counterparties is generally limited to the aggregate unrealized loss of all contracts with that counterparty, which was $13 as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. The Company’s exposure of counterparty credit risk is limited to the aggregate unrealized gain on all contracts. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, there was no such exposure to the counterparties. The Company’s derivative counterparties have strong credit ratings\nand as a result, the Company does not require collateral to facilitate transactions.\nThe Company held the following contracts designated as hedging instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nNotional Latest\nAmount Maturity\nForeign exchange contracts - Canadian Dollars $3,574 February 2025\nForeign exchange contracts - Euros € 13,296 August 2025\nDecember 31, 2023\nNotional Latest\nAmount Maturity\nForeign exchange contracts - Canadian Dollars $7,925 February 2025\nForeign exchange contracts - Euros € 20,612 February 2025\nFor contracts that qualify as effective hedge instruments, the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the\ninstruments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to sales in the period the underlying hedged transaction\nis recognized in earnings. Gains of $14 and $226 were reclassified to sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and $231 and $167 were reclassified to sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n18\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe following table presents the balance sheet classification and fair value of derivative instruments as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023:\nClassification September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nDerivative instruments in asset positions:\nPrepaid and other current\nDesignated forward exchange contracts assets $ 34 $ -\nDerivative instruments in liability positions:\nDesignated forward exchange contracts Accrued liabilities $ 47 $ 221\nDesignated forward exchange contracts Other long-term liabilities $ - $ 35\nNOTE 10.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the\namount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, under a\nthree-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are\nobservable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are based on prices or valuation techniques that are unobservable.\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nDesignated forward exchange contracts $ - $ 34 $ - $ 34\n$ - $ 34 $ - $ 34\nLiabilities\nDesignated forward exchange contracts $ - $ 47 $ - $ 47\n$ - $ 47 $ - $ 47\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nDesignated forward exchange contracts $ - $ - $ - $ -\n$ - $ - $ - $ -\nLiabilities\nDesignated forward exchange contracts $ - $ 256 $ - $ 256\nContingent consideration liabilities $ - $ - $ 129 $ 129\n$ - $ 256 $ 129 $ 385\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value based on current market pricing models. No nonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements existed at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe Company estimated the initial fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities primarily using the Monte-Carlo pricing model.\nSignificant unobservable inputs used in the valuation included a discount rate of 11.5%. Contingent consideration liabilities are\nsubsequently remeasured at the estimated fair value at the end of each reporting period using\n21\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nfinancial projections of the acquired company, such as sales-based milestones and estimated probabilities of achievement, with the change\nin fair value recognized in contingent consideration benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)\nfor such period.

Our\ndetermination of fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities could change in future periods based on our ongoing evaluation of\nthese significant unobservable inputs. As of September 30, 2024, the net sales threshold required for the payment of the TRED contingent\nconsideration is not expected to be met.\nNOTE 12. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nOn August 6, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program of\n$0.025 per share of the Company’s common stock (the “Quarterly Cash Dividend”) or $0.10 per share on an annualized basis. The\ndeclaration and payment of future Quarterly Cash Dividends is subject to the discretion of and approval of the Company’s Board of\nDirectors. On November 6, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the payment on November 27, 2024 of the\nQuarterly Cash Dividend of $0.025 to the record holders of shares of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on\nNovember 18, 2024.\nNOTE 13. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding\nduring each period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing earnings (loss) by the total of the weighted average number\nof shares of common stock outstanding during each period, plus the effect of dilutive outstanding stock options and unvested restricted\nstock grants. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share if their effect is anti-\ndilutive to the loss from continuing operations.\n22\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe following table is a reconciliation of basic and diluted shares of common stock outstanding used in the calculation of earnings (loss)\nper share:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nWeighted average shares\noutstanding - basic 38,352 37,470 38,286 37,267\nEffect of dilutive stock awards - - - -\nWeighted average shares\noutstanding - diluted 38,352 37,470 38,286 37,267\nLoss from continuing operations\nper share:\nBasic $ (0.08) $ (0.06) $ (0.39) $ (0.23)\nDiluted (0.08) (0.06) (0.39) (0.23)\nIncome from discontinued\noperations per share:\nBasic $ - $ 0.03 $ 0.74 $ 0.18\nDiluted - 0.03 0.74 0.18\nNet (loss) income per share:\nBasic $ (0.08) $ (0.03) $ 0.35 $ (0.05)\nDiluted (0.08) (0.03) 0.35 (0.05)\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, equity awards of 5,762 and 4,922, respectively, and for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, equity awards of 5,217 and 5,613, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of earnings (loss) per\nshare for these periods as they were anti-dilutive.\nNOTE 14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN\nUnder the Company’s current 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”), the Company’s Board of Directors has flexibility to determine\nthe type and amount of awards to be granted to eligible participants, who must be employees, directors, officers or consultants of the\nCompany or its subsidiaries. The 2015 Plan allows for grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock\nawards, stock appreciation rights, and restricted units. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be granted through\nawards under the 2015 Plan to any employee in any calendar year may not exceed 500 shares. The 2015 Plan will continue in effect until\nDecember 2025 unless terminated sooner.\nOptions Granted:\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued stock options for an aggregate of 1,240 shares under the 2015 Plan\nto directors and employees of the Company. Of the 1,240 options, 1,140 options vest and become exercisable over a period of two years\nand 100 vest in four equal consecutive quarterly tranches from the date of grant. All of the issued stock options expire ten years from the\ndate of the grant.\n23\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nFor computing the fair value of the stock-based awards, the fair value of each option grant has been estimated as of the date of grant using\nthe Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:\nOptions Granted During the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nNumber of options 1,240\nOption vesting period 1 - 2 Years\nGrant price (per share) $6.75 - $6.81\nDividend yield 1.47% - 1.48%\nExpected volatility (a) 50.3% - 51.9%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.08% - 4.57%\nExpected life (years) (b) 5.31 - 5.75\nWeighted average fair value (per share) $3.06 - $3.12\n(a) Expected volatility is based upon the Company’s historical volatility.\n(b) The expected term was determined based upon the underlying terms of the awards and the category and employment history\nof employee award recipient.\nThe grant date fair value of the stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $3,798, which will be\nrecognized over the vesting period of the options.\nRestricted Stock Awards Granted:\nOn March 11, 2024, the Company issued and granted employees restricted stock awards of 100 restricted shares under the 2015 Plan, of\nwhich 50 and 50 shares will vest and become nonforfeitable on each March 11, 2025 and March 11, 2026, respectively. As these restricted\nstock awards vest over time, the fair value of the restricted stock was estimated as of the date of grant using the grant price of $6.75 per\nshare. The grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards was approximately $675 which will be amortized over the expected term of 2\nyears.\nThe total non-cash stock compensation expense for continuing operations related to restricted stock, stock options and stock awards\nrecorded by the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1,547 and $1,151, respectively, and for the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $4,253 and $3,923, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, the majority of stock-based compensation costs were classified as selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were 1,146 unvested stock options and unrecognized compensation cost of $2,849 related to unvested\nstock options, as well as 1,600 unvested restricted stock awards and unrecognized compensation costs of $5,249 related to unvested\nrestricted stock awards.\nNOTE 15. RESTRUCTURING\nStarting in 2023, the Company began incurring expenses to facilitate long-term sustainable growth through cost reduction actions,\nconsisting of employee reductions, facility rationalization and contract termination costs. During the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $478 and $1,076, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the\nCompany incurred $1,009 and $1,812, respectively, of restructuring charges related to these actions. The Company has incurred $4,232 of\ncumulative restructuring charges since the commencement of restructuring actions in 2023. The Company accrues for restructuring costs\nwhen they are probable and reasonably estimable. These costs include severance costs, exit costs, and other restructuring costs and are\nincluded in restructuring\n24\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\ncharges in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Severance costs primarily consist of severance benefits\nthrough payroll continuation, conditional separation costs and employer tax liabilities, while exit costs primarily consist of lease exit and\ncontract termination costs. Other costs consist primarily of costs related to the discontinuance of certain product lines and are\ndistinguishable and directly attributable to the Company’s restructuring initiative and not a result of external market factors associated with\nthe ongoing business. We estimate that we will continue to incur restructuring costs related to employee-related costs and facility exit costs\nduring the year 2024; however, the Company cannot estimate the total amount expected to be incurred as cost reduction actions continue to\nbe evaluated. The Company anticipates completing these restructuring activities in 2025.\nThe following table summarizes the restructuring charges, payments and the remaining liabilities related to restructuring costs at September\n30, 2024, which are included within accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets:\nOutdoor Adventure Corporate Total\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 1,246 $ - $ - $ 1,246\nCharges to expense:\nEmployee termination benefits 544 449 - 993\nExit costs 16 - - 16\nTotal restructuring charges $ 560 $ 449 $ - $ 1,009\nCash payments and non-cash charges:\nCash payments (1,616) (348) - (1,964)\nAsset impairments (23) - - (23)\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ 167 $ 101 $ - $ 268\nNOTE 16. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL MATTERS\nAs a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces the risk of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for\nsubstantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. The\nCompany is therefore vulnerable to various personal injury and property damage lawsuits relating to its products and incidental to its\nbusiness.\nThe Company is involved in various legal disputes and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Anticipated costs related to litigation matters are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the\namount can be reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible\nthat the disposition of any of the legal disputes the Company or its subsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect\nupon the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety\nCommission (“CPSC”) matter discussed below. There is a reasonable possibility of loss from contingencies in excess of the amounts\naccrued by the Company in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets; however, the actual amounts of such possible losses\ncannot currently be reasonably estimated by the Company. It is possible that, as additional information becomes available, the Company\nmay subsequently determine that it may incur losses from such contingencies materially in excess of the amounts initially accrued by the\nCompany which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, stock price, consolidated financial position, results of\noperations and/or cash flows.\nLegal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of comprehensive income (loss) except as described below. See Part II, Item 1. “Legal Proceedings.”\n25\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nU.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission\nIn January 2021, Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. (“BDEL”) wrote to the CPSC outlining its new cradle solution for certain models of its\navalanche beacon transceivers to prevent such transceivers from switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode. The proposed new cradle\nsolution was designed to improve transceiver safety by locking the transceiver into “send” mode prior to use so that it would not switch\nunexpectedly out of “send” mode. BDEL also requested approval for the CPSC Fast-Track Program for a voluntary product recall to\nimplement this cradle solution. The CPSC approved the recall and entered into a Corrective Action Plan agreement with BDEL in March\n2021. BDEL received a letter from the CPSC, dated October 28, 2021, stating that the CPSC is investigating whether BDEL has timely\ncomplied with the reporting requirements of Section 15(b) of the Consumer Protection Safety Act and related regulations regarding certain\nmodels of avalanche transceivers switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode.\nSeparately, on April 21, 2022, BDEL filed a Section 15(b) report and applied for Fast-Track consideration for a voluntary recall, consisting\nof free repair or replacement of such malfunctioning models of avalanche transceivers, which would not switch from “send” mode to\n“search” mode due to an electronic malfunction in the reed switch or foil. The CPSC approved the recall and entered into a Corrective\nAction Plan agreement with BDEL in August 2022. BDEL received a letter from the CPSC, dated January 17, 2023, stating that the CPSC\nis investigating whether BDEL has timely complied with the reporting requirements of Section 15(b) of the Consumer Protection Safety\nAct and related regulations regarding the malfunction in the reed switch or foil in certain models of avalanche transceivers switching out of\n“search” mode. BDEL responded to the CPSC’s investigation by letter dated March 31, 2023, accompanied with documents responsive to\nthe CPSC’s requests. The CPSC asked for further clarification and documents, and BDEL sent a responsive letter accompanied by\nadditional documents on June 23, 2023. On September 6, 2023, the CPSC requested further clarification and information regarding the reed\nswitch issue, to which BDEL responded on October 6 and 13, 2023.\nBy letters dated October 12, 2023 and December 18, 2023, BDEL was notified by the CPSC that the agency staff has concluded BDEL\nfailed to timely meet our statutory reporting obligations under the Consumer Product Safety Act with respect to certain models of BDEL’s\navalanche transceivers switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode and certain models of BDEL’s avalanche transceivers not switching\nfrom “send” mode into “search” mode, that BDEL made a material misrepresentation in a report to the CPSC, and that the agency staff\nintends to recommend that the CPSC impose civil monetary penalties of $16,135 and $9,000, respectively, for the two matters described\nabove.\nOn November 20, 2023 and February 8, 2024, respectively, BDEL submitted a comprehensive response disputing the CPSC’s findings and\nconclusions in the October 12, 2023 and December 18, 2023 letters, including the amount of any potential penalties. The CPSC ultimately\ndisagreed with our position and the agency staff has restated their recommendation for the monetary penalties which the Company intends\nto strongly contest and vigorously defend against.\nJohn C. Walbrecht, the former President of BDEL and the Company, received a letter from the CPSC dated June 25, 2024 alleging that in\nhis personal capacity he knowingly violated the Consumer Product Safety Act by failing to timely report the occurrence resulting in\nbeacons switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode. The staff of the CPSC recommended a $5,000 fine against Mr. Walbrecht personally.\nPursuant to the Company’s by-laws, the Company has agreed to indemnify Mr. Walbrecht and pay his legal fees, and he has provided an\nundertaking to the Company that the Company will be entitled to recover those expenses if it is ultimately determined that he was not\nentitled to indemnification. On August 26, 2024, Mr. Walbrecht’s independent counsel responded to the CPSC, denying the allegations of\nits June 25 letter and rejecting its demand for a penalty.\nBased on currently available information, the Company believes an unfavorable outcome with the CPSC is probable, however, we cannot\nreasonably estimate on what terms this matter will be resolved. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded\na liability of $2,500 representing the low end of the range of our estimated exposure. The Company does not have a better estimate of the\nloss; therefore the low-end of the range was recorded as an\n26\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\naccrued liability during the first quarter of 2024 and a corresponding expense is included in legal costs and regulatory matter expenses in\nthe consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nWe believe it is reasonably possible that a change in our ability to estimate the amount of loss could occur in the near term and that the\nchange in the estimate could be material. In addition, as this matter is ongoing, the Company is currently unable to predict its duration,\nresources required or outcome, or the impact it may have on the Company’s liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash\nflows. Any penalties imposed by the CPSC or other regulators, could be costly to us and could damage our business and reputation as well\nas have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, stock price, consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash\nflows. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred legal expenses of $194 and $53, respectively,\nand during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred legal expenses of $579 and $216, respectively, in\nefforts to resolve this matter. These legal expenses are included in legal costs and regulatory matter expenses in the consolidated statements\nof comprehensive income (loss).\nClarus Corporation v. HAP Trading, LLC and Harsh A. Padia\nOn September 23, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against HAP\nTrading, LLC and Harsh A. Padia (“HAP Trading”), seeking disgorgement of profits from transactions in the Company’s common stock\nand related derivative securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nClarus Corporation v. Caption Management, LLC, et al.\nOn March 8, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Caption\nManagement, LLC, Caption Partners II LP, Caption GP, LLC, William Cooper and Jason Strasser (“Caption Management”), seeking\ndisgorgement of profits from transactions in the Company’s stock and related derivative securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company incurred legal expenses of $200 and $526, respectively, and\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred legal expenses of $716 and $846, respectively, in the\nefforts to bring the cases against HAP Trading and Caption Management to trial. These legal expenses are included in legal costs and\nregulatory matter expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nNOTE 17. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company’s U.S. federal statutory tax rate is 21% and its foreign operations have statutory tax rates of approximately 23% in Austria,\n28% in New Zealand, and 30% in Australia.\nThe difference between the Company’s estimated effective tax rate benefit of 17.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and\nthe U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% was primarily due to the impact of stock compensation and research and experimentation\nexpenditures and credits in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe difference between the Company’s estimated effective tax rate benefit of 17.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and\nthe U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% was primarily due to the impact of stock compensation and research and experimentation\nexpenditures and credits in the first three quarters of 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s gross deferred tax asset was $39,893. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $714,\nresulting in a net deferred tax asset of $39,179, before deferred tax liabilities of $34,434. The Company\n27\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(Unaudited)\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nhas provided a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, because\nthe ultimate realization of those assets did not meet the more-likely-than-not criteria. Part of the Company’s deferred tax assets consist of\nnet operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) for federal tax purposes. If a change in control were to occur, these could be limited under\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Code”), as amended.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all\nof the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future\ntaxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and net operating loss and credit carryforwards\nexpire. The estimates and judgments associated with the Company’s valuation allowance on deferred tax assets are considered critical due\nto the amount of deferred tax assets recorded by the Company on its consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining\nthe Company’s future taxable income. The need for a valuation allowance is reassessed at each interim reporting period.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $18,000 in U.S. net deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets are expected to reverse\ninto NOL carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. At this time, we\nconsider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in future periods that will allow us to realize these deferred tax\nassets. However, unless we can generate sufficient taxable income from our future operations, a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S.\ndeferred tax assets may be required, which would materially increase our income tax expense in the period the allowance is recognized and\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial position.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had NOLs and research and experimentation credit for U.S. federal income tax purposes of $7,699\nand $2,997, respectively. The Company believes its U.S. Federal NOLs will offset a portion of its future U.S. Federal income taxes.\nNOLs available to offset taxable income, subject to compliance with Section 382 of the Code, begin to expire based upon the following\nschedule:\nNet Operating Loss Carryforward Expiration Dates\nDecember 31, 2023\nNet Operating\nExpiration Dates December 31, Loss Amount\n2024 $ -\n2025 -\n2026 -\n2027 and beyond 7,699\nTotal $ 7,699\nNOTE 18. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe operate our business structure within two segments.

On November 6, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the payment on November 27, 2024 of the\nQuarterly Cash Dividend of $0.025 to the record holders of shares of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on\nNovember 18, 2024.\nRestructuring\nStarting in 2023, the Company began incurring expenses to facilitate long-term sustainable growth through cost reduction actions,\nconsisting of employee reductions, facility rationalization and contract termination costs. During the three months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $478 and $1,076, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the\nCompany incurred $1,009 and $1,812, respectively, of restructuring charges related to these actions. The Company has incurred $4,232 of\ncumulative restructuring charges since the commencement of restructuring actions in 2023. The Company accrues for restructuring costs\nwhen they are probable and reasonably estimable. These costs include severance costs, exit costs, and other restructuring costs and are\nincluded in restructuring charges in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Severance costs primarily\nconsist of severance benefits through payroll continuation, conditional separation costs and employer tax liabilities, while exit costs\nprimarily consist of lease exit and contract termination costs. Other costs consist primarily of costs related to the discontinuance of certain\nproduct lines and are distinguishable and directly attributable to the Company’s restructuring initiative and not a result of external market\nfactors associated with the ongoing business. We estimate that we will continue to incur restructuring costs related to employee-related\ncosts and facility exit costs during the year 2024; however, the Company cannot estimate the total amount expected to be incurred as cost\nreduction actions continue to be evaluated. The Company anticipates completing these restructuring activities in 2025.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nManagement’s discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based on the consolidated financial statements, which have\nbeen prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial\nstatements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our\ncritical accounting policies that require the use of estimates and assumptions were discussed in detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be\nreasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nNo impairments were recorded for goodwill or intangible assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. However, factors such\nas a sustained decline in revenues and cash flows, or other adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, including our current and future\nshare price, could result in an impairment charge to our Adventure reporting unit in a future reporting period. The Company performs its\nannual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of 2024.\nAt this time, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in future periods that will allow us to realize\nour deferred tax assets. However, unless we can generate sufficient taxable income from our future operations, a valuation allowance to\nreduce our U.S. deferred tax assets may be required, which would materially increase our income tax expense in the period the allowance is\nrecognized and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial position.\nThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023.\n33\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe following presents a discussion of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nSales\nDomestic sales $ 24,365 $ 30,423\nInternational sales 42,750 50,879\nTotal sales 67,115 81,302\nCost of goods sold 43,618 54,018\nGross profit 23,497 27,284\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative 27,880 28,404\nRestructuring charges 478 1,076\nTransaction costs 103 400\nLegal costs and regulatory matter expenses 394 579\nTotal operating expenses 28,855 30,459\nOperating loss (5,358) (3,175)\nOther income (expense)\nInterest income, net 373 19\nOther, net 1,164 (445)\nTotal other income (expense), net 1,537 (426)\nLoss before income tax (3,821) (3,601)\nIncome tax benefit (664) (1,395)\nLoss from continuing operations (3,157) (2,206)\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax - 942\nNet loss $ (3,157) $ (1,264)\n34\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nSales\nTotal sales decreased $14,187, or 17.4%, to $67,115 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to total sales of $81,302\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in sales was attributable to a decrease in sales at the Outdoor and\nAdventure segments of $11,789 and $2,398, respectively.\nSales in the Adventure segment increased by $281 due to foreign exchange impact from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the\nAustralian dollar during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period. Sales in the Outdoor segment were\nreduced by $13 due to foreign exchange impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against the euro during the three months\nended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period.\nSales in the Outdoor segment decreased due to weakness in our North American wholesale and direct to consumer (“DTC”) channels,\nindependent global distributor (“IGD”) customers, and softness in our European markets, combined with the effects from our product\nsimplification and SKU rationalization strategy. Sales in the Adventure segment decreased due to lower demand from original equipment\nmanufacturer (“OEM”) customers and challenging wholesale in the Australia and US markets, partially offset by a $1,237 increase from\nthe TRED Outdoors acquisition.\nDomestic sales decreased $6,058, or 19.9%, to $24,365 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to domestic sales of\n$30,423 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in sales was attributable to decreases at the Outdoor and\nAdventure segments of $5,253 and $805, respectively.\nInternational sales decreased $8,129, or 16.0%, to $42,750 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to international\nsales of $50,879 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in sales was attributable to decreases at the Outdoor and\nAdventure segments of $6,536 and $1,593, respectively.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold decreased $10,400, or 19.3%, to $43,618 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cost of goods\nsold of $54,018 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nGross Profit\nGross profit decreased $3,787, or 13.9%, to $23,497 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gross profit of\n$27,284 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was 35.0% during the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to a gross margin of 33.6% during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 increased compared to the prior year as a result of favorable product mix at the Outdoor segment, as well as a\nfavorable channel mix due to lower OEM sales and higher MAXTRAX revenue at the Adventure segment. These increases were partially\noffset by an increase in polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) related inventory reserve expenses at the Outdoor segment, as well as sales\nreturn reserve and rebate expenses at the Adventure segment.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $524, or 1.8%, to $27,880 during the three months ended September 30, 2024,\ncompared to selling, general and administrative expenses of $28,404 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general\nand administrative expenses at the Outdoor segment decreased by $1,688 primarily as a result of lower retail expenses due to store closures\nand other expense reduction initiatives to manage costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses at the Adventure segment increased\nby $1,212 primarily as a result of investments in global marketing and e-commerce initiatives to accelerate growth.\n35\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges decreased to $478 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to restructuring charges of $1,076\nduring the three months ended September 30, 2023.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, our effective income tax rate was a benefit of 38.7% and differed compared to the\nstatutory tax rates primarily due to the impact of stock compensation, research and experimentation expenditures and credits, and discrete\nstock option windfall benefits.\nDiscontinued Operations\nNet income from discontinued operations was $0 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income from\ndiscontinued operations of $942 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

There was no activity in discontinued operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nOur primary ongoing funding requirements are for working capital, expansion of our operations (both organically and through acquisitions)\nand general corporate needs, as well as investing in the various brands. We plan to fund these activities through a combination of our future\noperating cash flows and cash on hand. Upon the closing of the sale of the Precision Sport segment, the Company terminated and settled all\noutstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and term debt under the Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as\nadministrative agent and the lenders party thereto (the “Restated Credit Agreement”). We believe that our liquidity requirements and\ncontractual obligations for at least the next 12 months will be adequately covered by cash provided by operations and cash on hand.\nAdditionally, long-term contractual obligations are currently expected to be funded from cash from operations and cash on hand.\nAt September 30, 2024, we had total cash of $36,399, compared to total cash of $11,324 at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the\nCompany had $5,109 of the $36,399 in cash held by foreign entities, of which $3,819 is considered permanently reinvested.\nThe following presents a discussion of cash flows for the condensed consolidated nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with\nthe condensed consolidated nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (23,870) $ 17,428\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 171,144 (4,549)\nNet cash used in financing activities (122,281) (16,191)\nEffect of foreign exchange rates on cash 82 (725)\nChange in cash 25,075 (4,037)\nCash, beginning of year 11,324 12,061\nCash, end of period $ 36,399 $ 8,024\nNet Cash From Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $23,870 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by\noperating activities of $17,428 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net cash (used in) provided by operating\nactivities during 2024 is primarily due to the gain on sale of $40,585 related to the disposition of the Precision Sport segment and an\nincrease in cash outflows related to working capital of $18,859. These were partially offset by an increase in net income and deferred\nincome taxes, as well as a decrease in contingent consideration benefit during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the\nsame period in 2023.\n40\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nFree cash flow, defined as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, of ($28,395) was used during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $12,933 generated during the same period in 2023.

A\nreconciliation of free cash flows to the nearest comparable GAAP financial measure is set forth below:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (23,870) $ 17,428\nPurchase of property and equipment (4,525) (4,495)\nFree cash flow $ (28,395) $ 12,933\nNet Cash From Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $171,144 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in\ninvesting activities of $4,549 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the cash received related to the disposition of the Precision Sport segment, compared to the\nsame period in 2023.\nNet Cash From Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $122,281 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in\nfinancing activities of $16,191 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in net cash used in financing activities\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the settlement of all\noutstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and term debt under the Restated Credit Agreement.\nNet Operating Loss\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and research and experimentation credit for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes of $7,699 and $2,997, respectively. The Company believes its U.S. Federal NOLs will offset a portion of its\nfuture U.S. Federal income taxes. The Company has $7,699 of NOLs, of which, $0 expire on December 31, 2024. These NOLs are subject\nto compliance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Code”), as amended.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s gross deferred tax asset was $39,893. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $714,\nresulting in a net deferred tax asset of $39,179, before deferred tax liabilities of $34,434. The Company has provided a valuation allowance\nagainst a portion of the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, because the ultimate realization of those assets does not meet the\nmore-likely-than-not criteria. Part of the Company’s deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes.\nIf a change in control were to occur, these could be limited under Section 382 of the Code.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $18,000 in U.S. net deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets are expected to reverse\ninto NOL carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. At this time, we\nconsider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in future periods that will allow us to realize these deferred tax\nassets. However, unless we can generate sufficient taxable income from our future operations, a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S.\ndeferred tax assets may be required, which would materially increase our income tax expense in the period the allowance is recognized and\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial position.\n41\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nMANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nCredit Agreement\nUpon the closing of the sale of the Precision Sport segment on February 29, 2024, the Company terminated and settled all outstanding\nborrowings on our revolving credit facility and term debt under the Restated Credit Agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not engage in any transactions or have relationships or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere has not been any material change in the market risk disclosure contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Executive\nChairman and Chief Financial Officer, its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, of the effectiveness of the\ndesign and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e) under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”)) as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.\nSuch disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated\nand communicated to the appropriate management on a basis that permits timely decisions regarding disclosure. Based upon that\nevaluation, the Company’s Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of September 30, 2024, were effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nthat has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n42\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved in various legal disputes and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Based on currently available information, and except as disclosed herein, the Company does not believe that the existence of any\nof the legal disputes the Company or its subsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”)\nmatter discussed below. It is possible that, as additional information becomes available, the impact on the Company of an adverse\ndetermination could have a different effect. See also Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”.\nLitigation\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits arising from time to time that the Company considers ordinary routine litigation incidental to\nits business. Amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs (damages and/or settlement amounts) in connection with\npending litigation and claims and related anticipated legal fees and other expenses or costs for defending such actions, which legal fees and\nexpenses or costs are expensed as incurred. The costs are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount\ncan be reasonably estimated. The accruals are based upon the Company’s assessment, after consultation with counsel (if deemed\nappropriate), of probable loss based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature of the claim made, the\nnature of the damages sought and any relevant information about the plaintiffs and other significant factors that vary by case. When it is not\npossible to estimate a specific expected cost to be incurred, the Company evaluates the range of probable loss and records the minimum\nend of the range. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the disposition\nof any of the legal disputes the Company or its subsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except for the CPSC matter discussed below. There is a reasonable\npossibility of loss from contingencies in excess of the amounts accrued by the Company in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets; however, the actual amounts of such possible losses cannot currently be reasonably estimated by the Company at this time.\nIt is possible that, as additional information becomes available, the impact on the Company could have a different effect.\nProduct Liability\nAs a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces the risk of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for\nsubstantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. The\nCompany is therefore vulnerable to various personal injury and property damage lawsuits relating to its products and incidental to its\nbusiness.\nExcept as disclosed herein, there are no pending product liability claims and lawsuits of the Company, which the Company believes in the\naggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, brand reputation, liquidity, stock price, consolidated financial\nposition, results of operations and/or cash flows. See also Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”.\nU.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission\nIn January 2021, Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. (“BDEL”) wrote to the CPSC outlining its new cradle solution for certain models of its\navalanche beacon transceivers to prevent such transceivers from switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode. The proposed new cradle\nsolution was designed to improve transceiver safety by locking the transceiver into “send” mode prior to use so that it would not switch\nunexpectedly out of “send” mode. BDEL also requested approval for the CPSC Fast-Track Program for a voluntary product recall to\nimplement this cradle solution. The CPSC approved the recall and entered into a Corrective Action Plan agreement with BDEL in March\n2021. BDEL received a letter from the CPSC, dated October 28, 2021, stating that the CPSC is investigating whether BDEL has timely\ncomplied with the reporting\n43\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nrequirements of Section 15(b) of the Consumer Protection Safety Act and related regulations regarding certain models of avalanche\ntransceivers switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode.\nSeparately, on April 21, 2022, BDEL filed a Section 15(b) report and applied for Fast-Track consideration for a voluntary recall, consisting\nof free repair or replacement of such malfunctioning models of avalanche transceivers, which would not switch from “send” mode to\n“search” mode due to an electronic malfunction in the reed switch or foil. The CPSC approved the recall and entered into a Corrective\nAction Plan agreement with BDEL in August 2022. BDEL received a letter from the CPSC, dated January 17, 2023, stating that the CPSC\nis investigating whether BDEL has timely complied with the reporting requirements of Section 15(b) of the Consumer Protection Safety\nAct and related regulations regarding the malfunction in the reed switch or foil in certain models of avalanche transceivers switching out of\n“search” mode. BDEL responded to the CPSC’s investigation by letter dated March 31, 2023, accompanied with documents responsive to\nthe CPSC’s requests. The CPSC asked for further clarification and documents, and BDEL sent a responsive letter accompanied by\nadditional documents on June 23, 2023. On September 6, 2023, the CPSC requested further clarification and information regarding the reed\nswitch issue, to which BDEL responded on October 6 and 13, 2023.\nBy letters dated October 12, 2023 and December 18, 2023, BDEL was notified by the CPSC that the agency staff had concluded BDEL\nfailed to timely meet our statutory reporting obligations under the Consumer Product Safety Act with respect to certain models of BDEL’s\navalanche transceivers switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode and certain models of BDEL’s avalanche transceivers not switching\nfrom “send” mode into “search” mode, that BDEL made a material misrepresentation in a report to the CPSC, and that the agency staff\nintends to recommend that the CPSC impose civil monetary penalties of $16,135,000 and $9,000,000, respectively, for the two matters\ndescribed above.\nOn November 20, 2023 and February 8, 2024, respectively, BDEL submitted a comprehensive response disputing the CPSC’s findings and\nconclusions in the October 12, 2023 and December 18, 2023 letters, including the amount of any potential penalties. The CPSC ultimately\ndisagreed with our position and the agency staff has restated their recommendation for the monetary penalties which the Company intends\nto strongly contest and vigorously defend against.\nJohn C. Walbrecht, the former President of BDEL and the Company, received a letter from the CPSC dated June 25, 2024 alleging that in\nhis personal capacity he knowingly violated the Consumer Product Safety Act by failing to timely report the occurrence resulting in\nbeacons switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode. The staff of the CPSC recommended a $5,000,000 fine against Mr. Walbrecht\npersonally. Pursuant to the Company’s by-laws, the Company has agreed to indemnify Mr. Walbrecht and pay his legal fees, and he has\nprovided an undertaking to the Company that the Company will be entitled to recover those expenses if it is ultimately determined that he\nwas not entitled to indemnification. On August 26, 2024, Mr. Walbrecht’s independent counsel responded to the CPSC, denying the\nallegations of its June 25 letter and rejecting its demand for a penalty.\nBased on currently available information, the Company believes an unfavorable outcome with the CPSC is probable, however, we cannot\nbe sure on what terms this matter will be resolved. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a liability of\n$2,500,000 representing the low end of the range of our estimated exposure. The Company does not have a better estimate of the loss;\ntherefore the low-end of the range was recorded as an accrued liability during the first quarter of 2024 and a corresponding expense is\nincluded in legal costs and regulatory matter expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. of the Company’s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nITEM 5.

STATEMENTS**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\nNOTE 1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Clarus Corporation and subsidiaries (which may be referred to as the “Company,” “Clarus,” “we,” “us” or “our”) as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, except otherwise disclosed) necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been included. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be obtained for the year ending December 31, 2024. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 7, 2024.\n\nNature of Business\n\nHeadquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, we are a global leader in the design and development of best-in-class equipment and lifestyle products for outdoor enthusiasts. Driven by our rich history of engineering and innovation, our objective is to provide safe, simple, effective and beautiful products so that our customers can maximize their outdoor pursuits and adventures. Each of our brands has a long history of continuous product innovation for core and everyday users alike. The Company’s products are principally sold globally under the Black Diamond®, Rhino-Rack®, MAXTRAX®, and TRED Outdoors® brand names through outdoor specialty and online retailers, our own websites, distributors and original equipment manufacturers.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The more significant estimates relate to the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations, provision for excess or obsolete inventory, allowance for credit losses, and valuation of contingent consideration liabilities, deferred tax assets, long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and other intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience, projected future cash flows, and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n​\n\n**Reclassifications**\n\n​\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation. Specifically, legal costs associated with specific legal matters which were recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses are now presented in legal costs and regulatory matter expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See Note 16 for discussion regarding legal matters.\n\n​\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\n _Accounting Pronouncements issued and not yet adopted_\n\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, _Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures_ , which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable \n\n9\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\nsegment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are effective for all public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the enhanced disclosure requirements; however, it does not anticipate a material change to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, _Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures_ , which requires a public entity to disclose in its rate reconciliation table additional categories of information about federal, state and foreign income taxes and provide more details about the reconciling items in some categories if items meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance will require all entities to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds, disaggregated by federal (national), state and foreign taxes for annual periods and to disaggregate the information by jurisdiction based on a quantitative threshold. The guidance makes several other changes to the disclosure requirements. All entities are required to apply the guidance prospectively, with the option to apply it retrospectively. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the enhanced disclosure requirements; however, it does not anticipate a material change to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS\n\n _TRED_\n\nOn September 13, 2023, Clarus entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “TRED Purchase Agreement”) to acquire TRED Outdoors Pty Ltd. (“TRED”), which subsequently closed on October 9, 2023. All United States dollar amounts contained herein are based on the exchange rates in effect for Australian dollars ($AUD) and the market value of the Company’s common stock at the time of closing of the acquisition of TRED (the “TRED Acquisition”).\n\nThe Company acquired TRED for an aggregate purchase price of $AUD 10,741 (approximately $6,849), subject to a post-closing adjustment, comprised of $AUD 8,875 (approximately $5,659) cash, 179 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $1,069, and additional consideration described below. The TRED Purchase Agreement provides for the payment of additional contingent consideration of up to $AUD 1,000 (approximately $638) in cash upon the satisfaction of certain net sales targets (the “TRED Contingent Consideration”). The Company estimated the initial fair value of the TRED Contingent Consideration to be $AUD 189 (approximately $121) and recorded this liability within accrued liabilities. See Note 11 for discussion regarding the valuation of the TRED Contingent Consideration as of September 30, 2024. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.\n\nThe Company believes the acquisition of TRED will provide the Company with a greater combined global revenue base, increased gross margins, profitability and free cash flows, and access to increased liquidity to further acquire and grow businesses.\n\nThe following table is a reconciliation to the fair value of the purchase consideration and how the purchase consideration is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed which have been estimated at their fair values. The fair value measurements for the acquisition of TRED have been completed. The excess of purchase consideration over the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill for TRED is included in the Adventure segment. The goodwill consists largely of the growth and profitability expected from the acquisition.\n\n​\n\n10\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **TRED**  \n​| ​| **October 9, 2023**  \n​| ​| **Number of Shares**|  ​| **Estimated Fair Value**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Cash paid**|  ​|  -| ​| $|  5,659  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Issuance of shares of Clarus Corporation**|  ​|  179| ​| ​|  1,069  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Contingent consideration**|  ​|  -| ​| ​|  121  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Total purchase consideration**|  ​|  179| ​| $|  6,849  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Assets acquired and liabilities assumed**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCash| ​| ​| ​| $|  11  \nAccounts receivable| ​| ​| ​| ​|  1,000  \nInventories| ​| ​| ​| ​|  1,006  \nPrepaid and other current assets| ​| ​| ​| ​|  11  \nProperty and equipment| ​| ​| ​| ​|  195  \nOther intangible assets| ​| ​| ​| ​|  3,305  \nGoodwill| ​| ​| ​| ​|  2,832  \n**Total assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​|  8,360  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Liabilities**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities| ​| ​| ​| ​|  638  \nDeferred income taxes| ​| ​| ​| ​|  873  \n**Total liabilities**|  ​| ​| ​| ​|  1,511  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Net Book Value Acquired**|  ​| ​| ​| $|  6,849  \n  \n​\n\nThe estimated fair value of inventory was recorded at expected sales price less cost to sell plus a reasonable profit margin for selling efforts.\n\n​\n\n11\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\nIn connection with the acquisitions, the Company acquired exclusive rights to TRED’s trademarks, customer relationships, product technologies, and tradenames.

No pre-existing relationships existed between the Company and TRED or its sellers prior to the acquisition. TRED revenue and operating income are included in the Adventure segment. Total revenue and net income of TRED from the date of acquisition to December 31, 2023 were not material to the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\n​\n\n**NOTE 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**\n\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company and Everest/Sapphire Acquisition, LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the sale to Bullseye Acquisitions, LLC, an affiliate of JDH Capital Company, of all of the equity associated with the Company’s Precision Sport segment, comprised of the Company’s subsidiaries Sierra and Barnes, pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of December 29, 2023, by and among, Bullseye Acquisitions, LLC, Everest/Sapphire Acquisition, LLC and the Company (the “Precision Sport Purchase Agreement”). The Precision Sport segment engaged in the business of designing, developing, manufacturing, and marketing bullets and ammunition to the military, law enforcement, and commercial/consumer markets. Under the terms of the Precision Sport Purchase Agreement, the Buyer agreed to pay $175,000 in cash, which was subject to a customary working capital adjustment. The Company received $175,674 in cash under the terms of the Precision Sport Purchase Agreement, which included a preliminary working capital adjustment. As of September 30, 2024, the working capital adjustment had been finalized, with no changes from the preliminary working capital adjustment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain on such sale of $40,585.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe Company’s primary exchange rate risk management objective is to mitigate the uncertainty of anticipated cash flows attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company primarily focuses on mitigating changes in cash flows resulting from sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages this risk primarily by using currency forward and option contracts. If the anticipated transactions are deemed probable, the resulting relationships are formally designated as cash flow hedges. The Company accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges and tests effectiveness by determining whether changes in the expected cash flow of the derivative offset, within a range, changes in the expected cash flow of the hedged item.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company’s derivative contracts had remaining maturities of less than one year. The counterparties to these transactions had both long-term and short-term investment grade credit ratings. The maximum net exposure of the Company’s credit risk to the counterparties is generally limited to the aggregate unrealized loss of all contracts with that counterparty, which was $13 as of September 30, 2024. The Company’s exposure of counterparty credit risk is limited to the aggregate unrealized gain on all contracts. As of September 30, 2024, there was no such exposure to the counterparties. The Company’s derivative counterparties have strong credit ratings and as a result, the Company does not require collateral to facilitate transactions.\n\nThe Company held the following contracts designated as hedging instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n​| **September 30, 2024**  \n​| Notional| Latest   \n​| Amount| ​| Maturity  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \nForeign exchange contracts - Canadian Dollars| $3,574| ​| February 2025  \nForeign exchange contracts - Euros| € 13,296| ​| August 2025  \n  \n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n​| **December 31, 2023**  \n​| Notional| Latest   \n​| Amount| ​| Maturity  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \nForeign exchange contracts - Canadian Dollars| $7,925| ​| February 2025  \nForeign exchange contracts - Euros| € 20,612| ​| February 2025  \n  \n​\n\nFor contracts that qualify as effective hedge instruments, the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the instruments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to sales in the period the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in earnings.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, under a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\n\nLevel 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\nLevel 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n\nLevel 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are based on prices or valuation techniques that are unobservable.\n\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **September 30, 2024**  \n​| **Level 1**| **Level 2**| **Level 3**| **Total**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDesignated forward exchange contracts| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  34| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  34  \n​| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  34| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  34  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Liabilities**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDesignated forward exchange contracts| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  47| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  47  \n​| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  47| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  47  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n​| ​| **December 31, 2023**  \n​| **Level 1**| **Level 2**| **Level 3**| **Total**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Assets**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDesignated forward exchange contracts| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  -  \n​| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  -  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Liabilities**|  ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDesignated forward exchange contracts| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  256| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  256  \nContingent consideration liabilities| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  129| ​| $|  129  \n​| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  256| ​| $|  129| ​| $|  385  \n  \n​\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value based on current market pricing models. No nonrecurring fair value measurements existed at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company estimated the initial fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities primarily using the Monte-Carlo pricing model. Significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation included a discount rate of 11.5%. Contingent consideration liabilities are subsequently remeasured at the estimated fair value at the end of each reporting period using \n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\nfinancial projections of the acquired company, such as sales-based milestones and estimated probabilities of achievement, with the change in fair value recognized in contingent consideration benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for such period. We measure the initial liability and remeasure the liability on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs as defined under authoritative guidance for fair value measurements.\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in contingent consideration liabilities:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---  \n​| **TRED**  \n​| ​| ​  \nBalance at December 31, 2023| **$**|  129  \n​| ​| ​  \nFair value adjustments| ​|  (125)  \nImpact of foreign currency exchange rates| ​|  (4)  \n​| ​| ​  \nBalance at September 30, 2024| $|  -  \n  \n​\n\nAs the contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured to fair value each reporting period, significant increases or decreases in projected sales, discount rates or the time until payment is made could result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. Our determination of fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities could change in future periods based on our ongoing evaluation of these significant unobservable inputs. As of September 30, 2024, the net sales threshold required for the payment of the TRED contingent consideration is not expected to be met.\n\n​\n\nNOTE 12. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n\nOn August 6, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program of $0.025 per share of the Company’s common stock (the “Quarterly Cash Dividend”) or $0.10 per share on an annualized basis. The declaration and payment of future Quarterly Cash Dividends is subject to the discretion of and approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. On November 6, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the payment on November 27, 2024 of the Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.025 to the record holders of shares of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on November 18, 2024.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNOTE 13. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\n\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing earnings (loss) by the total of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period, plus the effect of dilutive outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock grants. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share if their effect is anti-dilutive to the loss from continuing operations.\n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\nThe following table is a reconciliation of basic and diluted shares of common stock outstanding used in the calculation of earnings (loss) per share:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Three Months Ended**|  ​| **Nine Months Ended**  \n​| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic| ​|  38,352| ​| ​|  37,470| ​| ​|  38,286| ​| ​|  37,267  \nEffect of dilutive stock awards| ​|  -| ​| ​|  -| ​| ​|  -| ​| ​|  -  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted| ​|  38,352| ​| ​|  37,470| ​| ​|  38,286| ​| ​|  37,267  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nLoss from continuing operations per share:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nBasic| $|  (0.08)| ​| $|  (0.06)| ​| $|  (0.39)| ​| $|  (0.23)  \nDiluted| ​|  (0.08)| ​| ​|  (0.06)| ​| ​|  (0.39)| ​| ​|  (0.23)  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nIncome from discontinued operations per share:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nBasic| $|  -| ​| $|  0.03| ​| $|  0.74| ​| $|  0.18  \nDiluted| ​|  -| ​| ​|  0.03| ​| ​|  0.74| ​| ​|  0.18  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet (loss) income per share:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nBasic| $|  (0.08)| ​| $|  (0.03)| ​| $|  0.35| ​| $|  (0.05)  \nDiluted| ​|  (0.08)| ​| ​|  (0.03)| ​| ​|  0.35| ​| ​|  (0.05)  \n  \n​\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, equity awards of 5,762 and 4,922, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, equity awards of 5,217 and 5,613, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of earnings (loss) per share for these periods as they were anti-dilutive.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNOTE 14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN\n\nUnder the Company’s current 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”), the Company’s Board of Directors has flexibility to determine the type and amount of awards to be granted to eligible participants, who must be employees, directors, officers or consultants of the Company or its subsidiaries. The 2015 Plan allows for grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, and restricted units. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be granted through awards under the 2015 Plan to any employee in any calendar year may not exceed 500 shares. The 2015 Plan will continue in effect until December 2025 unless terminated sooner.\n\n​\n\n**Options Granted:**\n\n​\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company issued stock options for an aggregate of 1,240 shares under the 2015 Plan to directors and employees of the Company. Of the 1,240 options, 1,140 options vest and become exercisable over a period of two years and 100 vest in four equal consecutive quarterly tranches from the date of grant. All of the issued stock options expire ten years from the date of the grant. \n\n​\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\nFor computing the fair value of the stock-based awards, the fair value of each option grant has been estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:\n\n​\n\n**Options Granted During the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---  \nNumber of options| ​| 1,240  \nOption vesting period| ​| 1 - 2 Years  \nGrant price (per share)| ​| $6.75 - $6.81  \nDividend yield| ​| 1.47% - 1.48%  \nExpected volatility (a)| ​| 50.3% - 51.9%  \nRisk-free interest rate| ​| 4.08% - 4.57%  \nExpected life (years) (b)| ​| 5.31 - 5.75  \nWeighted average fair value (per share)| ​| $3.06 - $3.12  \n  \n​\n\n(a)| Expected volatility is based upon the Company’s historical volatility.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n(b)| The expected term was determined based upon the underlying terms of the awards and the category and employment history of employee award recipient.  \n---|---  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\nThe grant date fair value of the stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $3,798, which will be recognized over the vesting period of the options.\n\nRestricted Stock Awards Granted:\n\nOn March 11, 2024, the Company issued and granted employees restricted stock awards of 100 restricted shares under the 2015 Plan, of which 50 and 50 shares will vest and become nonforfeitable on each March 11, 2025 and March 11, 2026, respectively. As these restricted stock awards vest over time, the fair value of the restricted stock was estimated as of the date of grant using the grant price of $6.75 per share. The grant date fair value of the restricted stock awards was approximately $675 which will be amortized over the expected term of 2 years.\n\nThe total non-cash stock compensation expense for continuing operations related to restricted stock, stock options and stock awards recorded by the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1,547 and $1,151, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $4,253 and $3,923, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the majority of stock-based compensation costs were classified as selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were 1,146 unvested stock options and unrecognized compensation cost of $2,849 related to unvested stock options, as well as 1,600 unvested restricted stock awards and unrecognized compensation costs of $5,249 related to unvested restricted stock awards.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNOTE 15. RESTRUCTURING\n\nStarting in 2023, the Company began incurring expenses to facilitate long-term sustainable growth through cost reduction actions, consisting of employee reductions, facility rationalization and contract termination costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $478 and $1,076, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $1,009 and $1,812, respectively, of restructuring charges related to these actions. The Company has incurred $4,232 of cumulative restructuring charges since the commencement of restructuring actions in 2023. The Company accrues for restructuring costs when they are probable and reasonably estimable. These costs include severance costs, exit costs, and other restructuring costs and are included in restructuring \n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\ncharges in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Severance costs primarily consist of severance benefits through payroll continuation, conditional separation costs and employer tax liabilities, while exit costs primarily consist of lease exit and contract termination costs. Other costs consist primarily of costs related to the discontinuance of certain product lines and are distinguishable and directly attributable to the Company’s restructuring initiative and not a result of external market factors associated with the ongoing business. We estimate that we will continue to incur restructuring costs related to employee-related costs and facility exit costs during the year 2024; however, the Company cannot estimate the total amount expected to be incurred as cost reduction actions continue to be evaluated. The Company anticipates completing these restructuring activities in 2025. \n\nThe following table summarizes the restructuring charges, payments and the remaining liabilities related to restructuring costs at September 30, 2024, which are included within accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| ​| **Outdoor**|  ​| **Adventure**|  ​| **Corporate**|  ​| **Total**  \nBalance at December 31, 2023| ​| **$**|  1,246| ​| **$**|  -| ​| **$**|  -| ​| **$**|  1,246  \nCharges to expense:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nEmployee termination benefits| ​| ​|  544| ​| ​|  449| ​| ​|  -| ​| ​|  993  \nExit costs| ​| ​|  16| ​| ​|  -| ​| ​|  -| ​| ​|  16  \nTotal restructuring charges| ​| $|  560| ​| $|  449| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  1,009  \nCash payments and non-cash charges:| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCash payments| ​| ​|  (1,616)| ​| ​|  (348)| ​| ​|  -| ​| ​|  (1,964)  \nAsset impairments| ​| ​|  (23)| ​| ​|  -| ​| ​|  -| ​| ​|  (23)  \nBalance at September 30, 2024| ​| $|  167| ​| $|  101| ​| $|  -| ​| $|  268  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNOTE 16. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL MATTERS\n\nAs a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces the risk of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for substantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. The Company is therefore vulnerable to various personal injury and property damage lawsuits relating to its products and incidental to its business.\n\nThe Company is involved in various legal disputes and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Anticipated costs related to litigation matters are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the disposition of any of the legal disputes the Company or its subsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) matter discussed below. There is a reasonable possibility of loss from contingencies in excess of the amounts accrued by the Company in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets; however, the actual amounts of such possible losses cannot currently be reasonably estimated by the Company. It is possible that, as additional information becomes available, the Company may subsequently determine that it may incur losses from such contingencies materially in excess of the amounts initially accrued by the Company which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, stock price, consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. \n\n​\n\nLegal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) except as described below. See Part II, Item 1. “Legal Proceedings.”\n\n​\n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\nU.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission\n\nIn January 2021, Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. (“BDEL”) wrote to the CPSC outlining its new cradle solution for certain models of its avalanche beacon transceivers to prevent such transceivers from switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode. The proposed new cradle solution was designed to improve transceiver safety by locking the transceiver into “send” mode prior to use so that it would not switch unexpectedly out of “send” mode. BDEL also requested approval for the CPSC Fast-Track Program for a voluntary product recall to implement this cradle solution. The CPSC approved the recall and entered into a Corrective Action Plan agreement with BDEL in March 2021. BDEL received a letter from the CPSC, dated October 28, 2021, stating that the CPSC is investigating whether BDEL has timely complied with the reporting requirements of Section 15(b) of the Consumer Protection Safety Act and related regulations regarding certain models of avalanche transceivers switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode.\n\nSeparately, on April 21, 2022, BDEL filed a Section 15(b) report and applied for Fast-Track consideration for a voluntary recall, consisting of free repair or replacement of such malfunctioning models of avalanche transceivers, which would not switch from “send” mode to “search” mode due to an electronic malfunction in the reed switch or foil. The CPSC approved the recall and entered into a Corrective Action Plan agreement with BDEL in August 2022. BDEL received a letter from the CPSC, dated January 17, 2023, stating that the CPSC is investigating whether BDEL has timely complied with the reporting requirements of Section 15(b) of the Consumer Protection Safety Act and related regulations regarding the malfunction in the reed switch or foil in certain models of avalanche transceivers switching out of “search” mode. BDEL responded to the CPSC’s investigation by letter dated March 31, 2023, accompanied with documents responsive to the CPSC’s requests. The CPSC asked for further clarification and documents, and BDEL sent a responsive letter accompanied by additional documents on June 23, 2023. On September 6, 2023, the CPSC requested further clarification and information regarding the reed switch issue, to which BDEL responded on October 6 and 13, 2023.\n\nBy letters dated October 12, 2023 and December 18, 2023, BDEL was notified by the CPSC that the agency staff has concluded BDEL failed to timely meet our statutory reporting obligations under the Consumer Product Safety Act with respect to certain models of BDEL’s avalanche transceivers switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode and certain models of BDEL’s avalanche transceivers not switching from “send” mode into “search” mode, that BDEL made a material misrepresentation in a report to the CPSC, and that the agency staff intends to recommend that the CPSC impose civil monetary penalties of $16,135 and $9,000, respectively, for the two matters described above. \n\nOn November 20, 2023 and February 8, 2024, respectively, BDEL submitted a comprehensive response disputing the CPSC’s findings and conclusions in the October 12, 2023 and December 18, 2023 letters, including the amount of any potential penalties. The CPSC ultimately disagreed with our position and the agency staff has restated their recommendation for the monetary penalties which the Company intends to strongly contest and vigorously defend against.\n\nJohn C. Walbrecht, the former President of BDEL and the Company, received a letter from the CPSC dated June 25, 2024 alleging that in his personal capacity he knowingly violated the Consumer Product Safety Act by failing to timely report the occurrence resulting in beacons switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode. The staff of the CPSC recommended a $5,000 fine against Mr. Walbrecht personally. Pursuant to the Company’s by-laws, the Company has agreed to indemnify Mr. Walbrecht and pay his legal fees, and he has provided an undertaking to the Company that the Company will be entitled to recover those expenses if it is ultimately determined that he was not entitled to indemnification. On August 26, 2024, Mr. Walbrecht’s independent counsel responded to the CPSC, denying the allegations of its June 25 letter and rejecting its demand for a penalty.\n\nBased on currently available information, the Company believes an unfavorable outcome with the CPSC is probable, however, we cannot reasonably estimate on what terms this matter will be resolved. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a liability of $2,500 representing the low end of the range of our estimated exposure. The Company does not have a better estimate of the loss; therefore the low-end of the range was recorded as an \n\n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\naccrued liability during the first quarter of 2024 and a corresponding expense is included in legal costs and regulatory matter expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). \n\nWe believe it is reasonably possible that a change in our ability to estimate the amount of loss could occur in the near term and that the change in the estimate could be material. In addition, as this matter is ongoing, the Company is currently unable to predict its duration, resources required or outcome, or the impact it may have on the Company’s liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. Any penalties imposed by the CPSC or other regulators, could be costly to us and could damage our business and reputation as well as have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, stock price, consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred legal expenses of $194 and $53, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred legal expenses of $579 and $216, respectively, in efforts to resolve this matter. These legal expenses are included in legal costs and regulatory matter expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). \n\nClarus Corporation v. HAP Trading, LLC and Harsh A. Padia\n\nOn September 23, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against HAP Trading, LLC and Harsh A. Padia (“HAP Trading”), seeking disgorgement of profits from transactions in the Company’s common stock and related derivative securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\nClarus Corporation v. Caption Management, LLC, et al. \n\nOn March 8, 2024, the Company filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Caption Management, LLC, Caption Partners II LP, Caption GP, LLC, William Cooper and Jason Strasser (“Caption Management”), seeking disgorgement of profits from transactions in the Company’s stock and related derivative securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. \n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company incurred legal expenses of $200 and $526, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred legal expenses of $716 and $846, respectively, in the efforts to bring the cases against HAP Trading and Caption Management to trial. These legal expenses are included in legal costs and regulatory matter expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNOTE 17. INCOME TAXES\n\nThe Company’s U.S. federal statutory tax rate is 21% and its foreign operations have statutory tax rates of approximately 23% in Austria, 28% in New Zealand, and 30% in Australia.\n\nThe difference between the Company’s estimated effective tax rate benefit of 17.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% was primarily due to the impact of stock compensation and research and experimentation expenditures and credits in the third quarter of 2024. \n\nThe difference between the Company’s estimated effective tax rate benefit of 17.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% was primarily due to the impact of stock compensation and research and experimentation expenditures and credits in the first three quarters of 2024.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s gross deferred tax asset was $39,893. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $714, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $39,179, before deferred tax liabilities of $34,434. The Company \n\n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\nhas provided a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, because the ultimate realization of those assets did not meet the more-likely-than-not criteria. Part of the Company’s deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) for federal tax purposes. If a change in control were to occur, these could be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Code”), as amended.\n\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and net operating loss and credit carryforwards expire. The estimates and judgments associated with the Company’s valuation allowance on deferred tax assets are considered critical due to the amount of deferred tax assets recorded by the Company on its consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining the Company’s future taxable income. The need for a valuation allowance is reassessed at each interim reporting period.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $18,000 in U.S. net deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets are expected to reverse into NOL carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. At this time, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in future periods that will allow us to realize these deferred tax assets. However, unless we can generate sufficient taxable income from our future operations, a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S. deferred tax assets may be required, which would materially increase our income tax expense in the period the allowance is recognized and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial position.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had NOLs and research and experimentation credit for U.S. federal income tax purposes of $7,699 and $2,997, respectively. The Company believes its U.S. Federal NOLs will offset a portion of its future U.S. Federal income taxes.\n\nNOLs available to offset taxable income, subject to compliance with Section 382 of the Code, begin to expire based upon the following schedule:\n\n​\n\n​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Net Operating Loss Carryforward Expiration Dates**  \n**December 31, 2023**  \n​| ​| ​| ​  \n**Expiration Dates December 31,**| **Net Operating Loss Amount**  \n2024| ​| $|  -  \n2025| ​| ​|  -  \n2026| ​| ​|  -  \n2027 and beyond| ​| ​|  7,699  \nTotal| ​| $|  7,699  \n  \n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nNOTE 18. SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nWe operate our business structure within two segments. These segments are defined based on the internal financial reporting used by our chief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance. Certain significant selling and general and administrative expenses are not allocated to the segments including non-cash stock compensation expense. Each segment is described below:\n\n●| Our Outdoor segment, which includes Black Diamond Equipment and PIEPS, is a global leader in designing, manufacturing, and marketing innovative outdoor engineered equipment and apparel for climbing, mountaineering, trail running, backpacking, skiing, and a wide range of other year-round outdoor recreation   \n---|---  \n  \n28\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED**\n\n**(Unaudited)**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\nactivities.

Similarly, TRED, founded in 2012, is a trusted brand for key retailers and distributors in the overlanding and off-road vehicle recovery market.\n\nClarus, incorporated in Delaware in 1991, acquired Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. in May 2010 and changed its name to Black Diamond, Inc. in January 2011. In October 2012, we acquired PIEPS Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries. On August 14, 2017, the Company changed its name from Black Diamond, Inc. to Clarus Corporation and its stock ticker symbol from “BDE” to “CLAR” on the NASDAQ stock exchange.\n\nOn August 21, 2017, the Company acquired Sierra Bullets, L.L.C. (“Sierra”). On November 6, 2018, the Company acquired the assets of SKINourishment, Inc. (“SKINourishment”). During the first quarter of 2024, the Company ceased operations of SKINourishment. On October 2, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities constituting the Barnes business (“Barnes”). On July 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Australia-based Rhino-Rack Holdings Pty Ltd (“Rhino-Rack”). On December 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Australia-based MaxTrax Australia Pty Ltd (“MAXTRAX”). On October 9, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Australia-based TRED Outdoors Pty Ltd. (“TRED”).\n\nOn February 29, 2024, the Company completed the sale of all of the equity associated with the Company’s Precision Sport segment, comprised of the Company’s subsidiaries Sierra and Barnes, pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of December 29, 2023 (the “Precision Sport Purchase Agreement”). Under the terms of the Precision Sport Purchase Agreement, the Company received approximately $175,674 in cash in exchange for all of the equity associated with the Company’s Precision Sport segment. The activities of the Precision Sport segment have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for financial information regarding discontinued operations.\n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\nOn August 6, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program of $0.025 per share of the Company’s common stock (the “Quarterly Cash Dividend”) or $0.10 per share on an annualized basis. The declaration and payment of future Quarterly Cash Dividends is subject to the discretion of and approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. On November 6, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the payment on November 27, 2024 of the Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.025 to the record holders of shares of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on November 18, 2024.\n\n**Restructuring**\n\nStarting in 2023, the Company began incurring expenses to facilitate long-term sustainable growth through cost reduction actions, consisting of employee reductions, facility rationalization and contract termination costs. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $478 and $1,076, respectively, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $1,009 and $1,812, respectively, of restructuring charges related to these actions. The Company has incurred $4,232 of cumulative restructuring charges since the commencement of restructuring actions in 2023. The Company accrues for restructuring costs when they are probable and reasonably estimable. These costs include severance costs, exit costs, and other restructuring costs and are included in restructuring charges in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Severance costs primarily consist of severance benefits through payroll continuation, conditional separation costs and employer tax liabilities, while exit costs primarily consist of lease exit and contract termination costs. Other costs consist primarily of costs related to the discontinuance of certain product lines and are distinguishable and directly attributable to the Company’s restructuring initiative and not a result of external market factors associated with the ongoing business. We estimate that we will continue to incur restructuring costs related to employee-related costs and facility exit costs during the year 2024; however, the Company cannot estimate the total amount expected to be incurred as cost reduction actions continue to be evaluated. The Company anticipates completing these restructuring activities in 2025.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\n\nManagement’s discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based on the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our critical accounting policies that require the use of estimates and assumptions were discussed in detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nNo impairments were recorded for goodwill or intangible assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. However, factors such as a sustained decline in revenues and cash flows, or other adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, including our current and future share price, could result in an impairment charge to our Adventure reporting unit in a future reporting period. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nAt this time, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in future periods that will allow us to realize our deferred tax assets. However, unless we can generate sufficient taxable income from our future operations, a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S. deferred tax assets may be required, which would materially increase our income tax expense in the period the allowance is recognized and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial position.\n\nThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**\n\nSee “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.\n\nResults of Operations\n\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\n\nThe following presents a discussion of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n​| **Three Months Ended**  \n​| **September 30, 2024**| **September 30, 2023**  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nSales| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDomestic sales| $|  24,365| ​| $|  30,423  \nInternational sales| ​|  42,750| ​| ​|  50,879  \nTotal sales| ​|  67,115| ​| ​|  81,302  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nCost of goods sold| ​|  43,618| ​| ​|  54,018  \nGross profit| ​|  23,497| ​| ​|  27,284  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating expenses| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nSelling, general and administrative| ​|  27,880| ​| ​|  28,404  \nRestructuring charges| ​|  478| ​| ​|  1,076  \nTransaction costs| ​|  103| ​| ​|  400  \nLegal costs and regulatory matter expenses| ​|  394| ​| ​|  579  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTotal operating expenses| ​|  28,855| ​| ​|  30,459  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOperating loss| ​|  (5,358)| ​| ​|  (3,175)  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nOther income (expense)| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nInterest income, net| ​|  373| ​| ​|  19  \nOther, net| ​|  1,164| ​| ​|  (445)  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nTotal other income (expense), net| ​|  1,537| ​| ​|  (426)  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nLoss before income tax| ​|  (3,821)| ​| ​|  (3,601)  \nIncome tax benefit| ​|  (664)| ​| ​|  (1,395)  \nLoss from continuing operations| ​|  (3,157)| ​| ​|  (2,206)  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nDiscontinued operations, net of tax| ​|  -| ​| ​|  942  \n​| ​| ​| ​| ​| ​  \nNet loss| $|  (3,157)| ​| $|  (1,264)  \n  \n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\n​\n\nSales\n\nTotal sales decreased $14,187, or 17.4%, to $67,115 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to total sales of $81,302 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in sales was attributable to a decrease in sales at the Outdoor and Adventure segments of $11,789 and $2,398, respectively.\n\nSales in the Adventure segment increased by $281 due to foreign exchange impact from the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period. Sales in the Outdoor segment were reduced by $13 due to foreign exchange impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily against the euro during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior period. \n\nSales in the Outdoor segment decreased due to weakness in our North American wholesale and direct to consumer (“DTC”) channels, independent global distributor (“IGD”) customers, and softness in our European markets, combined with the effects from our product simplification and SKU rationalization strategy. Sales in the Adventure segment decreased due to lower demand from original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers and challenging wholesale in the Australia and US markets, partially offset by a $1,237 increase from the TRED Outdoors acquisition.\n\nDomestic sales decreased $6,058, or 19.9%, to $24,365 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to domestic sales of $30,423 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The decrease in sales was attributable to decreases at the Outdoor and Adventure segments of $6,536 and $1,593, respectively.\n\nCost of Goods Sold\n\nCost of goods sold decreased $10,400, or 19.3%, to $43,618 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cost of goods sold of $54,018 during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nGross Profit\n\nGross profit decreased $3,787, or 13.9%, to $23,497 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to gross profit of $27,284 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin was 35.0% during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gross margin of 33.6% during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross margin during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the prior year as a result of favorable product mix at the Outdoor segment, as well as a favorable channel mix due to lower OEM sales and higher MAXTRAX revenue at the Adventure segment. These increases were partially offset by an increase in polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) related inventory reserve expenses at the Outdoor segment, as well as sales return reserve and rebate expenses at the Adventure segment.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $524, or 1.8%, to $27,880 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of $28,404 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses at the Outdoor segment decreased by $1,688 primarily as a result of lower retail expenses due to store closures and other expense reduction initiatives to manage costs.

We plan to fund these activities through a combination of our future operating cash flows and cash on hand. Upon the closing of the sale of the Precision Sport segment, the Company terminated and settled all outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and term debt under the Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party thereto (the “Restated Credit Agreement”). We believe that our liquidity requirements and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months will be adequately covered by cash provided by operations and cash on hand. Additionally, long-term contractual obligations are currently expected to be funded from cash from operations and cash on hand.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, we had total cash of $36,399, compared to total cash of $11,324 at December 31, 2023.

The change in net cash (used in) provided by operating activities during 2024 is primarily due to the gain on sale of $40,585 related to the disposition of the Precision Sport segment and an increase in cash outflows related to working capital of $18,859.

The change in net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily due to the settlement of all outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and term debt under the Restated Credit Agreement.\n\nNet Operating Loss\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and research and experimentation credit for U.S. federal income tax purposes of $7,699 and $2,997, respectively. The Company believes its U.S. Federal NOLs will offset a portion of its future U.S. Federal income taxes. The Company has $7,699 of NOLs, of which, $0 expire on December 31, 2024. These NOLs are subject to compliance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Code”), as amended.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s gross deferred tax asset was $39,893. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $714, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $39,179, before deferred tax liabilities of $34,434. The Company has provided a valuation allowance against a portion of the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, because the ultimate realization of those assets does not meet the more-likely-than-not criteria. Part of the Company’s deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes. If a change in control were to occur, these could be limited under Section 382 of the Code.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $18,000 in U.S. net deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets are expected to reverse into NOL carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. At this time, we consider it more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income in future periods that will allow us to realize these deferred tax assets. However, unless we can generate sufficient taxable income from our future operations, a valuation allowance to reduce our U.S. deferred tax assets may be required, which would materially increase our income tax expense in the period the allowance is recognized and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and consolidated financial position.\n\n41\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\n**MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS**\n\n**(in thousands, except per share amounts)**\n\n​\n\nCredit Agreement\n\nUpon the closing of the sale of the Precision Sport segment on February 29, 2024, the Company terminated and settled all outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility and term debt under the Restated Credit Agreement.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe do not engage in any transactions or have relationships or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities. These include special purpose and similar entities or other off-balance sheet arrangements. We also do not engage in energy, weather or other commodity-based contracts.\n\n​\n\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nThere has not been any material change in the market risk disclosure contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nThe Company’s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15I and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”)) as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated and communicated to the appropriate management on a basis that permits timely decisions regarding disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, were effective.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n42\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\n\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nLegal Proceedings\n\nThe Company is involved in various legal disputes and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Based on currently available information, and except as disclosed herein, the Company does not believe that the existence of any of the legal disputes the Company or its subsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) matter discussed below. It is possible that, as additional information becomes available, the impact on the Company of an adverse determination could have a different effect. See also Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”.\n\nLitigation\n\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits arising from time to time that the Company considers ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business. Amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs (damages and/or settlement amounts) in connection with pending litigation and claims and related anticipated legal fees and other expenses or costs for defending such actions, which legal fees and expenses or costs are expensed as incurred. The costs are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are based upon the Company’s assessment, after consultation with counsel (if deemed appropriate), of probable loss based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature of the claim made, the nature of the damages sought and any relevant information about the plaintiffs and other significant factors that vary by case. When it is not possible to estimate a specific expected cost to be incurred, the Company evaluates the range of probable loss and records the minimum end of the range. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the disposition of any of the legal disputes the Company or its subsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, except for the CPSC matter discussed below. There is a reasonable possibility of loss from contingencies in excess of the amounts accrued by the Company in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets; however, the actual amounts of such possible losses cannot currently be reasonably estimated by the Company at this time. It is possible that, as additional information becomes available, the impact on the Company could have a different effect.\n\nProduct Liability\n\nAs a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces the risk of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for substantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. The Company is therefore vulnerable to various personal injury and property damage lawsuits relating to its products and incidental to its business.\n\nExcept as disclosed herein, there are no pending product liability claims and lawsuits of the Company, which the Company believes in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, brand reputation, liquidity, stock price, consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. See also Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”.\n\n**U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission**\n\nIn January 2021, Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. (“BDEL”) wrote to the CPSC outlining its new cradle solution for certain models of its avalanche beacon transceivers to prevent such transceivers from switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode. The proposed new cradle solution was designed to improve transceiver safety by locking the transceiver into “send” mode prior to use so that it would not switch unexpectedly out of “send” mode. BDEL also requested approval for the CPSC Fast-Track Program for a voluntary product recall to implement this cradle solution. The CPSC approved the recall and entered into a Corrective Action Plan agreement with BDEL in March 2021. BDEL received a letter from the CPSC, dated October 28, 2021, stating that the CPSC is investigating whether BDEL has timely complied with the reporting \n\n43\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\nrequirements of Section 15(b) of the Consumer Protection Safety Act and related regulations regarding certain models of avalanche transceivers switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode.\n\nSeparately, on April 21, 2022, BDEL filed a Section 15(b) report and applied for Fast-Track consideration for a voluntary recall, consisting of free repair or replacement of such malfunctioning models of avalanche transceivers, which would not switch from “send” mode to “search” mode due to an electronic malfunction in the reed switch or foil. The CPSC approved the recall and entered into a Corrective Action Plan agreement with BDEL in August 2022. BDEL received a letter from the CPSC, dated January 17, 2023, stating that the CPSC is investigating whether BDEL has timely complied with the reporting requirements of Section 15(b) of the Consumer Protection Safety Act and related regulations regarding the malfunction in the reed switch or foil in certain models of avalanche transceivers switching out of “search” mode. BDEL responded to the CPSC’s investigation by letter dated March 31, 2023, accompanied with documents responsive to the CPSC’s requests. The CPSC asked for further clarification and documents, and BDEL sent a responsive letter accompanied by additional documents on June 23, 2023. On September 6, 2023, the CPSC requested further clarification and information regarding the reed switch issue, to which BDEL responded on October 6 and 13, 2023.\n\nBy letters dated October 12, 2023 and December 18, 2023, BDEL was notified by the CPSC that the agency staff had concluded BDEL failed to timely meet our statutory reporting obligations under the Consumer Product Safety Act with respect to certain models of BDEL’s avalanche transceivers switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode and certain models of BDEL’s avalanche transceivers not switching from “send” mode into “search” mode, that BDEL made a material misrepresentation in a report to the CPSC, and that the agency staff intends to recommend that the CPSC impose civil monetary penalties of $16,135,000 and $9,000,000, respectively, for the two matters described above.\n\nOn November 20, 2023 and February 8, 2024, respectively, BDEL submitted a comprehensive response disputing the CPSC’s findings and conclusions in the October 12, 2023 and December 18, 2023 letters, including the amount of any potential penalties. The CPSC ultimately disagreed with our position and the agency staff has restated their recommendation for the monetary penalties which the Company intends to strongly contest and vigorously defend against.\n\nJohn C. Walbrecht, the former President of BDEL and the Company, received a letter from the CPSC dated June 25, 2024 alleging that in his personal capacity he knowingly violated the Consumer Product Safety Act by failing to timely report the occurrence resulting in beacons switching unexpectedly out of “send” mode. The staff of the CPSC recommended a $5,000,000 fine against Mr. Walbrecht personally. Pursuant to the Company’s by-laws, the Company has agreed to indemnify Mr. Walbrecht and pay his legal fees, and he has provided an undertaking to the Company that the Company will be entitled to recover those expenses if it is ultimately determined that he was not entitled to indemnification. On August 26, 2024, Mr. Walbrecht’s independent counsel responded to the CPSC, denying the allegations of its June 25 letter and rejecting its demand for a penalty.\n\nBased on currently available information, the Company believes an unfavorable outcome with the CPSC is probable, however, we cannot be sure on what terms this matter will be resolved. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a liability of $2,500,000 representing the low end of the range of our estimated exposure. The Company does not have a better estimate of the loss; therefore the low-end of the range was recorded as an accrued liability during the first quarter of 2024 and a corresponding expense is included in legal costs and regulatory matter expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\n​\n\n​\n\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nThere have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n44\n\n[Table of Contents](#TOC)\n\n**CLARUS CORPORATION**\n\nITEM 5.

BUSINESS\nOverview\nHeadquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, Clarus Corporation (which may be referred to as the “Company,” “Clarus,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is\na global leading designer, developer, manufacturer and distributor of best-in-class outdoor equipment and lifestyle products focused on the\noutdoor and consumer enthusiast markets. Our mission is to identify, acquire and grow outdoor “super fan” brands through our unique\n“innovate and accelerate” strategy. We define a “super fan” brand as a brand that creates the world’s pre-eminent, performance-defining\nproduct that the best-in-class user cannot live without. Each of our brands has a long history of continuous product innovation for core and\neveryday users alike. The Company’s products are principally sold globally under the Black Diamond®, Sierra®, Barnes®, Rhino-Rack®\nand MAXTRAX® brand names through outdoor specialty and online retailers, our own websites, distributors and original equipment\nmanufacturers. Our portfolio of iconic brands is well-positioned for sustainable, long-term growth underpinned by powerful industry trends\nacross the outdoor and adventure sport end markets.\nOne of the key elements of our sustained financial performance is our persistent focus on brand building through product initiatives. Our\niconic brands are rooted in performance-defining technologies that enable our customers to have their best days outdoors. We have a long\nhistory of technical innovation and product development, backed by an extensive patent portfolio that continues to evolve and advance our\nmarkets. We currently employ approximately 120 engineers across the portfolio, focusing on enhancing our customers’ performance in the\nmost critical moments. Our commitment to quality, rigorous safety, and ultimately best-in-class design is evidenced by outstanding\nindustry recognition, as we have received numerous product awards across our portfolio of super fan brands.\nEach of our brands represents a unique customer value proposition. Supported by six decades of proven innovation, Black Diamond is an\nestablished global leader in high-performance, activity-based climbing, skiing, and technical mountain sports equipment. The brand is\nsynonymous with premium performance, safety and reliability. Our Sierra and Barnes brands have been leading specialty manufacturers of\nbullets and ammunition for over 50 years. Since 1947, Sierra has been dedicated to manufacturing the highest-quality, most accurate bullets\nin the world for hunting and sport shooting enthusiasts. Barnes traces its history back to 1932, and since 1989 has manufactured\ntechnologically-advanced, lead-free bullets and premium ammunition for hunters, range shooters, military and law enforcement\nprofessionals. Founded in 1992, our Rhino-Rack brand is a globally-recognized designer and distributor of highly-engineered automotive\nroof racks and accessories to enhance the outdoor enthusiast’s overlanding experience. Founded in 2005, our MAXTRAX brand offers\nhigh-quality overlanding and off-road vehicle recovery and extraction tracks for the overland and off-road market.\nClarus, incorporated in Delaware in 1991, acquired Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. (“Black Diamond Equipment”) in May 2010 and\nchanged its name to Black Diamond, Inc. in January 2011. In October 2012, we acquired PIEPS Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries\n(collectively, “PIEPS”). On August 14, 2017, the Company changed its name from Black Diamond, Inc. to Clarus Corporation and its stock\nticker symbol from “BDE” to “CLAR” on the NASDAQ stock exchange.\nOn August 21, 2017, the Company acquired Sierra Bullets, L.L.C. (“Sierra”). On November 6, 2018, the Company acquired the assets of\nSKINourishment, Inc. (“SKINourishment”). On October 2, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities\nconstituting the Barnes business (“Barnes”). On July 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Australia-based Rhino-Rack\nHoldings Pty Ltd (“Rhino-Rack”). On December 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Australia-based MaxTrax Australia\nPty Ltd (“MAXTRAX”).\nMarket Overview\nOur brands participate in the outdoor-oriented lifestyle that has and is expected to benefit from favorable long-term growth trends. The\nusers of our products are loyal outdoor enthusiasts, including climbers, mountaineers, trail runners, skiers, mountain bikers, backpackers\nand campers, competitive shooters, hunters, adventure seekers, overlanders and other outdoor-inspired consumers. We believe we have a\nstrong reputation for innovation, style, quality, design, safety and durability in our core product lines, positioning us for sustainable growth\namidst the acceleration of our market opportunity. Select factors driving this acceleration include:\nIncreasing Adoption of Outdoor Lifestyles and Focus on Health and Wellness. According to Outdoor Foundation, over the past decade,\nmany outdoor activities have experienced a consistent rise in participation rates. This heightened participation has grown in tandem with\nincreasing consumer focus on health and wellness with many consumers acutely aware of the myriad of physical and mental health benefits\nassociated with outdoor activities.\nGrowing Demand for SUVs as “Staycations,” Road Trips and Short Breaks Increase in Popularity. Following the emergence of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, we believe that outdoor participation and the desire for more localized vacation trips experienced an uplift as\nconsumers actively sought activities that conform to local social distancing guidelines, and avoided air and rail travel. We anticipate\n3\nthat the continuing impact of rising energy costs and inflation, along with positive memories consumers have from their previous pandemic\n“staycations”, will continue this trend of localized travel. In addition, the popularity of pickups and, more recently, their sibling sport utility\nvehicles (“SUVs”) and crossover utility vehicles (“CUVs”) continues to rise. They are multipurpose vehicles, proving equally functional\nfor daily commutes, heavy jobsite work or recreational and trail activities. Per the 2022 issue of “SEMA Light-Truck Snapshot,” the light-\ntruck segment(cid:3031)—(cid:3031)which includes pickups, vans, SUVs and CUVs(cid:3031)—(cid:3031)is forecast to account for 80% of all new passenger vehicle sales by\n2028. The demand for vehicles geared towards local travel is driving demand for extra luggage space and the automotive rack market,\nwhich is expected to directly benefit our Rhino-Rack and MAXTRAX brands.\nRise of Overlanding. Combining off-road driving with backcountry lifestyle activities, such as camping, hiking, kayaking and mountain\nbiking, we believe that overlanding has driven a new niche in the light truck, SUV and CUV segment for enthusiasts and light truck\nmanufacturers, which is expected to directly benefit our Rhino-Rack and MAXTRAX brands. Per SEMA, overlanding, loosely defined, is\nthe practice of exploring the backcountry in a purpose-built vehicle(cid:3031)—(cid:3031)generally, a high-clearance four-wheel drive(cid:3031)—(cid:3031)that is equipped to\nallow its occupants to remain self-sufficient for periods of time ranging from a few days to several weeks. Overlanding originated in\nAustralia, with popularity in South America and sub-Saharan Africa, but its popularity in North America has grown over the past decade.\nDue to its overlap with numerous outdoor lifestyle activities, overlanding’s market growth is difficult to precisely measure, but we believe\nthat the global adventure tourism market(cid:3031)—(cid:3031)which includes camping, hiking, mountain biking, kayaking, rafting and other pursuits that are\nclosely associated with overlanding(cid:3031)—(cid:3031)reflects this growing trend and is expected to continue to grow in the coming years.\nClimbing Verticals Becoming Mainstream. With the release of critically acclaimed free climbing documentary The Dawn Wall as well as\nthe Academy Award-winning rock climbing documentary Free Solo, mainstream consumers are increasingly exposed to the markets that\nClarus and, specifically, Black Diamond work to serve. Furthermore, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics marked the first time that sport climbing\ndebuted in an Olympic stadium, bringing the thrills of high-skill rock climbing to the living rooms of people across the globe. The 2024\nParis Summer Olympics will also include sport climbing events.\nResurgence in Popularity of Hunting. After several years of falling participation, we believe that hunting continues to experience a\nresurgence as a popular outdoor activity. Additionally, the sport of hunting has experienced more diversity in participants, specifically\nwomen and younger people. The investment in hunting equipment and required training courses is expected to drive sustained activity in\nthe sport.\nAs the variety of outdoor sports activities continues to proliferate, and existing outdoor sports evolve and become more specialized, we\nbelieve there is demand in the marketplace to address the unique technical and performance needs of such enthusiasts. We believe we have\nbeen able to help address this opportunity by seeking to leverage our intimate knowledge of what the customer needs to perform at the\nhighest level. We continue to seek to improve on our existing product lines by expanding our offerings into new niche categories, and by\nincorporating innovative industrial design, engineering and performance tolerances into our products. We believe the credibility and\nauthenticity of our brands expands our potential market beyond committed outdoor athletes to outdoor generalists who desire to lead active,\noutdoor-focused lifestyles.\nGrowth Strategies\nOur growth strategies are to achieve sustainable, profitable growth organically while seeking to expand our business through targeted,\nstrategic acquisitions. We intend to create new and innovative products, increase consumer and retailer awareness and demand for our\nproducts, and build stronger emotional brand connections with consumers over time across an increasing number of geographic markets.\nAdditionally, long-term growth is underpinned by powerful industry trends across the outdoor and consumer enthusiast markets. Our\ngrowth initiatives include, but are not limited to the following:\nBlack Diamond Product Category Expansions. Within our Outdoor segment, we intend to utilize our “innovate and accelerate” strategy to\nleverage our strong brand name, customer relationships, proven capacity to develop new innovative products and product extensions in\neach of our existing product categories, and to expand into new product categories. Our new technologies are generally inspired by our\ncontinuing commitment to maximize the enjoyment and efficacy of the products for the outdoor sports for which we design. We intend to\nfocus on the expansion of our apparel and footwear categories, driving further innovation in lights, trekking poles, snow safety, and\nclimbing hard goods, while broadening our appeal in gloves and packs.\nGrowth in International Markets. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand the presence and penetration of each of our\nbrands globally. The European alpine market is currently significantly larger than the U.S. market and is highly fragmented by country,\nwith no clear leader across Europe. We have been able to gain market share by emphasizing our Black Diamond brand, positioning it as a\nglobal brand with American roots. We believe there is also a significant opportunity to expand our Sierra and Barnes brands outside the\nU.S. market through additional sales and marketing commitments. The acquisition of Rhino-Rack adds a leading market position in\nAustralia and New Zealand, with an opportunity to grow our presence in the U.S., currently less than 1% market share, through key\npartnerships with brick-and-mortar and online retailers alike, and enhanced brand awareness. Our most recent acquisition, MAXTRAX,\n4\nhas a leading market position in Australia and we believe it has a significant opportunity to grow in the U.S.\nAcquisition of Complementary Businesses. We expect to target acquisitions as a viable opportunity to gain access to new product group\nand customer channels, and increase penetration of existing markets. We may also pursue acquisitions that diversify the Company within\nthe outdoor and consumer enthusiast markets. To the extent we pursue future acquisitions, we intend to focus on super-fan brands with\nrecurring revenue, sustainable margins and strong cash flow generation. We anticipate financing future acquisitions prudently through a\ncombination of cash on hand, operating cash flow, bank financings, and capital markets offerings.\nCompetitive Strengths\nAuthentic Portfolio of Iconic Super Fan Brands.

All MAXTRAX vehicle recovery tracks are manufactured in Australia using its proprietary, Australian-sourced, engineering-\ngrade and fiber-reinforced nylon. MAXTRAX currently sells its products around the world to distributors, retailers, government\nagencies, third-party e-commerce sites and through its own website.\nProduct Innovation and Development Capabilities at Clarus. We have a long history of technical innovation and product development,\nwith over 300 patents and over 100 patents pending worldwide. Our employees’ passion and intimacy with our core outdoor activities\ngenerates new and boundary-pushing concepts and products, which we believe provides a significant advantage that will drive our\nCompany to new levels. We seek to design products that enhance our customers’ personal performance as they participate in the activities\nwe serve. We integrate quality assurance and quality control teams throughout the entire design process to maintain the quality and\nintegrity for which our brands are known.

Our capital structure provides us with the capacity to fund future growth.\nOperating Segments\nWe operate our business structure within three segments.

We have also\ndeveloped skincare products, such as lotions, lip balm, and sunscreen, as well as sport-enhancing supplements, nutrition, and other products\nusing natural, organic or alternative ingredients. Generally, we divide our product offerings into the following three primary categories:\n• Outdoor: Our outdoor line consists of apparel, footwear, headlamps, lights, trekking poles, gloves, packs, avalanche airbags,\npoles, avalanche safety devices, and equipment such as carabiners, harnesses, protection devices, and various other climbing,\nmountaineering, hiking, and backcountry accessories and products. Our outdoor line represented approximately 50% of our sales\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022.\n• Precision Sport: Our precision sport line consists of premium quality high-precision bullets and ammunition used in competitive\nshooting, hunting and other applications and environments. Our precision sport line represented approximately 29% of our sales\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022.\n• Adventure: Our adventure line consists of highly-engineered automotive roof racks, trays, mounting systems, luggage boxes,\ncarriers, recovery tracks and accessories. Our adventure line represented approximately 21% of our sales during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\n7\nProduct Design and Development\nWe conduct our product research, evaluation, and design activities at our locations in Salt Lake City, Utah; Sedalia, Missouri; Mona, Utah;\nLebring, Austria; Wimberly, Texas; Sydney, Australia; and Brisbane, Australia.\nWe typically bring new products from concept to market in approximately 18 to 36 months, depending upon the technology integration and\ncomplexity of the product. We work simultaneously on product lines for the four subsequent selling seasons.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred in selling, general, and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2022, we had\n110 employees dedicated to research and development.\nCustomers\nWe market and distribute our products in over 50 countries, primarily through independent specialty stores and specialty chains, premium\nsporting goods and outdoor recreation stores, distributors and OEMs in the United States, Canada, Europe, Middle East, Asia, Australia,\nNew Zealand, Africa, and South America. Outside of North America and Europe, we sell our products through independent global\ndistributors into specialty retail stores. We also sell our products directly to customers through our various websites.\nOur end users include a broad range of consumers, including mountain, rock, ice, and gym climbers, winter-outdoor enthusiasts, trail\nrunners, backpackers, competitive shooters, hunters, and outdoor-inspired consumers. Such consumers demand high-quality, reliable, and\nhigh-precision products to enhance their performance and, in some cases, safety in a multitude of outdoor activities. We expect to leverage\nour user intimacy, engineering prowess, and design ability to expand into related technical product categories that target the same\ndemographic group and distribution channels.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales force is generally deployed by geographic region: Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Australia, and the United States.\nOur focus is on providing our products to a broad spectrum of outdoor enthusiasts. Within each of our brands, we strive to create a unique\nlook for our products and to communicate those differences to the consumer. In addition, we are continuously exploring uses for brand and\nmarket research. We also regularly utilize various promotions and public relations campaigns.\nWe have consistently established relationships with professional athletes and influencers to help evaluate, promote and establish product\nperformance and authenticity with customers. Such brand endorsers are one of many elements in our array of marketing materials,\nincluding instore displays, catalogs, workbooks, social media, and digital campaigns via our websites.\nManufacturing, Sourcing, Quality Assurance and Distribution\nManufacturing\nOur objective is to deliver on-time the highest quality of products in the safest and most cost-efficient manner. Our culture of continuous\nimprovement and implementation of industry best practices allows us to continue to increase productivity, reduce costs, and bring new\ninnovative products to the market.\nThe Black Diamond Equipment, PIEPS, Rhino-Rack, and MAXTRAX manufacturing and distribution operations are ISO 9001–2015\ncertified and are audited annually by an independent certifying agency to ensure quality management systems meet the requirements of ISO\n9001–2015, and to ensure that certified products meet all necessary performance certification requirements. Sierra and Barnes are members\nof the Sporting Arms & Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute and employ best-in-class proprietary manufacturing processes with respect to\neach one of its products. These processes are performed in-house and include control of bullet jacket wall concentricity utilizing strict\nquality control standards overseen by experienced employees, yielding what we believe to be the tightest tolerances in the industry.\nWe manufacture approximately 25% to 30% of our products, including nearly all protection devices for climbing and all bullets, in our\nfacilities in the United States. The remaining approximately 70% to 75% of our products are also manufactured to our specifications in\nthird-party, independently-owned facilities. We keep employees and agents on-site or via regular visits at these third-party, independently-\nowned facilities to ensure that our products are manufactured to meet our specifications. While we do not maintain a long-term\nmanufacturing contract with those facilities, we believe that our long-term relationships with them will help to ensure that a sufficient\nsupply of goods built to our specification are available in a timely manner and on satisfactory economic terms in the future.\n8\nSourcing\nWe source raw materials, components, finished goods from a variety of suppliers. Our primary materials include copper, lead, aluminum,\nsteel, nylon, corrugated cardboard for packaging, metal, plastic and electrical components, and various textiles, foams, and fabrics. The raw\nmaterials and components used to manufacture our products are generally available from numerous suppliers in quantities sufficient to\nmeet normal requirements.\nWe source packaging materials both domestically as well as from sources in Asia and Europe. We believe that all of our purchased\nproducts and materials could be readily obtained from alternative sources at comparable costs.\nQuality Assurance\nQuality assurance at the Company has two primary functions:\n• The first is to ensure that the products that we design and develop are manufactured to meet or exceed the Company’s own\nstandards and international regulatory standards. This involves creating inspection documentation, reviewing manufacturing\nprocesses with our various vendor-partners, and inspecting finished product to assure it meets the rigorous standards required by\nour customers. These activities take place globally, wherever our products are manufactured.\n• The second function is to provide real and meaningful input to the new product development process. Quality assurance\nprofessionals interact closely with the design and engineering teams and bring knowledge and expertise to the design process,\nensuring that the products we bring to market truly meet the criteria established when a new product is envisioned.\nThe engineering prowess of the quality assurance group is a core competency that the Company seeks to leverage across all product lines\nand brands.\nGlobal Distribution\nOur distribution model allows us to ship a broad cross-section of our product line in smaller quantities to our own global distribution\ncenters and to those of our Independent Global Distributors (“IGD”) more frequently and at lower transportation and logistics costs.\nCompetition\nBecause of the diversity of our product offerings, we compete by niche with a variety of companies. Our products must stand up to the high\nstandards set by the end users in each category where quality, durability and performance are paramount. We believe our products compete\nfavorably on the basis of product innovation, product performance, marketing support, and price.\nThe popularity of various outdoor activities and changing design trends affect the desirability of our products. Therefore, we seek to\nanticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of available product offerings by developing new\nproducts with innovative performance features and designs, and by marketing our products in a persuasive and memorable fashion to drive\nconsumer awareness and demand. Failure to anticipate or respond to consumer needs and preferences in a timely and adequate manner\ncould have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nWe compete with niche, privately-owned companies as well as a number of brands owned by large, multinational companies, such as those\nset forth below.\n• Outdoor: Our outdoor products and accessories, such as apparel, footwear, trekking poles, headlamps, gloves, backpacks,\ntransceivers, protection, carabiners, helmets, and harnesses, compete with products from companies such as The North Face,\nPatagonia, La Sportiva, Prana, Hestra, Osprey, Arc’Teryx, Petzl, and Mammut.\n• Precision Sport: We sell bullets and ammunition to both retailers and distributors for sale to consumers. We supply bullets to\nOEMs who also manufacture bullets. Such companies include Vista (Federal Ammunition, CCI, and Remington), Nammo,\nHornady, Fiocchi, and Olin (Winchester).\n• Adventure: Our highly-engineered automotive roof racks, trays, mounting systems, luggage boxes, carriers, recovery tracks and\naccessories compete with products from companies such as Thule, Dometic, Yakima, Front Runner, and TRED Outdoors.\nIn addition, in certain categories we compete with certain of our large wholesale customers who focus on the outdoor market, such as REI,\nMountain Equipment Co-op and Decathlon, which manufacture, market and distribute their own climbing, mountaineering, and skiing\nproducts under their own private labels.\n9\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe our registered and pending word and icon trademarks worldwide, including the Black Diamond and Diamond “C” logos, Black\nDiamond®, ATC ®, Camalot®, AvaLung ®, FlickLock®, Ascension™, Time is Life®, Hexentric®, Stopper®, Dawn Patrol®, Bibler®,\n“Use.Design.Build.Engineer.Repeat”®, Sierra®, Sierra® MatchKing®, Sierra® GameKing®, Sierra® BlitzKing®, Barnes®, TSX®, X\nBullet®, VOR-TX®, PIEPS®, Rhino-Rack®, and Maxtrax® create international brand recognition for our products.\nSolely for convenience, our trademarks and tradenames referred to in this report may appear without the ® and ™ symbols, but those\nreferences are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights, or the right\nof the applicable licensor to these trademarks and tradenames.\nWe believe our brands have an established reputation for innovation, style, quality, design, safety, and durability, and accordingly, we\nactively monitor and police our brands against infringement to ensure their viability and enforceability.\nIn addition to trademarks, we hold over 300 patents and over 100 patents pending worldwide for a wide variety of technologies across our\nproduct lines.\nOur success with our proprietary products is generally derived from our “first mover” advantage in the market as well as our commitment\nto protecting our current and future proprietary technologies and products, which acts as a deterrent to infringement of our intellectual\nproperty rights. While we believe our patent and trademark protection policies are robust and effective, if we fail to adequately protect our\nintellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours. Our principal intellectual property rights\ninclude our patents and trademarks but also include products containing proprietary trade secrets and manufacturing know-how.\nWe cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our patent applications or that any existing or future patents that we receive or\nlicense will provide competitive advantages for our products. While we actively monitor our competitors to ensure that we do not\ncompromise the intellectual property of others, we cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge, invalidate or void the application of\nany existing or future patents that we receive or license. In addition, patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using\nor selling products that are in similar product niches as ours.\nSeasonality\nThe Company’s products are outdoor activity-based, however, there are not significant seasonal variations in sales and profitability. In\n2022, approximately 51% of our sales were in the first half of the year while approximately 49% of our sales occurred in the second half of\nthe year.\nWorking capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital generally increases to support peak manufacturing and shipping\nperiods and then decreases as accounts receivable are collected. However, throughout 2022, the Company leveraged our balance sheet to\nsecure additional inventory across all of our brands to ensure the right inventory is available to meet customer demand.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those that impose\nworkplace standards and regulate the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation,\nemission, release, discharge, treatment, storage, and disposal of materials and substances including solid and hazardous wastes. We believe\nthat we are in material compliance with such laws and regulations. Further, the cost of maintaining compliance has not, and we believe in\nthe future, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nDue to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology, we cannot\npredict with any certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable\nenvironmental laws and regulations.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe manufacture, sale, and purchase of ammunition by our Precision Sport segment are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and\nforeign governmental laws. Our Precision Sport segment is also subject to the rules and regulations of the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\nFirearms and Explosives (“ATF”) and various state and international agencies that control the manufacture, export, import, distribution and\nsale of firearms, explosives, and ammunition. Such regulations may adversely affect demand for the products sold by our Precision Sport\nsegment by imposing limitations that increase the costs or limit the availability of its products.\n10\nThe failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations may result in the limitation of our growth or business activities and could result\nin the revocation of licenses necessary for business conducted by the Precision Sport segment. Applicable laws and regulations provide for\nthe following:\n• require the licensing of all persons manufacturing, exporting, importing, or selling ammunition as a business;\n• require serialization, labeling, and tracking of the acquisition and disposition of certain types of ammunition;\n• regulate the interstate sale of certain ammunition\n• restrict or prohibit the ownership, use, or sale of specified categories of ammunition;\n• require registries of so-called “ballistic images” of ammunition fired from new guns;\n• govern the sale, export, and distribution of ammunition;\n• regulate the use and storage of gun powder or other energetic materials;\n• regulate the employment of personnel with certain criminal convictions;\n• restrict access to ammunition manufacturing facilities for certain individuals from other countries or with criminal convictions;\nand\n• require compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations\nThe handling of our technical data and the international sale of products sold by our Precision Sport segment may also be regulated by the\nU.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. These agencies can impose civil and criminal penalties, including denying the\nexport of the products sold by our Precision Sport segment, for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nBills have been introduced in Congress to establish, and to consider the feasibility of establishing, a nationwide database recording so-\ncalled “ballistic images” of ammunition fired from new guns. Should such a mandatory database be established, the cost to us, our\ndistributors, and our customers could be significant, depending on the type of firearms and ballistic information included in the database.\nBills have been introduced in Congress in the past several years that would affect the manufacture and sale of ammunition, including bills\nto regulate its manufacture, importation, and sale.\nWe believe that existing federal, state, and local legislation relating to the regulation of firearms and ammunition have not had a material\nadverse effect on our sales of these products. However, the regulation of firearms and ammunition may become more restrictive in the\nfuture, and any such developments might have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash\nflows. In addition, regulatory proposals, even if never enacted, may affect firearms or ammunition sales as a result of consumer\nperceptions.\nIn addition, our SKINourishment business is subject to substantial government regulation. This government regulation includes regulation\nin the United States and other countries regarding the research, development, formulation, manufacture and marketing of our\nSKINourishment skincare products.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had a total of over 900 employees worldwide. Of these employees, 380 were engaged in manufacturing,\n280 in sales, marketing, product management and customer support, 80 in administrative functions (IT, Finance, HR, Legal and\nCompliance, etc.), 110 in R&D, engineering technology, manufacturing engineering and project management, 50 retail store\nassociates and 20 in various executive and corporate functions. None of our employees are represented by a union in collective\nbargaining with us. We believe that our employee relations are good. Our human capital objectives center around identifying,\nrecruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. We maintain and grow our team utilizing\npractices that help us identify, hire, incentivize and retain our existing employees and integrate new employees into our Company.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by each of the\nU.S., European, and Australian governments in March 2020, with governments world-wide implementing safety measures restricting travel\nand requiring citizen lockdowns and self-confinements for quarantining purposes. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and\n2022, this had negatively affected the U.S., European, Australian and global economies, disrupted global supply chains, and resulted in\nsignificant transport restrictions and disruption of global financial markets.\nAn outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have, and in the case of the COVID-19\npandemic has had and may continue to have, a significant impact on the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on related\nactivities causing disruption and delay, along with increased raw material, storage, and shipping costs. Any of these disruptions and delays\nmay strain domestic and international supply chains, which could negatively affect the flow or availability of certain critical raw materials\nand finished good products that the Company relies upon. Furthermore, the foregoing impacts may significantly increase demand from\nonline sales channels, including our website, and could impact our logistical operations, including our fulfillment and shipping functions,\nwhich may result in periodic delays in the delivery of our products.\n11\nWe expect that an outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have, and in the case of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may continue to have, an impact on the Company’s sales and profitability in future periods. The duration of these\ntrends and the magnitude of such impacts cannot be precisely estimated at this time, as they are affected by a number of factors (some of\nwhich are outside management’s control), including those presented in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAvailable Information\nOur Internet address is www.claruscorp.com. We make available free of charge on or through our website our annual reports on Form 10-\nK, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, and the proxy statement for our annual\nmeeting of stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and\nExchange Commission.

The contents of the websites identified above are not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in\nevaluating our business, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial\ncondition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results could differ materially from those mentioned in any forward-looking\nstatements. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently consider to be immaterial, may also impact\nour business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results,\nliquidity and financial condition, and the price of our common stock, could be materially adversely affected.\nRisk Factor Summary\n•\nWe are subject to risks related to our dependence on the strength of retail economies.\n•\nCertain products we sell are inherently risky and could give rise to product liability, product warranty claims, and other loss\ncontingencies.\n•\nOur markets are highly competitive and are subject to dramatic changes in consumer preferences.\n•\nOur operations, including but not limited to integrating acquisitions and our purchase of raw materials, are sensitive to changes in\nglobal cultural, political, and financial market conditions as well as potential changes in regulations, legislation and government\npolicies.\n•\nTechnological advances, the introduction of new products, and new design and manufacturing techniques could adversely affect\nour operations unless we are able to adapt to the resulting change in conditions.\n•\nWe may seek to raise additional funds, finance acquisitions, or develop strategic relationships by issuing capital stock that would\ndilute your ownership.\n•\nWe may be unsuccessful in our future acquisition endeavors, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business; in\naddition, some of the businesses we acquire may incur significant losses from operations.\n•\nWe have been required to recognize impairment charges and may be required to take future write downs or write-offs,\nrestructuring, and impairment or other charges.\n•\nOur business and growth may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key officers or employees, including our Chief\nExecutive Officer, Warren Kanders, as well as any loss of officers or employees due to illness or other events outside of our\ncontrol.\n•\nWe are uncertain of our ability to manage our growth.\n•\nWe have significant payment obligations under the terms of our credit facility, $138,360,000 of which was outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\n•\nThe members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers beneficially own in excess of 24% of our common stock. As\nsuch, the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\n12\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nMany of the products we sell are used for inherently risky outdoor pursuits and could give rise to product liability or product\nwarranty claims and other loss contingencies, which could affect our earnings and financial condition.\nMany of our products are used in applications and situations that involve high levels of risk of personal injury and death. As a result, we\nmaintain a staff who focus on including appropriate disclaimers and markings, and undertaking testing and otherwise seeking to assure the\nquality and safety of our products. We stay current with laws to seek to provide thorough and protective disclaimers and instructions on all\nof our products and packaging. Furthermore, our technical climbing and avalanche safety equipment and our related operations meet and\nare certified to International Personal Protective Equipment (PP) standards set by the EEC or ISO 9001 quality system standards. Failure to\nuse our products for their intended purposes, failure to use or care for them properly, or their malfunction, or, in some limited\ncircumstances, even correct use of our products, could result in serious bodily injury or death.\nWe remain exposed to product liability claims by the nature of the products we produce. Exposure occurs if one of our products is alleged\nto have resulted in property damage, bodily injury or other adverse effects. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of\ndefects in manufacturing and/or design, failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product or activities associated with the product,\nnegligence, strict liability, and/or breach of warranties. Although we maintain product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are\nreasonable, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, in the future or that\nproduct liability claims will not exceed the amount of insurance coverage.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products, we are subject to government regulation in the United States and other countries,\nincluding, without limitation, the Consumer Products Safety Act, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission to exclude\nfrom the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Products Safety\nCommission could require us to repurchase or recall one or more of our products. Additionally, laws regulating certain consumer products\nexist in some cities and states, as well as in other countries in which we sell our products, and more restrictive laws and regulations may be\nadopted in the future. Any repurchase or recall of our products could be costly to us and could damage our reputation. If we are required to\nremove, or we voluntarily remove, our products from the market, our reputation could be tarnished and we might have large quantities of\nfinished products that we ae unable to sell.\nWe spend substantial resources ensuring compliance with governmental and other applicable standards. However, compliance with these\nstandards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk. We do not maintain\ninsurance against many types of claims involving alleged defects in our products that do not involve personal injury or property damage.\nAs a result, these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur product liability insurance program is an occurrence-based program based on our current and historical claims experience and the\navailability and cost of insurance. We carry both general and umbrella liability policies that insure us for product liability claims. The\npolicy has a small retention, which enables us to manage and control our product liability claims. Historically, product liability awards have\nnot exceeded our individual per occurrence self-insured retention. We cannot assure you, however, that our future product liability\nexperience will be consistent with our past experience. Additionally, we do not maintain product recall insurance. We maintain a warranty\nreserve for estimated future warranty claims, but the actual costs of servicing future warranty claims may exceed the reserve. As a result,\nproduct recalls or product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks related to our dependence on the strength of retail economies in various parts of the world, and our\nperformance may be affected by general economic conditions.\nOur business depends on the strength of the retail economies in various parts of the world, primarily in North America, Europe, Australia\nand to a lesser extent, Asia, Central and South America. These retail economies are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand\nand the condition of the retail industry, which, in turn, are affected by general economic conditions and specific events such as natural\ndisasters, terrorist attacks, and political unrest. The impact of these external factors is difficult to predict, and one or more of the factors\ncould adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nPurchases of many consumer products are discretionary and tend to be highly correlated with the cycles of the levels of disposable income\nof consumers. As a result, any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect consumer discretionary\nspending patterns, our sales, and our results of operations. In particular, decreased consumer confidence or a reduction in discretionary\nincome as a result of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions may negatively affect our business. If the macroeconomic environment\nworsens, consumers may reduce or delay their purchases of our products. Any such reduction in purchases could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n13\nMoreover, declining economic conditions create the potential for future impairments of goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets\nthat may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Various uncertainties tied to economic conditions, including\nsignificant adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers, a\ndownturn in the economy or in discretionary income levels or changes in consumer preferences could impact the expected cash flows to be\ngenerated by an asset or group of assets, and may result in an impairment of those assets. The impact of weak consumer credit markets,\ncorporate restructurings, layoffs, prolonged high unemployment rates, declines in the value of investments and residential real estate,\nhigher fuel prices and increases in federal and state taxation all can negatively affect our operating results.\nAs noted above, because a substantial majority of our net revenue is generated through discretionary spending by consumers for our\noutdoor recreation products, a downturn in the economy resulting from prolonged supply chain disruptions or labor shortages, a significant\nincrease in inflation rates (including in connection with rising interest rates through government action to fight inflationary trends), or a\nreduction in consumer confidence in the U.S. economy may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results\nof operations, as consumers generally reduce their discretionary spending during such periods. Inflation rates have increased and may\ncontinue to rise or stay elevated for some time, all of which negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending patterns.\nAdditionally, inflationary trends and uncertainties in the economic climate in the United States and elsewhere could have a similar negative\nimpact on the rate and amounts of purchases by our current and potential customers, create price inflation for our products, or otherwise\nhave a negative impact on our expenses, gross margins and revenues, all of which could hinder our growth.\nThe occurrence of severe weather events, catastrophic health events, natural or man-made disasters, social and political conditions\nor civil unrest could significantly damage or destroy demand for our products, as well as key supply chain and fulfillment\narrangements.\nUnforeseen events, including public health emergencies, such as pandemics, natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes,\nsnow or ice storms, floods and heavy rains, and man-made disasters, such as an oil spill closing large areas of hunting or fishing, could\ndisrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers, as well as the behavior of our consumers. In addition, extreme weather conditions\ncould result in disruption or delay of production and delivery of materials and products in our supply chain and cause staffing shortages\namong our suppliers and other vendors on whom we rely. Global climate change may result in significant natural disasters occurring more\nfrequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding. Socio-political factors, such as wars,\ncivil unrest or other economic or political uncertainties that contribute to consumer unease or harm to our supply chain or customer base,\nmay also result in decreased discretionary spending, property damage and/or business interruption losses. To the extent these events result\nin the closure of one or more distribution centers that we rely on, a significant number of stores where our goods are sold, or our corporate\nheadquarters or impact one or more of our key suppliers, our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected\nthrough an inability to support our business and fulfill demand that results in lost sales, and any precautions that we may take may not be\nadequate to mitigate the impact of such events. As these events occur in the future, if they should impact areas in which we have our\ncorporate headquarters, a distribution center or a concentration of vendors or the stores where our products are sold, such events could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the retail industry and markets for consumer products affecting our customers or retailing practices could negatively\nimpact existing customer relationships and our results of operations.\nWe sell our products to retailers, including sporting goods and specialty retailers, as well as direct to consumers. A significant deterioration\nin the financial condition of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. We regularly monitor\nand evaluate the credit status of our customers and attempt to adjust sales terms as appropriate. Despite these efforts, a bankruptcy filing by\na key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels, there is a growing trend among retailers to make\npurchases on a “just-in-time” basis. This requires us to shorten our lead time for production in certain cases and more closely anticipate\ndemand, which could in the future require us to carry additional inventories.\nWe may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailer customers, such as inventory destocking, limitations on access to\nand time on shelf space, use of private label brands, price demands, payment terms, and other conditions, which could negatively impact\nour results of operations.\nThere is a growing trend among retailers in the U.S. and in foreign markets to undergo changes such as consolidations, restructurings or\nstore closings or reorganizations, that could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the concentration of\nownership within the retail industry. These changes within the retail industry could result in a shift of bargaining power to the retail\nindustry and in fewer outlets for our products which could result in price and other competition that could reduce our margins and our net\nsales.\nAdditionally, shifts in consumer purchasing patterns, including the growth of e-commerce and large one-stop digital marketplaces, e-\ncommerce off-price retailing and online comparison shopping in our key markets may have an adverse effect on our direct-to-consumer\n14\noperations and the financial health of certain of our wholesale customers, some of whom may reduce their brick and mortar store fleet, file\nfor protection under bankruptcy laws, restructure, or cease operations. These related business impacts have already occurred at certain of\nour wholesale customers. We face increased risk of order reduction and cancellation when dealing with financially ailing wholesale\ncustomers. We also extend credit to our wholesale customers based on an assessment of the wholesale customer’s financial condition,\ngenerally without requiring collateral. We may choose (and have chosen in the past) to limit our credit risk by reducing our level of\nbusiness with wholesale customers experiencing financial difficulties and may not be able to replace those revenues with other customers\nor through our direct-to-consumer businesses within a reasonable period or at all.\nSeasonality and weather conditions may cause our operating results to vary from quarter to quarter.\nSales of certain of our products in our Outdoor segment are seasonal. Sales of our outdoor recreation products such as carabineers,\nharnesses, and related climbing equipment products increase during warm weather months and decrease during winter, while sales of our\napparel line and winter sports equipment such as our skis and related ski equipment increase during the cold weather months and decrease\nduring summer. Weather conditions may also negatively impact sales (including events that may be caused or exacerbated by climate\nchange). For instance, milder temperatures could prevent the formation of ice, which may negatively affect demand for our ice climbing\nproducts, and mild winter weather with less snowfall may negatively impact sales of our winter sports products. These factors could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products.\nIn each of our geographic markets, we face significant competition with respect to our products. Retailers who are our wholesale customers\noften pose a significant competitive threat by designing, marketing and distributing products under their own private labels that compete\nwith ours. We also experience direct competition in our direct-to-consumer business from retailers that are our wholesale customers. This is\ntrue in particular in the digital marketplace, where increased consumer expectations and competitive pressure related to various aspects of\nour e-commerce business, including speed of product delivery, shipping charges, return privileges, and other evolving expectations are key\nfactors.\nAdditionally, we often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers’\norders are firm. Therefore, if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of\nproduct to deliver to our customers.\nInventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices,\nwhich could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. On the other hand, if we underestimate\ndemand for our products, our manufacturing facilities or third-party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet customer\nrequirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues, as well as damage to our reputation and\ncustomer relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory levels to meet future order and\nreorder requirements.\nCompetition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, achieve profitability, or maintain\nrelationships with existing customers.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. In this industry, we compete against numerous other domestic and foreign companies.\nCompetition in the markets in which we operate is based primarily on product quality, product innovation, price, and customer service and\nsupport, although the degree and nature of such competition vary by location and product line. Some of our competitors are more\nestablished in their industries and have substantially greater revenue or resources than we do. Our competitors may take actions to match\nnew product introductions and other initiatives. Since many of our competitors also source their products from third parties, our ability to\nobtain a cost advantage through sourcing is reduced. Certain of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit\nmargins to compete with us. Further, retailers often demand that suppliers reduce their prices on existing products. Competition could cause\nprice reductions, reduced profits or losses or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results\nof operations, and financial condition.\nTo compete effectively in the future in the consumer products industry, among other things, we must: maintain strict quality standards;\ndevelop new and innovative products that appeal to consumers; deliver products on a reliable basis at competitive prices; anticipate and\nrespond to changing consumer trends in a timely manner; maintain favorable brand recognition; and provide effective marketing support.\nOur inability to do any of these things could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n15\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours,\nwhich could adversely affect our market share and results of operations.\nThe success of our proprietary products depends, in part, on our ability to protect our current and future technologies and products and to\ndefend our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and\nmarket products similar to ours. Our principal intellectual property rights include our trademarks, patents, and trade secrets.\nWe hold numerous patents for the invention of new or improved technologies, which are known as utility patents, and pending patent\napplications covering a wide variety of products. We cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our patent applications or that\nany existing or future patents that we receive or license will provide competitive advantages for our products. We also cannot be sure that\ncompetitors will not challenge, invalidate or avoid the application of any existing or future patents that we receive or license. In addition,\npatent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our\nproducts.\nThird parties may have patents, or may be awarded new patents, that may materially adversely affect our ability to market, distribute and\nsell our products. Accordingly, our products, including, but not limited to, our technical climbing and backpack products, may become\nsubject to patent infringement claims or litigation, any adverse determination of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, and financial condition.\nOur success depends on third-party logistics providers and our and third-party distribution facilities.\nThe majority of our products are manufactured outside of our principal sales markets, which requires these products to be consolidated and\ntransported, sometimes over large geographical distances. A small number of third-party logistics providers currently consolidate,\ndeconsolidate and/or transload almost all of our products. Any disruption in the operations of these providers or changes to the costs they\ncharge, due to capacity constraints, volatile fuel prices or otherwise, could materially impact our sales and profitability. A prolonged\ndisruption in the operations of these providers, by any means, could also require us to seek alternative distribution arrangements, which\nmay not be available on attractive terms and could lead to delays in distribution of products, either of which could have a significant and\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the ability to move products over larger geographical distances could be (as is currently the case) constrained by ocean, air and\ntrucking cargo capacity, or disrupted by limitations at ports or borders. These constraints and disruptions could hinder our ability to satisfy\ndemand through our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses, and we may miss delivery deadlines, which may cause our customers to\ncancel their orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand a reduction in purchase price. In addition, increases in distribution costs,\nincluding but not limited to trucking, air and freight costs, could (as is currently the case) adversely affect our costs, which we may not be\nable to offset through price increases or decreased promotions.\nWe receive our products from third-party logistics providers at our owned and leased distribution centers in the United States, Australia,\nAustria, and New Zealand. The fixed costs associated with owning, operating and maintaining such distribution centers during a period of\neconomic weakness or declining sales can result in lower operating efficiencies, financial deleverage and potential impairment in the\nrecorded value of distribution assets.\nWe also receive and distribute our products through third-party operated distribution facilities internationally and domestically. We depend\non these third-parties to manage the operation of their distribution facilities as necessary to meet our business needs. If the third-parties fail\nto manage these responsibilities, our international and domestic distribution operations could face significant disruptions.\nOur ability to meet consumer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales, and achieve our objectives for operating efficiencies depends\non the proper operation of our existing distribution facilities, as well as the facilities of third-parties, the development or expansion of\nadditional distribution capabilities and services, and the timely performance of services by third-parties, including those involved in\nmoving products to and from our distribution facilities and facilities operated by third-parties.\nOur operations in international markets, and earnings in those markets, may be affected by changes in global cultural, political,\nand financial market conditions as well as potential changes in regulations, legislation and government policies.\nApproximately 47% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 were earned in international markets. As such our ability to\nmaintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new international\nmarkets is subject to risks associated with international operations.\nOur products are subject to increasingly stringent and complex domestic and foreign product labeling and performance and safety\nstandards, laws and other regulations. These requirements could result in greater expense associated with compliance efforts, and failure to\ncomply with these regulations could result in a delay, non-delivery, recall, or destruction of inventory shipments during key seasons\n16\nor in other financial penalties. Significant or continuing noncompliance with these standards and laws could disrupt our business and harm\nour reputation.\nThese include the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements,\nnew tariffs or other barriers to some international markets. For example, any future withdrawal or renegotiation of trade agreements, and\nthe prosecution of trade disputes or the imposition of tariffs, duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports between the United\nStates and countries like China may adversely affect our ability to operate our business and execute our growth strategy. In addition, it may\nbe more difficult for us to enforce agreements, collect receivables, receive dividends and repatriate earnings through foreign legal systems.\nWe cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, exchange controls, current or future “trade wars” or other restrictions will be imposed by\nthe United States, Australia, China, or other countries upon the import or export of our products and the commodities and components used\nto manufacture our products, or what effect any of these actions would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe cannot predict whether there might be changes in our ability to repatriate earnings or capital from international jurisdictions. Changes\nin regulatory and geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect our business or may require us to modify our current business\npractices.\nSome of our operations are conducted or products are sold in countries where economic growth has slowed, or where economies have\nsuffered economic, social and/or political instability or hyperinflation. Moreover, declining economic conditions create the potential for\nfuture impairments of goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets that may negatively impact our financial condition and results of\noperations. In addition, global economic uncertainty relating to the effects of fiscal and political crises and political and economic disputes,\nchanges in consumer spending, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, political unrest, natural disasters or other crises, terrorist acts,\nacts of war and/or military operations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we cannot continue to develop new products in a timely manner, and at favorable margins, we may not be able to compete\neffectively.\nWe believe that our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to continue to introduce innovative design extensions for our\nexisting products and to develop, manufacture, and market new products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in the\nintroduction, manufacturing, and marketing of any new products or product innovations, or develop and introduce, in a timely manner,\ninnovations to our existing products that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance. Our failure to develop new products and\nintroduce them successfully and in a timely manner, and at favorable margins, would harm our ability to successfully grow our business\nand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur operating results can be adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials.\nPricing and availability of raw materials for use in our businesses can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including\ngeneral, domestic, and international economic conditions, labor costs, production levels, competition, consumer demand, import duties, and\ntariffs and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials for us, and may\ntherefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDuring periods of rising prices of raw materials, there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to\ncustomers. Conversely, when raw material prices decline, customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and, to the\nextent we have existing inventory, lower margins. We currently do not hedge against our exposure to changing raw material prices. As a\nresult, fluctuations in raw material prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial\ncondition.\nSupply shortages or changes in availability for any particular type of raw material can delay production or cause increases in the cost of\nmanufacturing our products. We may be negatively affected by changes in availability and pricing of raw materials, which could negatively\nimpact our results of operations.\nWe may not realize returns on our fixed cost investments in our direct-to-consumer business operations.\nOne of our strategic priorities is to expand and improve our global direct-to-consumer business operations. Accordingly, we continue to\nmake investments in our digital capabilities and our direct-to-consumer operations. Since many of the costs of our direct-to-consumer\noperations are fixed, we may be unable to reduce expenses in order to avoid losses or negative cash flows if we have insufficient sales,\nincluding as a result of restrictions on operations. We may not be able to exit direct-to-consumer brick and mortar locations and related\nleases at all or without significant cost or loss, renegotiate the terms thereof, or effectively manage the profitability of our existing brick and\nmortar stores. In addition, obtaining real estate and effectively renewing real estate leases for our direct-to-consumer brick and\n17\nmortar operations is subject to the real estate market and we may not be able to secure adequate new locations or successfully renew leases\nfor existing locations.\nChanges in effective tax rates could adversely affect our results.\nAs a global company, we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions and our effective tax rate based on an analysis and\ninterpretation of local tax laws and regulations and our financial projections. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and\nestimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future, which, in times of economic disruptions, are highly uncertain. These\ndeterminations are the subject of periodic domestic and foreign tax audits. Although we accrue for uncertain tax positions, our accruals may\nbe insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings. Unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes, fines and\npenalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act (the “TCJA”). The TCJA made broad and complex changes to the United States tax code. In addition, on March 27, 2020, the\nUnited States government enacted the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). A change in\ninterpretation of the applicable revisions to the United States tax code and related tax accounting guidance, changes in assumptions made in\ndeveloping these estimates, and regulatory guidance that may be issued with respect to the applicable revisions to the United States tax\ncode, and state tax implications as a result of the TCJA, the CARES Act, and other recent legislation may cause actual amounts to differ\nfrom our provisional estimates. In addition, proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S.\nmultinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict\nwhether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on\nour effective tax rate, income tax expense and cash flows.\nOther changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the\ntreatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. For example, changes in the tax laws of\nforeign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic\nCo-operation and Development (“OECD”). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to\nnumerous long-standing tax principles. In addition, recent efforts to reform how digital profits are taxed globally could have significant\ncompliance and cost implications. As these changes are adopted by countries, tax uncertainty could increase and may adversely affect our\nprovision for income taxes.\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine could have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations, financial\ncondition, liquidity and business outlook.\nThere is continued, sustained military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and continued disruption in the region is likely. As a result, new\nand stricter sanctions have been imposed by the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and other countries and\norganizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia. Russia’s potential response to such sanctions, as well as\nprolonged unrest, intensified military activities and/or the implementation of more extensive sanctions impacting the region could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our operations, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and business outlook. Additionally, due to\ncontractions in the supply of certain fuels from Russia arising out of the conflict in Ukraine and related sanctions, it is possible that certain\nof our consumers in Europe may not participate in outdoor activities during winter in patterns that are predictable or to the scale we have\nexperienced in the past, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations, results of operations, financial condition,\nliquidity and business outlook.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows, as well as the trading price of our common stock may be\nnegatively impacted by the effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern, such as\ntravel restrictions or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to self-quarantine,\nwhether as a result of the COVID-19 or coronavirus global pandemic or otherwise.\nAn outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have, and in the case of the COVID-19\npandemic has had and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results,\nincluding in the form of lowered net sales and the delay of inventory production and fulfillment in impacted regions. Fear of contracting\nCOVID-19, individuals contracting COVID-19 and the actions taken, and that may be taken, by governmental authorities, our third-party\nlogistics providers, our landlords, our competitors or by us relating to the COVID-19 pandemic may:\n• cause disruptions in the supply chain, including the ability to produce and deliver product as expected;\n• result in canceled orders, non-payment for orders received and/or delayed payment for orders received;\n• restrict the operation of our retail store operations and our ability to meet consumer demand at our stores;\n• cause inflation and currency rate fluctuations;\n• result in a misalignment between demand and supply;\n• result in labor shortages, including as a result of any vaccine mandate or our return to work policies;\n18\n• increase reliance by consumers on e-commerce platforms;\n• impair the financial health of certain of our customers;\n• impact previous business assumptions;\n• increase the reliance of our employees on digital solutions;\n• restrict global business and travel;\n• impair our ability to ship product through our owned or affiliated distribution centers, including as a result of capacity reductions,\nshift changes, labor shortages, higher than normal absenteeism and/or the complete shutdowns of facilities for deep cleaning\nprocedures;\n• cause rapid changes to employment and tax law;\n• impair our key personnel;\n• result in incremental costs from the adoption of preventative measures, including providing facial coverings and hand sanitizer,\nrearranging operations to follow social distancing protocols, conducting temperature checks and undertaking regular and\nthorough disinfecting of surfaces, and providing testing; and/or\n• cause any number of other disruptions to our business, the risks of which may be otherwise identified herein.\nIn addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A, any of which could have a\nmaterial effect on us. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and its dynamic nature, including uncertainties relating to the duration of the\npandemic, the return of consumer confidence and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, landlords, our competitors or by\nus to contain the pandemic or to treat its impact, makes it difficult to forecast the degree to, or the time period over, which our sales and\noperations will be affected.\nWe use foreign suppliers and manufacturing facilities for a significant portion of our raw materials and finished products, and\ndisruptions to international trade, such as disease epidemics or potential ‘trade wars,’ pose a risk to our business operations.\nA majority of our products sold were produced by and purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in Asia and Eastern\nEurope, with substantially all of the remainder produced by our manufacturing facilities located in Utah and Missouri. Although no single\nsupplier and no one country controls a majority of our production needs, any of the following could materially and adversely affect our\nability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations:\n• political or labor instability in countries where our facilities, contractors, and suppliers are located;\n• political or military conflict, which could cause a delay in the transportation of raw materials and products to us and an increase\nin transportation costs;\n• heightened terrorism security concerns;\n• disease epidemics and health-related concerns, such as COVID-19 or the coronavirus;\n• imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations;\n• imposition of tariffs, duties, taxes and other charges on imports and/or exports; and\n• imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual property rights.\nChanges in governmental regulation, legislation or public opinion regarding the manufacture and sale of bullets, or the possession\nand use of firearms and ammunition, could adversely affect our Precision Sport segment and overall financial results.\nThe manufacture and sale of bullets by our Precision Sport segment, and the possession and use of firearms and ammunition by our\ncustomers, is subject to significant governmental regulation. We hold all licenses necessary for the legal manufacture and sale of our\nbullets. However, federal, state or local legislatures may enact further legislation regarding the manufacture and sale of bullets, and the\npossession and use of firearms and ammunition by our customers, such as point-of-sale background checks, age and other restrictions on\nammunition purchases or further licensing of ammunition dealers. Such legislation, if enacted, could materially and adversely affect the\nsale of bullets that we manufacture.\nThe manufacture and sale of bullets, and the possession and use of firearms and ammunition, are also the subject of significant public\ninterest and debate. If public opinion should worsen, it may lead to boycotts of certain of our products and decreased demand for the bullets\nand other products we manufacture by consumers and the other constituents with which we deal, including suppliers, distributors and\nretailers, all of which could be a catalyst for potentially adverse reactions from our shareholders.\nWe cannot assure you that governmental regulation, legislation or public opinion regarding the manufacture and sale of bullets, or the\npossession and use of firearms and ammunition, will not become more restrictive or worsen in the future. We also cannot assure you that\nany such negative public opinion relating to our Precision Sport segment would not affect our Black Diamond or Adventure segments, nor\ncan we assure you that any such changes in governmental regulation, legislation or public opinion will not have a material adverse effect on\nour business, results of operations or financial condition. See “Business(cid:3031)—(cid:3031)Regulatory Matters.”\n19\nCompliance costs related to environmental requirements could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe are, and any of our vendors or customers may be subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and\nordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment, climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and the generation, storage,\nhandling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Costs and capital expenditures\nrelating to environmental, health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the\npromulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could\ninhibit or interrupt our operations, or require modifications to our facilities. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety regulatory matters\ncould result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities.\nWe may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental remediation obligations.\nEnvironmental laws in the United States and in other countries also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated\nproperties or to pay for the cost of such remediation, often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination. Accordingly, we may\nbe liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or\noperated by us, is a landfill or other location where we have disposed wastes, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or\nprior to our ownership or operation of the property. Given the nature of the past industrial operations conducted by us and others at these\nproperties, there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified, even for those\nproperties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their\nenforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination, may give rise to additional remediation liabilities that may have a\nmaterial adverse effect upon our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Business\nThere are significant risks associated with acquiring and integrating businesses.\nAn element of our general growth strategy is the acquisition of or investment in businesses and assets that will diversify our current\nbusiness, increase size, expand our geographic scope of operations and otherwise offer growth opportunities. We may not be able to\nsuccessfully identify attractive acquisition or investment opportunities, obtain financing for acquisitions, make acquisitions on satisfactory\nterms, or successfully acquire and/or integrate identified targets. In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business or assets for a\npotential acquisition or investment, we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities, including blank check companies,\nprivate equity groups, venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these\nentities are well-established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates.\nMoreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us which will give them a\ncompetitive advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses.\nOur ability to implement our acquisition strategy is also subject to other risks and costs, including:\n• loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of acquired businesses;\n• diversion of management’s time and attention from our core businesses;\n• adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n• our ability to secure necessary financing;\n• our ability to realize operating efficiencies, synergies, or other benefits expected from an acquisition;\n• risks associated with entering markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n• risks associated with our ability to execute successful due diligence;\n• any material differences in the actual financial results of the Company’s past and future acquisitions as compared with our\nfinancial expectations for such acquisitions may require us to recognize impairment or other charges, and\n• assumption of contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets.\nAny of the above risks could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nOur previously announced growth strategy may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company announced that it is seeking to invest in high-quality, durable, cash flow-producing assets in order to diversify our business\nwithin the outdoor and consumer markets as part of our previously announced growth strategy. There can be no assurance as to the\noutcome of the growth strategy, that any particular acquisition or investment opportunities will be consummated, or that any transaction\nwill occur. In addition, our growth strategy may create perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and may result in the loss of\nemployees, customers or business partners.\n20\nTurmoil across various sectors of the financial markets may negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition, and/or\noperating results as well as our ability to effectively execute our growth strategy.\nVarious sectors of the credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval\ncharacterized by disruption in the credit markets and availability of credit and other financing, the failure, bankruptcy, collapse or sale of\nvarious financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States federal government. While the future\nrecurrence of these events cannot be predicted, they may have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain financing necessary to\neffectively execute acquisitions, the ability of our customers and suppliers to continue to operate their businesses or the demand for our\nproducts, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nOur business is significantly dependent on our ability to meet our labor needs.\nThe success of our business depends significantly on our ability to hire and retain quality team members, which include but are not limited\nto managers and other personnel. Competition for non-entry-level personnel, particularly those with experience in our industry, is highly\ncompetitive. We may be unable to meet our labor needs and control our costs due to external factors such as the availability of a sufficient\nnumber of qualified persons in the workforce of the markets in which we operate, competition, unemployment levels, demand for certain\nlabor expertise, prevailing wage rates, wage inflation, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs, adoption of new or revised\nemployment and labor laws and regulations, and the impacts of man-made or natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and public\nhealth emergencies, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, a shortage of\nlabor for certain functions, which has increased our labor costs and negatively impacted our profitability. The extent and duration of the\neffect of these labor market challenges are subject to numerous factors, including the availability of qualified persons in the markets where\nwe and our vendors and customers operate and unemployment levels within these markets, behavioral changes, prevailing wage rates and\nother benefits, inflation, adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations (including increased minimum wage\nrequirements) or government programs, safety levels of our operations, and our reputation within the labor market.\nRecent or potential future legislative initiatives may seek to increase the federal minimum wage in the United States, as well as the\nminimum wage in a number of individual states or markets. As federal or state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not\nonly the wage rates of our minimum wage team members, but also the wages paid to our other hourly team members as well. Further,\nshould we fail to increase our wages competitively in response to increasing wage rates, the quality of our workforce could decline, causing\nour customer service to suffer. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Labor has proposed rules that may have salary and wage impact for\n“exempt” team members, which could result in a substantial increase in store payroll expense. Any increase in the cost of our labor could\nhave an adverse effect on our operating costs, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn can materially adversely affect\nour business.\nAlthough none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that employees will\nnot elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If some or our entire workforce were to become unionized and collective\nbargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements or work practice, it could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adequately manage our growth.\nWe have expanded, and are seeking to continue to expand, our business. This growth has placed significant demands on our management,\nadministrative, operating, and financial resources as well as our manufacturing capacity capabilities. The continued growth of our customer\nbase, the types of products offered and the geographic markets served can be expected to continue to place a significant strain on our\nresources. Personnel qualified in the production and marketing of our products are difficult to find and hire, and enhancements of\ninformation technology systems to support growth are difficult to implement. Our future performance and profitability will depend in large\npart on our ability to attract and retain additional management and other key personnel, as well as our ability to increase and maintain our\nmanufacturing capacity capabilities to meet the needs of our current and future customers. Any failure to adequately manage our growth\ncould have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nOur credit agreement contains financial and restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe amended and restated credit agreement that we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. on April\n18, 2022 (the “Credit Agreement”) contains, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions that limit our\nability to operate our business, including, without limitation, restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to:\n• incur additional debt or create liens;\n• engage in mergers, consolidations, certain divisions, liquidations or dissolutions other than in certain permitted instances\ndescribed in the Credit Agreement;\n21\n• substantially change the business conducted by us or our subsidiaries; and\n• pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments if certain conditions in the Credit Agreement are not fulfilled.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on our and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to perform the following, subject to certain customary exceptions, qualifications and “baskets”: make certain\ninvestments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions other than in certain permitted instances as described in the Credit Agreement;\nsell assets; prepay other indebtedness; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements that restrict dividends from\nsubsidiaries or the ability of subsidiaries to grant liens upon their assets; amend certain charter documents and material agreements\ngoverning subordinated indebtedness; and deviate from certain financial ratios described further in the Credit Agreement.\nAs a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if\nneeded, may be significantly restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions or making acquisitions of a business that\nmight otherwise be beneficial to us.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase\nsignificantly.\nOur borrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt\nservice obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net\nincome and cash flows would decrease.\nCompliance with changing laws, regulations and standards of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional\nexpenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (the “Sarbanes Oxley Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, new Securities and Exchange\nCommission regulations and NASDAQ rules, are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours. These new or changed laws, regulations,\nand standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice\nmay evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty\nregarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed\nto maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws,\nregulations, and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a\ndiversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nWe could face particular challenges in maintaining and reporting on our internal control over financial reporting.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal control over financial reporting and\nrequires that we have our internal control over financial reporting audited. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, we could be\nsubject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports\ncould harm our business and the trading price of our common stock. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our\nindependent registered public accounting firm report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In\naddition, acquisition targets may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal\ncontrols. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the\ntime and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\nIf we identify any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, we may need to take\ncostly steps to implement improved controls and may be subject to sanctions for failure to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act. Such remedial costs or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, we would be required to disclose any material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, and we would receive an\nadverse opinion on our internal control over financial reporting from our independent auditors. These factors could cause investors to lose\nconfidence in our reported financial information and could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nInitiatives to upgrade our business processes and information technology systems to optimize our operational and financial\nperformance involve many risks which could result in, among other things, business interruptions, higher costs and lost profits.\nWe regularly implement business process improvement and information technology initiatives intended to optimize our operational and\nfinancial performance. Transitioning to these new or upgraded processes and systems requires significant capital investments and personnel\nresources. Implementation is also highly dependent on the coordination of numerous employees, contractors and software and system\nproviders. The interdependence of these processes and systems is a significant risk to the successful completion and continued refinement\nof these initiatives, and the failure of any aspect could have a material adverse effect on the functionality of our overall\n22\nbusiness. We may also experience difficulties in implementing or operating our new or upgraded business processes or information\ntechnology systems, including, but not limited to, ineffective or inefficient operations, significant system failures, system outages, delayed\nimplementation and loss of system availability, which could lead to increased implementation and/or operational costs, loss or corruption of\ndata, delayed shipments, excess inventory and interruptions of operations resulting in lost sales and/or profits.\nWe rely on information technology systems, including third-party cloud-based solutions, and any failure of these systems may\nresult in disruptions or outages in our e-commerce and in-store retail platforms, loss of processing capabilities, and/or loss of data,\nany of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve consumers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our underlying technology\ninfrastructure and external service providers, including third-party cloud-based solutions. These systems are vulnerable to damage or\ninterruption and we have experienced interruptions in the past. We rely on cloud-based solutions furnished by third parties primarily to\nallocate resources, pay vendors, collect from customers, process transactions, develop demand and supply plans, manage product design,\nproduction, transportation, and distribution, forecast and report operating results, meet regulatory requirements and administer employee\npayroll and benefits, among other functions. In addition, our direct-to-consumer operations, both in-store and online, rely on cloud-based\nsolutions to process transactions. We have also designed a significant portion of our software and computer systems to utilize data\nprocessing and storage capabilities from third-party cloud solution providers. Both our on-premises and cloud-based infrastructure may be\nsusceptible to outages due to any number of reasons, including, human error, fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist\nattacks and similar events. Despite the implementation of security measures that we believe to be reasonable, both our on-premises and our\ncloud-based infrastructure may also be vulnerable to hacking, computer viruses, the installation of malware and similar disruptions either\nby third-parties or employees, which may result in outages. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery\nplanning may not account for all eventualities. If we or our existing third-party cloud-based solution providers experience interruptions in\nservice regularly or for a prolonged basis, or other similar issues, our business could be seriously harmed and, in some instances, our\nconsumers may not be able to purchase our products, which could significantly and negatively affect our sales. Additionally, our existing\ncloud-based solution providers have broad discretion to change and interpret their terms of service and other policies with respect to us, and\nthey may take actions beyond our control that could harm our business. We also may not be able to control the quality of the systems and\nservices we receive from our third-party cloud-based solution providers. Any transition of the cloud-based solutions currently provided to\ndifferent cloud providers would be difficult to implement and may cause us to incur significant time and expense.\nIf we and/or our cloud-based solution providers are not successful in preventing or effectively responding to outages and cyberattacks, our\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, information technology systems require periodic modifications, upgrades, and replacement that subject us to costs and risks,\nincluding potential disruption to our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating\nexpenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel or outside firms to implement and operate existing or new systems, and other risks and\ncosts of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new or modified systems or of integrating new or modified systems into our current\nsystems. In addition, challenges implementing new or modified technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations and\nhave an adverse effect on our business operations if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated.\nBreaches of our information systems could adversely affect our reputation, disrupt our operations, and result in increased costs\nand loss of revenue.\nThere have been an increasing number of recent global cyber security incidents affecting companies, including us. These incidents are\nexpected to be more prevalent as a result of work-from-home policies, and could cause operational failures or compromise sensitive or\nconfidential corporate and personal data. Because we are interconnected with and dependent on third-party vendors, we could also be\nadversely affected if we or any of our vendors are subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event. Such cyber\nsecurity incidents may result in the loss or compromise of customer, financial, or operational data; disruption of billing, collections, or\nnormal operating activities; disruption of electronic monitoring and control of operational systems; and delays in financial reporting and\nother management functions, and our acquisition activities could increase such risk. There can be no guarantees that such a cyber incident\nwould not result in the unauthorized access to or the disclosure of customer data, our trade secrets or other intellectual property, or personal\ninformation of our employees. There can be no guarantee that the disclosure of any of this information would not have a material adverse\neffect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. We continually evaluate our systems and may implement\nfurther controls and additional preventative actions to further strengthen our systems against attacks. We cannot assure you that such\nmeasures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or that our remediation efforts following past or\nfuture attacks will be successful. Possible impacts associated with a cyber security incident may include, among other things, business\ninterruption, ransom payments, the identification of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, remediation costs related to lost,\nstolen, or compromised data; repairs to data processing systems; increased cyber security protection costs; reputational damage; and\nadverse effects on our compliance with privacy and other laws and regulations that are applicable to us. We have insurance coverage to\nprotect us against losses from certain cyber security incidents, including liability for third-party vendors who\n23\nmishandle our information. However, there can be no guarantee that every potential loss due to cyber-attack or theft of information has\nbeen insured against, nor that the limits of the insurance we have acquired will be sufficient to cover all such losses.\nAdverse publicity about the Company and/or its brands, including without limitation, through social media or in connection with\nbrand damaging events and/or public perception could negatively impact our business.\nOur brands have wide recognition, and our success has been due in large part to our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand\nimage and reputation and our consumers’ and customers’ connection to our brands. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to\nadapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising\ncampaigns. In addition, consumer and customer sentiment could be shaped by our sustainability policies and related design, sourcing and\noperational decisions.\nNegative claims or publicity involving us, our board of directors, our brands, our products, services and experiences, consumer data, or any\nof our key employees, endorsers, or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and the image of our brands, regardless of whether\nsuch claims are accurate.\nFurthermore, social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of\nresponding to negative claims. Adverse publicity could also damage our reputation and the image of our brands, undermine consumer\nconfidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if such adverse publicity is unfounded or not material to our\noperations. If the reputation, culture or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity, then our sales, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe effects of climate change and increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, customers, consumers\nand investors on sustainability issues, including those related to climate change and socially responsible activities, may adversely\naffect our business and financial results and damage our reputation.\nClimate change is occurring around the world and may impact our business in numerous ways. Such change could lead to an increase in\nraw material and packaging prices, and reduced availability, for example, due to water shortages which could adversely impact raw\nmaterial availability. Increased frequency of extreme weather (storms and floods) could cause increased incidence of disruption to the\nproduction and distribution of our products and an adverse impact on consumer demand and spending.\nInvestor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, and stakeholders have\nfocused increasingly on the environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) and related sustainability practices of companies. These parties\nhave placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or\nother stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brands, reputation and employee retention may be negatively\nimpacted. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of their adoption. We could also incur\nadditional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply with various ESG practices. Also, our failure, or perceived\nfailure, to manage reputational threats and meet expectations with respect to socially responsible activities and sustainability commitments\ncould negatively impact our credibility, employee retention, and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us.\nOur Board of Directors and executive officers have significant influence over our affairs.\nThe members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, which includes Mr. Warren B. Kanders, beneficially own\napproximately 24.3% of our outstanding common stock as of February 22, 2023. As a result, our Board of Directors and executive officer,\nto the extent they vote their shares in a similar manner, have influence over our affairs and could exercise such influence in a manner that is\nnot in the best interests of our other stockholders, including by attempting to delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction that\nmight otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe may be unable to realize the benefits of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\nNet operating losses (“NOLs”) may be carried forward to offset federal and state taxable income in future years and eliminate income taxes\notherwise payable on such taxable income, subject to certain adjustments. Based on current federal corporate income tax rates, our NOL\nand other carryforwards could provide a benefit to us, if fully utilized, of significant future tax savings. However, our ability to use these\ntax benefits in future years will depend upon the amount of our otherwise taxable income. If we do not have sufficient taxable income in\nfuture years to use the tax benefits before they expire, we will lose the benefit of these NOL carryforwards permanently.\nAdditionally, if we underwent an ownership change, the NOL carryforward limitations would impose an annual limit on the amount of the\ntaxable income that may be offset by our NOL generated prior to the ownership change. If an ownership change were to occur, we may be\nunable to use a significant portion of our NOL to offset taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs when, as of any testing\ndate, the aggregate of the increase in percentage points of the total amount of a corporation’s stock owned by one or more “5-\n24\npercent shareholders” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”) whose percentage ownership of the stock\nhas increased as of such date over the aggregate of the lowest percentage of the stock owned by such 5-percent shareholder at any time\nduring the three-year period preceding such date is more than 50 percentage points. In general, persons who own 5% or more of a\ncorporation’s stock are 5-percent shareholders, and all stock owned by persons who are not 5-percent shareholders is treated as owned by\none 5-percent shareholder. The issuance of a large number of shares of common stock in connection with any acquisitions could result in a\nlimitation of the use of our NOLs.\nFurther, our certificate of incorporation provides for blank check preferred stock, which allows the Board to issue preferred stock at any\ntime with rights and designations set forth by the Board. Section 382 of the Code generally excludes preferred stock when calculating\nownership percentages as they relate to our NOLs if the preferred stock satisfies all of the following criteria: it is not entitled to vote, it is\nlimited and preferred as to dividends and does not participate in corporate growth to any significant extent, it has redemption and\nliquidation rights which do not exceed the issue price of such stock (except for a reasonable redemption or liquidation premium), and it is\nnot convertible into another class of stock. Our Board may authorize and issue preferred stock that does not meet these criteria, and such\npreferred stock would count towards determining ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Therefore the issuance of any preferred\nstock could increase the likelihood of a limitation of the use of our NOLs.\nMoreover, if a corporation experiences an ownership change and does not satisfy the continuity of business enterprise, or COBE,\nrequirement (which generally requires that the corporation continue its historic business or use a significant portion of its historic business\nassets in a business for the two-year period beginning on the date of the ownership change), it cannot, subject to certain exceptions, use any\nNOL from a pre-change period to offset taxable income in post-change years.\nThe actual ability to utilize the tax benefit of any existing NOLs will be subject to future facts and circumstances with respect to meeting\nthe above described COBE requirements at the time NOLs are being utilized on a tax return. The realization of NOLs and the recognition\nof asset and valuation allowances for deferred taxes require management to make estimates and judgments about the Company’s future\nprofitability which are inherently uncertain. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management,\nit is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If, in the opinion of management, it becomes\nmore likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, deferred tax assets would be reduced by a\nvaluation allowance and any such reduction could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company.\nThe amount of NOL and tax credit carryforwards that we have claimed has not been audited or otherwise validated by the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service (the “IRS”). The IRS could challenge our calculation of the amount of our NOL or our determinations as to when a prior\nchange in ownership occurred, and other provisions of the Code may limit our ability to carry forward our NOL to offset taxable income in\nfuture years. If the IRS were successful with respect to any such challenge, the potential tax benefit of the NOL carryforwards to us could\nbe substantially reduced.\nCertain protective measures implemented by us to preserve our NOL may not be effective or may have some unintended negative\neffects.\nOn July 24, 2003, at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved an amendment (the “Amendment”) to our Amended\nand Restated Certificate of Incorporation to restrict certain acquisitions of our securities in order to help assure the preservation of our\nNOL. The Amendment generally restricts direct and indirect acquisitions of our equity securities if such acquisition will affect the\npercentage of the Company’s capital stock that is treated as owned by a “5% stockholder.” Additionally, on February 7, 2008, our Board of\nDirectors approved a rights agreement which is designed to assist in limiting the number of 5% or more owners and thus reduce the risk of\na possible “change of ownership” under Section 382 of the Code.\nAlthough the transfer restrictions imposed on our capital stock and the rights agreement are intended to reduce the likelihood of an\nimpermissible ownership change, there is no guarantee that such protective measures would prevent all transfers that would result in an\nimpermissible ownership change. These protective measures also will require any person attempting to acquire a significant interest in us to\nseek the approval of our Board of Directors. This may have an “anti-takeover” effect because our Board of Directors may be able to\nprevent any future takeover. Similarly, any limits on the amount of capital stock that a stockholder may own could have the effect of\nmaking it more difficult for stockholders to replace current management. Additionally, because protective measures implemented by us to\npreserve our NOL will have the effect of restricting a stockholder’s ability to acquire our common stock, the liquidity and market value of\nour common stock might suffer.\nThe loss of any member of our senior management or certain other key executives could significantly harm our business.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts and skills of our senior management team,\nincluding Warren B. Kanders. If we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management, our business may be significantly\nimpaired. In addition, many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and\nborrowing opportunities, and having such opportunities brought to us. The loss of the services of these key personnel could materially\n25\nand adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with lenders, existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and\nindustry personnel.\nOur Board of Directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval.\nOur investment, financing, borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to all other activities, including growth, debt,\ncapitalization and operations, will be determined by our Board of Directors. These policies may be amended or revised at any time and\nfrom time to time at the discretion of the Board of Directors without a vote of our stockholders. In addition, the Board of Directors may\nchange our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements. A\nchange in these policies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, per share trading price of\nour common stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nCompensation awards to our management may not be tied to or correspond with our improved financial results or share price.\nThe compensation committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our compensation and employee benefit plans and\npractices, including our executive compensation plans and our incentive compensation and equity-based compensation plans. Our\ncompensation committee has significant discretion in structuring compensation packages and may make compensation decisions based on\nany number of factors. As a result, compensation awards may not be tied to or correspond with improved financial results for the Company\nor the share price of our common stock.\nWe have been required to recognize impairment charges and may be required to take future write downs or write-offs,\nrestructuring, and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of\noperations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nIn connection with our general growth strategy of acquiring businesses and assets, we have and may be forced in the future to write-down\nor write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in us reporting losses. Even though\nthese charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could\ncontribute to negative market perceptions about us or our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of preferred stock.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that our Board of Directors will be authorized to issue from time to time,\nwithout further stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix or alter the designations,\npreferences, rights and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of each series, including the dividend rights, dividend\nrates, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, including sinking fund provisions, redemption price or prices, liquidation\npreferences and the number of shares constituting any series or designations of any series. Such shares of preferred stock could have\npreferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. We may issue additional preferred stock in ways\nwhich may delay, defer or prevent a change in control of the Company without further action by our stockholders. Such shares of preferred\nstock may be issued with voting rights that may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock by increasing the\nnumber of outstanding shares having voting rights, and by the creation of class or series voting rights.\nOur payment of future quarterly dividends on our common stock is subject to the discretion and approval of our Board of\nDirectors.\nOn August 6, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the initiation of the Quarterly Cash Dividend program of\n$0.025 per share of the Company’s common stock or $0.10 per share on an annualized basis. We temporarily replaced the Quarterly Cash\nDividend with a Quarterly Stock Dividend during portions of the 2020 fiscal year in light of the operational impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. While we intend to pay regular Quarterly Cash Dividends for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed\nquarterly and declared at the discretion and approval of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, our results of\noperations, capital requirements, general business conditions, contractual restrictions under our credit facility on the payment of dividends,\nlegal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Therefore, you\nshould not purchase our common stock if you need immediate or future income by way of dividends from your investment. In addition,\nupon an event of default under our credit facility, we are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on our common stock or\ngenerally making other distributions to our stockholders.\n26\nThe sale of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of\nour common stock.\nWe have outstanding an aggregate of 37,073,635 shares of our common stock as of February 22, 2023. This includes 6,353,234 shares of\ncommon stock that are beneficially owned by Mr. Kanders, our Chairman of the Board, of which he has 4,840,971 hypothecated and/or\npledged as security for loans from financial institutions and that may be sold by such financial institutions in the event of a foreclosure of\nthese loans. The sale of a significant amount of shares at any given time, or the perception that such sales could occur, including sales of\nthe shares beneficially owned by Mr. Kanders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue a substantial amount of our common stock in the future, which could cause dilution to current investors and\notherwise adversely affect our stock price.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock as consideration for such acquisition. These issuances could be significant. To the extent\nthat we make acquisitions and issue our shares of common stock as consideration, your equity interest in us will be diluted. Any such\nissuance will also increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock that will be eligible for sale in the future. Persons receiving\nshares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions may be more likely to sell off their common stock, which may influence\nthe price of our common stock. In addition, the potential issuance of additional shares in connection with anticipated acquisitions could\nlessen demand for our common stock and result in a lower price than might otherwise be obtained. We may issue common stock in the\nfuture for other purposes as well, including in connection with financings, for compensation purposes, in connection with strategic\ntransactions or for other purposes. The issuance of a large number of shares of common stock in connection with an acquisition could also\nhave a negative effect on our ability to use our NOLs.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if\nthey change their recommendations regarding our securities adversely, the price and trading volume of our securities could\ndecline.\nThe trading market for our securities may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our\nbusiness, market, or competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our shares of\ncommon stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our shares of common stock would\nlikely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose\nvisibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nShares of our common stock have been, and may continue to be, thinly traded, which may contribute to volatility in our stock price\nand less liquidity for investors.\nThe trading volume of our common stock has varied, and at times may be characterized as thinly traded. As a result of this thin trading\nmarket or “float” for our common stock, our common stock has been, and may continue to be, less liquid than the common stock of\ncompanies with broader public ownership. If our common stock is thinly traded, the trading of a relatively small volume of our common\nstock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our common stock than would be the case if our float were larger. As a result, the\ntrading prices of our common stock may be more volatile than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership, and an\ninvestor to be unable to liquidate an investment in our common stock at attractive prices.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock will trade in the future. Variations in financial results, announcements of material\nevents, changes in our dividend policy, technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, our quarterly operating results,\nchanges in general conditions in the economy or the outdoor and consumer industries, other developments affecting us or our competitors\nor general price and volume fluctuations in the market are among the many factors that could cause the market price of our common stock\nto fluctuate substantially.\nTechniques employed by short sellers or other derivative traders may drive down the market price of our common stock and/or\nspur litigation or regulatory action.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that a seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third party with the intention of\nbuying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. Short sellers hope to profit from a decline in the value of the securities\nbetween the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement securities, as short sellers expect to pay less in that\npurchase than they received in the sale. As it is in short sellers’ interest for the price of the security to decline, many short sellers publish, or\narrange for the publication of, negative opinions and allegations regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create\nnegative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a security short. These short attacks have, in the past, led to\nselling of shares in the market.\n27\nIf we were to become the subject of unfavorable allegations contained in short reports, whether such allegations are proven to be true or\nuntrue, we may have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we would\nprefer to strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the\nrelevant short sellers by principles of freedom of speech, applicable state law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation\ncould be costly and time-consuming, and could divert management’s attention from our day-to-day operations. Even if such allegations are\nultimately proven to be groundless, allegations against us could severely impact the market price of our common stock and our business\noperations.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n28\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur corporate headquarters, as well as our primary research, evaluation and design studios, is located in a facility owned by the Company\nin Salt Lake City, Utah. In addition, at December 31, 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries lease or own facilities throughout the U.S.,\nEurope, Australia and New Zealand.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved in various legal disputes and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that the disposition of any of the legal disputes the\nCompany or its subsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated financial\ncondition, results of operations or cash flows. It is possible that, as additional information becomes available, the impact on the Company\nof an adverse determination could have a different effect.\nLitigation\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits arising from time to time that the Company considers ordinary routine litigation incidental to\nits business. Amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs (damages and/or settlement amounts) in connection with\npending litigation and claims and related anticipated legal fees for defending such actions, which legal fees are expensed as incurred. The\ncosts are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are\nbased upon the Company’s assessment, after consultation with counsel (if deemed appropriate), of probable loss based on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case, the legal issues involved, the nature of the claim made, the nature of the damages sought and any relevant\ninformation about the plaintiffs and other significant factors that vary by case. When it is not possible to estimate a specific expected cost to\nbe incurred, the Company evaluates the range of probable loss and records the minimum end of the range. Based on currently available\ninformation, the Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the disposition of any of the legal disputes the Company or its\nsubsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of\noperations or cash flows. There is a reasonable possibility of loss from contingencies in excess of the amounts accrued by the Company in\nthe accompanying consolidated balance sheets; however, the actual amounts of such possible losses cannot currently be reasonably\nestimated by the Company at this time. It is possible that, as additional information becomes available, the impact on the Company could\nhave a different effect.\nProduct Liability\nAs a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces the risk of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for\nsubstantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. The\nCompany is therefore vulnerable to various personal injury and property damage lawsuits relating to its products and incidental to its\nbusiness.\nBased on current information, there are no pending product liability claims and lawsuits of the Company, which the Company believes in\nthe aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER\nPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOur common stock is listed for trading on NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol “CLAR”.\nPerformance Graph\nSet forth below is a line graph comparing the yearly percentage change in the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock to\nthe cumulative total return of the NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite and the Russell 2000 Index for the period commencing on\nDecember 31, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2022 (the “Measuring Period”). The graph assumes that the value of the investment in our\ncommon stock and the indexes was $100 on December 31, 2017.

Founded in 2005, our MAXTRAX brand offers\nhigh-quality overlanding and off-road vehicle recovery and extraction tracks for the overland and off-road market.\nClarus, incorporated in Delaware in 1991, acquired Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. (“Black Diamond Equipment”) in May 2010 and\nchanged its name to Black Diamond, Inc. in January 2011. In October 2012, we acquired PIEPS Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries\n(collectively, “PIEPS”). On August 14, 2017, the Company changed its name from Black Diamond, Inc. to Clarus Corporation and its stock\nticker symbol from “BDE” to “CLAR” on the NASDAQ stock exchange.\nOn August 21, 2017, the Company acquired Sierra Bullets, L.L.C. (“Sierra”). On November 6, 2018, the Company acquired the assets of\nSKINourishment, Inc. (“SKINourishment”). On October 2, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities\nconstituting the Barnes business (“Barnes”). On July 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Australia-based Rhino-Rack\nHoldings Pty Ltd (“Rhino-Rack”). On December 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Australia-based MaxTrax Australia\nPty Ltd (“MAXTRAX”).\nOn August 6, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program of\n$0.025 per share of the Company’s common stock (the “Quarterly Cash Dividend”) or $0.10 per share on an annualized basis. The\ndeclaration and payment of future Quarterly Cash Dividends is subject to the discretion of and approval of the Company’s Board of\nDirectors. On May 1, 2020, the Company announced that, in light of the operational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, its Board of\nDirectors temporarily replaced its Quarterly Cash Dividend with a stock dividend (the “Quarterly Stock Dividend”). On October 19, 2020,\nthe Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of its Quarterly Cash Dividend. In 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nour total Quarterly Cash Dividends were $3,721,000, $3,335,000, and $1,520,000 respectively. In 2020, our total Quarterly Stock\nDividends were $1,533,000, which combined with our cash dividend of $1,520,000, resulted in total dividends of $3,053,000. On February\n24, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the payment on March 17, 2023 of the Quarterly Cash Dividend to\nthe record holders of shares of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on March 7, 2023.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by each of the\nU.S., European, and Australian governments in March 2020, with governments world-wide implementing safety measures restricting travel\nand requiring citizen lockdowns and self-confinements for quarantining purposes. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and\n2022, this had negatively affected the U.S., European, Australian and global economies, disrupted global supply chains, and resulted in\nsignificant transport restrictions and disruption of global financial markets.\nAn outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have, and in the case of the COVID-19\npandemic has had and may continue to have a significant impact on the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on related\nactivities causing disruption and delay, along with increased raw material, storage, and shipping costs. Any of these disruptions and delays\nmay strain domestic and international supply chains, which could negatively affect the flow or availability of certain critical raw materials\nand finished good products that the Company relies upon. Furthermore, the foregoing impacts may significantly increase demand from\nonline sales channels, including our website, and could impact our logistical operations, including our fulfillment and shipping functions,\nwhich may result in periodic delays in the delivery of our products.\nWe expect that an outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have, and in the case of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may continue to have, an impact on the Company’s sales and profitability in future periods. The duration of these\ntrends and the magnitude of such impacts cannot be precisely estimated at this time, as they are affected by a number of factors (some of\nwhich are outside management’s control), including those presented in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n35\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nManagement’s discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based on the consolidated financial statements, which have\nbeen prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial\nstatements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We\ncontinually evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition, income taxes and valuation of long-lived\nassets, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and other intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and other\nassumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies include the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements.\n• Fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations – We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and\nintangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over these fair\nvalues is recorded as goodwill. We engage independent third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair values of\ncertain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Different valuation approaches are used to value different types of intangible assets. The\nincome approach is a valuation technique that capitalizes anticipated income associated with the asset being valued. This approach is\npredicated on developing net income and cash flow projections which are discounted for risk and the time value of money. This\napproach is generally the principal approach to the valuation of most intangible assets. The market approach involves the compilation\nand analysis of recent acquisitions of similar assets in the open market. A fair value can be estimated after adjustments are made to\nreflect comparability differences between the assets sold and those being valued. This method of valuation applies primarily to the\nvaluation of owned land, inventory, and certain intangible assets. The cost approach estimates the amount that would be required to\nreplace the service capacity of an asset (often referred to as current replacement cost). We typically apply all three approaches to\nestimate the fair value of our tangible and intangible tangible assets depending on the type of asset acquired. Business acquisitions\nmay include contingent consideration payments based on various future financial measures, such as sales-based milestones, related to\nthe acquired entity. We estimate the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities based on estimated sales growth rates, discount\nrates, and other relevant factors.\nSignificant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the projected financial information related to\neach individual asset, particularly forecasted sales growth rates, cash flows, market-based royalty rates and estimated discount rates.\nProduct technology and trademarks are valued using the relief-from-royalty method, and customer relationships are valued using the\nmulti-period excess earnings model. The relief-from-royalty method is used to estimate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an\nintangible asset who would otherwise have to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. The multi-\nperiod excess earnings method supposes that the owner of the intangible asset is able to achieve a return in excess of that received\nwithout the intangible asset through enhanced revenues or cost savings. Our discounted cash flow estimates use discount rates that\ncorrespond to a weighted-average cost of capital consistent with a market-participant view. The discount rates are consistent with\nthose used for investment decisions and take into account our operating plans and strategies. Management’s estimates of fair value are\nbased upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If we do not achieve the\nresults reflected in the assumptions and estimates, our goodwill impairment evaluations could be adversely affected, and we may\nimpair a portion or all of our intangible assets, which would adversely affect our operating results in the period of impairment.\n• Income taxes – We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method provides that deferred\ntax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial\nreporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We may make assumptions,\njudgments and estimates in order to determine the future taxable income available to support the recoverability of deferred tax assets\nat a more-likely-than-not threshold. The sources of future taxable income include 1) future reversal of existing taxable temporary\ndifferences, 2) taxable income in carryback years if carryback is permitted, 3) future taxable income from future operations, and 4) tax\nplanning strategies. The degree and subjectivity and judgment increases as the source of future taxable income becomes more\ninherently subjective. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the realizability of a deferred tax asset take into account\npredictions of the amount and category of expected future taxable income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and\ncategory of income in future years could cause our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes to\nbe inaccurate. Changes in any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above related to the realizability of deferred tax\nassets, could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\n36\n•\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets – We assess the recoverability of our reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill by\nperforming a qualitative assessment and/or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. At a minimum, we perform an annual assessment\nof possible goodwill impairment as of each December 31. Management may perform an interim goodwill impairment assessment\nwhenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse\nchange in the business climate or a decision to sell or dispose of the reporting unit. If we begin with a qualitative assessment and are\nable to support the conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value,\nwe are not required to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, we are required to perform the quantitative\ngoodwill impairment test which compares the reporting unit’s carrying value including goodwill to its estimated fair value. We\nestimate the reporting unit’s fair value using a combination of the income approach based upon projected discounted cash flows of the\nreporting unit and the market approach based upon the market multiple of comparable publicly traded companies. If the estimated fair\nvalue of the reporting entity exceeds the carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired, and no further review is required. However, if\nthe carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment expense should be recognized for the excess of\nthe carrying value over the fair value.\nUnder the income approach, the estimated discounted cash flows are based on the best information available to us at the time,\nincluding supportable assumptions and projections we believe are reasonable. Our discounted cash flow estimates use discount rates\nthat correspond to a weighted-average cost of capital consistent with a market-participant view. The discount rates are consistent with\nthose used for investment decisions and take into account our future operating plans and strategies. Certain other key assumptions\nutilized, including revenue and cash flow projections, are based on estimates consistent with those utilized in our annual budgeting\nand planning process that we believe are reasonable. However, if we do not achieve the results reflected in the assumptions and\nestimates, our goodwill impairment evaluations could be adversely affected, and we may impair a portion or all of our goodwill,\nwhich would adversely affect our operating results in the period of impairment.\nThe market approach identifies the EBITDA multiples of comparable publicly traded companies. The reporting unit’s current\nEBITDA is multiplied by the market multiple to estimate its current estimated fair value. Key assumptions utilized in estimating the\nreporting unit’s EBITDA include revenue and cash flow projections. If the market multiples or EBITDA value assumptions are\nincorrect, our goodwill impairment evaluation could also be adversely affected, and we may impair a portion or all of our goodwill,\nwhich would adversely affect our operating results in the period of impairment.\nWe also test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, generally as of December 31st of each\nyear. Management may perform an interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment whenever events or circumstances\nmake it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a\ndecision to sell or dispose of the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived asset is higher than its fair value, then the\nasset is deemed to be impaired and the impairment charge is estimated as the difference. The Company calculates the fair value of its\nindefinite-lived intangible assets using the income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. The relief-from-\nroyalty method is used to estimate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset who would otherwise have to pay\nroyalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. Internally forecasted revenues, which the Company believes\nreasonably approximate market participant assumptions, are multiplied by a royalty rate to arrive at the estimated net after tax cost\nsavings. The royalty rate used in the analysis is based on an analysis of empirical, market-derived royalty rates for comparable\nintangible assets. The net after tax cost savings are discounted using the same weighted-average cost of capital discount rate developed\nfor purposes of the Company's quantitative goodwill impairment test. The key uncertainties in these calculations are the assumptions\nused in determining the revenue associated with each indefinite-lived intangible asset and the royalty rate. If we do not achieve the\nresults reflected in the market assumptions and forecasted estimates, our indefinite-lived intangibles impairment evaluations could be\nadversely affected, and we may impair a portion or all of their carrying values, which would adversely affect our operating results in\nthe period of impairment.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $92,311,000 of impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,\nspecifically the Rhino-Rack trademark, in our Adventure reporting unit. No impairment was recorded during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, and 2020.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to the notes to consolidated financial statements.\n37\nResults of Operations (In Thousands)\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nThe following presents a discussion of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with the year ended December 31,\n2021:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nSales\nDomestic sales $ 238,144 $ 225,878\nInternational sales 209,962 149,916\nTotal sales 448,106 375,794\nCost of goods sold 284,690 238,862\nGross profit 163,416 136,932\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative 135,039 105,494\nTransaction costs 2,967 11,843\nContingent consideration expense (benefit) 493 (1,605)\nImpairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets 92,311 -\nTotal operating expenses 230,810 115,732\nOperating (loss) income (67,394) 21,200\nOther income (expense)\nInterest expense, net (7,895) (2,939)\nOther, net (1,842) (4,382)\nTotal other expense, net (9,737) (7,321)\n(Loss) income before income tax (77,131) 13,879\nIncome tax benefit (7,351) (12,214)\nNet (loss) income $ (69,780) $ 26,093\nSales\nSales increased $72,312, or 19.2%, to $448,106 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to sales of $375,794 during the year\nended December 31, 2021. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to an increase in sales at the Adventure, Precision Sport, and\nOutdoor segments of $50,095, $23,032, and $8,126, respectively. The increase at the Adventure segment is due to the full year ownership\nof the Adventure brands during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the partial year of ownership in the prior period. Sales\nincreases in the Outdoor and Adventure segments were partially offset by a decrease in sales of $6,613 and $2,328, respectively, due to the\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior period.\nDomestic sales increased $12,266, or 5.4%, to $238,144 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to domestic sales of\n$225,878 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to an increase in sales at the\nAdventure and Precision Sport segments of $12,470 and $4,267, respectively. The increase at the Adventure segment is due to the full year\nownership of the Adventure brands during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the partial year of ownership in the prior\nperiod. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales at the Outdoor segment of $4,471.\nInternational sales increased $60,046, or 40.1%, to $209,962 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to international sales of\n$149,916 during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Gross margin during the year ended December 31, 2022, increased compared\nto the prior year as gross margin was negatively impacted by $4,769 due to the sale of Barnes, Rhino-Rack, and MAXTRAX inventory that\nwas recorded at its fair value in purchase accounting during the year ended December 31, 2021. The 2022 increase was partially offset by\nthe $269 MAXTRAX fair value inventory charge due to purchase accounting during the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as\nunfavorable foreign exchange impacts due to a strong U.S. dollar against foreign currencies and abnormally high freight costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $29,545, or 28.0%, to $135,039 during the year ended December 31, 2022,\ncompared to selling, general and administrative expenses of $105,494 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses is primarily due to the inclusion of Rhino-Rack and MAXTRAX for the full year in 2022, which\nincluded incremental expenditure of $16,634 and $4,526 in 2022 for Rhino-Rack and MAXTRAX, respectively. Additionally, the\nCompany incurred higher Corporate costs of $4,083 primarily related to increased payroll and stock compensation of $3,546 during the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, compared to the prior year. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to the Company’s\ninvestments in retail and direct-to-consumer initiatives at the Outdoor segment.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction expense decreased to $2,967 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to transaction costs of $11,843 during the\nyear ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of expenses related to the Company’s various acquisition efforts.\nContingent Consideration Expense (Benefit)\nContingent consideration expense was $493 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a $1,605 contingent consideration\nbenefit during the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of changes in estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nImpairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets increased to $92,311 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to\nimpairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $0 during the year ended December 31, 2021. Based on the results of the\nCompany’s impairment analysis completed as of December 31, 2022, the Company determined that goodwill at the Adventure reporting\nunit and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, specifically the Rhino-Rack trademark, were impaired and recognized a charge of\n$52,071 and $40,240, respectively.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net increased to $7,895 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to interest expense, net of $2,939 during the\nyear ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily\nassociated with the increase in the average outstanding debt amounts during the period compared to the prior year, higher interest rates, and\nthe recording of certain debt issuance costs.\n39\nOther, net\nOther, net expense decreased by $2,540, or 58.0%, to $1,842 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to other, net expense of\n$4,382 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in other, net was primarily attributable to losses from non-hedged foreign\ncurrency contracts during the year ended December 31, 2021, not repeating in the current period. The decrease was partially offset by an\nincrease in remeasurement losses recognized on the Company’s foreign denominated accounts receivable and accounts payable.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax benefit decreased $4,863, or 39.8%, to $7,351 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to an income tax benefit of\n$12,214 during the same period in 2021. Our effective income tax rate was a benefit of 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022, and\ndiffered compared to the statutory tax rates primarily due to the impact of impairment of goodwill as well as officer compensation\nlimitations, partially offset by the impact of foreign earnings taxed at applicable statutory rates, tax credits, and permanent book to tax\ndifferences related to incentive stock options. Our effective income tax rate was a benefit of 88% for the year ended December 31, 2021,\nand differed compared to the statutory tax rates due to the partial release of a valuation allowance offsetting deferred tax assets and discrete\ncharges recorded during the period. This release of the valuation allowance is primarily due to a change in accounting method which\nincreased taxable income and the ability to utilize NOLs. Factors that could cause our annual effective tax rate to differ materially from our\nquarterly effective tax rates include changes in the geographic mix of taxable income and discrete events that may occur.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nThe following presents the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared with the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2020\nSales\nDomestic sales $ 225,878 $ 132,226\nInternational sales 149,916 91,781\nTotal sales 375,794 224,007\nCost of goods sold 238,862 146,212\nGross profit 136,932 77,795\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative 105,494 71,428\nContingent consideration benefit (1,605) –\nTransaction costs 11,843 2,433\nTotal operating expenses 115,732 73,861\nOperating income 21,200 3,934\nOther income (expense)\nInterest expense, net (2,939) (1,261)\nOther, net (4,382) 912\nTotal other expense, net (7,321) (349)\nIncome before income tax 13,879 3,585\nIncome tax benefit (12,214) (1,960)\nNet income $ 26,093 $ 5,545\n40\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (In Thousands)\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nOur primary ongoing funding requirements are for working capital, expansion of our operations (both organically and through acquisitions)\nand general corporate needs, as well as investing with the various brands. We plan to fund these activities through a combination of our\nfuture operating cash flows and borrowings on our revolving credit facility which had approximately $98,000 available to borrow at\nDecember 31, 2022, while currently maintaining compliance with the consolidated total leverage ratio per the Restated Credit Agreement\nof 3.75 to 1. We believe that our liquidity requirements and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months will be adequately\ncovered by cash provided by operations and our existing revolving credit facility. Additionally, long-term contractual obligations are also\ncurrently expected to be funded from cash from operations and availability under our existing credit facilities. For additional information\nregarding the Company’s existing credit facilities, see the section titled “Credit Agreement” below.\nAt December 31, 2022, we had total cash of $12,061, compared to cash of $19,465 at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, the\nCompany had $7,921 of the $12,061 in cash held by foreign entities, of which $5,719 is considered permanently reinvested.\nThe following presents a discussion of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared with the year ended December 31,\n2021.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 14,610 $ (304)\nNet cash used in investing activities (7,751) (178,142)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (13,858) 180,677\nEffect of foreign exchange rates on cash (405) (555)\nChange in cash (7,404) 1,676\nCash, beginning of year 19,465 17,789\nCash, end of period $ 12,061 $ 19,465\nNet Cash From Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $14,610 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash used in operating\nactivities of $304 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in net cash provided by (used in) operating activities during 2022\nis primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as improvements in working capital and increases in stock\ncompensation and contingent consideration expense during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.\nFree cash flow, defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures, of $6,360 was generated during the\nyear ended December 31, 2022 compared to ($17,687) of negative free cash flow during the same period in 2021. The Company believes\nthat the non-GAAP measure, free cash flow, provides an understanding of the capital required by the Company to expand its asset base. A\nreconciliation of free cash flows to comparable GAAP financial measures is set forth below:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 14,610 $ (304)\nPurchase of property and equipment (8,250) (17,383)\nFree cash flow $ 6,360 $ (17,687)\nNet Cash From Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $7,751 during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to net cash used in investing activities\nof $178,142 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash used during the year ended December 31, 2022 is due to the\nacquisition of Rhino-Rack and MAXTRAX during the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as a decrease in purchases of property and\nequipment, primarily due to the purchase of the Barnes facility during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n41\nNet Cash From Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $13,858 during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to net cash provided by financing\nactivities of $180,677 during the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash provided during the year ended December 31, 2022,\ncompared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in net proceeds to the revolving line of credit and term loan, a\ndecrease in proceeds from the sale of common stock, and an increase in purchases of treasury stock.\nNet Operating Loss\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and research and experimentation credit for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes of $17,663 and $2,651, respectively. The Company believes its U.S. Federal NOLs will substantially offset its\nfuture U.S. Federal income taxes until expiration. The majority of the Company’s pre-tax income is currently earned and expected to be\nearned in the U.S., or taxed in the U.S. as Subpart F income and will be offset with the NOLs. The Company has $17,663 of NOLs, of\nwhich, $1,851 expire on December 31, 2023. These NOLs are subject to compliance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company’s gross deferred tax asset was $32,972. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of\n$3,323, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $29,649, before deferred tax liabilities of $30,243. The Company has provided a valuation\nallowance against a portion of the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022, because the ultimate realization of those assets does not\nmeet the more-likely-than-not criteria. The majority of the Company’s deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards for\nfederal tax purposes. If a change in control were to occur, these could be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\n(“Code”), as amended.\nCredit Agreement\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had drawn approximately $18,049 of the approximately $98,000 available to borrow on the\nrevolving loan commitment at December 31, 2022, while maintaining compliance with the consolidated total leverage ratio per the\nRestated Credit Agreement (as defined below) of 3.75 to 1, and $120,311 was outstanding under the term loan commitment. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, the interest rates on the revolving loan and term loan commitments were approximately 6.3%. The Company was in\ncompliance with the debt covenants set forth in the Restated Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022.\nOn April 18, 2022 (the “Effective Date”), the Company, Black Diamond Retail, Inc., Black Diamond Retail – Alaska, LLC, Sierra Bullets,\nL.L.C., SKINourishment, LLC, Black Diamond Retail – Colorado, LLC, Black Diamond Retail – Montana, LLC, Black Diamond Retail –\nWyoming, LLC, Barnes Bullets-Mona, LLC, Black Diamond Retail – Oregon, LLC, Black Diamond Retail – Vermont, LLC (collectively\nwith the Company, the “Borrowers”) and the other loan parties party thereto (together with the Borrowers, each a “Loan Party”, and\ncollectively, the “Loan Parties”) entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as\nadministrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”) and the lenders party thereto (the “Restated Credit Agreement”) pursuant to which the\nexisting Credit Agreement, dated as of May 3, 2019 (as amended prior to the Effective Date, the “Existing Credit Agreement”) by and\namong the Company, the lenders and loan parties from time to time party thereto and the Administrative Agent was amended and restated\nin its entirety. Each of the Loan Parties, other than the Company, is a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company.\nThe Restated Credit Agreement provides for borrowings of up to $300,000 under a secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving\nLoans”) (including up to $5,000 for letters of credit), and borrowings of up to $125,000 under a secured term loan facility (the “Term\nLoans”). The Restated Credit Agreement also permits the Borrowers, subject to certain requirements, to arrange with lenders for an\naggregate of up to $175,000 of additional revolving and/or term loan commitments (both of which are currently uncommitted), for potential\naggregate revolving and term loan commitments under the Restated Credit Agreement of up to $600,000. The proceeds of loans made\nunder the Restated Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions permitted\nunder the Restated Credit Agreement. The Restated Credit Agreement matures on April 18, 2027 (the “Maturity Date”), at which time the\nrevolving commitments thereunder will terminate and all outstanding Revolving Loans and Term Loans, together with all accrued and\nunpaid interest thereon, must be repaid.\nThe Term Loans were fully drawn on the Effective Date and cannot be reborrowed. The Restated Credit Agreement provides for quarterly\namortization payments of the Term Loans on the last business day of each March, June, September and December, commencing on June\n30, 2022. Through and including the payment due on March 31, 2023, the scheduled amortization payment is $1,563 per quarter, and each\nscheduled amortization payment due thereafter through the Maturity Date is $3,125 per quarter.\n42\nThe Borrowers may elect to have the Revolving Loans and Term Loans under the Restated Credit Agreement bear interest at an applicable\nrate plus either:\n(i) in the case of alternate base rate borrowings, a rate per annum generally equal to the greatest of:\n(a) the prime rate in effect on such day;\n(b) 0.50% plus the greater of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s effective federal funds rate or the Federal\nReserve Bank of New York’s overnight bank funding rate in effect on such day; and\n(c) 1.00% plus the adjusted term SOFR rate for a 1-month interest period;\nprovided that, in certain circumstances where the alternate base rate is being used as an alternate rate of interest, the alternate base rate shall\nbe determined only according to (a) and (b), and shall be subject to a 1.00% floor; or\n(ii) in the case of term benchmark borrowings, a rate per annum as follows:\n(a) for borrowings denominated in U.S. Dollars, the term SOFR rate (based on one, three or six-month interest\nperiods) plus 0.10%, subject to a 0.00% floor; or\n(b) for borrowings denominated in a Foreign Currency, the applicable rate for such Foreign Currency set forth in\nthe Restated Credit Agreement.\nThe applicable rate for these borrowings will range from 0.50% to 1.625% per annum, in the case of alternate base rate borrowings, and\n1.50% to 2.625% per annum, in the case of term benchmark borrowings. The applicable rate was initially 0.875% per annum, in the case of\nalternate base rate borrowings, and 1.875% per annum, in the case of term benchmark borrowings, however, these initial applicable rates\nmay be adjusted from time to time based upon the level of the Company’s consolidated total leverage ratio, which is more fully discussed\nin the Restated Credit Agreement. If one or more of the above interest rates are not determinable, or under certain other circumstances set\nforth in the Restated Credit Agreement, a substitute or alternative interest rate may apply under the Restated Credit Agreement.\nThe Restated Credit Agreement also requires the Borrowers to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan\ncommitments. Such commitment fee will range between 0.15% and 0.30% per annum, and is also based upon the level of the Company’s\nconsolidated total leverage ratio, which is more fully discussed in the Restated Credit Agreement. The Company is also obligated to pay\nother customary closing fees, arrangement fees, administration fees and letter of credit fees for a credit facility of this size and type.\nThe Restated Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the ability of the Company\nand its subsidiaries to perform the following, subject to certain customary exceptions, qualifications and “baskets”: (i) incur additional debt;\n(ii) create liens; (iii) engage in mergers, consolidations, certain divisions, liquidations or dissolutions other than in certain permitted\ninstances as described in the Restated Credit Agreement; (iv) substantially change the business conducted by the Company and its\nsubsidiaries; (v) make certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions other than in certain permitted instances as\ndescribed in the Restated Credit Agreement; (vi) sell assets; (vii) pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments if certain\nconditions in the Restated Credit Agreement are not fulfilled; (viii) prepay other indebtedness; (ix) engage in certain transactions with\naffiliates; (x) enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries or the ability of subsidiaries to grant liens upon their assets; (xi)\namend certain charter documents and material agreements governing subordinated indebtedness; (xii) permit the consolidated total leverage\nratio, which is to be determined for each quarter end on a trailing twelve month basis, from exceeding a limit of 3.75 to 1, provided, that,\nsubject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Restated Credit Agreement, so long as no Event of Default (as defined in the\nRestated Credit Agreement) exists at such time or would result therefrom, the Company may elect to increase the maximum consolidated\ntotal leverage ratio permitted under the Restated Credit Agreement to 4.25:1.00 for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in\nconnection with any acquisition permitted under the Restated Credit Agreement for which the aggregate consideration is greater than or\nequal to $60,000; and (xiii) permit the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, which is to be determined for each quarter end on a trailing\ntwelve month basis, to be less than 1.25 to 1.\nThe Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to: (i) failure to pay amounts due\nunder the Restated Credit Agreement; (ii) materially incorrect representations and warranties; (iii) failure to comply with covenants; (iv)\nchange of control; and (v) default under other indebtedness aggregating at least $3,000.\nThe obligations of each Loan Party under the Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by each other Loan Party. All obligations under\nthe Restated Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations (as well as banking services obligations and certain swap\nagreements), are secured by pledges and liens on 100% of the equity interests of domestic subsidiaries, either 100% or 65% of the equity\ninterests of certain foreign subsidiaries, and the accounts receivable, inventory, intellectual property and certain real property or other\n43\nassets of the Loan Parties pursuant to (i) a Pledge and Security Agreement, dated as of May 3, 2019, by and among certain of the Loan\nParties and the Administrative Agent (as amended from time to time prior to the Effective Date, the “PSA”), (ii) a General Security Deed,\ndated as of August 30, 2021, by and among certain of the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent (the “Oscar GSD”), (iii) a General\nSecurity Deed, dated as of January 31, 2022, by and among certain of the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent (the “Simpson GSD”)\nor (iv) a mortgage or other applicable security agreement or instrument. Each of the PSA, the Oscar GSD and the Simpson GSD was\nreaffirmed by the Loan Parties on the Effective Date pursuant to a Reaffirmation Agreement dated as of the Effective Date by and among\nthe Administrative Agent and the Loan Parties pursuant to which each Loan Party ratified and reaffirmed its obligations to the Lenders in\nconnection with entering into the Restated Credit Agreement.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not engage in any transactions or have relationships or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities. These include special\npurpose and similar entities or other off-balance sheet arrangements. We also do not engage in energy, weather or other commodity-based\ncontracts.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn general, we can be exposed to market risks including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and certain\ncommodity prices that can affect the cost of operating, investing, and financing under those conditions. The Company believes it has\nmoderate exposure to these risks. We assess market risk based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, and commodity prices\nutilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential loss in earnings, fair values, and cash flows based on a hypothetical change in\nthese rates and prices.\nInterest Rate Risks\nOur primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facility since the interest is indexed to market rates. We\nentered into our current credit facility on April 18, 2022, and simultaneously terminated our previous credit facility. The applicable interest\nrate for the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately 6.3% and 2.4%,\nrespectively. Amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $138,360,000 and $140,375,000, respectively. A change of\n100-basis points in market interest rates would cause an impact of approximately $1,384,000 to annual interest expense as of December 31,\n2022.\nForeign Currency Risks\nWe transact business predominantly in U.S. dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, and Canadian dollars. Given the current geopolitical\nenvironment and other economic uncertainties worldwide, changes in the relation to these and other currencies to the U.S. dollar will affect\nour sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses. For the year ending December 31, 2022, approximately 37% of our sales\nwere denominated in foreign currencies (compared to 41% of our pro forma sales in the prior year), the most significant of which were the\nAustralian Dollar, Euro, Canadian Dollar, Norwegian Kroner, and Swiss Franc. The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging\nactivities is to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate exposure on the cash flows related to forecasted inventory purchases and sales.\nA hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates would not have a material effect on foreign currency gains and losses related to the\nforeign currency derivatives or the net fair value of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives. We have not held a material amount of\nforeign assets during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and do not believe our foreign assets expose us to a material\nforeign currency risk.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe employ a variety of practices to manage these market risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed\nappropriate, the use of derivative instruments. Derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation\nor trading. Derivatives are such that a specific debt instrument, contract, or anticipated purchase determines the amount, maturity, and other\nspecifics of the hedge. If a derivative contract is entered into, we either determine that it is an economic hedge or we designate the\nderivative as a cash flow or fair value hedge. We do not hold derivative financial investments, derivative commodity investments, engage\nin foreign currency hedging or other transactions that expose us to material market risks.\n44\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nCLARUS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIndex to Financial Statements\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No. 34) 46\nConsolidated Balance Sheets - December 31, 2022 and 2021 48\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income - Years Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 49\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows - Years Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 50\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity - Years Ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 51\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 52\n45\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Clarus Corporation:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Clarus Corporation and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December\n31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of\nthe three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our\nopinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and\n2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control —\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated\nFebruary 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our\naudits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits\nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit\nmatters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical\naudit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets — Adventure reporting unit and Rhino-Rack trademark — Refer to Notes 1 and 5 to the financial\nstatements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company's evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of the estimated fair\nvalue of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the reporting unit’s fair value\nusing a combination of the income approach based upon projected discounted cash flows and the market approach based upon the market\nmultiple of comparable publicly traded companies. The determination of the fair value using the income approach requires management to\nmake significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue and cash flow projections and discount rates. The determination of the fair\nvalue using the market approach also requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue and cash flow\nprojections used to determine earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) as well as the market multiple of\ncomparable publicly traded companies. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets using the relief-from-\nroyalty method. The relief-from-royalty method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue\nprojections, discount rates, and royalty rates. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment\nin its Adventure reporting unit of $52 million and $40 million related to the Rhino-Rack indefinite-lived trademark in its Adventure\nreporting unit.\nWe identified the valuation of the Adventure reporting unit and Rhino-Rack trademark as a critical audit matter because of the significant\nestimates and assumptions management made to determine their fair values. The audit of these estimates and assumptions required a high\ndegree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when\n46\nperforming audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to revenue and cash flow\nprojections, and the selection of EBITDA multiples, discount rates, and royalty rates.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the revenue and cash flow projections (“projections”), and the selection of EBITDA multiples, discount\nrates, and royalty rates for the valuation of the Adventure reporting unit and Rhino-Rack trademark included the following, among others:\n• We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analyses, including\nthose over revenue and cash flow projections and the selection of EBITDA multiples, discount rates, and royalty rates.\n• We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s projections by comparing the projections to:\n– Historical revenues and cash flows.\n– Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.\n– Projected information included in industry reports and certain of its peer companies.\n• With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodologies, EBITDA multiples,\ndiscount rates, and royalty rates by:\n– Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and royalty rates and the mathematical\naccuracy of the calculations.\n– Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n– Evaluating EBITDA multiples, including testing the underlying source information and mathematical accuracy of the\ncalculations, and comparing the multiples selected by management to its comparable publicly traded companies.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSalt Lake City, Utah\nFebruary 27, 2023\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.\n47\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash $ 12,061 $ 19,465\nAccounts receivable, net 66,553 66,180\nInventories 147,072 129,354\nPrepaid and other current assets 9,899 11,831\nIncome tax receivable 3,034 116\nTotal current assets 238,619 226,946\nProperty and equipment, net 43,010 42,826\nOther intangible assets, net 55,255 73,683\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets 82,901 128,271\nGoodwill 62,993 118,090\nDeferred income taxes 17,912 22,433\nOther long-term assets 17,455 19,578\nTotal assets $ 518,145 $ 631,827\nLiabilities and Stockholders' Equity\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 27,052 $ 31,488\nAccrued liabilities 25,170 27,473\nIncome tax payable 421 4,437\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 11,952 9,585\nTotal current liabilities 64,595 72,983\nLong-term debt, net 127,082 131,948\nDeferred income taxes 18,506 35,280\nOther long-term liabilities 15,854 21,448\nTotal liabilities 226,037 261,659\nStockholders' Equity\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share; 5,000\nshares authorized; none issued -

NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accompanying audited consolidated financial statements of Clarus Corporation and subsidiaries (which may be referred to as the\n“Company,” “Clarus,” “we,” “our” or “us”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nNature of Business\nHeadquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, we are a global leading designer, developer, manufacturer and distributor of best-in-class outdoor\nequipment and lifestyle products focused on the outdoor and consumer enthusiast markets. Our mission is to identify, acquire and grow\noutdoor “super fan” brands through our unique “innovate and accelerate” strategy. We define a “super fan” brand as a brand that creates the\nworld’s pre-eminent, performance-defining product that the best-in-class user cannot live without. Each of our brands has a long history of\ncontinuous product innovation for core and everyday users alike. The Company’s products are principally sold globally under the Black\nDiamond®, Sierra®, Barnes®, Rhino-Rack® and MAXTRAX® brand names through outdoor specialty and online retailers, our own\nwebsites, distributors and original equipment manufacturers.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. The more significant estimates relate to the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations, excess or\nobsolete inventory, allowance for credit losses, contingent consideration liabilities, and valuation of deferred tax assets, long-lived assets,\ngoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and other intangible assets. We base our estimates on historical experience, projected future\ncash flows, and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these\nestimates.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Clarus Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nForeign Currency Transactions and Translation\nThe accounts of the Company’s international subsidiaries’ financial statements which have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar\nare translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at the balance sheet dates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for the\nperiods for revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income (expense) in the\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not hold any amounts that were considered to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company records its trade receivables at sales value. The trade receivables do not bear interest. The Company performs on-going\ncredit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness, as\ndetermined by the review of their current credit information. The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable and\ndetermines the appropriate allowance for credit losses based on a combination of factors. A non-specific allowance for estimated credit\nlosses is recorded based on historical experience of collectability. In addition, specific allowances are established for customer accounts as\nknown collection problems occur due to insolvency, disputes or other collection issues. The amounts of these specific allowances are\nestimated by management based on the customer’s financial position, the age of the customer’s receivables and the reasons for any\ndisputes. The allowance for credit losses is reduced by subsequent collections of the specific allowances or by any write-off of customer\naccounts that are deemed uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses was $1,211 and $811 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThere were no significant write-offs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\n52\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method “FIFO”) or net realizable value. Elements of cost in the\nCompany’s manufactured inventories generally include raw materials, direct labor, manufacturing overhead and freight in. The Company\nreviews its inventories for excess, close-out, or slow-moving items and makes provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory values.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method\nover the estimated useful lives. The principal estimated useful lives are: buildings, 30 years; building improvements, 20 years; machinery\nand equipment, 3-10 years; computer hardware and software, 3-5 years; furniture and fixtures, 5 years. Leasehold improvements are\namortized over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the life of the lease. Major replacements, which extend the\nuseful lives of equipment, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life. Normal maintenance and repair items are\nexpensed as incurred. Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances exist that indicate\nthe carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Property and equipment located outside of the United States are not considered\nmaterial.\nLeases\nLease assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement of an arrangement where it is determined at inception that a lease\nexists. Lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make\nlease payments arising from the lease. These assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over\nthe lease term calculated using our incremental borrowing rate. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is\nreasonably certain that those options will be exercised.\nVariable lease payments are generally expensed as incurred and include certain non-lease components, such as common area maintenance\nand other services provided by the lessor, and other charges such as utilities, insurance and property taxes included in the lease. Leases\nwith an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, and the expense for these short-term leases and for leases is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Non-lease components are excluded from the right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease\nliability present value computations. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material\nrestrictive covenants.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets of acquired companies. Goodwill\nis not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of December 31st of each year or more frequently\nif triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment, such as a significant adverse change in business climate. The\nCompany has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting\nunit is less than its carrying amount. If, through this qualitative assessment, the conclusion is made that it is more likely than not that a\nreporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, or the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, a quantitative\nimpairment analysis is performed. We estimate the reporting unit’s fair value using a combination of the income approach based upon\nprojected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit and the market approach based upon the market multiple of comparable publicly\ntraded companies. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess\ncarrying amount over the fair value computation. Based on the results of the Company’s annual impairment tests completed as of\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company recognized goodwill impairment in our Adventure reporting unit of $52,071. No impairment of goodwill\nwas recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets represent other intangible assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired. The Company’s other intangible assets,\nsuch as certain customer relationships, product technologies, tradenames, trademarks and core technologies with finite lives are amortized\nover their estimated useful lives. Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances exist\nthat indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n53\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of certain tradenames and trademarks that provide Black Diamond Equipment,\nPIEPS, Sierra, Barnes, Rhino-Rack, and MAXTRAX with the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and sell their respective\nproducts. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized; however, they are tested for impairment annually as of December 31st of each\nyear or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances exist that may indicate impairment. The Company has the option to first\nassess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than\nits carrying amount. If, through this qualitative assessment, the conclusion is made that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived\nintangible asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount, or the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, a quantitative\nimpairment analysis is performed by comparing the indefinite-lived intangible asset's book value to its estimated fair value. The fair value\nfor indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined through an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. The amount of any\nimpairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired asset. Based on the results of the\nCompany’s annual impairment tests completed as of December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment of indefinite-lived\nintangible assets in our Adventure reporting unit, specifically the Rhino-Rack trademark, of $40,240 during the year ended December 31,\n2022. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to hedge currency rate movements on foreign currency denominated sales. The Company enters\ninto forward contracts, option contracts and non-deliverable forwards to manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on a portion of\nits forecasted foreign currency exposure. These derivatives are carried at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets in\nprepaid and other current assets, other long-term assets, accrued liabilities, and other long-term liabilities. Changes in fair value of the\nderivatives not designated as hedge instruments are included in Other, net in the determination of net income. For derivative contracts\ndesignated as hedge instruments, the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the instruments are\nincluded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to sales in the period the underlying hedged item is recognized in\nearnings.\nFor all hedging relationships, the Company formally documents the hedging relationship and its risk-management objective and strategy\nfor undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging\ninstrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively, and a description of the method\nused to measure ineffectiveness. The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing\nbasis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging relationships are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged\ntransactions. The Company uses operating budgets and cash flow forecasts to estimate future foreign currency cash flow exposures and to\ndetermine the level and timing of derivative transactions intended to mitigate such exposures in accordance with its risk management\npolicies. The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in\noffsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, the cash flow hedge is de-\ndesignated because a forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring, or management determines to remove the designation of the cash\nflow hedge. The Company does not enter into material derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging. The Company\ndoes not speculate using derivative instruments.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company records compensation expense for all share-based awards granted based on the fair value of the award at the time of the\ngrant. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses\nassumptions and estimates that the Company believes are reasonable. Stock-based compensation costs for stock awards and restricted stock\nawards is measured based on the closing market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. For restricted stock awards\nsubject to market conditions, the fair value of each restricted stock award has been estimated as of the date of grant using the Monte-Carlo\npricing model. The Company recognizes the cost of the share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the\naward and recognizes forfeitures in the period they occur. Stock options granted have contractual terms of up to ten years. Upon exercise of\nstock options or vesting of restricted stock awards, the Company issues shares from new shares authorized and reserved for issuance.\n54\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when a contract exists with a customer that specifies the goods and services to be provided at an agreed\nupon sales price and when the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the goods or service to the customer. The performance\nobligation is considered complete when control transfers, which is determined when products are shipped or delivered to the customer\ndepending on the terms of the contract. Sales are made on normal and customary short-term credit terms or upon delivery of point-of-sale\ntransactions.\nThe Company enters into contractual arrangements with customers in the form of individual customer orders which specify the goods,\nquantity, pricing, and associated order terms. The Company does not have long-term contracts that are satisfied over time. Due to the\nnature of the contracts, no significant judgment exists in relation to the identification of the customer contract, satisfaction of the\nperformance obligation, or transaction price. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract due to the short-term nature\nof the contracts.\nThe Company’s contract terms or historical business practices can give rise to variable consideration such as term discounts and customer\ncooperative payments. We estimate the expected term discounts based on an analysis of historical experience and record cash discounts as\na reduction to revenue. Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for some of their costs\nof advertising the Company’s products. The Company records such costs as a reduction of revenue, where the fair value cannot be\nreasonably estimated or where costs exceed the fair value of the services.\nAt the time of revenue recognition, we also provide for estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to\nrevenues. The estimates are based on historical rates of product returns and claims. The Company accrues for such estimated returns and\nclaims with an estimated accrual and associated reduction of revenue. Additionally, the Company records inventory that it expects to be\nreturned as an other current asset, with a corresponding reduction of cost of goods sold.\nSales commissions are expensed as incurred. These costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying\nconsolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are\nreported on the net basis and are excluded from sales.\nCost of Goods Sold\nThe expenses that are included in cost of goods sold include all direct product costs and costs related to shipping, certain warehousing or\nhandling, duties and importation fees. Product warranty costs and specific provisions for excess, close-out, or slow-moving inventory are\nalso included in cost of goods sold. Certain warehousing or handling costs which are not associated with the manufacturing of goods for\nsale are excluded from cost of goods sold.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense includes personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, product development,\nselling, advertising, visual merchandise, depreciation and amortization, and other general operating expenses. Advertising costs are\nexpensed in the period incurred. Total advertising expense, including cooperative advertising costs, were $8,280, $5,945, and $3,833 for\nthe years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThrough cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for some of their costs of advertising the\nCompany’s products based on various criteria, including the value of purchases from the Company and various advertising specifications.\nCooperative advertising costs were not material for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nProduct Warranty\nSome of the Company’s products carry warranty provisions for defects in quality and workmanship. Warranty repairs and replacements are\nrecorded in cost of goods sold and a warranty liability is established at the time of sale to cover estimated costs based on the Company’s\nhistory of warranty repairs and replacements.

Total research and development costs were $14,645, $11,857, and\n$10,159 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs consists of expenses related to the Company’s various acquisition efforts and capital-raising activities, including those\nassociated with acquiring Sierra, Barnes, Rhino-Rack and MAXTRAX.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Income taxes are based on amounts of taxes payable or refundable in\nthe current year and on expected future tax consequences of events that are recognized in the financial statements in different periods than\nthey are recognized in tax returns. As a result of timing of recognition and measurement differences between financial accounting standards\nand income tax laws, temporary differences arise between amounts of pre-tax financial statement income and taxable income and between\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and\nliabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheets reflect estimated future tax effects attributable to these temporary differences and to\nnet operating loss and net capital loss carryforwards, based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for years in which the differences\nare expected to be settled or realized. The Company has netted these deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities by jurisdiction.\nRealization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions. Valuation allowances are used to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to amounts considered more likely than not to be realized. U.S. deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed\nincome of foreign subsidiaries where such earnings are considered to be permanently invested. Unremitted taxes on undistributed foreign\nearnings are not material for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nThe Company releases residual tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive loss through continuing operations as the underlying asset\nmatures or expires.\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements\nfrom such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon\nultimate resolution. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax benefit.\nUnrecognized tax benefits that reduce a net operating loss, similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward, are presented as a reduction to\ndeferred income taxes. The Company recognizes interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax benefit.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and Sales\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash, accounts receivable,\nand aggregate unrealized gains (losses) on derivative contracts. Risks associated with cash within the United States are mitigated by\nbanking with federally insured, creditworthy institutions; however, there are balances with these institutions that are greater than the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and maintains\nallowances for possible losses as considered necessary by management.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, no single customer contributed more than 10% of the Company’s sales. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, Recreational Equipment, Inc. (“REI”) accounted for approximately 10% of the Company’s sales each year.\nThese sales are included in the Outdoor segment. No other single customer contributed more than 10% of the Company’s sales during those\nperiods. As of December 31, 2022, no single customer contributed more than 10% of the Company's accounts receivable. As of December\n31, 2021, REI accounted for approximately 11% of the Company’s accounts receivable.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, and accrued liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short-term nature\nand liquidity of these financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value based on current market pricing\nmodels. The Company estimates that, due to the variable interest rates reflecting current market rates, the fair value of its long-term debt\nobligations under its revolving credit facility and term loan approximate the carrying value at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n56\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nContingent Consideration Liabilities\nContingent consideration liabilities are required to be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We estimate the fair value of these\nliabilities based on financial projections of the acquired company, such as sales-based milestones and estimated probabilities of\nachievement. Based on updated estimates and projections, the contingent consideration liabilities are adjusted at each reporting date to their\nestimated fair value. Changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date are reported in contingent consideration benefit in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Variations in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities\nmay result from changes in discount periods or rates, changes in the timing and amount of sales estimates, and changes in probability\nassumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving sales milestones.\nSegment Information\nWe operate our business structure within three segments. These segments are defined based on the internal financial reporting used by our\nchief operating decision maker to allocate resources and assess performance. Certain significant selling, general and administrative\nexpenses are not allocated to the segments including non-cash stock compensation expense.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current period presentation. Specifically,\naccounts payable and accrued liabilities, which were combined and disclosed as one amount, and certain deferred tax assets, which were\ncombined and disclosed as one amount within Note 15, are now presented separately.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Pronouncements adopted during 2022\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform\n(Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The ASU was adopted on a prospective basis.\nThis ASU provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to existing guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to\nfacilitate the market transition from existing reference rates, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), to alternate reference\nrates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS\nMAXTRAX\nOn November 26, 2021, Clarus entered into a Share and Unit Purchase Agreement (the “MAXTRAX Purchase Agreement”) to acquire\nMaxTrax Australia Pty Ltd (“MAXTRAX”), which subsequently closed on December 1, 2021. All United States dollar amounts contained\nherein are based on the exchange rates in effect for Australian dollars ($AUD) and the market value of the Company’s common stock at the\ntime of closing of the acquisition of MAXTRAX (the “MAXTRAX Acquisition”).\nThe Company acquired MAXTRAX for an aggregate purchase price of $AUD 49,744 (approximately $35,475), subject to a post-closing\nadjustment, comprised of $AUD 37,551 (approximately $26,780) cash, 107 shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $2,594, and\nadditional consideration described below.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 108 shares of the Company’s common stock were issued in accordance\nwith the MAXTRAX Purchase Agreement as additional consideration. The MAXTRAX Purchase Agreement provides for the payment of\nadditional contingent consideration up to $AUD 6,250 (approximately $4,457) in cash if certain future net sales thresholds are met during\n2022 and 2023 (the “MAXTRAX Contingent Consideration”). The Company estimated the initial fair value of the MAXTRAX Contingent\nConsideration to be $AUD 2,307 (approximately $1,644) and has recorded this liability within accrued liabilities and other long-term\nliabilities. The net sales threshold required for the cash payment of the 2022 portion of the MAXTRAX Contingent Consideration was met\nduring the 2022 measurement period ended June 30, 2022. See Note 10 for discussion regarding the valuation of the MAXTRAX\nContingent Consideration as of December 31, 2022.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. Acquisition-related costs for the MAXTRAX Acquisition, which were\nincluded in transaction costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $382 and $446, respectively.\n57\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRhino-Rack\nOn May 30, 2021, Clarus entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to acquire Rhino-Rack Holdings\nPty Ltd (“Rhino-Rack”), which subsequently closed on July 1, 2021. All United States dollar amounts contained herein are based on the\nexchange rates in effect for Australian dollars ($AUD) and the market value of the Company’s common stock at the time of closing of the\nacquisition of Rhino-Rack (the “Rhino-Rack Acquisition”).\nThe Company acquired Rhino-Rack for an aggregate purchase price of $AUD 269,696 (approximately $202,488), subject to a post-closing\nadjustment, comprised of approximately $AUD 191,249 (approximately $143,590) cash, 2,315 shares of the Company’s common stock\nvalued at $55,333, and additional contingent consideration described below. The Purchase Agreement also provides for the payment of\nadditional contingent consideration up to approximately $AUD 10,000 (approximately $7,508) if certain future net sales thresholds are met\n(the “Rhino-Rack Contingent Consideration”). The Company estimated the initial fair value of the Rhino-Rack Contingent Consideration\nto be $AUD 4,747 (approximately $3,565) and has recorded this liability within accrued liabilities at the date of purchase. The net sales\nthreshold required for the payment of the Rhino-Rack Contingent Consideration was not met during the measurement period ended June\n30, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, no remaining contingent consideration liability existed related to the Rhino-Rack Acquisition.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. Acquisition-related costs for the Rhino-Rack Acquisition, which were\nincluded in transaction costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1,799 and $10,975, respectively.\nBarnes\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Barnes Asset Purchase Agreement”) with\nRemington Outdoor Company, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Seller”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to (i) acquire\ncertain assets of the Seller constituting the Barnes business (“Barnes”), including equipment, inventory, intellectual property (including\nexclusive use of Barnes’ intellectual property in the all-copper and powdered metallurgy ammunition fields as well as its trademarks) and a\nleasehold interest in certain real property located in Mona, Utah (collectively, the “Barnes Purchased Assets”) and (ii) assume certain\nliabilities related to the Barnes Purchased Assets in a transaction to be effected in Seller’s bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of title\n11 of the United States Code, §§ 101 et seq. (the “Bankruptcy Code”) which commenced on July 27, 2020 in the United States Bankruptcy\nCourt for the Northern District of Alabama (the “Bankruptcy Court”). Pursuant to the Barnes Asset Purchase Agreement, the purchase\nprice to be paid for the Barnes Purchased Assets is $30,500 (the “Barnes Purchase Price”). On October 2, 2020, Sierra completed the\nacquisition of the Barnes Purchased Assets. Acquisition-related costs for the Barnes acquisition, which were included in transaction costs\nduring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $0, $273, and $922, respectively. The acquisition was accounted for as a\nbusiness combination.\nThe Company believes the acquisitions of MAXTRAX, Rhino-Rack, and Barnes will provide the Company with a greater combined global\nrevenue base, increased gross margins, profitability and free cash flows, and access to increased liquidity to further acquire and grow\nbusinesses.\n58\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe following table is a reconciliation to the fair value of the purchase consideration and how the purchase consideration is allocated to\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed which have been estimated at their fair values. Since our initial purchase price allocation for the\nMAXTRAX acquisition, we have increased the fair value of accrued liabilities assumed and goodwill by $741. These adjustments were\nmade after receiving certain information related to the fair value of assumed liabilities and such amounts were recorded during the first\nquarter of 2022. The fair value measurements for the acquisitions of MAXTRAX, Rhino-Rack, and Barnes have been completed. The\nexcess of purchase consideration over the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill for MAXTRAX and\nRhino-Rack is included in the Adventure segment and goodwill for Barnes is included in the Precision Sport segment.

Revenues continued to decline unexpectedly during the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2022, due to a lack of product demand in what is typically the highest selling season for the product in Australia, in addition\nto a continued increase in interest rates. As a result, we reduced our sales forecasts for 2023 and beyond in our Adventure reporting unit.

The foreign subsidiaries pay interest monthly on any borrowings on the credit facilities as\nwell as monthly payments on the term debt. As of December 31, 2022, the interest rates ranged between approximately 1.3% and\n4.0% and as of December 31, 2021, the interest rates ranged between approximately 1.3% and 5.2%. The credit facilities are\nsecured by certain assets of the foreign subsidiaries. There were no additional amounts available to borrow under the revolving\ncredit facility as of December 31, 2022.\n(c)The Company is required to repay the term loan through quarterly payments of $1,563 beginning with the quarter ended June 30,\n2022, increasing to $3,125 each quarter beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2023, and any remaining obligations will be\nrepaid in full on the maturity date of the Restated Credit Agreement of April 18, 2027.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company’s primary exchange rate risk management objective is to mitigate the uncertainty of anticipated cash flows attributable to\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company primarily focuses on mitigating changes in cash flows resulting from sales\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company manages this risk primarily by using currency forward and option\ncontracts. If the anticipated transactions are deemed probable, the resulting relationships are formally designated as cash flow hedges. The\nCompany accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges and tests effectiveness by determining whether changes in the expected cash\nflow of the derivative offset, within a range, changes in the expected cash flow of the hedged item.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company held commodity derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of commodity\nprice fluctuations associated with raw material costs. The Company held no outstanding commodity derivative contracts as of December\n31, 2022. These contracts were not designated as accounting hedges and the changes in fair value of the instruments are recognized in\nearnings. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, losses of $(795) were recorded in Other, net.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company held currency forward contracts to mitigate currency fluctuations related to the\nestimated cash purchase price of Rhino-Rack totaling $AUD 193,650 with a maturity date of July 1, 2021. These contracts were not\ndesignated as accounting hedges and the changes in fair value of the instruments are recognized in earnings. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, losses of $4,281 were recorded in Other, net.\nAt December 31, 2022, the Company’s derivative contracts had remaining maturities of less than one and one-half years. The\ncounterparties to these transactions had both long-term and short-term investment grade credit ratings. The maximum net exposure of the\nCompany’s credit risk to the counterparties is generally limited to the aggregate unrealized loss of all contracts with that counterparty. As\nof December 31, 2022, there was no such exposure to the counterparties. The Company’s exposure of counterparty credit risk is limited to\nthe aggregate unrealized gain of $351 on all contracts as of December 31, 2022. The Company’s derivative counterparties have strong\ncredit ratings and as a result, the Company does not require collateral to facilitate transactions.\n65\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nThe Company held the following contracts designated as hedged instruments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nDecember 31, 2022\nNotional Latest\nAmount Maturity\nForeign exchange contracts - Canadian Dollars $2,807 February 2023\nForeign exchange contracts - Euros € 20,760 February 2024\nDecember 31, 2021\nNotional Latest\nAmount Maturity\nForeign exchange contracts - Canadian Dollars $14,850 February 2023\nForeign exchange contracts - Euros € 20,104 February 2023\nFor contracts that qualify as effective hedge instruments, the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of the\ninstruments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to sales in the period the underlying hedged transaction\nis recognized in earnings.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the\namount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, under a\nthree-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1- inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2- inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are\nobservable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3- inputs to the valuation methodology are based on prices or valuation techniques that are unobservable.\n67\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nDesignated forward exchange contracts $ - $ 357 $ - $ 357\n$ - $ 357 $ - $ 357\nLiabilities\nDesignated forward exchange contracts $ - $ 6 $ - $ 6\nContingent consideration liabilities - - 1,595 1,595\n$ - $ 6 $ 1,595 $ 1,601\nDecember 31, 2021\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nDesignated forward exchange contracts $ - $ 511 $ - $ 511\n$ - $ 511 $ - $ 511\nLiabilities\nDesignated forward exchange contracts $ - $ 24 $ - $ 24\nContingent consideration liabilities $ - $ - $ 3,485 $ 3,485\n$ - $ 24 $ 3,485 $ 3,509\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value based on current market pricing models. No nonrecurring fair value\nmeasurements existed at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company estimated the initial fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities using a series of call options. Significant\nunobservable inputs used in the valuation included discount rates ranging from 4.8% to 8.0%. Contingent consideration liabilities are\nsubsequently remeasured at the estimated fair value at the end of each reporting period using financial projections of the acquired company,\nsuch as sales-based milestones and estimated probabilities of achievement, with the change in fair value recognized in contingent\nconsideration benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income for such period. We measure the initial\nliability and remeasure the liability on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs as defined under authoritative guidance for fair value\nmeasurements.\nThe net sales threshold required for the payment of the Rhino-Rack Contingent Consideration was not met during the measurement period\nended June 30, 2022. The net sales threshold required for the payment of the 2022 portion of the MAXTRAX Contingent Consideration\nwas met during the 2022 measurement period ended June 30, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $AUD 3,125 was paid in\ncash in accordance with the MAXTRAX Purchase Agreement.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in contingent consideration liabilities:\nRhino-Rack MAXTRAX Total\nBalance at December 31, 2021 $ 1,813 $ 1,672 $ 3,485\nFair value adjustments (1,811) 2,304 493\nContingent consideration payments - (2,148) (2,148)\nImpact of foreign currency exchange rates (2) (233) (235)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ - $ 1,595 $ 1,595\nAs the contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured to fair value each reporting period, significant increases or decreases in projected\nsales, discount rates or the time until payment is made could have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair value\n68\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nmeasurement. Our determination of fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities could change in future periods based on our\nongoing evaluation of these significant unobservable inputs.\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nIn assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, management estimates the fair value of each reporting unit\nusing Level 3 inputs through a combination of the income approach based upon projected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit and\nthe market approach. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is estimated using Level 3 inputs through the income approach,\nspecifically the relief-from-royalty method. The fair values are based on revenue and cash flow projections, royalty rates, and discount\nrates. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets was $92,311, $0, and $0 during the years ended December 31, 2022,\n2021, and 2020, respectively. See Note 5 for additional information.\nNOTE 11. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nOn August 6, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program of\n$0.025 per share of the Company’s common stock (the “Quarterly Cash Dividend”) or $0.10 per share on an annualized basis. The\ndeclaration and payment of future Quarterly Cash Dividends is subject to the discretion of and approval of the Company’s Board of\nDirectors. On May 1, 2020, the Company announced that, in light of the operational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, its Board of\nDirectors temporarily replaced its Quarterly Cash Dividend with a stock dividend (the “Quarterly Stock Dividend”). In 2022, 2021 and\n2020 our total Quarterly Cash Dividends were $3,721, $3,335 and $1,520, respectively. In 2020, our total Quarterly Stock Dividends were\n$1,533, which combined with our cash dividend of $1,520, resulted in total dividends of $3,053. On February 24, 2023, the Company\nannounced that its Board of Directors approved the payment on March 17, 2023 of the Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.025 to the record\nholders of shares of the Company’s common stock as of the close of business on March 7, 2023.\nOn October 25, 2021, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc., as representative of the several\nunderwriters named therein (the “Underwriters”), relating to the public offer and sale of 2,750 shares of the Company’s common stock at a\nprice to the public of $27.00 per share. The Underwriters received an underwriting discount of 6%, or $1.62 per share, in connection with\nthe sale of the shares of Common Stock in the offering. In addition, the Company granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up\nto 413 additional shares of common stock on the same terms and conditions which was fully exercised. The net proceeds to the Company\nfrom the offering, including the Underwriters’ exercise of their 30-day option but before expenses and after deducting the applicable\nunderwriting discounts and commissions, were $80,264.\nOn September 25, 2020, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with three existing\nstockholders of the Company. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company sold 900 shares of its common stock in a registered direct\noffering. The proceeds to the Company from this offering were $11,476.\nNOTE 12. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding\nduring each period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing earnings (loss) by the total of the weighted average number\nof shares of common stock outstanding during each period, plus the effect of dilutive outstanding stock options and unvested restricted\nstock grants. Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share if their effect is anti-\ndilutive to the loss from continuing operations.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of basic and diluted shares of common stock outstanding used in the calculation of earnings (loss)\nper share:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 37,201 33,136 30,175\nEffect of dilutive stock awards - 2,509 1,050\nEffect of dilutive deferred stock consideration for business\nacquisition - 41 -\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 37,201 35,686 31,225\nNet (loss) income per share:\nBasic $ (1.88) $ 0.79 $ 0.18\nDiluted (1.88) 0.73 0.18\n69\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, equity awards of 6,060, 509, and 868, respectively, were outstanding and anti-\ndilutive and therefore not included in the calculation of net (loss) income per share for these periods.\nNOTE 13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN\nUnder the Company’s current 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”), the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”)\nhas flexibility to determine the type and amount of awards to be granted to eligible participants, who must be employees, directors, officers\nor consultants of the Company or its subsidiaries. The 2015 Plan allows for grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options,\nrestricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, and restricted units. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be\ngranted through awards under the 2015 Plan to any employee in any calendar year may not exceed 500 shares. The 2015 Plan will continue\nin effect until December 2025 unless terminated sooner. As of December 31, 2022, the number of shares authorized and reserved for\nissuance under the 2015 Plan is 8,142 shares, subject to automatic annual increase equal to 5% of the total number of shares of the\nCompany’s outstanding common stock.\nOptions Granted:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued stock options for an aggregate of 440 shares under the 2015 Plan to\ndirectors and employees of the Company. Of the 440 options, 355 vest and become exercisable over a period of three years, 75 vest in four\nequal consecutive quarterly tranches from the date of grant and the remaining 10 vest immediately.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nAs a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor, the Company faces the risk of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for\nsubstantial money damages, product recall actions and higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods. The\nCompany is therefore vulnerable to various personal injury and property damage lawsuits relating to its products and incidental to its\nbusiness.\nThe Company is involved in various legal disputes and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the disposition of any\nof the legal disputes the Company or its subsidiaries is currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s\nconsolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. There is a reasonable possibility of loss from contingencies in excess\nof the amounts accrued by the Company in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets; however, the actual amounts of such possible\nlosses cannot currently be reasonably estimated by the Company at this time. It is possible that, as additional information becomes\navailable, the impact on the Company could have a different effect.\n72\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nNOTE 15.

Significant components of the Company’s existing\ndeferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss, capital loss amount and research & experimentation credit carryforwards $ 10,685 $ 19,413\nCapitalized research and development costs 8,205 7,117\nCapitalized costs to self-constructed property 7,892 4,876\nNon-cash compensation 2,534 2,576\nAccrued liabilities 1,472 1,944\nReserves and other 1,960 2,013\nIntangibles 224 245\n32,972 38,184\nValuation allowance (3,323) (4,378)\nNet deferred tax assets 29,649 33,806\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nDepreciation (1,390) (1,737)\nIntangibles (28,319) (44,814)\nOther (534) (102)\n(30,243) (46,653)\nTotal $ (594) $ (12,847)\nCertain deferred income tax balances are not netted as they represent deferred amounts applicable to different taxing jurisdictions. The\nCompany has provided a valuation allowance against a portion of the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022, because the ultimate\nrealization of those assets does not meet the more-likely-than-not criteria. The majority of the Company’s deferred tax assets consist of\n74\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nnet operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes. If a change in control were to occur, these could be limited under Section 382 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (“Code”), as amended.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all\nof the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of\nfuture taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and net operating loss and credit\ncarryforwards expire. The estimates and judgments associated with the Company’s valuation allowance on deferred tax assets are\nconsidered critical due to the amount of deferred tax assets recorded by the Company on its consolidated balance sheets and the judgment\nrequired in determining the Company’s potential for future taxable income. The need for a valuation allowance is reassessed at each\nreporting period.\nThe net change in the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets was ($1,055), ($17,970), and ($6,284) during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. A roll forward of our valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets for the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 is as follows:\nBalance at Beginning of Charged to Costs and\nYear Expenses Other Adjustments Balance at End of Year\n2020 $ 28,632 $ (6,284) $ - $ 22,348\n2021 $ 22,348 $ (17,970) $ - $ 4,378\n2022 $ 4,378 $ 51 $ (1,106) $ 3,323\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and research and experimentation credit for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes of $17,663 and $2,651, respectively. The Company believes its U.S. Federal NOLs will substantially offset its\nfuture U.S. Federal income taxes until expiration. The majority of the Company’s pre-tax income is currently earned and expected to be\nearned in the U.S., or taxed in the U.S. as Subpart F. income and will be offset with the NOLs. There are $1,851 of NOLs that expire on\nDecember 31, 2023, which the Company expects to realize in their entirety in 2023.\nNOLs available to offset taxable income, subject to compliance with Section 382 of the Code, begin to expire based upon the following\nschedule:\nNet Operating Loss Carryforward Expiration Dates\nDecember 31, 2022\nNet Operating Loss\nExpiration Dates December 31, Amount\n2023 $ 1,851\n2024 3,566\n2025 1,708\n2026 and beyond 10,538\nTotal $ 17,663\nTax positions are recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination\nby the tax authorities. The Company conducts its business globally. As a result, the Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in\nthe U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions and are subject to examination for the open tax years in the U.S.\nfederal and state jurisdictions of 2015 through 2021 and in the foreign jurisdictions of 2007 through 2021. The Company recognizes\ninterest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\n75\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of total unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and\n2020 is as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nBalance, beginning of year $ 696 $ 427 $ 561\nAdditions for current year tax positions 159 143 87\nAdditions for prior year tax positions - 237 12\nReductions for prior year tax positions (42) (111) (233)\nBalance, end of year $ 813 $ 696 $ 427\nIncluded in the balance of total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022 and 2021, are potential benefits of $813 and $696,\nrespectively, that if recognized, would affect the effective rate, subject to impact of valuation allowance, on income from continuing\noperations. Unrecognized tax benefits that reduce a net operating loss, similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward are presented as a\nreduction to deferred income taxes. As a result, the Company classified $454 and $250 of its unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction to\ndeferred tax assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInterest and penalty expense recognized related to uncertain tax positions were not significant during the years ending December 31, 2022,\n2021, and 2020, respectively.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Executive\nChairman and Chief Financial Officer, its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, of the effectiveness of the\ndesign and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under\nthe Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed\nto ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated and communicated to the appropriate management on a\nbasis that permits timely decisions regarding disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Executive Chairman and Chief\nFinancial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022, were effective.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). The Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the Company;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with US GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the\nCompany’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAs required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on our assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2022. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an\naudit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n80\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Clarus Corporation:\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Clarus Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,\n2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the\nconsolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2023,\nexpressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our\naudit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our\naudit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance\nof records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations\nof management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of\nany evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nSalt Lake City, Utah\nFebruary 27, 2023\n81\nCLARUS CORPORATION\nITEM 9B.
