provided in this earnings release include non-GAAP measures of operating income, operating margin, net income and earnings per share. Management excludes from these measures stock-based compensation, restructuring, acquisition and integration expenses, impairment charges, amortization charges and other unusual or infrequent items, as adjusted for taxes, as more fully described below.\n\nManagement excludes these items principally because such charges or benefits are not directly related to the Company's ongoing core business operations. We use such non-GAAP measures in order to (1) make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operations, both internally and externally, (2) guide management in assessing the performance of the business, internally allocating resources and making decisions in furtherance of Company's strategic plan, (3) provide investors with a better understanding of how management plans and measures the business and (4) provide investors with a better understanding of our ongoing, core business. The material limitations to management's approach include the fact that the charges, benefits and expenses excluded are nonetheless charges, benefits and expenses required to be recognized under GAAP and, in some cases, consume cash which reduces the Company's liquidity. Management compensates for these limitations primarily by reviewing GAAP results to obtain a complete picture of the Company's performance and by including a reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results in its earnings releases.\n\nAdditional information regarding the economic substance of each exclusion, management's use of the resultant non-GAAP measures, the material limitations of management's approach and management's methods for compensating for such limitations is provided below.\n\n_Stock-based Compensation Expense_ , which consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of equity awards granted to employees and directors, is excluded in order to permit more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's results since the Company grants different amounts and value of equity awards each quarter. In addition, given the fact that competitors grant different amounts and types of equity awards and may use different valuation assumptions, excluding stock-based compensation permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's core results with those of its competitors.\n\n_Restructuring, Acquisition and Integration Expenses_ , which consist of employee severance, lease termination costs, exit costs, environmental investigation, remediation and related employee costs and other charges primarily related to closing and consolidating manufacturing facilities and those associated with the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses, are excluded because such charges (1) can be driven by the timing of acquisitions and exit activities which are difficult to predict, (2) are not directly related to ongoing business results and (3) generally do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, given the fact that the Company's competitors complete acquisitions and adopt restructuring plans at different times and in different amounts than the Company, excluding these charges or benefits permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's core results with those of its competitors. Items excluded by the Company may be different from those excluded by the Company's competitors and restructuring and integration expenses include both cash and non-cash expenses. Cash expenses reduce the Company's liquidity. Therefore, management also reviews GAAP results including these amounts.\n\n_Impairment Charges for Goodwill and Other Assets_ , which consist of non-cash charges, are excluded because such charges are non-recurring and do not reduce the Company's liquidity. In addition, given the fact that the Company's competitors may record impairment charges at different times, excluding these charges permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's core results with those of its competitors.\n\n_Amortization Charges_ , which consist of non-cash charges impacted by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions of businesses or assets, are also excluded because such charges do not reduce the Company's liquidity. In addition, such charges can be driven by the timing of acquisitions, which is difficult to predict. Excluding these charges permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's core results with those of its competitors because the Company's competitors complete acquisitions at different times and for different amounts than the Company.\n\n_Other Unusual or Infrequent Items_ , such as charges or benefits associated with distressed customers, expenses, charges and recoveries relating to certain legal matters, and gains and losses on sales of assets, are excluded because such items are typically non-recurring, difficult to predict or not directly related to the Company's ongoing or core operations and are therefore not considered by management in assessing the current operating performance of the Company and forecasting earnings trends. However, items excluded by the Company may be different from those excluded by the Company's competitors. In addition, these items include both cash and non-cash expenses. Cash expenses reduce the Company's liquidity. Management compensates for these limitations by reviewing GAAP results including these amounts.\n\n_Adjustments for Taxes,_ which consist of the tax effects of the various adjustments that we exclude from our non-GAAP measures, and adjustments related to deferred tax and discrete tax items. Including these adjustments permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's core results with those of its competitors. We determine the tax adjustments based upon the various applicable effective tax rates. In those jurisdictions in which we do not expect to realize a tax cost or benefit (due to a history of operating losses or other factors), a reduced tax rate is applied.\n\nLogo - [https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1992091/4833572/SANMINA_CORPORATION_LOGO_2024.jpg](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4294317-1&h=1502706266&u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D4221311-1%26h%3D1782786331%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmma.prnewswire.com%252Fmedia%252F1992091%252F4833572%252FSANMINA_CORPORATION_LOGO_2024.jpg%26a%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fmma.prnewswire.com%252Fmedia%252F1992091%252F4833572%252FSANMINA_CORPORATION_LOGO_2024.jpg&a=https%3A%2F%2Fmma.prnewswire.com%2Fmedia%2F1992091%2F4833572%2FSANMINA_CORPORATION_LOGO_2024.jpg)\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=SF47793&sd=2024-11-04) View original content:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sanmina-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2024-financial-results-302295715.html>\n\nSOURCE Sanmina Corporation\n\n[View All News](https://ir.sanmina.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [News](https://ir.sanmina.com/news/default.aspx)\n  * [Events](https://ir.sanmina.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx)\n  * [SEC Filings](https://ir.sanmina.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Governance](https://ir.sanmina.com/highlights/default.aspx)\n  * [FAQs](https://ir.sanmina.com/resources/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### IR Contact\n\n2700 North First Street\n\nSan Jose, CA 95134\n\nTel [1 408 964 3610](tel:1-408-964-3610)\n\nEmail ir@sanmina.com \n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

\n**_Schedule 1_**\n\nThe statements above and financial information provided in this earnings release include non-GAAP measures of operating income, operating margin, net income and earnings per share. Management excludes from these measures stock-based compensation, restructuring, acquisition and integration expenses, impairment charges, amortization charges and other unusual or infrequent items, as adjusted for taxes, as more fully described below.\n\nManagement excludes these items principally because such charges or benefits are not directly related to the Company's ongoing core business operations. We use such non-GAAP measures in order to (1) make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operations, both internally and externally, (2) guide management in assessing the performance of the business, internally allocating resources and making decisions in furtherance of Company's strategic plan, (3) provide investors with a better understanding of how management plans and measures the business and (4) provide investors with a better understanding of our ongoing, core business. The material limitations to management's approach include the fact that the charges, benefits and expenses excluded are nonetheless charges, benefits and expenses required to be recognized under GAAP and, in some cases, consume cash which reduces the Company's liquidity. Management compensates for these limitations primarily by reviewing GAAP results to obtain a complete picture of the Company's performance and by including a reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results in its earnings releases.\n\nAdditional information regarding the economic substance of each exclusion, management's use of the resultant non-GAAP measures, the material limitations of management's approach and management's methods for compensating for such limitations is provided below.\n\n_Stock-based Compensation Expense_ , which consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value of equity awards granted to employees and directors, is excluded in order to permit more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's results since the Company grants different amounts and value of equity awards each quarter. In addition, given the fact that competitors grant different amounts and types of equity awards and may use different valuation assumptions, excluding stock-based compensation permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's core results with those of its competitors.\n\n_Restructuring, Acquisition and Integration Expenses_ , which consist of employee severance, lease termination costs, exit costs, environmental investigation, remediation and related employee costs and other charges primarily related to closing and consolidating manufacturing facilities and those associated with the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses, are excluded because such charges (1) can be driven by the timing of acquisitions and exit activities which are difficult to predict, (2) are not directly related to ongoing business results and (3) generally do not reflect expected future operating expenses. In addition, given the fact that the Company's competitors complete acquisitions and adopt restructuring plans at different times and in different amounts than the Company, excluding these charges or benefits permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's core results with those of its competitors. Items excluded by the Company may be different from those excluded by the Company's competitors and restructuring and integration expenses include both cash and non-cash expenses. Cash expenses reduce the Company's liquidity. Therefore, management also reviews GAAP results including these amounts.\n\n_Impairment Charges for Goodwill and Other Assets_ , which consist of non-cash charges, are excluded because such charges are non-recurring and do not reduce the Company's liquidity. In addition, given the fact that the Company's competitors may record impairment charges at different times, excluding these charges permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's core results with those of its competitors.\n\n_Amortization Charges_ , which consist of non-cash charges impacted by the timing and magnitude of acquisitions of businesses or assets, are also excluded because such charges do not reduce the Company's liquidity. In addition, such charges can be driven by the timing of acquisitions, which is difficult to predict. Excluding these charges permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's core results with those of its competitors because the Company's competitors complete acquisitions at different times and for different amounts than the Company.\n\n_Other Unusual or Infrequent Items_ , such as charges or benefits associated with distressed customers, expenses, charges and recoveries relating to certain legal matters, and gains and losses on sales of assets, are excluded because such items are typically non-recurring, difficult to predict or not directly related to the Company's ongoing or core operations and are therefore not considered by management in assessing the current operating performance of the Company and forecasting earnings trends. However, items excluded by the Company may be different from those excluded by the Company's competitors. In addition, these items include both cash and non-cash expenses. Cash expenses reduce the Company's liquidity. Management compensates for these limitations by reviewing GAAP results including these amounts.\n\n_Adjustments for Taxes,_ which consist of the tax effects of the various adjustments that we exclude from our non-GAAP measures, and adjustments related to deferred tax and discrete tax items. Including these adjustments permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's core results with those of its competitors. We determine the tax adjustments based upon the various applicable effective tax rates. In those jurisdictions in which we do not expect to realize a tax cost or benefit (due to a history of operating losses or other factors), a reduced tax rate is applied.\n\nLogo - [https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1992091/4833572/SANMINA_CORPORATION_LOGO_2024.jpg](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4221311-1&h=1782786331&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmma.prnewswire.com%2Fmedia%2F1992091%2F4833572%2FSANMINA_CORPORATION_LOGO_2024.jpg&a=https%3A%2F%2Fmma.prnewswire.com%2Fmedia%2F1992091%2F4833572%2FSANMINA_CORPORATION_LOGO_2024.jpg)\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=SF71582&sd=2024-07-29) View original content:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sanminas-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-financial-results-302208906.html>\n\nSOURCE Sanmina Corporation\n\n[View All News](https://ir.sanmina.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [News](https://ir.sanmina.com/news/default.aspx)\n  * [Events](https://ir.sanmina.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx)\n  * [SEC Filings](https://ir.sanmina.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx)\n  * [Governance](https://ir.sanmina.com/highlights/default.aspx)\n  * [FAQs](https://ir.sanmina.com/resources/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### IR Contact\n\n2700 North First Street\n\nSan Jose, CA 95134\n\nTel [1 408 964 3610](tel:1-408-964-3610)\n\nEmail ir@sanmina.com \n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

and financial information provided in this earnings release include non-GAAP\nmeasures of operating income, operating margin, net income and earnings per share. Management\nexcludes from these measures stock-based compensation, restructuring, acquisition and integration\nexpenses, impairment charges, amortization charges and other unusual or infrequent items, as\nadjusted for taxes, as more fully described below.\nManagement excludes these items principally because such charges or benefits are not directly\nrelated to the Company’s ongoing core business operations. We use such non-GAAP measures in\norder to (1) make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s operations, both\ninternally and externally, (2) guide management in assessing the performance of the business,\ninternally allocating resources and making decisions in furtherance of Company’s strategic plan, (3)\nprovide investors with a better understanding of how management plans and measures the business\nand (4) provide investors with a better understanding of our ongoing, core business. The material\nlimitations to management’s approach include the fact that the charges, benefits and expenses\nexcluded are nonetheless charges, benefits and expenses required to be recognized under GAAP\nand, in some cases, consume cash which reduces the Company’s liquidity. Management\ncompensates for these limitations primarily by reviewing GAAP results to obtain a complete picture of\nthe Company’s performance and by including a reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results in\nits earnings releases.\nAdditional information regarding the economic substance of each exclusion, management’s use of\nthe resultant non-GAAP measures, the material limitations of management’s approach and\nmanagement’s methods for compensating for such limitations is provided below.\nStock-based Compensation Expense, which consists of non-cash charges for the estimated fair value\nof equity awards granted to employees and directors, is excluded in order to permit more meaningful\nperiod-to-period comparisons of the Company’s results since the Company grants different amounts\nand value of equity awards each quarter. In addition, given the fact that competitors grant different\namounts and types of equity awards and may use different valuation assumptions, excluding stock-\nbased compensation permits more accurate comparisons of the Company’s core results with those of\nits competitors.\nRestructuring, Acquisition and Integration Expenses, which consist of employee severance, lease\ntermination costs, exit costs, environmental investigation, remediation and related employee costs\nand other charges primarily related to closing and consolidating manufacturing facilities and those\nassociated with the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses, are excluded because such\ncharges (1) can be driven by the timing of acquisitions and exit activities which are difficult to predict,\n(2) are not directly related to ongoing business results and (3) generally do not reflect expected future\noperating expenses. In addition, given the fact that the Company’s competitors complete acquisitions\nand adopt restructuring plans at different times and in different amounts than the Company, excluding\nthese charges or benefits permits more accurate comparisons of the Company’s core results with\nthose of its competitors. Items excluded by the Company may be different from those excluded by the\nCompany’s competitors and restructuring and integration expenses include both cash and non-cash\nexpenses. Cash expenses reduce the Company’s liquidity. Therefore, management also reviews\nGAAP results including these amounts.\nImpairment Charges for Goodwill and Other Assets, which consist of non-cash charges, are excluded\nbecause such charges are non-recurring and do not reduce the Company’s liquidity. In addition, given\nthe fact that the Company’s competitors may record impairment charges at different times, excluding\nthese charges permits more accurate comparisons of the Company’s core results with those of its\ncompetitors.\nAmortization Charges, which consist of non-cash charges impacted by the timing and magnitude of\nacquisitions of businesses or assets, are also excluded because such charges do not reduce the\nCompany’s liquidity. In addition, such charges can be driven by the timing of acquisitions, which is\ndifficult to predict. Excluding these charges permits more accurate comparisons of the Company’s\ncore results with those of its competitors because the Company’s competitors complete acquisitions\nat different times and for different amounts than the Company.\nOther Unusual or Infrequent Items, such as charges or benefits associated with distressed customers,\nexpenses, charges and recoveries relating to certain legal matters, and gains and losses on sales of\nassets, are excluded because such items are typically non-recurring, difficult to predict or not directly\nrelated to the Company’s ongoing or core operations and are therefore not considered by\nmanagement in assessing the current operating performance of the Company and forecasting\nearnings trends. However, items excluded by the Company may be different from those excluded by\nthe Company’s competitors. In addition, these items include both cash and non-cash expenses. Cash\nexpenses reduce the Company’s liquidity. Management compensates for these limitations by\nreviewing GAAP results including these amounts.\nAdjustments for Taxes, which consist of the tax effects of the various adjustments that we exclude\nfrom our non-GAAP measures, and adjustments related to deferred tax and discrete tax items.\nIncluding these adjustments permits more accurate comparisons of the Company's core results with\nthose of its competitors. We determine the tax adjustments based upon the various applicable\neffective tax rates. In those jurisdictions in which we do not expect to realize a tax cost or benefit (due\nto a history of operating losses or other factors), a reduced tax rate is applied."

Business\nOverview\nSanmina Corporation (“we” or “Sanmina” or the “Company”) is a leading global provider of integrated manufacturing solutions, components, products and\nrepair, logistics and after-market services. We provide these comprehensive offerings primarily to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) in the following\nindustries: industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud infrastructure. Our customer-focused organization with\n37,000 employees, including 5,000 temporary employees, supports our customers from 21 countries on four continents. We locate our facilities near our customers\nand their end markets in major centers for the electronics industry or in lower-cost locations. The combination of our advanced technologies, extensive\nmanufacturing expertise and economies of scale enables us to meet the specialized needs of our customers. All references in this report to years refer to our fiscal\nyears unless otherwise noted.\nOur end-to-end solutions, combined with our global supply chain management expertise, allow us to manage our customers' products throughout their life\ncycles. These solutions include:\n• product design and engineering, including concept development, detailed design, prototyping, validation, preproduction services and manufacturing\ndesign release and product industrialization;\n• manufacturing of components, subassemblies and complete systems;\n• high-level assembly and test;\n• direct order fulfillment and logistics services;\n• after-market product service and support; and\n• global supply chain management.\nWe manage our operations as two businesses:\n1) Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (“IMS”). Our IMS business consists of printed circuit board assembly and test, high-level assembly and test and\ndirect-order-fulfillment. This segment generated approximately 80% of our total revenue in 2024.\n2) Components, Products and Services (“CPS”). Components include advanced printed circuit boards (“PCBs”), backplanes and backplane assemblies,\ncable assemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts. Products include optical, radio frequency (“RF”)\nand microelectronic design and manufacturing services from our Advanced Microsystems Technologies division; multi-chip package memory solutions\nfrom our Viking Technology division; high-performance storage platforms for hyperscale and enterprise solutions from our Viking Enterprise Solutions\ndivision; defense and aerospace products, design, manufacturing, repair and refurbishment services from our SCI Technology, Inc. (“SCI”) subsidiary;\nand cloud-based smart manufacturing execution software from our 42Q division. Services include design, engineering, and logistics and repair. CPS\ngenerated approximately 20% of our total revenue in 2024.\nWe target markets that we believe offer significant growth opportunities and in which OEMs sell complex mission critical products that are subject to strict\nregulatory requirements and/or rapid technological change. We believe these markets offer an opportunity to deliver higher margins as they require higher value-\nadded manufacturing services and provide better opportunities for us to sell customers our advanced vertically integrated components. In addition, diversification\nacross market segments and customers helps mitigate our dependency on any market or customer. We report our end markets as follows:\n1) Industrial, Medical, Defense and Aerospace, and Automotive:\na. Industrial.

In recent years, the industry has expanded to respond to customer demand for products and services beyond electronic components,\nincluding product design and engineering, manufacturing, high-level assembly and test, direct order fulfillment and logistics services, after-market product services\nand support, and global supply chain management.\nWe monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers we serve and our end markets, and closely manage our costs\nand capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances change. Over the long term, we believe our customers and potential customers rely on\nour industry’s services to:\n• focus on their core competencies;\n• access leading design and engineering capabilities;\n• optimize their supply chain while reducing risk and maximizing purchasing power;\n• reduce their fixed and operating costs and capital investment;\n• access global manufacturing services; and\n• accelerate their time to market and time to volume.\nWe believe each of our market sectors is high value and well-aligned with our expertise in more complex and highly-regulated products. This provides us\nwith an opportunity for increased value-add, higher profitability and greater market share as we seek to capitalize on increased outsourcing in our served markets.\nOur Business Strategy\nOur vision is to be the trusted leader in providing mission critical products, services and supply chain solutions to accelerate customer success. Key\nelements of our business strategy to deliver this vision include:\nCapitalizing on Our Comprehensive Solutions. Capitalizing on our end-to-end solutions allows us to sell additional solutions to our existing customers and\nattract new customers. Our end-to-end solutions include product design and engineering, manufacturing, high-level assembly and test, direct order fulfillment and\nlogistics services, after-market product service and support, and global supply chain management. Our vertically integrated manufacturing solutions enable us to\nmanufacture additional system components and subassemblies for our customers. When we provide a customer with multiple services, such as component\nmanufacturing or higher value-added solutions, we can often improve our margins and profitability. Consequently, our goal is to increase the number of\nmanufacturing programs for which we provide multiple solutions. To achieve this goal, our sales and marketing organization seeks to cross-sell our solutions to\ncustomers.\nExtending Our Technology Capabilities. We rely on advanced processes and technologies to provide our products, components and vertically integrated\nmanufacturing solutions. We continually improve our manufacturing processes and develop more advanced technologies, providing a competitive advantage for our\ncustomers. We work with our customers to anticipate their future product and manufacturing requirements and align our technology investment activities with their\nneeds. We use our design expertise to develop product technology platforms that we can customize by incorporating other components\n5\nTable of Contents\nand subassemblies to meet the needs of particular OEMs. These technologies enhance our ability to manufacture complex, high-value added products, maximizing\nour potential to continue to win business from existing and new customers.\nAttracting and Retaining Long-Term Customer Partnerships. A core component of our strategy is to attract, build and retain long-term partnerships with\ncompanies in growth industries that will benefit from our global/regional footprint and unique value proposition in advanced electronics manufacturing.\nPromoting New Product Introduction (“NPI”) and Joint Design Manufacturing (“JDM”) Solutions.

However, we\ncannot predict whether this trend will continue.\nBacklog\nWe generally do not obtain firm, long-term commitments from our customers and our customers usually do not make firm orders for product delivery more\nthan thirty to ninety days in advance. Additionally, customers may cancel or postpone scheduled deliveries, in some cases without significant penalty. Therefore, we\ndo not believe the backlog of expected product sales covered by firm orders is a meaningful measure of future sales.\nCustomers and Marketing\nA key component of our strategy is to attract and retain long-term customer partnerships with leading companies in growth industries that will benefit from\nour global/regional footprint and unique value proposition in advanced electronics manufacturing. We develop relationships with our customers and market our\nvertically integrated manufacturing solutions through our sales and marketing staff. Our sales team works closely with our customers' engineering and technical\npersonnel to understand their strategy and roadmaps to enable their go-to-market strategy. Our sales and marketing staff supports our business strategy of providing\nend-to-end solutions by encouraging cross-selling vertically integrated manufacturing solutions and component manufacturing across a broad range of major OEM\nproducts. We utilize our existing technical capabilities in design, technology components, and complex assembly, integration, and after-sales services to provide\ntailored solutions to our customers. With our extensive market knowledge and global/regional footprint, we can align these solutions to our facilities in each region\naround the world.\nSales to our ten largest customers represented 47% of our net sales in 2024. Motorola represented 10% or more of our net sales in 2024 and 2022. Nokia\nrepresented 10% or more of our net sales in 2023 and 2022.\nWe typically enter into supply agreements with our major OEM customers with terms ranging from three to five years. Our supply agreements generally do\nnot obligate the customer to purchase minimum quantities of products. However, the customer is typically liable for the cost of the materials and components we\nhave ordered to meet their production forecast but which are not used, provided that the material was ordered in accordance with an agreed-upon procurement plan.\nIn some cases, the procurement plan contains provisions regarding the types of materials for which our customers will assume responsibility. Our supply agreements\ngenerally contain provisions permitting cancellation and rescheduling of orders upon notice and are subject to cancellation charges and, in some cases, rescheduling\ncharges. In some circumstances, our supply agreements with customers include provisions for cost reduction objectives during the term of the agreement, which can\nhave the effect of reducing revenue and profitability from these arrangements.\nCompetition\nOur business is highly competitive. We compete against numerous domestic and foreign electronic manufacturing service providers, diversified\nmanufacturing service providers and design providers. In addition, our potential customers may also compare the benefits of outsourcing their manufacturing to us\nwith the merits of manufacturing products themselves.\nWe compete with different companies depending on the type of solution or geographic area. We believe the primary competitive factors in our industry\ninclude manufacturing technology, quality, global/regional footprint, delivery, responsiveness, provision of value-added solutions and price. We believe we are\nextremely competitive with regard to all of these factors.\n11\nTable of Contents\nIntellectual Property\nWe hold U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications relating to, among other things, printed circuit board manufacturing technology, enclosures,\ncables, memory modules, optical technology, medical devices and computing and storage. For other proprietary processes, we rely primarily on trade secret\nprotection. A number of our patents have expired or will expire in the near term. The expiration and abandonment of patents reduces our ability to assert claims\nagainst competitors or others who use similar technologies and to license such patents to third parties. We have registered a number of trademarks and have pending\ntrademark applications in both the U.S. and internationally. Sanmina, Viking, Viking Enterprise Solutions, Viking Technology and 42Q are registered trademarks of\nSanmina Corporation.\nCompliance with Government Regulations\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage and use of hazardous materials used\nin our manufacturing processes, as well as the storage, treatment, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous waste that are by-products of these processes. We\nare also subject to occupational safety and health laws, product labeling and product content requirements, either directly or as required by our customers. Proper\nwaste disposal is a major consideration for printed circuit board manufacturers due to the metals and chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Water used in the\nprinted circuit board manufacturing process must be treated to remove metal particles and other contaminants before it can be discharged into municipal sanitary\nsewer systems. We operate on-site wastewater treatment systems at our printed circuit board manufacturing plants in order to treat wastewater generated in the\nfabrication process.\nAdditionally, the electronics assembly process can generate lead dust. Upon vacating a facility, we are responsible for remediating lead dust from the\ninterior of the manufacturing facility. Although there are no applicable standards for lead dust remediation in manufacturing facilities, we endeavor to remove the\nresidues. To date, lead dust remediation costs have not been material to our results of operations. We also monitor for airborne concentrations of lead in our buildings\nand are unaware of any significant lead concentrations that exceed the applicable Occupational Safety & Health Administration (“OSHA”) or other local standards.\nWe have a range of corporate programs that aim to reduce the use of hazardous materials in manufacturing. We developed corporate-wide standardized\nenvironmental management systems, auditing programs and policies to enable better management of environmental compliance activities. For example, almost all of\nour manufacturing facilities are certified under ISO 14001, a set of standards and procedures relating to environmental compliance management. In addition, the\nelectronics industry must adhere to the European Union's Restrictions of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment\n(“WEEE”). Parallel initiatives have been adopted in other jurisdictions throughout the world, including several states in the U.S. and the Peoples' Republic of China.\nRoHS limits the use of lead, mercury and other specified substances in electronics products. WEEE requires producers to assume responsibility for the collection,\nrecycling and management of waste electronic products and components. We have implemented procedures intended to ensure our manufacturing processes are\ncompliant with RoHS and the European Union's Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”) legislation, when required. WEEE compliance\nis primarily the responsibility of OEMs.\nAsbestos containing materials (“ACM”) are present at several of our manufacturing facilities. Although ACM is being managed and controls have been put\nin place pursuant to ACM operations and maintenance plans, the presence of ACM could give rise to remediation obligations and other liabilities.\nOur facilities generally operate under environmental permits issued by governmental authorities. For the most part, these permits must be renewed\nperiodically and are subject to revocation in the event of violations of environmental laws. Any such revocation may require us to cease or limit production at one or\nmore of our facilities, adversely affecting our results of operations.\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we have incurred liabilities associated with environmental contamination. These include ongoing investigation and\nremediation activities at a number of current and former sites, including those located in Owego, New York; Derry, New Hampshire; and Brockville, Ontario. In\naddition, we have been found liable in a lawsuit alleging operations at our current and former facilities in Orange County, California contributed to groundwater\ncontamination, and also have ongoing investigation activities at and adjacent to a former facility to determine the extent of any soil, soil vapor, and groundwater\ncontamination. Finally, there are some sites, including our acquired facility in Gunzenhausen, Germany,\n12\nTable of Contents\nwhich are known to have groundwater contamination caused by a third-party, and that third-party has provided indemnification to us for the related liability.\nHowever, in certain situations, third-party indemnities may not be effective to reduce our liability for environmental contamination.\nWe use environmental consultants primarily for risk assessments and remediation, including remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial action\nplanning and design and site remediation. Our consultants provide information regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, acceptable remediation\nalternatives and estimated costs associated with each remediation alternative. We consider their recommendations together with other information when determining\nthe appropriate amount to accrue for environmental liabilities.\nOther Regulations\nWe are also subject to a number of domestic and foreign regulations relating to our operations worldwide. In particular, our sales activities must comply\nwith restrictions relating to the export of controlled technology and sales to denied or sanctioned parties contained in the U.S. International Traffic in Arms\nRegulations, U.S. Export Administration Regulations and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Controls of the U.S. Treasury Department. We must\nalso comply with regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts and subcontracts with respect to our defense\nbusiness, including regulations that govern price negotiations, cost accounting standards, procurement practices, termination at the election of the government and\nmany other aspects of performance under government contracts and subcontracts. These regulations are complex, require extensive compliance efforts and\nexpenditures in the form of additional personnel, systems and processes, and, in some cases, require us to ensure that our suppliers adhere to such regulations.\nFurthermore, our compliance with these regulations is subject to audit or investigation by governmental authorities and, from time to time, we receive formal and\ninformal inquiries from government agencies and regulators regarding our compliance. Finally, the design, manufacture and repair of products that we conduct for\nthe medical industry often requires compliance with domestic and foreign regulations, including the Food and Drug Administration’s quality system regulations and\nthe European Union’s medical device directive. In addition to complying with these standards, our medical facilities comply with ISO 13485 (formerly EN 46002)\nand ISO 9001, where required. Should we be found to have violated one or more of such regulations, we could become subject to civil damages (which in some\ncases can be trebled) or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including fines, penalties, appointment of government monitors, termination of our\ngovernment contracts and, ultimately, debarment from doing further business with the U.S. government. Any of such results would increase our expenses, reduce our\nrevenue and damage our reputation as both a commercial and government supplier.\nHuman Capital Resources\nGeneral Information About Our Human Capital Resources\nAs of September 28, 2024, we had approximately 37,000 employees, including 5,000 temporary employees in 21 countries.\nApproximate Breakdown\nRegion of Employees\nAmericas 58 %\nAPAC 32 %\nEMEA 10 %\nTotal 100 %\nCore Principles\nAt Sanmina, we believe our employees are the key to our success.

We embrace diverse perspectives and empower our\nemployees to improve our organization, help us innovate, and continuously strengthen our workplace.\nAs a founding member of the RBA, its principles are fundamental to our corporate culture and core values and are reflected in our commitments to our\ncustomers, stakeholders, employees and communities in which we do business around the world. We have aligned our work programs, processes and procedures to\nthe RBA Code of Conduct to help ensure a safe and\n13\nTable of Contents\npositive work environment for our employees that emphasizes learning and professional development, respect for individuals and ethical conduct, and that is\nfacilitated by a direct management-employee engagement model.\nFor over a decade, we have tracked human capital metrics that we consider to be key to our business, including health and safety, career growth and\ndevelopment, turnover, hiring and diversity, equity and inclusion. Management regularly reviews these metrics and seeks to improve them.\nHealth and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is of utmost importance to us. In the U.S., we are subject to the requirements of the United States Department of\nLabor’s OSHA and we are guided by the Environmental Health and Safety principles as described in the RBA’s Code of Conduct worldwide. We conduct regular\nself-assessments and audits to ensure compliance with our health and safety guidelines and regulatory requirements. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a level of work-\nrelated injuries as close to zero as possible through continuous investment in our safety programs. We provide protective gear (e.g., eye protection, masks and\ngloves) as required by applicable standards and as appropriate given employee job duties.\nCareer Growth and Development\nWe invest resources in professional development and growth as a means of improving employee performance and retaining our employees. We leverage\nboth formal and informal programs, including in-person, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and outside seminars and educational\nprograms, when applicable, to identify, foster, and retain top talent. Employees have access to courses through multiple learning and development platforms.\nOur performance review process is intended to promote transparent communication of team member performance, which we believe is a key factor in our\nsuccess. Performance reviews enable ongoing assessments, reviews, and mentoring to identify career development and learning opportunities for our employees.\nTurnover\nWe continually monitor employee turnover rates, both regionally and as a whole, as our success depends upon retaining our highly trained manufacturing\nand operating personnel. We believe the combination of competitive compensation, career growth and development opportunities have helped increase employee\ntenure and reduce voluntary turnover. The average tenure of our employees is approximately eight years and approximately 34% of our employees have been\nemployed by us for more than ten years.\nHiring Practices\nWe recruit the best people for the job without regard to gender, ethnicity or other protected characteristics and it is our policy to comply fully with all\ndomestic, foreign and local laws relating to discrimination in hiring.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe are focused on creating a culture of belonging where employees can be their authentic selves and cultivate a workplace where everyone has an\nopportunity to succeed. Recognizing and respecting our global presence, we strive to maintain a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce everywhere we operate.\nApproximately 49% of our employees worldwide are female and, in the U.S., non-Caucasian employees account for approximately 60% of the employee base. Our\ndiversity, equity and inclusion principles are reflected in our employee training, in particular with respect to our policies against harassment and bullying and the\nelimination of bias in the workplace.\nManagement Engagement Practices\nWe believe in a direct management-employee engagement model by which managers and employees maintain a regular dialogue about working conditions,\ncompensation, compliance with laws and applicable standards, safety and advancement opportunities. This model is also reflected in our training and compliance\nprograms, which emphasize the need to report concerns about violations of policy or law. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. In some\ninternational locations, our employees are represented by labor unions on either a national or plant level or are subject to collective bargaining agreements.\n14\nTable of Contents\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe following table sets forth the name, position and age of our current executive officers and their ages as of September 28, 2024.\nName Age Position\nJure Sola 73 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJonathan Faust 47 Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nAlan Reid 61 Executive Vice President, Global Human Resources\nCharles C.

Risk Factors\nEnd Market and Operational Risks\nAdverse changes in the key end markets we target could harm our business by reducing our sales.\nWe provide products and services to companies that serve the industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud\ninfrastructure industries. Adverse changes in any of these end markets could reduce demand for our customers’ products or make these customers more sensitive to\nthe cost of our products and services, either of which could reduce our sales, gross margins and net income. A number of factors could affect these industries in\ngeneral and our customers in particular, leading to reductions in net sales. These factors include:\n• intense competition among our customers and their competitors, leading to reductions in prices for their products and increases in pricing pressure placed on\nus;\n• failure of our customers’ products to gain widespread commercial acceptance, which could decrease the volume of orders our customers place with us;\n• changes in regulatory requirements affecting the products we build for our customers, leading to product redesigns or obsolescence and potentially causing\nus to lose business; and\n• the negative effects of inflation, high interest rates and any potential resultant recession on customers’ end markets and their demand for our products and\nservices.\nWe realize a substantial portion of our revenue from communications equipment customers. This market is highly competitive, particularly in the area of\nprice. Should any of our larger customers in this market fail to effectively compete with their competitors, they could reduce their orders to us or experience liquidity\ndifficulties, either of which could have the effect of substantially reducing our revenue and net income. In addition, recent customer finished goods inventory\nadjustments reduced demand for our services from this end market, negatively impacting our revenue during fiscal 2024. There can be no assurance when this\nadjustment will be complete or that we will not experience declines in demand in this or in other end markets in the future.\nOur operating results are subject to significant uncertainties, which can cause our future sales, net income and cash generated from operations to be variable.\nOur operating results can vary due to a number of significant uncertainties, including:\n• our ability to replace declining sales from end-of-life programs and customer disengagements with new business wins;\n• conditions in the global economy as a whole and in the industries we serve, which have been significantly impacted by supply chain disruptions,\ninflationary pressures and higher interest rates;\n• fluctuations in component prices, component shortages and extended component lead times caused by high demand and supply chain constraints and\ndisruptions caused by geopolitical events, such as the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East, natural disasters or otherwise;\n• timing and success of new product developments and ramps by our customers, which create demand for our services, but which can also require us to incur\nstart-up costs relating to new tooling and processes;\n• levels of demand in the end markets served by our customers and the amount of inventory held by them;\n• timing of orders from customers, the accuracy of their forecasts which drive the amount of components we order and the extent to which customers\nreschedule or cancel their orders;\n• the extent to which our customers may choose to in-source the manufacturing of their products;\n• our inventory levels, which in the past have been driven higher as a result of supply chain disruptions, with higher levels of inventory reducing our\noperating cash flow;\n• our customers’ inventory levels, which, if high, decrease demand for new orders for products;\n• customer payment terms and the extent to which we factor customer receivables during the quarter;\n• increasing labor costs in the regions in which we operate;\n• mix of products ordered by and shipped to major customers, as high volume and low complexity manufacturing services typically have lower gross margins\nthan more complex and lower volume services;\n• our ability to pass tariffs and price increases of components through to our customers;\n16\nTable of Contents\n• quality or other claims made by our customers;\n• the degree to which we are able to fully utilize our available manufacturing capacity or expand, when necessary to satisfy customer demand;\n• customer insolvencies resulting in bad debt or inventory exposures that are in excess of our reserves;\n• our ability to efficiently move manufacturing operations to lower cost regions when requested by our customers;\n• changes in our tax provision due to changes in our estimates of pre-tax income in the jurisdictions in which we operate, uncertain tax positions and our\ncontinued ability to utilize our deferred tax assets;\n• political and economic developments in countries in which we or our customers or our suppliers have operations, which could restrict our operations or\nthose of our suppliers and/or customers or increase our costs; and\n• accuracy of management’s estimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs relating to long-term contracts, particularly for new products, as any impact\ndue to changes in estimates must be recognized in the period of change.\nVariability in our operating results may also lead to variability in cash generated by operations, which can adversely affect our ability to make capital\nexpenditures, repurchase stock and engage in strategic transactions.\nWe are subject to risks arising from our international operations.\nThe substantial majority of our net sales are generated through our non-U.S. operations. As a result, we are or can be negatively impacted by economic,\npolitical and other conditions in the foreign countries in which we do business, including:\n• changes in trade and tax laws that may result in us or our customers being subject to increased taxes, duties and tariffs and import and export restrictions,\nwhich could increase our costs and/or reduce our customers’ willingness to use our services in countries in which we are currently manufacturing their\nproducts;\n• compliance with foreign laws, including labor laws that generally provide for increased notice, severance and consultation requirements compared to U.S.\nlabor laws;\n• labor unrest, including strikes;\n• difficulties in staffing due to immigration or travel restrictions imposed by national governments, including the U.S.;\n• security concerns;\n• political instability and/or regional military tension or hostilities, such as the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East, the possibility of such conflicts\nbroadening to areas outside the area of immediate hostilities and the actions taken by national governments in response to such hostilities;\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may either increase or decrease our operating costs and for which we have significant exposure;\n• the imposition of currency controls, which would have the effect of preventing us from repatriating profits from our foreign subsidiaries;\n• exposure to heightened corruption risks;\n• aggressive, selective or lax enforcement of laws and regulations by national governmental authorities; and\n• potentially increased risk of misappropriation of intellectual property.\nWe operate in countries that have experienced labor unrest, political instability or conflict and strife in the past, including China, India, Israel, Malaysia,\nMexico and Thailand, and we have experienced work stoppages and similar disruptions at our plants in these countries. To the extent these factors prevent us from\nadequately staffing our plants and manufacturing and shipping products in those jurisdictions, our margins and net income could be reduced and our reputation as a\nreliable supplier could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our sales and declines in sales to these customers could significantly reduce our\nnet sales and net income.\nSales to our ten largest customers have historically represented approximately half of our net sales. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small\nnumber of customers for a significant percentage of our sales for the foreseeable future. The loss of, a significant reduction in sales or pricing to, or an inability to\nrecover components liabilities from our largest customers could therefore substantially reduce our revenue and margins.\n17\nTable of Contents\nCustomer order cancellations, push-outs and reduced forecasts could reduce our sales, net income and liquidity.\nWe generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers and our bookings may generally be canceled prior to the scheduled\nshipment date. Although customers are generally liable for components we procure on their behalf, finished goods and work in progress at the time of cancellation,\ncustomers may fail to honor this commitment or we may be unable to, or, for other business reasons, choose not to, enforce our contractual rights. Cancellations,\nreductions or push-outs of orders by customers and reduced customer forecasts, whether due to changes in individual customer circumstances, such as customer\ninventory levels, or end market changes or recessionary conditions in general, could cause our inventory levels to increase, consume working capital, lead to write-\noffs of inventory that customers fail to purchase for any reason, which could reduce our sales, net income and liquidity.\nOur strategy to pursue higher margin business depends in part on the success of our CPS businesses, which, if not successful, could cause our future gross\nmargins and operating results to be lower.\nA key part of our strategy of providing end-to-end manufacturing solutions is to grow our CPS businesses, which supplies printed circuit boards, backplane\nand backplane assemblies, cable assemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts, memory, RF, optical and\nmicroelectronic solutions, and data storage solutions and design, engineering, logistics and repair services and our SCI defense and aerospace products. A decrease in\norders for these components, products and services can have a disproportionately adverse impact on our profitability since these components, products and services\ngenerally yield higher margins than our core IMS business. In addition, in order to grow this portion of our business profitably, we must continue to make substantial\ninvestments in the development of our product development capabilities, research and development activities, test and tooling equipment and skilled personnel, all of\nwhich reduce our operating results in the short term. The success of our CPS businesses also depends on our ability to increase sales of our proprietary products,\nconvince our customers to purchase our components rather than those of third parties for use in the manufacture of their products, and expand the number of our\ncustomers who contract for our design, engineering, logistics and repair services. We may face challenges in achieving commercially viable yields and difficulties in\nmanufacturing components in the quantities and to the specifications and quality standards required by our customers, as well as in qualifying our components for\nuse in our customers’ designs. Our proprietary products and design, engineering, logistics and repair services must compete with products and services offered by\nestablished vendors which focus solely on development of similar technologies or the provision of similar services. Any of these factors could reduce the revenue\nand margins of our CPS businesses, which in turn would have an adverse and potentially disproportionate effect on our overall revenue and profitability.\nWorldwide supply chain shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the resumption of strong worldwide demand for electronic products and components and\ngeopolitical events have collectively limited our ability to manufacture and ship all of the products for which we have demand; our profitability will be reduced if\nwe are unable to continue to pass on increasing component costs.\nOver the past four years, our supply chain has been significantly impacted by interruptions in supplier and port operations resulting from the COVID-19\npandemic, the resumption of strong worldwide demand for electronic products and components following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and geopolitical\nevents, such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. As a result, we have experienced and continue to experience delays in delivery and shortages\nof certain components, particularly certain types of capacitors, resistors and discrete semiconductors needed for many of the products we manufacture. These\nconditions have limited and may continue to limit our ability to manufacture and ship all of the products for which we have demand and that require these\ncomponents and have resulted and may continue to result in an increase in our inventories of other components that cannot be assembled into finished products\nwithout these components. These factors are exacerbated by the fact that we are dependent on a limited number of sole source suppliers to provide key components\nthat we incorporate into our products. In the case of semiconductors, most third-party manufacturing is concentrated among a small number of suppliers located in\nthe same geographic area. Although conditions have generally improved, we expect some level of delays and shortages to continue to persist in some form in the\nshort to medium term. Any such delays or shortages, including due to natural disasters or geopolitical issues or conflicts, could result in delays in shipments to our\ncustomers, which would reduce our revenue, margins and operating cash flow for the periods affected.\nIn addition, inflationary pressures resulting from supply chain constraints and strong economic conditions generally have led to sustained increases in the\nprices we pay for components and materials used in production and in our labor and transportation costs. While we seek to pass on to our customers the increased\nprices for components and shipping, plus a margin, our gross margins and profitability could decrease, perhaps significantly, over a sustained period of time if we are\nunable to do so.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had, and any future outbreak could have, a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition by reducing\ndemand from our customers, interrupting the flow of components needed for our customers’ products, limiting the operations and productivity of our\nmanufacturing facilities and creating health risks to our employees.\nOur business, operations and results of operations were significantly and negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic 1)\ncaused our customers to reduce their demand from us, 2) interrupted the availability of components we need for our customers’ products, 3) limited the operations\nand productivity of our manufacturing resources and 4) created health risks to our employees.\nOur operations could again be similarly and negatively impacted in the event of any future outbreaks, including outbreaks caused by new variants of\nCOVID-19, and actions that government authorities may take in response to such future outbreaks.\nCurrent U.S. trade policy could increase the cost of using both our onshore and offshore manufacturing services for our U.S. customers, leading them to reduce\ntheir orders to us.\nAlthough we maintain significant manufacturing capacity in the U.S., the majority of our manufacturing operations are located outside the U.S. The U.S.,\nChina, the E.U. and several other countries have imposed tariffs on certain imported products. In particular, the U.S. has imposed tariffs impacting certain\ncomponents and products imported from China by us into the U.S. These tariffs apply to both components imported into the U.S. from China for use in the\nmanufacture of products at our U.S. plants and to certain of our customers’ products that we manufacture for them in China and that are then imported into the U.S.\nAny decision by a large number of our customers to cease using our manufacturing services due to the application of tariffs would materially reduce our revenue and\nnet income. Depending on the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, a broad increase in tariffs on all imported components is possible. Our gross margins would\nbe reduced in the event we are for any reason unable to pass on any tariffs that we incur to our customers. Although our customers are generally liable for tariffs we\npay on their behalf on importation of components used in the manufacture of their products, our gross margins would be reduced in the event we are for any reason\nunable to recover tariffs or duties from our customers. Further, although we are required to pay tariffs upon importation of the components, we may not be able to\nrecover these amounts from our customers until sometime later, if at all, which would adversely impact our operating cash flow in a given period.\nTransfers of business or operations may increase our costs and cause disruptions in our ability to service our customers.\nOur customers sometimes require that we transfer the manufacturing of their products from one of our facilities to another to achieve cost reductions, tariff\nreductions and other objectives. These transfers have resulted in increased costs to us due to facility downtime, less than optimal utilization of our manufacturing\ncapacity and delays and complications related to the transition of manufacturing programs to new locations. These transfers, and any decision by a significant\ncustomer to terminate manufacturing services in a particular facility, could require us to close or reduce operations at certain facilities and, as a result, we may incur\nin the future significant costs for the closure of facilities, employee severance and related matters. We may be required to relocate or close additional manufacturing\noperations in the future and, accordingly, we may incur additional costs that decrease our net income.\nIn addition, certain of our foreign manufacturing facilities are leased from third parties. To the extent we are unable to renew the leases covering such\nfacilities as they expire on reasonable terms, or are forced to move our operations at those facilities to other locations as a result of a failure to agree upon renewal\nterms, production for our customers may be interrupted, we may breach our customer agreements, we could incur significant start-up costs at new facilities and our\nlease expense may increase, potentially significantly.\nRegulatory, Compliance and Litigation Risks\nWe are subject to a number of U.S. export control and regulatory requirements relating to our defense business, with which the failure to comply could result in\nfines and reduction of future revenue.\nWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to the export of U.S. technology, anti-corruption and the award, administration and performance\nof U.S. government contracts and subcontracts. In particular, our activities must comply with the restrictions relating to the export of controlled technology and sales\nto denied or sanctioned parties contained in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and sanctions administered by\nthe Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department. The U.S. Commerce Department has released rules that in some cases significantly restrict the\nexport of U.S. technology to or from China. These laws could negatively impact our operations in China by making it more difficult to import components\ncontaining U.S. technology into China and to export finished products\n19\nTable of Contents\ncontaining such components out of China. Any failure to comply with export control laws could result in significant fines or penalties. We must also comply with\nregulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts and subcontracts with respect to our defense business, including\nregulations that govern price negotiations, cost accounting standards, procurement practices, termination at the election of the government and many other aspects of\nperformance under government contracts and subcontracts. These laws and regulations are complex, require extensive compliance efforts and expenditures in the\nform of additional systems and personnel, and, in some cases, require us to ensure that our suppliers adhere to such regulations. Furthermore, our compliance with\nsuch regulations is subject to audit or investigation by governmental authorities. From time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from government\nagencies and regulators regarding our compliance. For example, we responded to several Civil Investigative Demands from the U.S. Department of Justice relating\nto certain contracts, projects, proposals, and business activities of our SCI subsidiary and a qui tam lawsuit filed by a former SCI employee was recently unsealed\nrelating to these matters. Should we be found to have violated one or more government contracting laws or regulations, we could become subject to civil damages\n(which in some cases could be trebled) or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including appointment of government monitors, termination of our\ngovernment contracts and, ultimately, debarment from doing further business with the U.S. government. Any of such results would increase our expenses, reduce our\nrevenue and damage our reputation as both a commercial and government supplier.\nIf we manufacture or design defective products, if there are manufacturing defects in the components we incorporate into customer products or if our\nmanufacturing processes do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and standards, we could be subject to claims, damages and fines\nand lose customers.\nWe manufacture products to our customers’ specifications, and in some cases our manufacturing processes and facilities need to comply with various\nstatutory and regulatory requirements and standards. For example, many of the medical products that we manufacture, as well as the facilities and manufacturing\nprocesses that we use to produce them, must comply with standards established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and products we manufacture for the\nautomotive end market are generally subject to the IATF 16949:2016 standard. In addition, our customers’ products and the manufacturing processes that we use to\nproduce them often are highly complex. As a result, products that we design or manufacture may at times contain design or manufacturing defects, and our\nmanufacturing processes may be subject to errors or may not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and standards. Finally,\ncustomer products can experience quality problems or failures as a result of defects in the components customers specify to be included in the products we\nmanufacture for them. Defects in the products we design or manufacture, even if caused by components specified by the customer, may result in product recalls,\nwarranty claims by customers, including liability for repair costs, delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders. The failure of the products\nthat we design or manufacture or of our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and standards may\nsubject us to legal fines or penalties, cause us to lose business and, in some cases, require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing\nprogram or facility. In addition, these defects may result in product liability claims against us by third parties. The risk and magnitude of such claims may increase as\nwe continue to expand our presence in the medical and automotive end markets since defects in these types of products can result in death or significant injury to end\nusers of these products. Even when our customers or suppliers are contractually responsible for defects in the design of a product and defects in components used in\nthe manufacture of such products, there is no guarantee that any indemnities provided by such parties will be adequate to cover all damages to which we may\nbecome subject or that these parties will have the financial resources to indemnify us for such liabilities, in which case we could be required to expend significant\nresources to defend ourselves if named in a product liability suit over such defects.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, upon the intellectual property of others, we could be required to\npay significant amounts in costs or damages.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights.\nHowever, a number of our patents covering certain aspects of our manufacturing processes or products have expired and will continue to expire in the future. Such\nexpirations reduce our ability to assert claims against competitors or others who use or sell similar technology. Any inability to protect our intellectual property rights\ncould diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology. In addition, should a current or former employee use or\ndisclose any of our or our customers’ proprietary information, we could become subject to legal action by our customers or others, our key technologies could\nbecome compromised and our ability to compete could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, we may become involved in administrative proceedings, lawsuits or other proceedings if others allege that the products we manufacture for our\ncustomers or our own manufacturing processes and products infringe on their intellectual property rights. If successful, such claims could force our customers and us\nto stop importing or producing products or components of products that use the challenged intellectual property, to pay up to treble damages and to obtain a license\nto the\n20\nTable of Contents\nrelevant technology or to redesign those products or services so as not to use the infringed technology. The costs of defense and potential damages and/or impact on\nproduction of patent litigation could be significant and have a materially adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, although our customers typically\nindemnify us against claims that the products we manufacture for them infringe others’ intellectual property rights, there is no guaranty that these customers will\nhave the financial resources to stand behind such indemnities should the need arise, nor is there any guarantee that any such indemnity could be fully enforced. We\nsometimes design products on a contract basis or jointly with our customers. In such situations, we may become subject to claims that products we design infringe\nthird party intellectual property rights and may also be required to indemnify our customer against liability caused by such claims.\nAny of these events could reduce our revenue, increase our costs and damage our reputation with our customers.\nAllegations of failures to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in the payment of significant damages, which would\nreduce our net income.\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, including those related to safety, wages and overtime, meal and rest periods,\ndiscrimination, harassment, collective bargaining, whistleblowing, classification of employees, privacy and severance payments. We may be required to defend\nagainst allegations that we have violated such laws. Allegations that we have violated labor laws could lead to damages being awarded to employees or fines from or\nsettlements with plaintiffs or federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities, the amounts of which could be substantial, and which would reduce our net income. For\nexample, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we paid approximately $4 million in a judicially approved settlement in connection with a lawsuit against us alleging\nviolations of California Labor Code provisions governing overtime, meal and rest periods, wages, wage statements and reimbursements of business expenses, and in\nfiscal 2024, four putative class actions were filed in California alleging similar violations.\nCyberattacks and other disruptions of our information technology network and systems could interrupt our operations, lead to loss of our customer and\nemployee data and subject us to damages.\nWe rely on internal and cloud-based networks and systems furnished by third parties for worldwide financial reporting, inventory management,\nprocurement, invoicing, employee payroll and benefits administration and email communications, among other functions. In addition, our 42Q manufacturing\nexecution solutions software used by us and certain of our customers operates in the cloud. Despite our business continuity planning, including maintaining\nredundant data sites and network availability, both our internal and cloud-based infrastructure may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss,\ntelecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, performance failures by our IT vendors and similar events. For example, in July 2024, a misconfigured system update\ninitiated by one of our network security vendors caused our worldwide manufacturing operations to be temporarily disrupted. In addition, our systems, like those of\nother large companies, are regularly subject to third-party hacking attempts. Despite the implementation of numerous network security measures, both our internal\nand our cloud-based infrastructure may also be vulnerable to such hacking attempts, the installation of computer viruses, malware or similar disruptions either by\nthird parties or employees with access to key IT infrastructure. Cybersecurity attacks can come in many forms, including distributed denial of service attacks,\nadvanced persistent threat, phishing, business email compromise efforts and ransomware attacks. There can be no assurance that a future malware attack or hacking\nattempt will not be successful in breaching our systems. Hacking, malware and other cybersecurity attacks, if not prevented, could lead to the collection and\ndisclosure of sensitive personal or confidential information relating to our business, customers, employees or others, exposing us to legal liability and causing us to\nsuffer reputational damage. In addition, our SCI defense and aerospace business is subject to U.S. government regulations requiring the safeguarding of certain\nunclassified government information and to report to the U.S. government certain cyber incidents that affect such information. The increasing sophistication of\ncyberattacks requires us to continually evaluate new technologies and processes intended to detect and prevent these attacks. Our insurance coverage for\ncyberattacks is limited. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity measures will be sufficient to protect the data we manage. If we and our cloud infrastructure\nvendors are not successful in preventing such outages and cyberattacks, our operations could be disrupted, we could incur losses, including losses relating to claims\nby our customers, employees or privacy regulators relating to loss of personal or confidential business information, the willingness of customers to do business with\nus may be damaged and, in the case of our defense business, we could be barred from future participation in U.S. government programs.\nGlobal, national and corporate initiatives addressing climate change could increase our costs.\nConcern over climate change may lead to state, federal and international legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing carbon dioxide and other\ngreenhouse gas emissions through incentives, taxes or mandates and there is increased interest generally in voluntary corporate commitments to reduce the\ngeneration of greenhouse gases. Collectively, such initiatives and commitments could lead to an increase in both the price of energy and our operating costs. A\nsustained increase in energy prices for any reason could increase our raw material, components, operations and transportation costs, which we may\n21\nTable of Contents\nnot be able to pass on to our customers and which would therefore reduce our profitability, as would any increase in operating costs and investments due to our\nadoption, whether voluntary or mandatory, of measures to reduce our carbon footprint. We could also suffer reputational damage if our sustainability practices are\nperceived to be inadequate.\nAny failure to comply with applicable environmental laws could adversely affect our business by causing us to pay significant amounts for cleanup of hazardous\nmaterials or for damages or fines.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, generation, storage,\ndischarge and disposal of hazardous substances and waste in the ordinary course of our manufacturing operations. If we violate environmental laws or if we own or\noperate, or owned or operated in the past, a site at which we or a predecessor company caused contamination, we may be held liable for damages and the costs of\nremedial actions. For example, in April 2023, a court issued a ruling finding us and other defendants liable for certain investigation and remediation costs relating to\na site owned by a predecessor company in Southern California at which a disposal was alleged to have occurred, which claim has since been settled subject to court\napproval. Although we estimate and regularly reassess our potential liability with respect to violations or alleged violations and accrue for such liability, our accruals\nmay not be sufficient. Any increase in existing reserves or establishment of new reserves for environmental liability would reduce our net income. Our failure or\ninability to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could also limit our ability to expand facilities or could require us to acquire costly\nequipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with these laws and regulations.\nPartly as a result of certain of our acquisitions, we have incurred liabilities associated with environmental contamination. These liabilities include ongoing\ninvestigation and remediation activities at a number of current and former sites. The time required to perform environmental remediation can be lengthy and there\ncan be no assurance that the scope, and therefore cost, of these activities will not increase as a result of the discovery of new contamination or contamination on\nadjoining landowners’ properties or the adoption of more stringent regulatory standards covering sites at which we are currently performing remediation activities.\nWe cannot assure that past disposal activities will not result in liability that will materially affect us in the future, nor can we provide assurance that we do\nnot have environmental exposures of which we are unaware and which could adversely affect our future operating results. Changes in or restrictions on discharge\nlimits, emissions levels, permitting requirements and material storage or handling could require a higher than anticipated level of remediation activities, operating\nexpenses and capital investment or, depending on the severity of the impact of the foregoing factors, costly plant relocation, any of which would reduce our net\nincome.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations; there\nare inherent limitations to our system of internal controls; changes in corporate governance requirements, policies and practices may impact our business.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires\nthat we make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets, liabilities and net income during the reporting period. A change in the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could impact our future operating results. GAAP is subject to interpretation\nby the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies. A change in those policies\ncan have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions which are completed before a change is announced. For example, in\nfiscal 2019, we implemented the new revenue recognition standard, which is complex and requires significant management judgment. Although we believe the\njudgments we applied in implementation of the new revenue recognition standard are appropriate, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to change\nour judgments relating to implementation of such standard in the future, whether as a result of new guidance or otherwise. A significant change in our accounting\njudgments could have a significant impact on our reported revenue, gross profit, assets and liabilities. In general, changes to accounting rules or challenges to our\ninterpretation or application of the rules by regulators may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business.\nOur system of internal and disclosure controls and procedures was designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives. However, no\nevaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. As a result, there can be no\nassurance that our system of internal and disclosure controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors, theft and fraud, or in informing management\nof all material information in a timely manner. For example, as disclosed in Item 9A of this annual report on Form 10-K, we have identified\n22\nTable of Contents\nseveral material weaknesses relating to the control environment at one of our divisions and a material weakness in our internal controls over accounting for certain\npayments received for inventory.\nFinally, corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices continue to evolve based upon continuing legislative action, SEC rulemaking and\npolicy positions taken by large institutional stockholders and proxy advisors. As a result, the number of rules, regulations and standards applicable to us may become\nmore burdensome to comply with, could increase scrutiny of our practices and policies by these or other groups and increase our legal and financial compliance costs\nand the amount of time management must devote to governance and compliance activities. For example, the SEC has recently adopted rules requiring that issuers\nprovide significantly increased disclosures concerning cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance and incident reporting and adopt more stringent\nexecutive compensation clawback policies and several agencies and governments, including the SEC, the EU and California have enacted legislation or adopted\nrules that will require large companies to provide significant disclosures concerning their greenhouse gas emissions and financial risks relating to climate change.\nIncreasing regulatory burdens and corporate governance requirements impose both internal and external costs on us, require significant management attention and\noversight and could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors and qualified executive officers.\nLiquidity and Credit Risks\nOur customers could experience credit problems, which could reduce our future revenue and net income.\nCertain of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties in the past, with a few filing for bankruptcy. Financial difficulties experienced by\none or more of our customers, could negatively affect our business by decreasing demand from such customers and through the potential inability of these companies\nto make full payment on amounts owed to us. Customer bankruptcies also entail the risk of potential recovery by the bankruptcy estate of amounts previously paid to\nus that are deemed a preference under bankruptcy laws. There can be no assurance that additional customers will not declare bankruptcy or suffer financial distress,\nin which case our future revenue, net income and cash flow could be reduced.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient liquidity to maintain or expand our operations, which would reduce the amount of business our customers and vendors\nare able to do with us and impact our ability to continue operations at current levels without seeking additional funding; high interest rates reduce our net\nincome and operating cash flow; we could experience losses if one or more financial institutions holding our cash or other financial counterparties were to fail;\nrepatriation of foreign cash could increase our taxes.\nOur liquidity is dependent on a number of factors, including profitability, business volume, inventory levels, the extension of trade credit by our suppliers,\nthe degree of alignment of payment terms from our suppliers with payment terms granted to our customers, the amount we invest in our facilities and equipment, the\ntiming of acquisitions and divestitures, the schedule for repayment of our outstanding indebtedness, the timing of stock repurchases, the amount available to borrow\nunder the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2022, as amended (the “Credit Agreement”), and the amount of accounts\nreceivable eligible and accepted for sale under our factoring programs. In the event we need or desire additional liquidity beyond the sources described above to\nmaintain or expand our business levels, make acquisitions or repurchase stock, there can be no assurance that such additional liquidity will be available on\nacceptable terms or at all. The sale of receivables under our factoring programs is subject to the approval of the banks or customers involved and there can be no\nassurance that we will be able to sell the maximum amount of receivables permitted by these programs when desired. In addition, because the interest rate we pay for\nborrowings under the Credit Agreement and the interest rate used to calculate the purchase price for receivables under our factoring programs are variable, the\ncurrently high interest rates resulting from actions taken by the Federal Reserve to reduce inflation both increases the amount of interest expense we pay, which\nreduces net income, and also reduces the amount of proceeds we receive from purchasers under our receivables factoring program, which reduces operating cash\nflow.\nAny failure to maintain adequate liquidity would prevent us from maintaining operations at current or desired levels, which in turn would reduce both our\nrevenue and profitability.\nAlthough we believe our existing cash resources and sources of liquidity, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our\nworking capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, should demand for our services increase significantly over the next 12 months or should we experience\nsignificant increases in delinquent or uncollectible accounts receivable for any reason, including recessionary economic conditions, our cash provided by operations\n23\nTable of Contents\ncould decrease significantly and we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity to continue our operations at their current level. In such a case, there can\nbe no assurance that such additional sources of financing would be available.\nA principal source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents, which are held with various financial institutions. Although we distribute such funds\namong a number of financial institutions that we believe to be of high quality, there can be no assurance that one or more of such institutions will not become\ninsolvent in the future. For example, in the spring of 2023, three mid-sized regional banks failed and were placed under the temporary control of federal regulators.\nAlthough none of our cash and cash equivalents were deposited with any of such banks, should the financial institutions in which our cash and cash equivalents are\ndeposited fail in the future and not be backstopped by the federal government or otherwise guaranteed, all or a portion of our uninsured funds on deposit with such\ninstitutions could be lost. Similarly, should the financial institutions holding the cash and cash equivalents of our customers fail and not be backstopped or otherwise\nguaranteed, our customers may become unable to satisfy their obligations to us. Finally, if one or more counterparties to our interest rate or foreign currency hedging\ninstruments were to fail, we could suffer losses and our hedging of risk could become less effective.\nAs of September 28, 2024, approximately 65% of our cash was held in foreign jurisdictions. Some of these jurisdictions restrict the amount of cash that can\nbe transferred to the U.S. or impose taxes and penalties on such transfers of cash. To the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in, or is\nneeded by, our U.S. operations, we may incur significant foreign taxes to repatriate these funds which would reduce the net amount ultimately available for such\npurposes.\nOur Credit Agreement contains covenants that may adversely impact our business; the failure to comply with such covenants or the occurrence of an event of\ndefault could cause us to be unable to borrow additional funds and cause our outstanding debt to become immediately payable.\nOur Credit Agreement contains a maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratio and a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions on\nincurring additional debt, making investments and other restricted payments, selling assets and paying dividends, subject to certain exceptions, with which we must\ncomply. Collectively, these covenants could constrain our ability to grow our business through acquisition or engage in other strategic transactions. Such facility also\ncontains customary events of default. Finally, such facility includes covenants requiring, among other things, that we timely file quarterly and annual financial\nstatements with the SEC, comply with all laws, pay all taxes and maintain casualty insurance. If we are not able to comply with these covenants or if an event of\ndefault were to occur and not be cured or waived by our lenders, all of our outstanding debt would become immediately due and payable and the incurrence of\nadditional debt under our Credit Agreement would not be allowed, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to continue to\nconduct our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are subject to intense competition in the electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”) industry, which could cause us to lose sales and, therefore, harm our\nfinancial performance.\nThe EMS industry is highly competitive and the industry has experienced a surplus of manufacturing capacity. Our competitors include major global EMS\nproviders, including Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Celestica, Inc., Flex Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (Foxconn), Jabil Inc. and Plexus Corp., as well as\nother companies that have a regional, product, service or industry-specific focus. We also face competition from current and potential OEM customers who may elect\nto manufacture their own products internally rather than outsource to EMS providers.\nCompetition is based on a number of factors, including end markets served, price and quality. We may not be able to offer prices as low as some of our\ncompetitors for any number of reasons, including the willingness of competitors to provide EMS services at prices we are unable or unwilling to offer. There can be\nno assurance that we will win new business or maintain existing business due to competitive factors, which could decrease our sales and net income. In addition, due\nto the extremely price sensitive nature of our industry, business that we do win or maintain may have lower margins than our historical or target margins. As a result,\ncompetition may cause our gross and operating margins to fall.\nConsolidation in the electronics industry may adversely affect our business by increasing customer buying power and increasing prices we pay for components.\nConsolidation in the electronics industry among our customers, our suppliers and/or our competitors may increase, which could result in a small number of\nvery large electronics companies offering products in multiple sectors of the electronics\n24\nTable of Contents\nindustry. If one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide EMS services, we may lose that customer’s business. Similarly,\nconsolidation among our suppliers could result in a sole or limited source for certain components used in our customers’ products. Any such consolidation could\ncause us to be required to pay increased prices for such components, which could reduce our gross margin and profitability if we are unable to pass on the\ncorresponding cost to our customers.\nChanges in our income tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities or expiration of our net operating loss carryforwards could increase our taxes and\ndecrease our net income; developments in pending audits could result in an increase in our tax expenses which would decrease our net income.\nWe are or may become subject to income, sales, value-added, goods and services, withholding and other taxes in the United States and various foreign\njurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for taxes and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions\nand calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective income tax rates and liability for other taxes could increase as a result of changes\nin the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in enacted tax laws, the\neffectiveness of our cash and tax management strategies, our ability to negotiate advance pricing agreements with foreign tax authorities, compliance with local trade\nlaws and other factors. International initiatives require multinational enterprises, like ours, to report profitability on a country-by-country basis, which could increase\nscrutiny by foreign tax authorities. In addition, our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities. For example, we are currently undergoing\naudits of our tax returns for certain recent tax years in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States. In connection with one such audit, on November 17,\n2023, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), which asserted an underpayment of tax of approximately\n$8 million for fiscal 2009. The proposed underpayment results from the IRS’s proposed disallowance of a $503 million worthless stock deduction previously taken\nby us. We disagree with the IRS’s position as asserted in the RAR and are vigorously contesting this matter through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial\nprocedures, as appropriate. However, an adverse result in this matter or additional developments in these or future audits would adversely affect our tax provisions,\nincluding through the disallowance or reduction of deferred tax assets or the assessment of back taxes, interest and penalties, any of which could result in a material\nincrease to our income tax expense and therefore a material decrease in our net income and could have a material adverse impact on our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements. Further, as of September 28, 2024, we have cumulative net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) for state and foreign tax purposes of $255\nmillion and $446 million, respectively, and none for federal. The state NOLs begin expiring in fiscal 2025, and expire at various dates through September 26, 2043.\nCertain foreign NOLs begin expiring in fiscal 2025. When our NOLs expire, our state income tax rates will increase, which will reduce our net income.\nWe can experience losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls, which could reduce our net income and impact our ability to\nrepatriate funds.\nBecause we manufacture the majority of our products abroad, our operating results can be negatively impacted due to fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates. We use financial instruments, primarily short-term foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.\nHowever, the success of our foreign currency hedging activities in preventing foreign exchange losses depends largely upon the accuracy of our forecasts of future\nsales, expenses, capital expenditures and assets and liabilities. As such, our foreign currency hedging program may not fully cover all of our exposure to exchange\nrate fluctuations. If our hedging activities are not successful, our net income may be reduced. In addition, certain countries in which we operate have adopted\ncurrency controls requiring that local transactions be settled only in local currency rather than in our functional currency, which is generally different than the local\ncurrency. Such controls could require us to hedge larger amounts of local currency than we otherwise would and/or prevent us from repatriating cash generated by\nour operations in such countries.\nWe may not have sufficient insurance coverage for potential claims and losses, which could leave us responsible for certain costs and damages.\nWe carry various forms of business and liability insurance in types and amounts we believe are reasonable and customary for similarly situated companies\nin our industry. However, our insurance program does not generally cover losses due to failure to comply with typical customer warranties for workmanship, product\nand medical device liability, intellectual property infringement, product recall claims, or environmental contamination. In particular, our insurance coverage with\nrespect to damages to or closure of our facilities, or damages to our customers’ products caused by cyberattacks, outages and certain natural disasters, such as\nearthquakes, epidemics and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), is limited and is subject to policy deductibles, coverage limits, and exclusions, and as a\nresult, may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses. For example, our policies have very limited coverage for damages due to earthquakes or losses caused by\nbusiness disruptions. In addition, such coverage may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. Our policies generally\n25\nTable of Contents\nhave deductibles and/or limits or may be limited to certain lines or business or customer engagements that reduce the amount of our potential recoveries from\ninsurance. As a result, not all of our potential business losses are covered under our insurance policies. Should we sustain a significant uncovered loss, our net\nincome will be reduced. Additionally, if one or more counterparties to our insurance coverage were to fail, we would bear the entire amount of an otherwise insured\nloss.\nRecruiting and retaining our key personnel is critical to the continued growth of our business.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our key personnel, particularly our highly skilled sales and operations executives, managers and\nengineers with many years of experience in the EMS industry. Such individuals can be difficult to identify, recruit and retain and are heavily recruited by our\ncompetitors. As our key employees choose to retire or terminate their employment with us, we will be required to replace them with new employees with the\nrequired experience, which has become challenging in the U.S. due to the strong employment market. Should we be unable to recruit new employees to fill key\npositions with us, our operations and growth prospects could be negatively impacted.\nWe may not be successful in implementing and integrating strategic transactions or in divesting assets or businesses, which could harm our operating results; we\ncould become required to book a charge to earnings should we determine that goodwill and other acquired assets are impaired.\nFrom time to time, we may undertake strategic transactions that give us the opportunity to access new customers and new end markets, increase our\nproprietary product offerings, obtain new manufacturing and service capabilities and technologies, enter new geographic manufacturing locations, lower our\nmanufacturing costs, increase our margins or further develop existing customer relationships. For example, in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered into a joint\nventure with a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited (“RSBVL”) that is intended to create a world-class electronic\nmanufacturing hub in India. The success of this joint venture is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the joint venture obtaining “Trusted Source”\ndesignation under the India government’s “Make in India” initiative, adverse changes in the key markets the joint venture targets and the risks described above under\nthe caption “We are subject to risks arising from our international operations”. Strategic transactions involve a number of risks, uncertainties and costs, including\nintegrating acquired operations and workforce, businesses and products, resolving quality issues involving acquired products, incurring severance and other\nrestructuring costs, diverting management attention from their normal operational duties, maintaining customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of\nacquired operations, terminating unfavorable commercial arrangements, losing key employees, integrating the systems of acquired operations into our management\ninformation systems and satisfying the liabilities of acquired businesses, including liability for past violations of law and material environmental liabilities. Any of\nthese risks could cause our strategic transactions not to be ultimately profitable. We may also choose to divest plants, businesses or products lines in the future.\nDivestitures reduce revenue and, potentially, margins and can involve the risk of retained liabilities from the operations divested, including environmental liabilities.\nIn addition, we have in the past recorded, and may be required to record in the future, goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with our\nacquisitions. We evaluate, at least on an annual basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of our\ngoodwill and other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable. Should we determine in the future that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become\nimpaired, an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary, which could be significant. For example, during our fiscal 2018 annual goodwill impairment\nanalysis, we fully impaired goodwill of $31 million associated with the acquisition of a storage software business we purchased in 2016.\nWe are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and global events.\nOur activities, including manufacturing, administration and information technology management, can be adversely affected by natural disasters such as\nmajor earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, tornadoes, fires and epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate change may cause certain\nof these events to become more severe and therefore more damaging. In the event of a major natural disaster affecting one or more of our facilities, our operations\nand management information systems, which control our worldwide procurement, inventory management, shipping and billing activities, could be significantly\ndisrupted. Such events could delay or prevent product manufacturing for an extended period of time. Any extended inability to continue our operations at affected\nfacilities following such an event could reduce our revenue. Further, geopolitical events like the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East may also impact our\noperations by affecting our supply chain or impacting our plants located in the region of instability.\n26\nTable of Contents\nRisks of Investing in Our Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and is impacted by factors other than our financial performance.\nThe stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected our stock price. These fluctuations have often\nbeen unrelated to our operating performance. Factors that can cause such fluctuations include announcements by our customers, suppliers, competitors or other\nevents affecting companies in the electronics industry, such as component shortages, currency fluctuations, the impact of natural disasters and global events, such as\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, such as the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East, general market fluctuations and macroeconomic\nconditions, including concerns about inflation and recession, any of which may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate widely.\n27\nTable of Contents\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have implemented a cybersecurity risk management program based on multiple cybersecurity frameworks, primarily the National Institute of Standards\nand Technology Cybersecurity Framework (800-171), as well as information security standards issued by international bodies. We use this program, which is\nintegrated into our overall enterprise risk management framework, to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.\nWe employ various measures to help manage our cybersecurity risks, including end-to-end email encryption, two-factor authentication for access to\nCompany applications, strong password requirements and firewall and email protection against malware and phishing campaigns. We augment these protective\ntechnologies with security monitoring and detection capabilities to limit the impact of cybersecurity incidents. Our program includes processes designed to identify\nmaterial risks related to the use of third party service providers, such as cloud service providers.\nWe provide cybersecurity and information security compliance training to relevant employees at least once per year, tracking completion and requiring\ntesting, and conduct simulated phishing campaign tests. We also provide additional specialized training for our security team and for employees with access to\ncertain sensitive information.\nOur SCI Technology subsidiary has been certified under the U.S. Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program. We also engage third-\nparty experts to improve our cybersecurity posture, including through penetration testing.\nWe have adopted a cybersecurity and privacy incident reporting framework to assess and manage cybersecurity incidents, which includes escalation\nprocedures based on the nature and severity of the incident, assessment of public disclosure considerations and reporting to the Audit Committee and the Board.\nAs of the date of this report, we do not believe that any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our Company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. However,\ndespite our security measures, there can be no assurance that we, or third parties with which we interact, will not experience a cybersecurity incident in the future\nthat will materially affect us. For more information on our cybersecurity related risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Cyberattacks and other disruptions of our\ninformation technology network and systems could interrupt our operations, lead to loss of our customer and employee data and subject us to damages.”\nGovernance\nOur Board has primary responsibility for overseeing risks associated with our information technology, including cybersecurity. Our Board receives regular\nreports from our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) regarding our information systems and technology and associated policies, processes and practices for managing\nand mitigating cybersecurity and technology-related risks. Our Audit Committee oversees our SEC reporting process generally, including with respect to any\nrequired disclosures relating to a material cybersecurity event.\nAt the management level, our Vice President, IT Security leads our enterprise-wide cybersecurity program and is primarily responsible for assessing and\nmanaging our material risks from cybersecurity threats. In performing his role, the Vice President, IT Security monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and\nremediation of cybersecurity risks and incidents and is a key stakeholder and participant in the Company’s cybersecurity and privacy incident reporting framework\ndescribed above. Our Vice President, IT Security reports to our CIO who, in turn, reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.\nOur Vice President, IT Security is an experienced cybersecurity professional with more than 20 years of experience building and leading cybersecurity, risk\nmanagement, and information technology teams, and holds industry-recognized cybersecurity certifications, including Certified Information Systems Security\nProfessional (CISSP) certification.\n28\nTable of Contents\nItem 2. Properties\nWe own or lease facilities located primarily in the geographies listed below. We believe our properties are generally in good condition, are well maintained\nand are generally suitable and adequate to carry out our business at expected capacity for the foreseeable future.\nAs of September 28, 2024, the approximate square footage of our active manufacturing facilities by region was as follows:\nApproximate\nSquare Footage\nAmericas 5,706,824\nAPAC 4,479,735\nEMEA 1,372,443\nTotal 11,559,002\nAs of September 28, 2024, our active manufacturing facilities consist of nine million square feet in facilities that we own and two million square feet in\nleased facilities with lease terms expiring between 2024 and 2042.\nCertifications and Registrations. Certifications and registrations under industry standards are important to our business because many customers rely on\nthem to confirm our adherence to manufacturing process and quality standards. Certain markets, such as telecommunications, medical, defense, aerospace,\nautomotive and oil and gas, require adherence to industry-specific standards. Substantially all of our manufacturing facilities are certified to ISO 9001:2015, a\nstandard published by the International Organization for Standardization. As part of the ISO 9001:2015 certification process, we have a highly developed quality\nmanagement system and continually improve its effectiveness in accordance with its requirements. We use this certification to demonstrate our ability to consistently\nprovide product that meets customer and applicable regulatory requirements and enhance customer satisfaction through its effective application.\nIn addition to ISO 9001:2015, many of our facilities are TL 9000 6.3 certified. The TL 9000 quality system requirements and quality system metrics are\ndesigned specifically for the telecommunications industry to promote consistency and efficiency, reduce redundancy and improve customer satisfaction. Included in\nthe TL 9000 system are performance-based metrics that quantify reliability and quality performance of the product. The majority of our facilities are also compliant\nwith the standards set by Underwriters Laboratories. These standards define requirements for quality, manufacturing process control and manufacturing\ndocumentation and are required by many OEMs in the communications sector of the electronics industry.\nOur medical systems division has identified certain manufacturing facilities to be centers of excellence for medical products manufacturing. These facilities\nare ISO 13485:2016 certified and, where appropriate, FDA registered and MDSAP certified.

Our revenue is\ngenerated from sales of our products and services primarily to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that serve the industrial, medical, defense and aerospace,\nautomotive, communications networks and cloud solutions industries.\nOur operations are managed as two businesses:\n1) Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (“IMS”). Our IMS segment consists of printed circuit board assembly and test, high-level assembly and test and\ndirect-order-fulfillment.\n2) Components, Products and Services (“CPS”). Components include advanced printed circuit boards, backplanes and backplane assemblies, cable\nassemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts. Products include optical, radio frequency (“RF”) and\nmicroelectronic design and manufacturing services from our Advanced Microsystems Technologies division; multi-chip package memory solutions\nfrom our Viking Technology division; high-performance storage platforms for hyperscale and enterprise solutions from our Viking Enterprise\nSolutions division; defense and aerospace product, design, manufacturing, repair and refurbishment services from our SCI Technology Inc. (“SCI”)\nsubsidiary; and cloud-based smart manufacturing execution software from our 42Q division. Services include design, engineering, and logistics and\nrepair.\nOur only reportable segment for financial reporting purposes is IMS, which represented approximately 80% of our total revenue in 2024. Our CPS business\nconsists of multiple operating segments which do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for being presented as reportable segments. Therefore, financial\ninformation for these operating segments is combined and presented in a single category entitled “CPS”.\n33\nTable of Contents\nOur strategy is to leverage our comprehensive product and service offerings, advanced technologies and global capabilities to further penetrate diverse end\nmarkets that we believe offer significant growth opportunities and have complex products that require higher value-added services. We believe this strategy\ndifferentiates us from our competitors and will help drive more sustainable revenue growth and provide opportunities for us to achieve operating margins that exceed\nindustry standards.\nA core component of our business strategy is to establish and retain long-term customer partnerships with companies. Historically, we have had substantial\nrecurring sales to existing customers. Sales to our ten largest customers typically represent approximately 50% of our net sales in any given year.\nWe typically enter into supply agreements with our major OEM customers. These agreements generally have terms ranging from three to five years and\ncover the manufacture of a range of products. Under these agreements, a customer typically purchases its requirements for specific products in particular geographic\nareas from us. However, these agreements generally do not obligate the customer to purchase minimum quantities of products. In addition, some customer contracts\ncontain cost reduction objectives, which can have the effect of reducing revenue from such customers.\nWe generate about 80% of our net sales from products manufactured in our foreign operations. The concentration of foreign operations has resulted\nprimarily from a desire on the part of many of our customers to manufacture in lower-cost locations in regions such as Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe and\nwe plan to expand our presence as appropriate to meet the needs of our customers. We also intend to continue to invest in factory automation, process improvements,\nrobotics and artificial intelligence, keeping up with the trends in technology to further enhance our efficiency output.\nTrends and Uncertainties\nWe believe our end-to-end manufacturing solutions combined with our global supply chain management expertise differentiates us from our competitors\nand enables us to better serve the needs of OEMs. However, our business faces many challenges. For example, we compete with a number of companies in each of\nour key end markets. This includes companies that are much larger than we are and smaller companies that focus on a particular niche product, service or end\nmarket. Although we believe we are well-positioned in each of our key end markets and offer many advantages compared to our competitors, competition remains\nintense and profitably growing our revenues has been challenging. Additionally, we are impacted by macroeconomic challenges such as inflation, supply chain\nconstraints, foreign currency fluctuations, high interest rates, market volatility, recession concerns, tariffs and other factors that have been and could be in the future\nexacerbated by geopolitical conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East and results of the U.S. presidential election. Although supply chain\nconstraints have been easing, we expect headwinds to our revenue growth that will continue in 2025 due to customers absorbing their finished goods inventory in\nsome of our end markets.\nDespite these challenges, we remain focused on improving our operations, building flexibility and efficiencies in our processes and adjusting our business\nmodels to changing circumstances. We intend to continue diversifying into mission critical markets and creating a portfolio of more complex, higher technology\nproducts with longer product life cycles. As our end markets evolve and grow, our ability to optimize our product and portfolio mix towards higher value\nopportunities will continue to be an important driver for our business going forward.\n34\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have\nbeen prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). We review the accounting policies used in reporting our\nfinancial results on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the process used to develop estimates\nrelated to accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, environmental matters, litigation and other contingencies, as well as estimates related to costs expected to\nbe incurred to satisfy performance obligations under long-term contracts and variable consideration related to such contracts. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not\nreadily apparent from other sources. We have considered information available to us as of the date of issuance of these financial statements and are not aware of any\nspecific events or circumstances that would require an update to our estimates or judgments, or a revision to the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. Our\nestimates may change as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used by us in preparing our consolidated financial\nstatements:\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue for the majority of our contracts on an over time basis. This is primarily due to the fact that we do not have an\nalternative use for the end products we manufacture for our customers and have an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit, for work in progress\nupon a customer's cancellation of a contract for convenience. In certain circumstances, we recognize over time because our customer simultaneously receives and\nconsumes the benefits provided by our services or, our customer controls the end product as we perform manufacturing services (continuous transfer of control). For\nthese contracts, revenue is recognized on an over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion)\nwhich we believe best depicts the transfer of control to the customer.\nIn our Defense and Aerospace division, we apply the cost-to-cost method for government contracts which requires the use of significant judgments with\nrespect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs included in the total estimated costs at completion. Additionally, we evaluate whether contract\nmodifications for claims have been approved and, if so, estimate the amount, if any, of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price of the\ncontract.\nEstimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs expected to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation are updated on a quarterly basis. These\nestimates consider costs incurred to date and estimated costs to be incurred over the remaining expected period of performance to satisfy a performance obligation.\nThere is inherent uncertainty in estimating the amount of costs that will be required to complete a contract. Factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in\nestimates include, among others, (1) the long-term duration of contracts, (2) the highly-complex nature of the products we manufacture, (3) the readiness of our\ncustomer’s design for manufacturing, (4) the cost and availability of purchased materials, (5) labor cost, availability and productivity, (6) subcontractor performance\nand (7) the risk of delayed performance/completion. Therefore, such estimates are reviewed each quarter by a group of employees that includes representatives from\nnumerous functions such as engineering, materials, contracts, manufacturing, program management, finance and senior management. If a change in estimate is\ndeemed necessary, the impact of the change is recognized in the period of change. Additionally, contract modifications for claims are assessed each quarter to\ndetermine whether the claims have been approved. If it is determined that a claim has been approved, the amount of the claim, if any, that can be included in\ntransaction price is estimated considering a number of factors such as the length of time expected to lapse until uncertainty about the claim has been resolved and the\nextent to which our experience with claims for similar contracts has predictive value.\nChanges in our estimates of transaction price and/or costs to complete result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to revenue and operating income. The\nimpact of changes in estimates on revenue and operating income resulting from application of the cost-to-cost method for recognizing revenue was as follows:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022\nRevenue: (In thousands)\nFavorable $ 12,220 $ 6,023 $ 5,403\nUnfavorable (2,697) (2,556) (162)\nTotal $ 9,523 $ 3,467 $ 5,241\n35\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating Income: (In thousands)\nFavorable $ 21,229 $ 8,657 $ 7,025\nUnfavorable (16,102) (44,838) (20,737)\nTotal $ 5,127 $ (36,181) $ (13,712)\nFor contracts for which revenue is required to be recognized at a point-in-time, we recognize revenue when we have transferred control of the related goods,\nwhich generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of the goods to the customer. Revenue streams for which revenue is recognized at a point-in-time include our\nproprietary products and sales of raw materials.\nInventories— We state inventories at the lower of cost (based on standard cost, which approximates first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Cost\nincludes raw materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. We regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and make provisions to reduce excess and\nobsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. The ultimate realization of inventory carrying amounts is affected by changes in customer demand for\ninventory that customers are not contractually obligated to purchase and inventory held for specific customers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Inventory\nwrite-downs are recorded based on forecasted demand, past experience with specific customers, the ability to redistribute inventory to other programs or return\ninventories to our suppliers, and whether customers are contractually obligated and have the ability to pay for the related inventory. Certain payments received from\ncustomers for inventories that have not been shipped to customers or otherwise disposed of are netted against inventory.\nWe generally procure inventory based on specific customer orders and forecasts. Customers generally have limited rights of modification (for example,\nrescheduling or cancellations) with respect to specific orders. Customer modifications of orders affecting inventory previously procured by us and our purchases of\ninventory beyond customer needs may result in excess and obsolete inventory. Although we may be able to use some excess inventory for other products we\nmanufacture, a portion of this excess inventory may not be returnable to vendors or recoverable from customers. Write-offs or write-downs of inventory could be\ncaused by:\n• changes in customer demand for inventory, such as cancellation of orders, and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs that result in excess\nquantities on hand that we are not able to return to the vendor, use to fulfill orders from other customers or charge back to the customer;\n• financial difficulties experienced by specific customers for whom we hold inventory; and\n• declines in the market value of inventory.\nOur raw materials inventories are generally acquired in anticipation of specific customer orders and pursuant to customer-specific design specifications.\nWhen we and our customers agree that the quantity of customer-specific inventory is in excess of anticipated demand, we may transfer control of those inventories to\nour customers in exchange for a cash payment. These transactions are reported as transfers of non-financial assets – i.e., reported on a net basis in the income\nstatement.\nLong-lived Assets— We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An asset group is the unit of accounting that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows\nare largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. An asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted\nfuture net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If an asset or asset group is considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured\nby the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. For asset groups for which a building is the primary asset, we estimate\nfair value primarily based on data provided by commercial real estate brokers. For other assets, we estimate fair value based on projected discounted future net cash\nflows, which requires significant judgment.\nConsolidation— In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), we consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest.\nIn fiscal 2023, we completed a joint venture transaction with Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited (“RSBVL”) to establish Sanmina SCI India Private\nLimited (“SIPL”), our existing Indian manufacturing entity, as a joint venture. As a result of the transaction, RSBVL holds 50.1% of the outstanding shares of SIPL\nand we hold the remaining 49.9% of the outstanding shares of SIPL. In connection with RSBVL’s investment, we entered into a management services contract\npursuant to which we have the unilateral ability to make the significant financial and operating decisions made in the ordinary course of SIPL’s business. We\ndetermined the voting interest model was applicable under ASC 810 and\n36\nTable of Contents\nconcluded that, despite not having a majority ownership interest, we have a controlling financial interest in SIPL through the management services contract.\nTherefore, we have, by contract, the unilateral ability to control the significant decisions made in the ordinary course of SIPL’s business and, as such, we consolidate\nSIPL. However, we periodically assess whether any changes in facts and circumstances have occurred that could require us to deconsolidate SIPL.\nIncome Taxes— We estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including estimating exposures related to\nexaminations by taxing authorities. We believe our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on our assessment of many factors, including past\nexperience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. Although we believe our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate, tax regulations are\nsubject to interpretation and the tax controversy process is inherently lengthy and uncertain; therefore, our assessments can involve a series of complex judgments\nabout future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. To the extent the probable tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will\nimpact our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. We only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a “more\nlikely than not” threshold of being upheld. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nWe must also make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that\nit is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. We evaluate positive and\nnegative evidence each reporting period when assessing the need for a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if we believe\nrealization of such assets is not more likely than not. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, new or\nmodified tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors. If our assumptions, and consequently our estimates, change in the future, the valuation allowances we\nhave established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense.\nOur effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the amount and geographic distribution of our worldwide income or losses, the tax regulations, rates and\nholidays in each geographic region, the utilization of net operating losses, the availability of tax credits and carryforwards, and the effectiveness of our tax planning\nstrategies.\n37\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nRefer to Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in our annual report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on November 16, 2023 for discussion of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended October 1, 2022.\nThe following table presents our key operating results.\nYear Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nNet sales $ 7,568,328 $ 8,935,048 $ 7,919,622\nGross profit $ 640,429 $ 743,211 $ 622,206\nGross margin 8.5 % 8.3 % 7.9 %\nOperating expenses $ 304,935 $ 287,553 $ 272,727\nOperating income $ 335,494 $ 455,658 $ 349,479\nOperating margin 4.4 % 5.1 % 4.4 %\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 222,536 $ 309,970 $ 240,384\nNet Sales\nNet sales decreased from $8.9 billion for 2023 to $7.6 billion for 2024, a decrease of 15.3%. Net sales increased from $7.9 billion for 2022 to $8.9 billion\nfor 2023, an increase of 12.8%. Sales by end market were as follows:\nYear Ended 2024 vs. 2023 2023 vs. 2022\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022 Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease)\n(Dollars in thousands)\nIndustrial, Medical, Defense and Aerospace, and\nAutomotive $ 4,915,880 $ 5,388,877 $ 4,744,088 $ (472,997) (8.8)% $ 644,789 13.6 %\nCommunications Networks and Cloud\nInfrastructure 2,652,448 3,546,171 3,175,534 (893,723) (25.2)% 370,637 11.7 %\nTotal $ 7,568,328 $ 8,935,048 $ 7,919,622 $ (1,366,720) (15.3)% $ 1,015,426 12.8 %\nComparison of 2024 to 2023 by End Market\nThe decrease in sales was primarily due to reduced demand caused by customers in some end markets, particularly communications networks, making\nadjustments to absorb their finished goods inventory. The impact of this was partially offset by new program wins and program ramps in our automotive and\ncommunications networks end markets.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was 8.5%, 8.3% and 7.9% in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. IMS gross margin decreased slightly to 7.5% in 2024 from 7.7% in 2023.\nCPS gross margin increased to 12.8% in 2024 from 11.6% in 2023, primarily due to significant losses recognized on certain fixed-price customer contracts in 2023\ncompared to 2024, the effect of which was partially offset by unfavorable product mix.\nWe have experienced fluctuations in gross margin in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Fluctuations in our gross margin may be caused by a\nnumber of factors, including:\n• the impacts of supply chain constraints on our operations, the operations of our suppliers and on our customers’ businesses;\n• capacity utilization which, if lower, results in lower margins due to fixed costs being absorbed by lower volumes;\n• changes in the mix of high and low margin products demanded by our customers;\n38\nTable of Contents\n• competition in the EMS industry and pricing pressures from OEMs due to greater focus on cost reduction;\n• the amount of our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, including those associated with distressed customers;\n• levels of operational efficiency and production yields;\n• our performance on long-term contracts, including our ability to recover claims for cost overruns; and\n• our ability to transition the location of and ramp up manufacturing and assembly operations when requested by a customer in a timely and cost-\neffective manner.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $266 million, $255 million and $245 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a percentage of net\nsales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 3.5%, 2.9% and 3.1% for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars in 2024 from\n2023 was primarily due to higher stock compensation expense from new equity grants, higher variable compensation and an increase in deferred compensation\ncaused by strong stock market performance that increased the market value of participant investment accounts, partially offset by lower professional fees.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses were $29 million, $26 million and $21 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a percentage of net sales,\nresearch and development expenses were 0.4% for 2024 and 0.3% for 2023 and 2022. The increase in absolute dollars in 2024 from 2023 was primarily due to\nhigher expenses for design and engineering support for existing and new projects.\nOther Expense\nOther expense was $1 million in 2024, $20 million in 2023 and a $26 million in 2022. The decrease in other expense in 2024 was primarily caused by a $12\nmillion decrease in discount of sold receivables in 2024 due to significantly lower factoring levels and an incremental gain of $5 million in the market value of\nparticipant investment accounts in our deferred compensation plan.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded income tax expense of $80 million, $85 million and $62 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 25%, 21%\nand 20% for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The tax rate was lower in 2023 and 2022 primarily due to larger discrete items, including recognized tax benefits\nfrom the release of certain foreign tax reserves due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations.\nAs a result of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for fiscal 2008 through 2010, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) on November\n17, 2023 asserting an underpayment of tax of approximately $8 million for fiscal 2009. The asserted underpayment results from the IRS’s proposed disallowance of\na $503 million worthless stock deduction in fiscal 2009. Such disallowance, if upheld, would reduce our available net operating loss carryforwards and result in\nadditional tax and interest attributable to fiscal 2021 and later years, which could be material. We disagree with the IRS’s position as asserted in the RAR and are\nvigorously contesting this matter through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. We do not expect resolution of this matter within\ntwelve months and cannot predict with any certainty the timing of such resolution. Although the final resolution of this matter remains uncertain, we continue to\nbelieve that it is more likely than not our tax position will be sustained. However, an unfavorable resolution of this matter could have a material adverse impact on\nour consolidated financial statements.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has\nproposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. Various\ncountries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax and where enacted, the rules begin to be effective for us\nin fiscal 2025. The Pillar Two rules are considered an alternative minimum tax and therefore deferred taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated\neffects of the future minimum tax. The adoption and effective dates of these rules may vary by country and could increase tax complexity and uncertainty and may\nadversely affect our provision for income taxes. We do not expect any material impact from these tax law changes in fiscal 2025.\n39\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYear Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 340,216 $ 235,168 $ 330,854\nInvesting activities (114,396) (192,458) (132,214)\nFinancing activities (269,707) 94,505 (314,299)\nEffect of exchange rate changes 2,177 498 (4,510)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (41,710) $ 137,713 $ (120,169)\nKey Working Capital Management Measures\nAs of\nSeptember 28, September 30,\n2024 2023\nDays sales outstanding (1) 56 55\nContract asset days (2) 18 20\nInventory turns (3) 5.2 5.1\nDays inventory on hand (4) 70 72\nAccounts payable days (5) 71 80*\nCash cycle days (6) 73 67*\n(1) Days sales outstanding (a measure of how quickly we collect our accounts receivable), or “DSO”, is calculated as the ratio of average accounts receivable, net,\nto average daily net sales for the quarter.\n(2) Contract asset days (a measure of how quickly we transfer contract assets to accounts receivable) are calculated as the ratio of average contract assets to average\ndaily net sales for the quarter.\n(3) Inventory turns (annualized) (a measure of how quickly we sell inventory) are calculated as the ratio of four times our cost of sales for the quarter to average\ninventory.\n(4) Days inventory on hand (a measure of how quickly we turn inventory into sales) is calculated as the ratio of average inventory for the quarter to average daily\ncost of sales for the quarter.\n(5) Accounts payable days (a measure of how quickly we pay our suppliers), or “DPO”, is calculated as the ratio of 365 days to accounts payable turns, in which\naccounts payable turns is calculated as the ratio of four times our cost of sales for the quarter to average accounts payable.\n(6) Cash cycle days (a measure of how quickly we convert investments in inventory to cash) is calculated as days inventory on hand plus days sales outstanding\nminus accounts payable days.\n* Certain prior period ratios reflect immaterial updates due to reclassifications of certain financial statement amounts to conform to the current period presentation.\nCash and cash equivalents were $626 million at September 28, 2024 and $668 million at September 30, 2023. Our cash levels vary during any given period\ndepending on the timing of collections from customers and payments to suppliers, borrowings under credit facilities, sales of accounts receivable under numerous\nprograms we utilize, repurchases of capital stock and other factors. Our working capital was approximately $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion as of September 28, 2024\nand September 30, 2023, respectively.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $340 million, $235 million and $331 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our working capital\nmetrics tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on factors such as the linearity of our\n40\nTable of Contents\nshipments to customers and purchases from suppliers, customer and supplier mix, and payment terms with customers and suppliers. These fluctuations can\nsignificantly affect our cash flows from operating activities.\nDuring 2024, we generated $447 million of cash from earnings, excluding non-cash items, and used $107 million of cash primarily because of a decrease in\naccounts payable of $112 million, an increase in accrued liabilities of $12 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $104 million, partially offset by a\ndecrease in inventories of $36 million. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily attributable to an unfavorable mix of supplier payment terms and lower\ninventory receipts, resulting in DPO decreasing from 80 days in 2023 to 71 days in 2024. The increase in accrued liabilities was due primarily to customer payments\nfor certain inventory partially offset by a decrease in amounts collected under our accounts receivable factoring program that had not been remitted as of the end of\nthe period to the financial institutions that purchased the receivables. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to unfavorable customer payment\nterms mix. The decrease in inventories is primarily due to our ongoing efforts to reduce inventory to more appropriate levels primarily by working with customers to\nensure their demand forecasts are reasonable and incorporate appropriate lead times to secure materials.\nDuring 2023, we generated $527 million of cash from earnings, excluding non-cash items, and used $292 million of cash primarily because of a decrease in\naccounts payable of $418 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $89 million, partially offset by a decrease in inventories of $210 million. The decrease in\naccounts payable was primarily attributable to lower inventory receipts and an unfavorable mix of supplier payment terms, resulting in DPO decreasing from 90 days\nin 2022 to 80 days in 2023. The decrease in inventories was primarily due to lower business volume and our efforts to reduce inventory to more appropriate levels\nprimarily by working with customers to ensure their demand forecasts are reasonable and incorporate appropriate lead times to secure materials. The increase in\naccounts receivable was primarily attributable to higher business volume and unfavorable customer payment terms mix.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $114 million, $192 million and $132 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, we used\n$111 million and $191 million, respectively, of cash for capital expenditures.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(270) million, $95 million and $(314) million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2024, we\nrepurchased $254 million of common stock (including $26 million in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations), repaid an aggregate of $22 million of\nlong-term debt and received $6 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock pursuant to stock option exercises. In 2023, we repurchased $107 million of\ncommon stock (including $23 million in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations), repaid an aggregate of $18 million of long-term debt, paid a final\npayment of $9 million in connection with a previous business combination, received $216 million from sale of shares of SIPL to RSBVL and received $8 million\nproceeds from short-term borrowing.\nRevolving Credit Facility. The Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2022, as amended, (the “Credit Agreement”),\nprovides for an $800 million revolving credit facility and a $350 million secured term loan (the “Term Loan Due 2027”), together with an accordion feature by\nwhich we can obtain, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions and commitment of the lenders, additional revolving commitments in an aggregate amount of\nup to $200 million.\nAs of September 28, 2024, no borrowings and $14 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement, under which $786 million was\navailable to borrow. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2023.\nShort-term Borrowing Facilities. We had no short-term borrowings outstanding as of September 28, 2024 and $8 million of short-term borrowings\noutstanding as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries had a total of $71 million of short-term borrowing facilities available, under\nwhich no borrowings were outstanding as of September 28, 2024. Some of these facilities expire at various dates through the second quarter of 2025 and are\nexpected to be renewed.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nDuring 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 4.0 million shares and 1.6 million shares of our common stock for $227 million and $84 million (including\ncommissions), respectively, under stock repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. These programs have no expiration dates and the timing of\nrepurchases will depend upon capital needs to support the growth of our business, market conditions and other factors. Although stock repurchases are intended to\nincrease stockholder value, purchases of shares reduce our liquidity. As a result, the timing of future repurchases depends upon our future capital needs, market\nconditions and other factors. As of September 28, 2024, an aggregate of $53 million remains available under these programs.\n41\nTable of Contents\nWe are party to a Receivables Purchase Agreement (the “RPA”) with certain third-party banking institutions for the sale of accounts receivable generated\nfrom sales to certain customers. The amount available under the RPA is uncommitted and, as such, is available at the discretion of our third-party banking\ninstitutions. Under the Credit Agreement, the percentage of our total accounts receivable that can be sold and outstanding at any time is 50%. Therefore, as of\nSeptember 28, 2024, a maximum of $490 million of sold receivables could be outstanding at any point in time under this program, as amended, as required by our\nCredit Agreement. Accounts receivables sold pursuant to the RPA are serviced by us.\nIn addition to the RPA, we participate in accounts receivable sales programs that have been implemented by certain of our customers, as in effect from time\nto time. We do not service accounts receivable sold under these other programs.\nThe sale of receivables under all of these programs is subject to the approval of the banks or customers involved and there can be no assurance that we will\nbe able to sell the maximum amount of receivables permitted by these programs when desired.\nUnder each of the programs noted above, we sell our entire interest in an accounts receivable for 100% of face value, less a discount. For the years ended\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we sold approximately $1.1 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of accounts receivable under these programs. As of\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, $34 million and $162 million, respectively, of accounts receivable sold under the RPA and subject to servicing by us\nremained outstanding and had not yet been collected. Our sole risk with respect to receivables we service is with respect to commercial disputes regarding such\nreceivables. Commercial disputes include billing errors, returns and similar matters. To date, we have not been required to repurchase any receivable we have sold\ndue to a commercial dispute. Additionally, we are required to remit amounts collected as servicer on a weekly basis to the financial institutions that purchased the\nreceivables. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, $3 million and $33 million, respectively, had been collected but not yet remitted. This amount is\nclassified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe enter into forward interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties to partially hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate benchmark interest rate associated with anticipated variable rate borrowings. See Note 5 “Financial Instruments and\nConcentration of Credit Risk” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for details.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are or may become party to legal proceedings, claims and other contingencies, including environmental, warranty and\nemployee matters and examinations by government agencies. As of September 28, 2024, we had accrued liabilities of $39 million related to such matters. We cannot\naccurately predict the outcome of these matters or the amount or timing of cash flows that may be required to defend ourselves or to settle such matters or that these\nreserves will be sufficient to fully satisfy our contingent liabilities.\nAs of September 28, 2024, we had a liability of $57 million for uncertain tax positions. Our estimate of liabilities for uncertain tax positions is based on a\nnumber of subjective assessments, including the likelihood of a tax obligation being assessed, the amount of taxes (including interest and penalties) that would\nultimately be payable, and our ability to settle any such obligations on favorable terms. Therefore, the amount of future cash flows associated with uncertain tax\npositions may be significantly higher or lower than our recorded liability and we are unable to reliably estimate when cash settlement may occur. It is reasonably\npossible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by approximately $8 million due to payments, the resolution of\naudits and expiration of statutes of limitations. In addition, there could be a corresponding decrease in accrued interest and penalties of approximately $2 million.\nOur liquidity is largely dependent on changes in our working capital, including sales of accounts receivable under our receivables sales programs and the\nextension of trade credit by our suppliers, investments in manufacturing inventory, facilities and equipment, repayments of obligations under outstanding\nindebtedness and repurchases of common stock. In 2024, we generated $340 million of cash from operations. Our primary sources of liquidity as of September 28,\n2024 consisted of (1) cash and cash equivalents of $626 million; (2) our Credit Agreement, under which $786 million, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of\ncredit, was available; (3) our foreign short-term borrowing facilities of $71 million, all of which was available; (4) proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable\nunder our receivables sales programs; and (5) cash generated from operations. Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining additional\ncommitments from existing and/or new lenders, we may increase the revolver commitments under the Credit Agreement by an additional $200 million.\nWe believe our existing cash resources and other sources of liquidity, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working\ncapital requirements through at least the next 12 months. However, should demand for our services decrease significantly over the next 12 months, should we be\nunable to recover on inventory obligations owed to us\n42\nTable of Contents\nby our customers or should we experience significant increases in delinquent or uncollectible accounts receivable for any reason, our cash provided by operations\ncould decrease significantly and we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity to continue our operations at their current level.\nWe invest our cash in numerous financial institutions that we believe to be of high quality. However, there can be no assurance that one or more of such\ninstitutions will not become insolvent in the future, in which case all or a portion of our uninsured funds on deposit with such institutions could be lost.\nAs of September 28, 2024, approximately 34% of our cash balance was held in the United States. Should we choose or need to remit cash to the United\nStates from our foreign locations, we may incur tax obligations which would reduce the amount of cash ultimately available to the United States. We believe that\ncash held in the United States, together with liquidity available under our Credit Agreement and cash from foreign subsidiaries that could be remitted to the United\nStates without tax consequences, will be sufficient to meet our United States liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. SIPL’s cash and cash equivalents balance\nof $200 million as of September 28, 2024 is not available for general corporate purposes and must be retained in SIPL to fund its operations.\nContractual Obligations\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. These obligations impact our\nliquidity and capital resource needs. Our estimated future obligations consist of leases, our Term Loan Due 2027, pension plan funding obligations and unrecognized\ntax benefits as of September 28, 2024.\nA summary of our operating lease obligations as of September 28, 2024 can be found in Note 7 “Leases” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements contained in this report.\nA summary of our long-term debt obligations as of September 28, 2024 can be found in Note 6 “Debt” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\ncontained in this report.\nWe have defined benefit pension plans with an underfunded amount of $39 million as of September 28, 2024. We will be required to provide additional\nfunding to these plans in the future if our returns on plan assets are not sufficient to meet our funding obligations. See Note 15 “Employee Benefit Plans” of the notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.\nThe Company’s long-term liabilities arising from unrecognized tax benefits can be found in Note 10 “Income Tax” of the notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements contained in this report.\nWe also have outstanding firm purchase orders with certain suppliers for the purchase of inventory which are generally short-term in nature. Orders for\nstandard, or catalog, items can typically be canceled with little or no financial penalty. Our policy regarding non-standard or customized items dictates that such\nitems are only ordered specifically for customers who have contractually assumed liability for the inventory, although exceptions are made to this policy in certain\nsituations. Accordingly, our liability from purchase obligations under these purchase orders is not expected to be significant. Lastly, pursuant to arrangements under\nwhich vendors consign inventory to us, we may be required to purchase such inventory after a certain period of time. To date, we have not been required to purchase\na significant amount of inventory pursuant to these time limitations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 28, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC,\nthat have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of\noperations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\n43\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our Term Loan Due 2027, under which $319 million is currently outstanding,\nand borrowings under our revolving credit facility, for which the interest rate we pay is based on a floating index. As of September 28, 2024, we had interest rate\nswaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million that effectively convert our floating rate Term Loan Due 2027 to a fixed rate term loan. An immediate 10\npercent change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations. For more information about our debt and derivative instruments, see\nNote 5 “Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk” and Note 6 “Debt” of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business in foreign currencies. Our foreign exchange policy requires that we take certain steps to limit our foreign exchange exposures resulting\nfrom certain assets and liabilities and forecasted cash flows. However, our policy does not require us to hedge all foreign exchange exposures. Furthermore, our\nforeign currency hedges are based on forecasted transactions and estimated balances, the amount of which may differ from that actually incurred. As a result, we can\nexperience foreign exchange gains and losses in our results of operations.\nWe enter into short-term foreign currency forward contracts to hedge currency exposures associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies such as Indian rupee, Mexican peso and Chinese renminbi. These contracts generally have maturities of up to two months\nand these forward contracts are not designated as part of a hedging relationship for accounting purposes. Accordingly, all outstanding foreign currency forward\ncontracts are marked-to-market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in other expense, in the consolidated statements of income. From\nan economic perspective, the objective of our hedging program is for gains or losses on forward contracts to substantially offset gains and losses on the underlying\nhedged items. As of September 28, 2024, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts to exchange various foreign currencies for U.S. dollars in an\naggregate notional amount of $366 million.\nWe also utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain operational (“cash flow”) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates. Such exposures result from (1) forecasted non-functional currency sales and (2) forecasted non-functional currency materials, labor, overhead and\nother expenses. These contracts may be up to twelve months in duration and are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The effective portion of\nchanges in the fair value of the contracts is recorded in stockholders' equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in\nearnings when the hedged item affects earnings. We had forward contracts related to cash flow hedges in various foreign currencies in an aggregate notional amount\nof $117 million as of September 28, 2024.\nThe net impact of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates would not be material to our consolidated financial statements, provided we accurately\nforecast and estimate our foreign currency exposure. If such forecasts are materially inaccurate, we could incur significant gains or losses.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe information required by this item is included below and incorporated by reference from the financial statement schedule included in “Part IV,\nItem 15(a)(2)” of this report.\n44\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Sanmina Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sanmina Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in\nthe period ended September 28, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively\nreferred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based\non criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September\n28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material\nrespects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the COSO because material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting existed as of that date related to (i) inappropriate tone at the top in the\ncontrol environment at one of the Company’s divisions, specifically division management did not sufficiently promote, monitor or enforce appropriate accounting\npolicies and procedures, thereby resulting in inappropriate and unsupported adjustments to the quarterly contract cost estimate process; (ii) the Company not\nmaintaining a sufficient complement of finance personnel at the division with an appropriate level of expertise, knowledge and training in internal control over\nfinancial reporting commensurate with the Company’s financial reporting requirements; (iii) the division not designing and maintaining effective controls over the\nquarterly contract estimate review process, which led to the failure to timely and appropriately record adjustments to quarterly estimates; and (iv) the Company not\ndesigning and maintaining effective controls to properly support and account for the transfer of control to its customers of certain raw materials inventory.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses referred to above are\ndescribed in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. We considered these material weaknesses in determining\nthe nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in management's report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express\nopinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n45\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii)\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical\naudit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition using the Cost-to-cost Method for Government Contracts in the Defense and Aerospace Division\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues for the CPS segment were $1.5 billion for the year ended September 28, 2024, of\nwhich the defense and aerospace division represents a portion of the segment. The Company recognizes revenue for defense and aerospace government contracts on\nan over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion), which management believes best depicts the\ntransfer of control to the customer. Recognition of revenue on government contracts requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials,\nlabor and subcontractor costs.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition using the cost-to-cost method for government contracts\nin the defense and aerospace division is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated costs for such contracts\nand (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence related to management’s\ndetermination of estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs. Also, as described in the “Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting” section, material weaknesses were identified related to this matter.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the estimation of costs for a sample of defense and aerospace\ngovernment contracts; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the estimate; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\ndetermination of estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s determination of the estimated materials, labor\nand subcontractor costs used involved (i) assessing management’s ability to reasonably estimate costs for government contracts by assessing the nature and status of\ngovernment contracts; (ii) performing retrospective reviews of government contract estimates and changes in estimates over time; and (iii) obtaining evidence to\nsupport estimated costs.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 27, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.\n46\nTable of

Organization of Sanmina\nSanmina Corporation (“Sanmina,” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in 1989. The Company is a leading global provider of integrated\nmanufacturing solutions, components, products and repair, logistics and after-market services. The Company provides these comprehensive solutions primarily to\noriginal equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that serve the industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud\ninfrastructure industries.\nThe Company's operations are managed as two businesses:\n1) Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (“IMS”). IMS is a single operating segment consisting of printed circuit board assembly and test, high-level\nassembly and test and direct-order-fulfillment.\n2) Components, Products and Services (“CPS”). Components include printed circuit boards, backplanes and backplane assemblies, cable assemblies,\nfabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts. Products include optical, radio frequency and microelectronic\ndesign and manufacturing services from the Company’s Advanced Microsystems Technologies division; multi-chip package memory solutions from\nthe Company’s Viking Technology division; high-performance storage platforms for hyperscale and enterprise solutions from the Company’s Viking\nEnterprise Solutions division; defense and aerospace products, design, manufacturing, repair and refurbishment services from the Company’s SCI\nTechnology, Inc. (“SCI”) subsidiary; and cloud-based smart manufacturing execution software from the Company’s 42Q division. Services include\ndesign, engineering, and logistics and repair.\nThe Company's only reportable segment is IMS, which represented approximately 80% of total revenue in 2024. CPS consists of multiple operating\nsegments which do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for being presented as reportable segments. Therefore, financial information for these operating\nsegments is combined and presented in a single category entitled “CPS”. The accounting policies for each segment are the same as those disclosed by the Company\nfor its consolidated financial statements.\nBasis of Presentation\nFiscal Year. The Company operates on a 52 or 53 week year ending on the Saturday nearest September 30. Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were each a 52 week\nyear. All references to years relate to fiscal years unless otherwise noted.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and subsidiaries in\nwhich the Company has a controlling financial interest. All intra-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Noncontrolling interest represents a\nnoncontrolling investor’s interest in the results of operations of subsidiaries that the Company controls and consolidates.\nReclassification. Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements\nand the accompanying notes.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nManagement Estimates and Uncertainties. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles\nin the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of\ncontingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The\nCompany has considered information available to it as of the date of issuance of these financial statements and is not aware of any specific events or circumstances\nthat would require an update to its estimates or judgments, or a revision to the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. Significant estimates made in preparing the\nconsolidated financial statements relate to allowances for accounts receivable; provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, environmental matters, and legal\nexposures; determining liabilities for uncertain tax positions; determining the realizability of deferred tax assets; determining fair values of tangible and intangible\nassets for purposes of impairment tests; and estimating costs expected to be incurred to satisfy performance obligations under long-term contracts and variable\nconsideration related to such contracts. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Actual results could differ\nmaterially from these estimates.\n52\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Instruments. Financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, foreign currency forward contracts,\ninterest rate swap agreements, accounts payable and debt obligations. The fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount as of\nSeptember 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 due to the nature or short maturity of these instruments, or because, in some cases, the instruments are recorded at fair\nvalue on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and investments in highly liquid debt instruments with initial\nmaturities of three months or less.\nAccounts Receivable and Other Related Allowances. The Company had allowances of approximately $7 million and $8 million as of September 28, 2024\nand September 30, 2023, respectively, for uncollectible accounts, product returns and other net sales adjustments. To establish the allowance for doubtful accounts,\nthe Company estimates credit risk associated with accounts receivable by considering the creditworthiness of its customers, past experience, specific facts and\ncircumstances, and the overall economic climate in industries that it serves. To establish the allowance for product returns and other adjustments, the Company\nprimarily utilizes historical data.\nAccounts Receivable Sales. The Company is a party to a Receivables Purchase Agreement (the “RPA”) with certain third-party banking institutions for the\nsale of accounts receivable generated from sales to certain customers, subject to acceptance by, and a funding commitment from, the banks that are party to the RPA.\nAccounts receivable sold pursuant to the RPA are serviced by the Company.\nIn addition to the RPA, the Company has the option to participate in accounts receivable sales programs that have been implemented by certain of the\nCompany’s customers, as in effect from time to time. The Company does not service accounts receivable sold under these other programs. Under each of the\nprograms noted above, the Company sells its entire interest in accounts receivable for 100% of face value, less a discount. Accounts receivable balances sold are\nremoved from the consolidated balance sheets and the related proceeds are reported as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash\nflows.\nInventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (based on standard cost, which approximates first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Cost\nincludes labor, materials and manufacturing overhead.\nProvisions are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. The ultimate realization of inventory carrying\namounts is primarily affected by changes in customer demand. Inventory provisions are established based on forecasted demand, past experience with specific\ncustomers, the age and nature of the inventory, the ability to redistribute inventory to other programs or back to suppliers and whether customers are contractually\nobligated and have the ability to pay for the related inventory. The Company’s raw materials inventories are generally acquired in anticipation of specific customer\norders and pursuant to customer-specific design specifications. When the Company and its customers agree that the quantity of customer-specific inventory is in\nexcess of anticipated demand, the Company will transfer control of those inventories to its customers in exchange for a cash payment. These transactions are\nreported as transfers of non-financial assets – i.e., reported on a net basis in the income statement.\nLong-lived Assets. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or, in the case of property and equipment acquired through business combinations, at fair\nvalue as of the acquisition date. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over 20 to 40 years for buildings and 3 to 15 years for machinery, equipment,\nfurniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the asset.\nThe Company reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\nasset or asset group may not be recoverable. An asset group is the unit of accounting which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\nindependent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. An asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net\ncash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the\namount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. For asset groups for which the primary asset is a building, the Company\nestimates fair value based on data provided by commercial real estate brokers. For other asset groups, the Company estimates fair value based on projected\ndiscounted future net cash flows.\nForeign Currency Translation. For foreign subsidiaries using the local currency as their functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated to U.S.\ndollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expenses are\n53\nTable of Contents\ntranslated at average exchange rates. The effects of these translation adjustments are reported in stockholder’ equity as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (“AOCI”). For all entities, remeasurement adjustments for non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are included in other\nexpense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from long-term intercompany loans denominated in a\ncurrency other than an entity’s functional currency are recorded in AOCI if repayment of the loan is not anticipated in the foreseeable future.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company conducts business on a global basis in numerous currencies and certain of the Company’s\noutstanding debt has a variable interest rate. Therefore, the Company is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company\nuses derivatives, such as foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps, to minimize the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nThe Company accounts for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which requires each\nderivative instrument to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value as either an asset or a liability. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow\nhedge, the Company excludes the change in the fair value of the contract related to the changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward price from\nits assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes these amounts, which are primarily related to time value, in earnings over the life of the derivative instrument.\nGains or losses on the derivative not caused by changes in time value are recorded in AOCI, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which\nthe hedged transaction affects earnings.\nDerivative instruments are entered into for periods of time consistent with the related underlying exposures and are not entered into for speculative\npurposes. At the inception of a hedge, the Company documents all relationships between derivative instruments and related hedged items, as well as its risk-\nmanagement objectives and strategies for the hedging transaction.\nThe Company’s foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps potentially expose the Company to credit risk to the extent the counterparties\nmay be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. The Company minimizes such risk by seeking high quality counterparties.\nLeases. The Company's leases consist of operating leases for buildings and land and have initial lease terms of up to 44 years. Certain of these leases\ncontain an option to extend the lease term for additional periods or to terminate the lease after an initial non-cancelable term. Renewal options are considered in the\nmeasurement of the Company’s initial lease liability and corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset only if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise\nsuch options. Leases with a term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the Company’s balance sheet.\nThe Company’s lease liability and ROU assets represent the present value of future fixed lease payments which are a combination of lease components and\nnon-lease components such as maintenance and utilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of the\nCompany’s lease payments are variable because such payments adjust periodically based on changes in consumer price and other indexes. Variable payments are\nexpensed as incurred and not included in the measurement of lease liabilities and ROU assets. Since the Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate,\nthe Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date for purposes of determining the present value of\nlease payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is based on the term of the lease, the economic environment of the lease and the effect of\ncollateralization, if any.\nRevenue Recognition. The Company derives revenue principally from sales of integrated manufacturing solutions, components and Company-proprietary\nproducts. Other sources of revenue include logistics and repair services; design, development and engineering services; defense and aerospace programs; and sales of\nraw materials to customers whose requirements change after the Company has procured inventory to fulfill the customer’s forecasted demand.\nThe Company determines the appropriate revenue to recognize as described in ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) by\napplying a 5-step model: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4)\nallocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nEach of these steps may involve the use of significant judgments, as discussed below.\nStep 1 - Identify the contract with a customer\nThe Company generally enters into a master supply agreement (“MSA”) with its customers that provides the framework under which business will be\nconducted, and pursuant to which a customer will issue purchase orders or other\n54\nTable of Contents\nbinding documents to specify the quantity, price and delivery requirements for products or services the customer wishes to purchase. The Company generally\nconsiders its contract with a customer to be a firm commitment, consisting of the combination of an MSA and a purchase order or any other similar binding\ndocument.\nStep 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract\nA performance obligation is a promised good or service that is material in the context of the contract and is both capable of being distinct (customer can\nbenefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources) and distinct within the context of the contract (separately identifiable\nfrom other promises). The Company reviews its contracts to identify promised goods or services and then evaluates such items to determine which of those items are\nperformance obligations. The majority of the Company’s contracts have a single performance obligation since the promise to transfer an individual good or service is\nnot separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Company’s performance obligations generally have an expected duration of one year or less.\nStep 3 - Determine the transaction price\nContracts with customers may include certain forms of variable consideration such as early payment discounts, volume discounts and shared cost savings.\nThe Company includes an estimate of variable consideration when determining the transaction price and the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized. This\nestimate is limited to an amount which will not result in a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. Factors considered in the Company’s estimate of variable\nconsideration are the potential amount subject to these contract provisions, historical experience and other relevant facts and circumstances.\nStep 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nA contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is\nsatisfied. In the event that more than one performance obligation is identified in a contract, a portion of the transaction price is allocated to each performance\nobligation. This allocation would generally be based on the relative standalone price of each performance obligation, which most often would represent the price at\nwhich the Company would sell similar goods or services separately.\nStep 5 - Recognize revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied\nThe Company is required to assess whether control of a product or services promised under a contract is transferred to the customer at a point-in-time or\nover time as the product is being manufactured or the services are being provided. If the criteria in ASC 606, for recognizing revenue on an over time basis are not\nmet, revenue must be recognized at the point-in-time determined by the Company at which its customer obtains control of a product or service.\nThe Company recognizes revenue for the majority of its contracts on an over time basis. This is primarily due to the fact that the Company does not have an\nalternative use for the end products it manufactures for its customers and has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit, for work in progress\nupon a customer’s cancellation of a contract for convenience. In certain circumstances, the Company recognizes over time because its customer simultaneously\nreceives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company’s services or the Company’s customer controls the end product as the Company performs\nmanufacturing services (continuous transfer of control). For these contracts, revenue is recognized on an over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs\nincurred to date to total estimated costs at completion) which the Company believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. At least 95% of the\nCompany’s revenue is recognized on an over time basis, which is as products are manufactured or services are performed. Because of this, and the fact that there is\nno work in process or finished goods inventory associated with contracts for which revenue is recognized on an over-time basis, 99% or more of the Company’s\ninventory at the end of a given period is in the form of raw materials. For contracts for which revenue is required to be recognized at a point in time, the Company\nrecognizes revenue when it has transferred control of the related goods, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of the goods to the customer.\nIn our Defense and Aerospace division, we apply the cost-to-cost method for government contracts which requires the use of significant judgments with\nrespect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs included in the total estimated costs at completion. Additionally, the Company evaluates whether\ncontract modifications for claims have been approved and, if so, estimates the amount, if any, of variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price\nof the contract.\nEstimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs expected to be incurred to satisfy a performance obligation are updated on a quarterly basis. These\nestimates consider costs incurred to date and estimated costs to be incurred over the\n55\nTable of Contents\nremaining expected period of performance to satisfy a performance obligation. There is inherent uncertainty in estimating the amount of costs that will be required to\ncomplete a contract. Factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in estimates include, among others, (1) the long-term duration of contracts, (2) the highly-\ncomplex nature of the products we manufacture, (3) the readiness of our customer’s design for manufacturing, (4) the cost and availability of purchased materials,\n(5) labor cost, availability and productivity, (6) subcontractor performance and (7) the risk of delayed performance/completion. Therefore, such estimates are\nreviewed each quarter by a group of employees that includes representatives from numerous functions such as engineering, materials, contracts, manufacturing,\nprogram management, finance and senior management. If a change in estimate is deemed necessary, the impact of the change is recognized in the period of change.\nAdditionally, contract modifications for claims are assessed each quarter to determine whether the claims have been approved. If it is determined that a claim has\nbeen approved, the amount of the claim, if any, that can be included in transaction price is estimated considering a number of factors such as the length of time\nexpected to lapse until uncertainty about the claim has been resolved and the extent to which our experience with claims for similar contracts has predictive value.\nContract Assets\nA contract asset is recognized when the Company has recognized revenue, but has not issued an invoice to its customer for payment. Contract assets are\nclassified separately on the consolidated balance sheets and transferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional. Because of the\nCompany’s short manufacturing cycle times, the transfer from contract assets to accounts receivable generally occurs within the next fiscal quarter.\nOther\nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the\nCompany from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control of a product has transferred to a\ncustomer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales.\nThe Company applies the following practical expedients or policy elections under ASC 606:\n• The promised amount of consideration under a contract is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component because, at inception of a\ncontract, the Company expects the period between when a good or service is transferred to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or\nservice will generally be one year or less.\n• The Company has elected to not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or\nless, which is substantially all of the Company’s remaining performance obligations.\n• Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are not capitalized if the period over which such costs would be amortized to expense is less than one year.\nStock-based Compensation. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the\nrequisite service period of the award, which generally ranges from one year to four years and/or upon achievement of specified performance criteria. Stock-based\ncompensation expense for time-based and performance-based restricted stock awards is valued at the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the\ndate of grant. During the requisite service period, performance-based restricted stock awards are monitored by management for probability of achievement of\nperformance goals and if it becomes probable that the number of awarded shares that will vest is greater than or less than the previous estimate of the number of\nawarded shares that will vest, an adjustment to stock-based compensation expense will be recognized as a change in accounting estimate. The Company recognizes\nstock-based compensation expense for market-based restricted stock units measured at fair value on the grant date using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The stock-\nbased compensation expense for awards with market conditions will be recognized over the requisite service periods regardless of whether the market conditions are\nsatisfied.\nIncome taxes. The Company estimates its income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates, including estimating exposures\nand making judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable\nto differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit\ncarryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary\ndifferences are expected to be recovered or settled. The carrying value of the Company’s net deferred tax assets is based on the Company’s belief that it is more\nlikely than not that the Company will generate sufficient future\n56\nTable of Contents\ntaxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that do not meet the\n“more likely than not” criteria discussed above.\nThe Company’s tax rate is dependent upon the geographic distribution of its worldwide income or losses, the tax regulations and tax holidays in each\ngeographic region, the availability of tax credits and carryforwards, including net operating losses, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies.\nThe Company makes an assessment of whether each income tax position is “more likely than not” of being sustained on audit, including resolution of\nrelated appeals or litigation, if any. For each income tax position that meets the “more likely than not” recognition threshold, the Company then assesses the largest\namount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon effective settlement with the tax authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized\ntax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting\n(Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which will require the Company to disclose information about its reportable segment’s significant\nexpenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. The disclosure requirements are effective for the Company in fiscal 2025, and for interim periods\nwithin the Company's fiscal 2026, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2023-07 will have on its financial statement\ndisclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which will require the Company,\non an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in its effective income tax rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated\nby jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company in fiscal 2026, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2023-\n09 will have on its financial statement disclosures.\nNote 3.

Therefore, it is impracticable for the Company to provide revenue from external customers for each product and service it\nprovides.\nChanges in the Company’s estimates of transaction price and/or costs to complete result in a favorable or unfavorable impact to revenue and operating\nincome. The impact of changes in estimates on revenue and operating income resulting from the application of the cost-to-cost method for recognizing revenue\nwas as follows:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022\nRevenue: (In thousands)\nFavorable $ 12,220 $ 6,023 $ 5,403\nUnfavorable (2,697) (2,556) (162)\nTotal $ 9,523 $ 3,467 $ 5,241\nYear Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022\nOperating Income: (In thousands)\nFavorable $ 21,229 $ 8,657 $ 7,025\nUnfavorable (16,102) (44,838) (20,737)\nTotal $ 5,127 $ (36,181) $ (13,712)\nNote 5. Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk\nFair Value Measurements\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of cash equivalents (representing 23% of cash and cash equivalents), accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate\ncarrying value due to the short-term duration of these instruments. Additionally, the fair value of variable rate long-term debt approximates carrying value as of\nSeptember 28, 2024. The Company’s cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company’s primary financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are deferred compensation plan assets and\ndefined benefit plan assets, which are both measured using Level 1 inputs. See Note 15 “Employee Benefit Plans”. Other financial assets and financial liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis include foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, which are both measured using Level 2 inputs. Interest rate\nswaps are valued based on a discounted cash flow analysis that incorporates observable (Level 2) market inputs such as interest rate yield curves and credit spreads.\nFor currency contracts, Level 2 inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates and interest rates at commonly quoted intervals. Foreign exchange contracts\nwere not material as of September 28, 2024 or September 30, 2023.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nOther non-financial assets, such as goodwill and other long-lived assets, are measured at fair value as of the date such assets are acquired or in the period an\nimpairment is recorded.\n59\nTable of Contents\nOffsetting Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company has entered into master netting arrangements with each of its derivative counterparties that allows net settlement of derivative assets and\nliabilities under certain conditions, such as multiple transactions with the same currency maturing on the same date. The Company presents its derivative assets\nand derivative liabilities on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents the location and fair values of derivative financial instruments included in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of\nSeptember 28, September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nDerivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges:\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets $ 2,277 $ 6,179\nOther assets $ 21 $ 6,351\nAccrued liabilities $ 53 $ 213\nOther $ 1,771 $ —\nDerivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges:\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets $ 3,229 $ 1,164\nAccrued liabilities $ 2,265 $ 4,685\nDerivative Instruments\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to certain risks related to its ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is foreign\ncurrency exchange risk.\nForward contracts on various foreign currencies are used to manage foreign currency risk associated with forecasted foreign currency transactions and\ncertain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. The Company’s primary foreign currency cash flows are in India, Mexico and\nChina.\nThe Company had the following outstanding foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures:\nAs of\nSeptember 28, September 30,\n2024 2023\nDerivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges:\nNotional amount (in thousands) $ 117,015 $ 125,758\nNumber of contracts 47 50\nDerivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges:\nNotional amount (in thousands) $ 366,425 $ 338,283\nNumber of contracts 38 42\nThe Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain operational (“cash flow”) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates. Such exposures generally result from (1) forecasted non-functional currency sales and (2) forecasted non-functional currency materials, labor,\noverhead and other expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are generally one to two months in duration but, by\npolicy, may be up to twelve months in duration. The amount of gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income on derivative instruments and the amount of\ngain or loss reclassified from AOCI into income were not material for any period presented herein and is included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated\nstatements of income.\n60\nTable of Contents\nThe Company enters into short-term foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures associated with certain monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. These contracts have maturities of up to two months and are not designated as accounting hedges. Accordingly,\nthese contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each period with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other expense, in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe amount of gains or losses associated with these forward contracts was not material for any period presented herein. From an economic perspective, the objective\nof the Company’s hedging program is for gains and losses on forward contracts to substantially offset gains and losses on the underlying hedged items. In addition to\nthe contracts disclosed in the table above, the Company has numerous contracts that have been closed from an economic and financial accounting perspective and\nwill settle early in the first month of the following quarter. Since these offsetting contracts do not expose the Company to risk of fluctuations in exchange rates, these\ncontracts have been excluded from the above table.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company enters into forward interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties to partially hedge the variability in cash flows due to\nchanges in Secured Overnight Financing Rate benchmark interest rate (“SOFR”) associated with anticipated variable rate borrowings. These interest rate swaps have\na maturity date of September 27, 2027 and effectively convert a portion of the Company’s variable interest rate obligations to fixed interest rate obligations. These\nswaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million\nand $650 million were outstanding as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The aggregate effective interest rate of these swaps as of\nSeptember 28, 2024 was approximately 4.7%.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, foreign\ncurrency forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with recognized financial institutions, both\ndomestic and foreign. Cash and cash equivalents may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits, but may generally be redeemed upon demand.\nPeriodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions are performed and the Company attempts to limit its exposure with any one institution.\nOne of the Company’s most significant credit risks is the ultimate realization of accounts receivable. This risk is mitigated by ongoing credit evaluations of, and\nfrequent contact with, the Company’s customers, especially its most significant customers, thus enabling it to monitor changes in business operations and respond\naccordingly. The Company generally does not require collateral for sales on credit. The Company considers these concentrations of credit risks when estimating its\nallowance for doubtful accounts. Foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps are maintained with high quality counterparties to reduce the Company’s\ncredit risk and are recorded on the Company’s balance sheets at fair value.\nSales to the Company’s ten largest customers represented 47% of net sales in 2024. Net sales from these customers are derived from multiple segments. The\nfollowing table presents the percentage of total net sales to each significant customer that represented 10% or more of the Company’s net sales.\nYear Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022\nNokia:\nIMS * 12.6 % 13.6 %\nCPS * 0.6 % 1.0 %\nTotal * 13.2 % 14.6 %\nMotorola:\nIMS 9.9 % * 10.1 %\nCPS 0.2 % * 0.2 %\nTotal 10.1 % * 10.3 %\n* Less than 10% of the Company’s net sales.\nNokia represented 10% or more of the Company’s gross accounts receivable as of September 28, 2024. No customer represented 10% or more of the\nCompany’s gross accounts receivable as of September 30, 2023.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNote 6. Debt\nLong-term debt consisted of the following:\nAs of\nSeptember 28, September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nTerm Loan Due 2027, net of issuance costs $ 317,323 $ 329,827\nLess: Current portion of Term Loan Due 2027 17,500 17,500\nLong-term debt $ 299,823 $ 312,327\nTerm Loan Due 2027 maturities by fiscal year are as follows:\nAs of\nSeptember 28,\n2024\n(In thousands)\n2025 $ 17,500\n2026 21,875\n2027 280,000\n$ 319,375\nOn September 27, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that\nprovides for a $800 million revolving credit facility and a $350 million secured term loan (“Term Loan Due 2027”). Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,\nincluding obtaining additional commitments from existing and/or new lenders, the Company may increase the revolving commitment up to an additional\n$200 million. Costs incurred in connection with Credit Agreement of $3 million are classified as long-term debt and are being amortized to interest expense over the\nlife of the Term Loan Due 2027 using the effective interest method.\nThe Term Loan Due 2027 was fully drawn on the Closing Date and the proceeds were used to repay the term loan issued under the Company’s prior credit\nagreement. Upon repayment, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1 million consisting of a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs\nunder such prior agreement.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either the SOFR or a base rate, in each case plus a spread determined based on\nthe Company’s credit rating. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to base rate loans and at the end of an interest period (and at three\nmonth intervals if the interest period exceeds three months) in the case of SOFR loans. The outstanding principal amount of all loans under the Credit Agreement,\nincluding the Term Loan Due 2027, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is due on September 27, 2027. The Company is required to repay a portion of the\nprincipal amount of the Term Loan Due 2027 equal to 1.25% of the principal in quarterly installments.\nCertain of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries are guarantors in respect of the Credit Agreement. The Company and the subsidiary guarantors’ obligations\nunder the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of their respective assets (excluding real property), including cash, accounts receivable and the\nshares of certain Company subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nAs of September 28, 2024, no borrowings and $14 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement, under which $786 million was\navailable to borrow. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2023.\nShort-term Borrowing Facilities\nCertain foreign subsidiaries of the Company had a total of $71 million of short-term borrowing facilities available, under which no borrowings were\noutstanding as of September 28, 2024. Some of these facilities expire at various dates through the second quarter of 2025 and are expected to be renewed.\nThe Company had $8 million of short-term borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and no short-term borrowings outstanding as of\nSeptember 28, 2024.\n62\nTable of Contents\nDebt Covenants\nThe Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, namely a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum\ninterest coverage ratio, in both cases measured on the basis of a trailing 12-month look-back period. In addition, the Company's debt agreements contain a number of\nrestrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making investments and other restricted payments, selling assets and paying dividends,\nsubject to certain exceptions. Finally, the agreements also include covenants that require us to file quarterly and annual financial statements with the SEC on a timely\nbasis. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of September 28, 2024.\nNote 7.

Accounts Receivable Sale Program\nUnder the sale of accounts receivable programs, the Company sells its entire interest in an accounts receivable for 100% of face value, less a discount. For\nthe years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company sold approximately $1.1 billion and approximately $2.6 billion, respectively, of accounts\nreceivable under these programs. Upon sale, these receivables are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and cash received is presented as cash provided by\noperating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Discounts on sold receivables were $8 million and $19 million for the years ended September 28,\n2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and were recorded in other expense, in the consolidated statements of income. As of September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023, $34 million and $162 million, respectively, of accounts receivable sold under the RPA and subject to servicing by the Company remained\noutstanding and had not yet been collected. The Company’s sole risk with respect to receivables it services is with respect to commercial disputes regarding such\nreceivables. Commercial disputes include billing errors, returns and similar matters. To date, the Company has not been required to repurchase any receivable it has\nsold due to a commercial dispute. Additionally, the Company is required to remit amounts collected as a servicer under the RPA on a weekly basis to the financial\ninstitutions that purchased the receivables. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, $3 million and $33 million, respectively, had been collected but not\nyet remitted. This amount is classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 9. Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is a party to litigation, claims and other contingencies, including environmental, regulatory and employee matters and\nexaminations and investigations by governmental agencies, which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a contingent liability when it is\nprobable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, or other applicable\naccounting standards. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had reserves of $39 million and $34 million, respectively, for environmental\nmatters, warranty, litigation and other contingencies (excluding reserves for uncertain tax positions), which the Company believes are adequate. However, there can\nbe no assurance that the Company’s reserves will be sufficient to settle these contingencies. Such reserves are included in accrued liabilities and other long-term\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLegal Proceedings\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and administrative orders concerning environmental protection,\nincluding those addressing the discharge of pollutants into the environment, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the cleanup of contaminated\nsites, the materials used in products, and the recycling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste.\nIn June 2008, the Company was named by the Orange County Water District in a suit alleging that a predecessor company’s actions at a plant the Company\nsold in 1998 contributed to polluted groundwater managed by the plaintiff. The complaint seeks recovery of compensatory and other damages, as well as declaratory\nrelief, for the payment of costs necessary to investigate, monitor, remediate, abate and contain contamination of groundwater. In April 2013, all claims against the\nCompany were dismissed. The plaintiff appealed this dismissal and the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment in August 2017, remanding the case back to the\nSuperior Court of California for trial. The trial against the Company and several other defendants commenced in April 2021 and the submission of evidence\nconcluded in May 2022. On April 3, 2023, the court published a statement of decision finding the Company and other remaining defendants liable for certain past\ninvestigation costs incurred by the plaintiff. Subsequent proceedings to assess the Company’s and other defendants’ liability for the plaintiff’s future remediation and\nother costs, including attorneys’ fees, were expected. However, without admitting any liability, in August 2024, the Company and plaintiff agreed to settle this matter\nand all pending litigation in exchange for the Company’s payment to the plaintiff of $3 million.\n64\nTable of Contents\nOther Matters\nIn December 2019, the Company sued a former customer, Dialight plc (“Dialight”), in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork to collect unpaid accounts receivable and net obsolete inventory obligations now totaling $9 million (exclusive of interest and attorneys’ fees). On the same day\nthe Company filed its suit, Dialight commenced its own action in the same court. Dialight alleged that the Company fraudulently misrepresented its capabilities to\ninduce Dialight to enter into a Manufacturing Services Agreement (“MSA”) and then allegedly committed multiple, willful breaches of contract when performing\nunder the MSA. A trial took place in September 2024 and the jury awarded the Company $9 million on its claims and rejected Dialight’s claims for fraudulent\ninducement and willful breach of contract and awarded Dialight $1 million for breach of contract. The parties filed post-trial motions in October 2024, including a\nmotion by the Company for prejudgment interest and its costs and expenses of the suit, and a motion by Dialight for pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, its\ncosts and expenses of the suit and for a new trial. A decision resolving these motions is expected in the first calendar quarter of 2025. The Company will continue to\nprosecute vigorously its claims against Dialight and, ultimately, to defend on appeal and enforce any resulting judgment.\nIn May 2023, Sanmina Corporation and its SCI Technology, Inc. subsidiary (“SCI”) received Civil Investigative Demands (“CIDs”) from the United States\nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”) pursuant to the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”). The stated purpose of the CIDs—a form of subpoena requiring responses to written\ninterrogatories and the production of documents relating to certain contracts, projects, proposals and business activities of SCI going back to 2010—is to determine\nwhether there is or has been a violation of the FCA with respect to the provision of products and services to the government. These CIDs supplement several CIDs\nrelating to the same subject matter served upon SCI and certain current and former SCI and Sanmina Corporation employees beginning in August 2020, pursuant to\nwhich SCI produced documents and information and certain of the current and former employees provided oral testimony. Sanmina and SCI cooperated with the\nDOJ investigation. On May 13, 2024, the Company learned that United States of America ex rel. Carl R. Eckert v. SCI Technology, Inc. et al. (the “Eckert Qui Tam\nSuit”) had been filed under seal in June 2020, and is now unsealed. On May 13, 2024, the Company also learned that the DOJ had filed a notice in the Eckert Qui\nTam Suit stating that, while its investigation would continue, it was declining to intervene at the current time. The Eckert Qui Tam Suit, filed by a former SCI\nemployee, alleges on behalf of the United States, 16 FCA counts that relate substantially to the same contracts and issues that the DOJ has investigated over the past\nfour years, including making false certifications under the Truth in Negotiations Act and Cost Accounting Standards, submitting false cost and pricing data,\nfraudulently inducing the government to award contracts and violations of the Service Contract Act. The complaint alleges such claimed violations defrauded the\ngovernment in an amount approximating $100 million. The complaint seeks, on behalf of the government, treble damages, civil penalties and interest payable\nthereon. On October 7, 2024, Sanmina and SCI filed a motion to dismiss the Eckert Qui Tam Suit. A decision on the motion is expected in the first half of calendar\n2025. Sanmina Corporation and SCI intend to defend vigorously against the claims made in the Eckert Qui Tam Suit. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate\noutcome of the Eckert Qui Tam Suit, although a loss is currently not considered to be probable or estimable.\nOn November 14, 2023, employee Gerardo Ramirez, filed two lawsuits against the Company in the Alameda County Superior Court (together, the “Ramirez\nCases”). The first, a putative class action, alleges violations of various California Labor Code and Wage Order requirements, including provisions governing\novertime, meal and rest periods, minimum wage requirements, payment of wages during employment, wage statements, payroll records, and reimbursement of\nbusiness expenses. The class action complaint seeks certification of a class of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company within the\nState of California at any time between March 1, 2021 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution, attorneys’ fees, pre-judgment\ninterest, and costs of suit. The second action, a complaint under California’s Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”), alleges substantially similar violations\nand a violation of the provision governing payment of final wages and seeks penalties individually and on behalf of the State of California and other “aggrieved\nemployees,” along with attorneys’ fees and costs. On May 16, 2024 and June 14, 2024, former employee Carlos Lobatos filed class and PAGA actions in the Santa\nClara County Superior Court (the “Lobatos Cases”) alleging violations substantially similar to the violations in the Ramirez Cases, and, in the case of the Lobatos\nPAGA action, additional violations related to sick leave, suitable rest facilities, seating, failure to retain and provide employment and payroll records, reporting time\npay, day of rest rules, payroll deductions, paid time off, and various unlawful employment practices. The Lobatos class action complaint seeks certification of a class\nof all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company (directly or via a staffing agency) within the State of California at any time between\nMay 16, 2020 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution, attorneys’ fees, pre-judgment interest, and costs of suit. On August 12, 2024,\nformer employee Mando Gomez filed a class and PAGA action in the Alameda County Superior Court (the “Gomez Case”) alleging violations substantially similar\nto the violations in the Ramirez Cases. The Gomez Case seeks certification of a class of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company\n(directly or via a staffing agency) within the State of California at any time between August 12, 2020 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties,\nrestitution,\n65\nTable of Contents\nattorneys’ fees, pre-judgment interest, and costs of suit. On September 20, 2024, former employee Frank J. Leon Guerrero filed a class action in the Alameda County\nSuperior Court (the “Guerrero Case”) alleging violations substantially similar to the violations in the Ramirez Cases. The Guerrero Case seeks certification of several\nclasses comprised of all current and former non-exempt employees who worked for the Company (directly or via a staffing agency) within the State of California at\nany time between September 20, 2020 and final judgment, as well as unspecified damages, penalties, restitution, attorneys’ fees, pre- and post-judgment interest, and\ncosts of suit. The Company expects the Lobatos Cases, the Gomez Case, and the Guerrero Case to be related to or consolidated with the Ramirez Cases and intends\nto defend all such cases vigorously.\nFor each of the pending matters noted above, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss at this time.\nIn addition, from time to time, the Company may become involved in routine legal proceedings, demands, claims, threatened litigation and regulatory\ninquiries and investigations that arise in the normal course of our business. The Company records liabilities for such matters when a loss becomes probable and the\namount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s results of operations and financial condition.\nNote 10. Income Taxes\nDomestic and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nDomestic $ 131,930 $ 157,548 $ 145,671\nForeign 185,605 255,259 156,649\nTotal $ 317,535 $ 412,807 $ 302,320\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nFederal:\nCurrent $ 1,814 $ 362 $ 1,070\nDeferred 23,581 36,431 25,399\nState:\nCurrent 2,888 3,188 1,711\nDeferred 3,048 3,329 3,081\nForeign:\nCurrent 44,816 53,346 31,241\nDeferred 3,637 (11,362) (566)\nTotal provision for income taxes $ 79,784 $ 85,294 $ 61,936\nThe Company's provision for income taxes for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $80 million (25% of income before taxes), $85 million (21% of income before\ntaxes) and $62 million (20% of income before taxes), respectively.\nThe effective tax rate for 2024 was higher than the expected U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at rates higher than the U.S.\nstatutory rate, state taxes, and unfavorable permanent differences. The effective tax rates for 2023 and 2022 were lower than the expected U.S. statutory rate of 21%\nprimarily due to a $12 million and $16 million tax benefit, respectively, resulting from the release of certain foreign tax reserves due to lapse of time and expiration\nof statutes of limitations.\n66\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the sale of shares of Sanmina SCI India Private Limited (“SIPL”) to Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited (\"RSBVL\") on\nOctober 3, 2022, the Company recognized tax expense of $6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, which was allocated to additional paid-in-capital. See\nNote 16 \"Strategic Transactions\".\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nAs of\nSeptember 28, September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nDeferred tax assets:\nU.S. net operating loss carryforwards $ 15,600 $ 51,741\nForeign net operating loss carryforwards 111,332 109,089\nIntangibles 14,268 17,921\nAccruals not currently deductible 45,515 43,831\nProperty, plant and equipment 25,945 28,932\nTax credit carryforwards 23,086 20,235\nReserves not currently deductible 17,332 23,341\nStock compensation expense 6,725 6,049\nFederal benefit of foreign operations 25,679 22,486\nCapitalized research and development 13,630 4,965\nLease deferred tax asset 17,802 16,987\nOther 13,822 2,720\nValuation allowance (121,035) (116,075)\nTotal deferred tax assets 209,701 232,222\nDeferred tax liabilities on undistributed earnings (21,414) (14,775)\nDeferred tax liabilities on branch operations (23,473) (24,001)\nRevenue recognition — (1,874)\nLease deferred tax liability (17,510) (16,671)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 147,304 $ 174,901\nRecorded as:\nDeferred tax assets $ 160,703 $ 177,597\nDeferred tax liabilities (13,399) (2,696)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 147,304 $ 174,901\nA valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information and other factors, it is more likely than not that all or a\nportion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company regularly assesses its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets on a jurisdiction-by-\njurisdiction basis. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of temporary differences, projected future taxable\nincome, tax planning strategies and recent financial results. Significant judgment is required in assessing the Company’s ability to generate revenue, gross profit,\noperating income and jurisdictional taxable income in future periods. The Company’s valuation allowance as of September 28, 2024 relates primarily to foreign net\noperating losses, except for $13 million related to U.S. state net operating losses.\nThe Company provides deferred tax liabilities for the tax consequences associated with the undistributed earnings that are expected to be repatriated to the\nsubsidiaries' parent unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. As of September 28, 2024, income taxes and foreign withholding taxes\nhave not been provided for approximately $438 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of several non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company intends to reinvest these\nearnings indefinitely in operations outside of the U.S. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these undistributed earnings is not\npracticable.\n67\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company has cumulative net operating loss carryforwards for state and foreign tax purposes of $255 million and $446\nmillion, respectively, and none for federal tax. The state net operating loss carryforwards begin expiring in fiscal year 2025 and expire at various dates through\nSeptember 26, 2043. Certain foreign net operating losses will begin expiring in 2025. However, the majority of foreign net operating losses carryforward indefinitely.\nAs of September 28, 2024, the Company has federal tax credits of $22 million that expire between 2031 and 2044. There are certain restrictions on the utilization of\nnet operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an “ownership change” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. The utilization of certain net\noperating losses may be restricted due to changes in ownership and business operations.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of the statutory federal tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022\nFederal tax at statutory tax rate 21.00 % 21.00 % 21.00 %\nEffect of foreign operations 2.15 0.81 3.52\nPermanent items 1.87 0.96 0.08\nFederal credits (0.98) (0.57) (0.73)\nOther (0.20) 0.06 0.59\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit 2.24 1.43 1.60\nRelease of foreign tax reserves (0.95) (3.03) (5.57)\nEffective tax rate 25.13 % 20.66 % 20.49 %\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued penalties and interest, is as follows:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nBalance, beginning of year $ 44,707 $ 53,552 $ 67,781\nIncrease (decrease) related to prior year tax positions 3,480 (331) (4,456)\nIncrease related to current year tax positions 2,500 2,040 7,154\nSettlements — (1,911) (7,596)\nDecrease related to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations (2,144) (8,643) (9,331)\nBalance, end of year $ 48,543 $ 44,707 $ 53,552\nThe Company had reserves of $8 million as of each of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 for the payment of interest and penalties relating to\nunrecognized tax benefits. During 2024, the Company recognized an income tax benefit for interest and penalties of $1 million due to lapse of time and expiration of\nstatutes of limitations compared to an income tax benefit of $4 million in 2023. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized\ntax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Should the Company be able to ultimately recognize all of these uncertain tax positions, it would result in a\nbenefit to net income of $36 million in 2024.\nThe Company conducts business globally and, as a result, files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign\njurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world.\nAs a result of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for fiscal 2008 through 2010, the Company received a Revenue Agent’s Report (“RAR”) on\nNovember 17, 2023 asserting an underpayment of tax of approximately $8 million for fiscal 2009. The asserted underpayment results from the IRS’s proposed\ndisallowance of a $503 million worthless stock deduction in fiscal 2009. Such disallowance, if upheld, would reduce the Company’s available net operating loss\ncarryforwards and result in additional tax and interest attributable to fiscal 2021 and later years, which could be material. The Company disagrees with the IRS’s\nposition as asserted in the RAR and is vigorously contesting this matter through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. The\nCompany does not expect resolution of this matter within twelve months and cannot predict with any certainty the timing of such resolution. Although the final\nresolution of this matter remains\n68\nTable of Contents\nuncertain, the Company continues to believe that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax position will be sustained. However, an unfavorable resolution of this\nmatter could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nAdditionally, the Company is being audited by various state tax agencies and certain foreign countries. To the extent the final tax liabilities are different\nfrom the amounts accrued, the increases or decreases would be recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of income. Although the\nCompany believes that the resolution of these audits will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, the outcome is subject to\nuncertainty.\nIn general, the Company is no longer subject to United States federal or state income tax examinations for years before 2003, and to foreign examinations\nfor years prior to 2006 in its major foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next\ntwelve months by approximately $8 million related to payments, the resolution of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations. In addition, there could be a\ncorresponding decrease in accrued interest and penalties of approximately $2 million.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), an international association of 38 countries including the United States, has\nproposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, namely, its Pillar Two framework, which imposes a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. Various\ncountries have enacted or have announced plans to enact new tax laws to implement the global minimum tax and where enacted, the rules begin to be effective for\nthe Company in fiscal 2025. The Pillar Two rules are considered an alternative minimum tax and therefore deferred taxes would not be recognized or adjusted for the\nestimated effects of the future minimum tax. The adoption and effective dates of these rules may vary by country and could increase tax complexity and uncertainty\nand may adversely affect the Company’s provision for income taxes. The Company does not expect any material impact from these tax law changes in fiscal 2025.\nNote 11. Earnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number\nof shares of common stock outstanding during the period, as follows:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 28, September 30, October 1,\n2024 2023 2022\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nNumerator:\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 222,536 $ 309,970 $ 240,384\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 55,592 57,847 61,310\nEffect of dilutive stock options and restricted stock units 1,378 1,968 1,807\nDenominator for diluted earnings per share 56,970 59,815 63,117\nNet income attributable to common shareholders per share:\nBasic $ 4.00 $ 5.36 $ 3.92\nDiluted $ 3.91 $ 5.18 $ 3.81\nWeighted-average dilutive securities that were excluded from the above calculation because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect under\nASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, due to application of the treasury stock method were not material for any period presented.\n69\nTable of Contents\nNote 12. Stockholders' Equity\nThe Company's 2009 Stock Plan (“2009 Plan”) expired as to future grants on January 26, 2019. Although the 2009 Plan expired, it will continue to govern\nall awards granted under it prior to its expiration date. On March 11, 2019, the Company's stockholders approved the Company’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019\nPlan”) and the reservation of 4 million shares of common stock for issuance thereunder, plus any shares subject to stock options or similar awards granted under the\n2009 Plan that expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full and shares issued pursuant to awards granted that are forfeited by the Company.\nAs of September 28, 2024, an aggregate of 5 million shares were authorized for future issuance under the Company’s stock plans, of which 3 million of\nsuch shares were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and delivery of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units and 2 million shares of common stock\nwere available for future grant. Awards other than stock options reduce common stock available for grant by 1.36 shares for every share of common stock subject to\nsuch an award. Awards under the 2019 Plan and 2009 Plan that expire or are cancelled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the\n2019 Plan. The 2019 Plan will expire as to future grants in December 2028.\nStock Repurchase Program\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased 4.0 million shares, 1.6 million shares and 8.0 million shares of its common stock for $227 million,\n$84 million and $317 million (including commissions), respectively, under stock repurchase programs authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors. These\nprograms have no expiration dates and the timing of repurchases will depend upon capital needs to support the growth of the Company’s business, market conditions\nand other factors. Although stock repurchases are intended to increase stockholder value, they also reduce the Company’s liquidity. As of September 28, 2024, an\naggregate of $53 million remains available under these programs.\nIn addition to the repurchases discussed above, the Company withheld 0.5 million, 0.4 million and 0.4 million shares of its common stock during 2024,\n2023, and 2022, respectively, in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. The Company paid $26 million,\n$23 million and $14 million, respectively, to applicable tax authorities in connection with these repurchases.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nAccumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax as applicable, consisted of the following:\nAs of\nSeptember 28, September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nForeign currency translation adjustments $ 73,236 $ 68,305\nUnrealized holding gain on derivative financial instruments 266 9,427\nUnrecognized net actuarial loss and unrecognized transition cost for benefit plans (6,761) (6,853)\nTotal $ 66,741 $ 70,879\nUnrealized holding gain (loss) on derivative financial instruments includes gains or losses from interest rate swap agreements with independent\ncounterparties to partially hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate (SOFR) associated with anticipated variable rate\nborrowings. Interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million and $650 million were outstanding as of September 28, 2024 and September 30,\n2023, respectively.\n70\nTable of Contents\nNote 13. Business Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company's chief operating decision making group is the Chief Executive Officer who allocates resources and assesses performance of operating\nsegments based on a measure of revenue and gross profit that excludes items not directly related to the Company's ongoing business operations. These items are\ntypically either non-recurring or non-cash in nature.

These units vest over periods ranging from one year to four years and/or upon achievement of specified performance criteria, with\nassociated compensation expense recognized ratably over the vesting period.\nGenerally, the Company’s PSUs vest contingent on achievement of cumulative non-GAAP earnings per share measured over three fiscal years. If a\nminimum threshold is not achieved during the measurement period, the PSUs will be cancelled. If a minimum threshold is achieved or exceeded, the number of\nshares of common stock that will be issued will range from 70% to 130% of the number of PSUs granted, depending on the extent of performance. Additionally, for\ncertain grants, the number of shares that vest may be adjusted up or down by up to 15% based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to that of its peer\ngroup over this same period.\n72\nTable of Contents\nActivity with respect to the Company’s RSUs and PSUs was as follows:\nWeighted Average Weighted-Average\nGrant-Date Fair Remaining Aggregate Intrinsic\nValue Contractual Term Value\nNumber of Shares ($) (Years) ($)\n(In thousands) (In thousands)\nOutstanding as of October 2, 2021 2,954 32.21 1.23 113,591\nGranted 1,644 40.54\nVested/Forfeited/Cancelled (1,318) 30.42\nOutstanding as of October 1, 2022 3,280 37.11 1.35 155,049\nGranted 972 59.78\nVested/Forfeited/Cancelled (1,371) 36.45\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2023 2,881 45.07 1.14 150,547\nGranted 1,444 50.81\nVested/Forfeited/Cancelled (1,438) 40.73\nOutstanding as of September 28, 2024 2,887 50.11 1.15 195,052\nExpected to vest as of September 28, 2024 2,632 49.97 1.10 177,821\nThe fair value of RSUs that vested during the year was $66 million for 2024, $70 million for 2023 and $44 million for 2022.

Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company has various defined contribution retirement plans that cover the majority of its domestic employees. These retirement plans permit\nparticipants to elect to have contributions made to the retirement plans in the form of salary deferrals. Under these retirement plans, the Company may match a\nportion of employee contributions. Amounts contributed by the Company were not material for any period presented herein.\nThe Company sponsors a deferred compensation plan for eligible employees that allows participants to defer payment of all or part of their compensation.\nDeferrals under this plan were immaterial. Assets associated with these plans were $47 million and $38 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023,\nrespectively. Liabilities associated with these plans were $47 million and $38 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. These amounts\nare recorded in other non-current assets and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDefined benefit plans covering certain employees in the United States and Canada were frozen in 2001. During 2022, the Board of Directors approved the\ntermination of the Company's frozen U.S. defined benefit plan, effective July 3, 2022. In connection with this termination, the Company purchased a group annuity\ncontract for $6 million during 2022 that provides for the administration of future payments to eligible plan participants. In addition, the Company recorded a pension\nsettlement charge of $2 million during 2022, which includes the reclassification of unrecognized pension losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to\nother expense on the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company provides defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries. The assumptions used for calculating the pension benefit obligations for\nnon-U.S. plans depend on the local economic environment and regulations. The measurement date for the Company's defined benefit plans is September 28, 2024.\n73\nTable of Contents\nThe funded status and plan assets for the non-U.S defined benefit plans and amount reported on the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:\nAs of\nSeptember 28, September 30,\n2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nPlan Assets $ 18,230 $ 17,307\nProjected Benefit Obligation 57,307 52,670\nUnderfunded Status $ 39,077 $ 35,363\nCurrent Liabilities $ 4,173 $ 3,147\nNon-current liabilities 34,904 32,216\nTotal liabilities $ 39,077 $ 35,363\nThe Company’s investment strategy is designed to help ensure that sufficient pension assets are available to pay benefits as they become due. Plan assets are\ninvested in mutual funds that are valued using the net asset value that is quoted in active markets (Level 1 input). These plans are managed consistent with\nregulations or market practices of the country in which the assets are invested. As of September 28, 2024, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk\nrelated to pension plan assets. All other amounts and assumptions were not material for any period presented herein.\nNote 16. Strategic Transactions\nIndia Joint Venture\nIn 2023, the Company entered into a joint venture transaction pursuant to which RSBVL acquired 50.1% of the outstanding shares of SIPL, the Company’s\nexisting Indian manufacturing entity for $216 million of cash. The remaining 49.9% is held by the Company.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), the Company is required to consolidate entities in which it has a controlling financial\ninterest. The Company determined the voting interest model was applicable under ASC 810 and concluded that, despite not having a majority ownership interest, the\nCompany has a controlling financial interest in SIPL through the management services contract. Therefore, the Company has, by contract, the unilateral ability to\ncontrol the significant decisions made in the ordinary course of SIPL’s business. Because the Company has a controlling financial interest in SIPL, it consolidates\nSIPL. However, the Company periodically assesses whether any changes in facts and circumstances have occurred that could require the Company to deconsolidate\nSIPL.\nSIPL’s cash and cash equivalents balance of $200 million as of September 28, 2024 is not available for general corporate purposes and must be retained in\nSIPL to fund its operations.\n74\nTable of Contents\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that their objectives are\nmet. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of disclosure controls and\nprocedures must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\ncan provide absolute assurance that all disclosure control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Our management, with the participation of our\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 28, 2024. Based on their\nevaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 28,\n2024 because of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below.\n(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-\n15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of\nour internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management\nhas concluded that the material weaknesses described herein existed as of September 28, 2024. As a result, management has concluded that the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was not effective as of September 28, 2024 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the COSO.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility\nthat a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis.\nWe identified the following material weaknesses as of September 28, 2024:\nAs previously reported, we identified material weaknesses in the control environment at one of our divisions due to this division maintaining an\ninappropriate tone at the top. Specifically, division management did not sufficiently promote, monitor or enforce appropriate accounting policies and procedures,\nthereby resulting in inappropriate and unsupported adjustments to the quarterly contract cost estimate process. Additionally, we did not maintain a sufficient\ncomplement of finance personnel at the division with an appropriate level of expertise, knowledge and training in internal control over financial reporting\ncommensurate with our financial reporting requirements. These material weaknesses contributed to an additional material weakness that the division did not design\nand maintain effective controls over the quarterly contract estimate review process, which lead to the failure to timely and appropriately record adjustments to\nquarterly estimates.\nThese material weaknesses resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended October 3, 2020, October 2, 2021\nand October 1, 2022 and for the quarterly fiscal periods included in such fiscal years and for the first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022. These material\nweaknesses also resulted in immaterial misstatements of our consolidated financial statements for the quarterly fiscal periods as of and for the periods ended April 1,\n2023, July 1, 2023, September 30, 2023, June 29, 2024 and September 28, 2024. Additionally, each of these material weaknesses could result in misstatements of the\naccounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or\ndetected.\nIn connection with our financial reporting process for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2024, we identified an additional material weakness as the\nCompany did not design and maintain effective controls to properly support and account for the transfer of control to its customers of certain raw materials\ninventory. This material weakness resulted in adjustments and immaterial misstatements to inventory, accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of September 28,\n2024 and September 30,\n75\nTable of Contents\n2023, respectively. Additionally, this material weakness could result in misstatements of the aforementioned accounts or disclosures that would result in a material\nmisstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an\nindependent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under Item 8.\n(c) Status of Remediation of Material Weaknesses\nRemediation of Previously Reported Material Weaknesses\nManagement plans to remediate the material weaknesses described above primarily by ensuring that relevant program management and finance personnel\npossess sufficient knowledge and experience and are sufficiently engaged to identify, escalate and drive closure of matters that could impact estimated long-term\ncustomer program costs and/or require the recording of additional expenses in the Company’s financial statements.\nTo date, management undertook the following remedial actions in conjunction with the above plan:\n• Removed internal control over financial reporting responsibilities and representation from designated individuals and added new individuals for these\nresponsibilities and representations.\n• Conducted training sessions for all employees involved in the estimate at completion (“EAC”) process on ethics, reporting and fraud, as well as the\nimportance of EACs to financial reporting.\n• Implemented a certification process whereby a select group of employees with key roles in the EAC and financial reporting processes are required to\nmake certain representations about the completeness and accuracy of EACs, as well as a representation that they are not aware of any improprieties in\nthe accounting or control functions.\n• Realigned reporting lines whereby program financial analysts report directly to the finance organization.\n• Hired a President to lead the division and added several new employees to the finance department of the division.\n• Engaged third-party consultants with extensive Aerospace and Defense experience and expertise to perform a comprehensive review of the division’s\naccounting and reporting functions, including performing an evaluation of the division’s policies and procedures.\nThese actions represent significant progress in addressing the material weaknesses. We plan to fully implement and operate the redesigned processes and\nprocedures in the upcoming fiscal year and to begin testing the enhanced controls starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. The material weaknesses will not be\nconsidered formally remediated until these controls have operated effectively for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that the\ncontrols are operating effectively.\nRemediation Plan for the Material Weakness Identified in Fiscal 2024\nManagement, with the oversight of the Audit Committee, intends to remediate the material weakness described above primarily by (i) updating the relevant\naccounting policy and procedures to be more prescriptive, (ii) enhancing the review processes applicable to evaluating whether the transfer of control of inventories\nhas occurred or whether payments received from customers should be reported as a liability, (iii) establishing controls over the preparation and review of customer\nlevel inventory reconciliations, and (iv) training of sales, operations and finance personnel responsible for administering and accounting for customer-purchased\ninventory arrangements.\n(d) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the\nquarter ended September 28, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n76\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.

Anyone violating these laws is subject to personal\nliability and could face criminal penalties, including imprisonment. Sanmina Corporation (the “Company”) takes seriously its obligation, and that of its employees,\nconsultants and advisors, to prevent insider trading violations. In light of the severity of the possible sanctions, both to the individual and to the Company, the\nfollowing Insider Trading Policy has been established to assist all parties in complying with these obligations. Any violation of this Company policy could subject\nindividuals to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\nThis policy is not intended to replace your responsibility to understand and comply with the legal prohibition on insider trading. If an individual has specific\nquestions regarding this policy or the applicable law, they should contact the Company’s General Counsel.\nDEFINITIONS\nBlack-out List: The list of Insiders meeting the criteria specified on Exhibit I who are subject to restrictions on trading in Company Securities during Black-out\nPeriods.\nBlack-out Periods: The four quarterly Black-out Periods per year during which certain Insiders may not trade in the Company’s Securities. The Black-out Periods\nbegin at the close of market on the last Trading Day of the second calendar month of each fiscal quarter and end at the close of market of the Trading Day following\nthe date of public disclosure of the financial results for such fiscal quarter. The Company may also impose other Black-out Periods from time-to-time based on\nspecific circumstances.\nDirector: A person who serves as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors.\nInsider: Any Director, officer employee, temporary employee, contractor or consultant performing work for the Company who possesses Material Non-public\nInformation of the Company, regardless of whether or not they are included on the Black-out List or the Pre-clearance List.\nMaterial Non-public Information: Information that has not been publicly released by the Company and which is material to the Company’s business. Information is\nmaterial if there is a reasonable likelihood that it would be considered important by an investor when making an investment decision about the Company. Examples\nof such information include but are not limited to:\n▪ Financial results not yet publicly reported.\n▪ Internal estimates or forecasts of future earnings, losses or cash requirements.\n▪ News of a pending or proposed merger, acquisition or sale of a subsidiary or division.\n▪ Information concerning bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems.\n▪ The fact of the gain or loss of a substantial customer or supplier.\n▪ Existence of significant product defects.\n▪ Plans to effect a stock split.\n▪ Plans to launch a new equity or debt offering.\n▪ Information indicating significant regulatory or litigation exposure, including notice from a government entity or third party.\n▪ Determination of significant environmental issues.\n▪ Major changes in senior management.\nFinancial Policies and Procedures\nPolicy: Number: Version: Effective Date: Page Number:\nFIN-GM-0002 J March 2008 2 of 11\nTitle: Insider Trading Policy\nUpdated by: Last Updated: March 1, 2023 Approval:\n▪ A major breach of our cybersecurity defenses.\nEither positive or negative information may be material.\nPre-clearance List: The list of Insiders meeting the criteria specified on Exhibit II who have been notified that they have been so identified and who must refrain\nfrom trading in the Company’s securities unless seeking pre-clearance from the General Counsel.\nSecurities: Securities include common stock, preferred stock, options to purchase common stock, warrants, convertible debentures and derivative securities.\nSection 16 Filers: Directors and officers who are subject to the reporting and liability provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(the “Exchange Act”) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. These persons will be notified by the Company as to their obligations under Section 16.\nThis list of persons will be amended from time to time as appropriate to reflect the election of new officers or Directors, any change in function of current officers\nand the resignation or departure of current officers or Directors.\nTrading Day: A Trading Day shall mean a day on which national stock exchanges and the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) are open for trading.\nTrading Window: The period of time commencing upon the open of market on the second Trading Day following the date of public disclosure of the financial results\nfor a particular fiscal quarter and continuing until the close of market on the last Trading Day of the second calendar month of the fiscal quarter.\nSTATEMENT OF POLICY\n▪ No Director, officer, employee, or temporary employee, contractor or consultant performing work for the Company, each an “Insider,” may buy or sell Company\nSecurities at any time when they are in possession of Material Non-public Information relating to the Company.\n▪ No Insider may buy or sell Securities of a supplier, customer, partner or other company with which the Company has a current or prospective business\nrelationship at any time when he or she possesses Material Non-Public Information about that company obtained in the course of services performed on behalf\nof the Company.\n▪ No Insider may disclose or “tip” Material Non-public Information to any third party (including family members), and no Insider may make recommendations or\nexpress opinions on the basis of Material Non-public Information with regard to trading in Company Securities.\n▪ No Insider who receives or has access to Material Non-public Information about the Company may comment on stock price movement or rumors of other\ncorporate developments that are of possible significance to the investing public unless it is part of their job (such as Investor Relations) or they have been\nspecifically authorized to do so by the CEO or CFO in each instance. This restriction covers all public forums, including social media. If an Insider comments on\nstock price movement or rumors, or discloses Material Non-public Information to a third party, he or she should immediately contact the General Counsel or the\nInvestor Relations department.\n▪ No Insider included on the Black-out List may buy or sell Company Securities during any of the four quarterly “Black-out Periods.”\n▪ No Insider included on the Pre-clearance List may buy or sell Company Securities at any time unless he or she shall have received prior approval from the\nGeneral Counsel.\n2\nFinancial Policies and Procedures\nPolicy: Number: Version: Effective Date: Page Number:\nFIN-GM-0002 J March 2008 3 of 11\nTitle: Insider Trading Policy\nUpdated by: Last Updated: March 1, 2023 Approval:\n▪ The restrictions on trading while in possession of Material Non-public Information do not apply to transactions made pursuant to an approved Rule 10b5-1\ntrading plan adopted by an Insider listed on Exhibit I or Exhibit II hereto (see “Requirements of Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans,” below).\nSPECIFIC POLICIES\n▪ Trading on Material Non-public Information is Prohibited. No Director, officer, employee, consultant or contractor of the Company, and no member of the\nimmediate family or household of any such person, shall engage in any transaction involving a purchase or sale of the Company’s Securities, including any offer\nto purchase or offer to sell, while he or she is aware of Material Non-public Information. Such prohibition shall continue until the beginning of the second\nTrading Day following the date of public disclosure of that information or such time as such non-public information is no longer material.\n▪ Tipping is Prohibited. No Insider shall disclose (“tip”) Material Non-public Information to any other person (including family members) nor shall such Insider\nor related person make recommendations or express opinions on the basis of Material Non-public Information as to trading in the Company’s Securities.\n▪ Material Non-public Information shall not be Disclosed. Material Non-public Information relating to the Company is the property of the Company and the\nunauthorized disclosure of such information is forbidden. In the event any officer, director or employee of the Company receives any inquiry from outside the\nCompany, such as a stock analyst, for information (particularly financial results and/or projections) that may be Material Non-public Information, the inquiry\nshould be referred to the General Counsel or the Investor Relations department.\nPOTENTIAL SANCTIONS FOR INSIDER TRADING\n▪ Liability for Insider Trading: Pursuant to federal and state securities laws, Insiders may be subject to criminal and civil fines and penalties as well as\nimprisonment for engaging in transactions in the Company’s Securities at a time when they have knowledge of Material Non-public Information regarding the\nCompany.\n▪ Liability for Tipping: Insiders may be liable for disclosure of Material Non-public Information to any other person (including family members) where such\ninformation may be used by such person to his or her profit by trading in the securities of companies to which such information relates. The Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”) has imposed large penalties even when the disclosing person did not profit from the trading. The SEC, the stock exchanges\nand the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., use sophisticated electronic surveillance techniques to uncover insider trading.\n▪ Disciplinary Actions: Employees of the Company who violate this Policy shall also be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, up to and including\ntermination of employment.\nBLACK-OUT PERIODS AND TRADING WINDOWS FOR CERTAIN INSIDERS\n▪ Black-out Periods: The period between the first day of the last month of the fiscal quarter and the release of financial results for such quarter is a particularly\nsensitive period of time for transactions in the Company’s Securities since certain Insiders may have knowledge of such results before they are announced.\nAccordingly, the Company prohibits all Insiders included on the Black-out List from trading in Company Securities during the period beginning at the close of\nmarket on the last Trading Day of the second calendar month of each fiscal quarter and ending at the close of market of the Trading Day following the date of\npublic disclosure of the financial results for such fiscal quarter (the “Black-out Period”). This prohibition includes trades made pursuant to “limit orders” placed\nby such Insiders during a Trading Window, but which were not completed before the end of the Trading Window.\n3\nFinancial Policies and Procedures\nPolicy: Number: Version: Effective Date: Page Number:\nFIN-GM-0002 J March 2008 4 of 11\nTitle: Insider Trading Policy\nUpdated by: Last Updated: March 1, 2023 Approval:\n▪ Quarterly Trading Window. To ensure compliance with this Policy and applicable federal and state securities laws, Insiders included on the Black-out List\nmay engage in transactions involving the purchase or sale of the Company’s Securities only during the period commencing upon the open of market on the\nsecond Trading Day following the date of public disclosure of the financial results for a particular fiscal quarter and continuing until the close of market on the\nlast Trading Day of the second calendar month of the fiscal quarter (the “Trading Window”). This is the period of time each quarter during which the Black-out\nPeriod is not in effect. However, trading during a Trading Window should not be considered a “safe harbor” and Insiders may never engage in any transactions\nin the Company’s securities while in possession of Material Non-public Information even if such trade would occur during the Trading Window. If any person is\nuncertain if they possess material, non-public information, they should confer with the General Counsel before trading.\n▪ Event-driven Black-out Periods. From time to time, the Company may also notify directors, officers and potentially a larger group of employees, consultants\nand contractors that they should not trade because of material developments known to the Company and not yet disclosed to the public (for example, a pending\nacquisition or disposition). In such event, directors, officers and such employees, consultants and contractors may not engage in any transaction involving the\npurchase or sale of the Company’s Securities and should not disclose to others the fact of such suspension of trading. The Company would typically permit\nresumption of trading at the beginning of the second Trading Day following the date of public disclosure of the information or at such time as the information is\nno longer material.\nThe Company will notify you by email if you are subject to the Trading Windows or any Black-out Period and will require you to execute an\nacknowledgment of your obligations under this Policy (see Exhibit III). The Company may enforce Black-out Periods by restricting access to Insiders’\nstock brokerage account with respect to Company Securities.\nPRE-CLEARANCE OF TRADES FOR CERTAIN INSIDERS\nThe Company has determined that all executive officers and Directors of the Company and certain other persons identified by the Company from time to time who\nmeet the requirements set forth in Exhibit II and who have been notified that they have been so identified must refrain from trading in the Company’s Securities,\neven during Trading Windows, without first complying with the Company’s “pre-clearance” process. Each such person should contact the General Counsel at least\n24 hours prior to commencing any trade in the Company’s Securities. The General Counsel will consult as necessary with senior management of and/or counsel to\nthe Company before clearing any proposed trade. The General Counsel shall make a decision promptly, generally within 24 hours, whether to approve a transaction.\nAlthough an Insider who has adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan need not seek pre-clearance from the General Counsel before each trade under the plan takes place,\nall Insiders must obtain Company approval prior to adopting a proposed Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. See “Requirements of Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans,” below.\nINDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH POLICY\nEvery officer, director and other employee, consultant and contractor has the individual responsibility to comply with this Policy against insider trading. An Insider\nmay, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in the Company’s Securities even if he or she planned to make the transaction before learning of the\nMaterial Non-public Information and even though the Insider believes he or she may suffer an economic loss or forego anticipated profit by waiting.\nDUTIES OF GENERAL COUNSEL\nThe General Counsel is responsible for administering this Policy and shall have the following duties:\n4\nFinancial Policies and Procedures\nPolicy: Number: Version: Effective Date: Page Number:\nFIN-GM-0002 J March 2008 5 of 11\nTitle: Insider Trading Policy\nUpdated by: Last Updated: March 1, 2023 Approval:\n▪ Other than transactions made pursuant to an approved Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, preclearing all transactions involving the Company’s Securities by those\nindividuals included on the Pre-clearance List, that have been identified and notified by the Company in order to determine compliance with the Policy, insider\ntrading laws, Section 16 of the Exchange Act and Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This list of persons will be amended\nfrom time to time as appropriate.\n▪ Compiling, maintaining and periodically publishing a definitive list of Insiders who should be included in the Black-out List and Pre-clearance List.\n▪ Notifying the Stock Administrator of the need to prepare and file Section 16 reports (Forms 3, 4 and 5) for all Section 16 Filers.\n▪ Performing periodic cross-checks of available materials, which may include Forms 3, 4 and 5, Forms 144, officer’s and director’s questionnaires, and reports\nreceived from the Company’s stock administrator and transfer agent, to determine trading activity by officers, directors and others who have, or may have,\naccess to Inside Information.\n▪ Sending, or causing to be sent, email notifications to each Insider included on the Black-out List of the dates on which the Black-out Periods and Trading\nWindows will begin and end.\n▪ Periodically circulating or publishing the Policy (and/or a summary thereof) to all employees, including Section 16 Filers and providing the Policy and other\nappropriate materials to new officers, directors and others who have, or may have, access to Inside Information.\n▪ Notifying Insiders of material changes to the Policy.\n▪ Assisting the Company in implementation of the Policy.\n▪ Coordinating compliance activities with respect to Rule 144 requirements and regarding changing requirements and recommendations for compliance with\nSection 16 of the Exchange Act and insider trading laws to ensure that the Policy is amended as necessary to comply with such requirements.\n▪ Approving, in his or her discretion, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans proposed to be adopted by Insiders included on the Black-out List and Section 16 Filers.\nAPPLICABILITY OF POLICY TO INSIDE INFORMATION OF OTHER COMPANIES\nThis Policy and the guidelines described herein also apply to Material Non-public Information relating to suppliers, customers, partners or other companies with\nwhich the Company has a current or prospective business relationship (“business partners”) when that information is obtained in the course of employment with, or\nthe performance of services on behalf of, the Company. Civil and criminal penalties, and termination of employment, may result from trading while in possession of\nMaterial Non-public Information regarding the Company’s business partners. All officers, Directors, employees, consultants and contractors should treat Material\nNon-public Information about the Company’s business partners with the same care required with respect to information related directly to the Company.\nEXCEPTIONS TO RESTRICTIONS ON TRADING\nThe prohibition on trading in the Company’s securities set forth above does not apply to:\n▪ The exercise of stock options for cash under the Company’s equity incentive plans.\n5\nFinancial Policies and Procedures\nPolicy: Number: Version: Effective Date: Page Number:\nFIN-GM-0002 J March 2008 6 of 11\nTitle: Insider Trading Policy\nUpdated by: Last Updated: March 1, 2023 Approval:\n▪ The withholding of restricted stock units by the Company to pay taxes due upon the vesting of restricted stock units.\n▪ Bona fide gifts of Company securities.\n▪ Transactions effected pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by an Insider listed on Exhibit I or II meeting the requirements set forth below under\n“Requirements of Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans.”\nREQUIREMENTS OF RULE 10B5-1 TRADING PLANS\nRule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides a defense against claims that an Insider traded while in possession of Material Non-public Information as long as such\ntrade was made pursuant to a plan adopted before the time the Insider became aware of such information (a “Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan”). Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans\ndo not provide an absolute defense from all claims of insider trading. In addition, any trades by Directors and executive officers pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Trading\nPlan must be reported on Form 4’s and remain subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, which generally prohibits purchases and sales of Company Securities\nwithin a six month period. See “Additional Information – Directors and Officers,” below.\nThe Company permits Insiders who are subject to restrictions on trading during Black-out Periods or subject to the pre-clearance requirements contained herein to\nenter into Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans. Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans must be in writing and must be specific as to the number of or dollar amount of Company\nSecurities to be sold during the term of the plan or the way such number will be determined. For example, a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan can specify a limit price above\nwhich shares will be sold. All Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans must be approved in advance by the General Counsel.\nThe safest time to adopt a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is immediately after the Trading Window opens each quarter or immediately following the Company’s filing of\nits quarterly or annual financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That is because, generally speaking, all material information concerning the\nCompany would be publicly available at such times. Insiders may not adopt a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan during a Black-out Period.\nTrades under a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan made shortly after such plan is adopted are sometimes challenged as having been made while in possession of material\nnon-public information. For that reason, and in order to ensure compliance with recently adopted SEC rules, the Company requires that the first trade taking place\nunder a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan occur no earlier than the later of (a) 91 days after the date the plan is adopted and (b) the third business day after disclosure of\nfinancial results for the fiscal quarter in which the plan is adopted on either a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K filed with the SEC (but in no case later than 120 days after\nthe date the plant was adopted). Because short-term plans generally provide less protection than longer-term plans, the Company recommends that Rule 10b5-1\nTrading Plans have a term of at least one year.\nFurthermore, Insiders may not adopt overlapping Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans, in which trades may be made under one plan before the trades are completed under the\npreviously adopted plan. Insiders who adopt a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan to provide only for a single trade may adopt only one such plan in a rolling 12-month\nperiod. These restrictions are intended to comply with recently adopted SEC rules.\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans may be terminated by the Insider, but any trades made subsequent to such termination will not have the benefit of the plan’s protection\nand any such termination could affect the protection afforded to prior sales made pursuant to the plan as well.\n6\nFinancial Policies and Procedures\nPolicy: Number: Version: Effective Date: Page Number:\nFIN-GM-0002 J March 2008 7 of 11\nTitle: Insider Trading Policy\nUpdated by: Last Updated: March 1, 2023 Approval:\nRule 10b5-1 Trading Plans may be amended, for example to reduce or increase the number of shares subject to the plan. However, any such amendment is\nconsidered to be the adoption of a new plan and, as such, no trades may take place under an amended plan earlier than the later of (a) 91 days after the date of the\namendment and (b) the third business day after disclosure of financial results for the fiscal quarter in which the plan was amended on either a Form 10-Q or Form\n10-K filed with the SEC (but in no case later than 120 days after the date the plant was amended), unless the amendment is administrative in nature.\nInsiders wishing to adopt a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan with respect to employee stock plan securities must use the form provided by the Company’s employee stock\nplan broker, E*Trade Securities LLC. This form is available from the Company’s Stock Administrator or General Counsel Please note that in addition to the\nrequirements described above, E*Trade may require additional terms. E*Trade also charges a commission for trades made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan.\nSuch additional commissions are borne by the Insider and not the Company.\nHEDGING AND PLEDGING OF COMPANY SECURITIES\nThe Company believes that “hedging,” a term used to describe certain practices taken to reduce the economic risk of Company stock ownership (e.g., to prevent\nlosses if the Company’s stock price were to fall) is inappropriate when undertaken by employees, officers or directors as such techniques reduce alignment with the\ninterests of our public stockholders. Similarly, the Company believes that “pledging” of Company stock by employees, officers or directors (i.e., using Company\nstock as collateral for a loan, such as in a margin account) can be inappropriate when such practice could cause shares to be sold when the trading window is closed\nor the individual is in possession of material non-public information and would otherwise be prohibited from selling under this policy. Therefore, the Company\nprohibits employees, officers and directors from (i) purchasing any financial instrument or engaging in any transaction intended to hedge or offset any decrease in\nthe market value of the Company’s common stock or (ii) engaging in short sales related to the Company’s common stock. In addition, the Company prohibits\nofficers and directors from (i) depositing any Company common stock in a margin account or (ii) pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan. The\nrestrictions on pledging hereunder may be waived by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board in its sole discretion.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION – DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS\nDirectors and certain officers of the Company must comply with the reporting obligations and limitations on short-swing transactions set forth in Section 16 of the\nExchange Act. The practical effect of these provisions is that officers, Directors and such other persons who purchase and sell the Company’s Securities within a six-\nmonth period must disgorge all profits to the Company whether or not they had knowledge of any Material Non-public Information. Under these provisions, and so\nlong as certain other criteria are met, neither the grant of an equity award under the Company’s equity incentive plans nor the vesting of that award is deemed a\npurchase under Section 16; however, the sale of any vested shares is considered a sale under Section 16. The Company has provided, or will provide, separate\nmemoranda and other appropriate materials to its executive officers and directors and those identified employees regarding compliance with Section 16 and its\nrelated rules.\nINQUIRIES\nAll questions regarding this Policy, requests for pre-clearance of trades (in the case of Insiders included on the Pre-clearance List) and requests for approval of\nproposed Rule 10b5-1 plans shall be made to the company’s General Counsel (see Company website).\n7\nFinancial Policies and Procedures\nPolicy: Number: Version: Effective Date: Page Number:\nFIN-GM-0002 J March 2008 8 of 11\nTitle: Insider Trading Policy\nUpdated by: Last Updated: March 1, 2023 Approval:\nExhibit I:\nBlack-out List\nPositions prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise effecting transactions in any stock or other securities of the Company or derivative securities thereof during\nany Black-out period\nPosition/Organization Title/Scope of Responsibilities*\nBoard of Directors All\nExecutive Officers All\nOther Executives All President/Chief Operating Officers and Senior and Executive Vice Presidents\nSales Organization All individuals involved in the compilation of, or in a position of having access\nto (i) consolidated sales information regarding any of the Company’s top\ncustomers accounting for more than 10% of consolidated revenues, or (ii)\nconsolidated sales or bookings information for the Company as a whole, or as\ndesignated by the General Counsel.\nFinance Organization All finance individuals located at Corporate in San Jose and all other finance\nindividuals involved in the compilation of, or in a position of having access to\nthe Company’s consolidated financial results, or as designated by the General\nCounsel.\nCorporate Development All\nOther As designated by General Counsel.\n* The foregoing includes any administrative assistants that have access to the same scope of information.\n8\nFinancial Policies and Procedures\nPolicy: Number: Version: Effective Date: Page Number:\nFIN-GM-0002 J March 2008 9 of 11\nTitle: Insider Trading Policy\nUpdated by: Last Updated: March 1, 2023 Approval:\nExhibit II:\nPre-clearance List\nExecutive Officers, Directors and Other Employees Subject to Pre-clearance Requirement\nPosition/Organization Title/Scope of Responsibilities*\nBoard of Directors All Directors\nExecutive Officers All\nOther Executives All President/Chief Operating Officers and Senior and Executive Vice Presidents\nOther Employees As designated by the General Counsel\n*The foregoing includes any administrative assistants reporting to or directly supporting an officer or employee included on or designated under\nthis Exhibit II as being subject to the Pre-Clearance Requirement.\n9\nFinancial Policies and Procedures\nPolicy: Number: Version: Effective Date: Page Number:\nFIN-GM-0002 J March 2008 10 of 11\nTitle: Insider Trading Policy\nUpdated by: Last Updated: March 1, 2023 Approval:\nEXHIBIT III:\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF INSIDER TRADING POLICY\nI acknowledge that I, _________________________have read and understand Sanmina Corporation’s Insider Trading Policy and that I agree to abide by the\nprovisions set forth therein.\nName: _____________________________________\nSignature: ______________________________________\nEmployee Number: ________________________________\nDate: ______________________________________\nThe Company will require that all Insiders included on the Black-out List sign this document within 30 days of designation as such or material changes or updates to\nthe Policy.\n10\nFinancial Policies and Procedures\nPolicy: Number: Version: Effective Date: Page Number:\nFIN-GM-0002 J March 2008 11 of 11\nTitle: Insider Trading Policy\nUpdated by: Last Updated: March 1, 2023 Approval:\n11\nEXHIBIT 21.1\nLIST OF SUBSIDIARIES\nEntity Name Jurisdiction\nAET Holdings Limited Mauritius\nCertainSource Technology Group Inc.
