Ready To Ship means that the PC is either fully prebuilt, or that we are ready to complete the build very quickly, in date order, according to our current order queue. This generally occurs within 1-4 business days. During peak season (Black Friday through Christmas into January), the estimated dispatch time for Ready To Ship systems may average approximately 3-5 business days, although the majority will ship more quickly than this.\n\nFor custom PCs, we receive your order, process it, assemble and stress test every system, and aim to dispatch all systems in approximately 3 to 5 business days. Please note this is an estimate or average time from the date on which an order is placed to the date it is dispatched, not a decisive guarantee. Higher tier builds, specialised components, periods of high demand or other factors may alter this estimate.\n\nIf time is of the essence, expedited build and shipping services may be purchased if they are available on the listing.\n\nOtherwise, the wait will be worth it, we promise.\n\nAccessories and Components: Unless otherwise stated on the listing, peripherals and components are subject to approximate 1 business day handling times and will ship as soon as possible.\n\nDelivery Methods:We use the Australia Post Parcel Post network for the regular shipping of Hive, Stinger and Patriot desktop PCs, laptops, peripherals and component orders. Australia Post, StarTrack or other shipping services may be used for expedited shipping options at our discretion. Once in transit, delivery dates may vary; check [www.auspost.com.au](https://auspost.com.au/service-updates/domestic-delivery-times) for their latest advice regarding Parcel Post deliveries from South Australia to your location, particularly during the festive peak season.\n\nDue to their size, M.O.A.Bs are shipped via StarTrack, on a pallet. It is recommended that at least two people are present for delivery of M.O.A.B. systems.

Our technicians may take up to 14 business days to complete any return-to-base warranty claims. Products made from other manufacturers will have their own warranty information regarding faults/repairs. Please check with the manufacturer for any warranty return information. We may advise that your warranty will need to be processed through the manufacturer as they will be better positioned to process their warranty claims for repair or replacement.\n\nUpgrade Program:Allied may offer credit for components from another Allied PC purchased via our website, in the form of a discounted upgrade fee when opting to upgrade to a new PC, or more recent compatible component configuration option, from our website. The components must have been part of the original specification purchased from us, which will be verified via serial numbers scanned into the original PC.

This can assist with expediting the process with warranty claims with the manufacturer and Allied.
