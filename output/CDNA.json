These forward-looking statements are based upon information that is currently available to CareDx and its current expectations, speak only as of the date hereof, and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, including general economic and market factors, among others discussed in CareDx’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including, but not limited to, the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed by CareDx with the SEC on February 28, 2024, the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 filed by CareDx with the SEC on May 9, 2024, the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 filed by CareDx with the SEC on July 31, 2024, the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 filed by CareDx with the SEC on November 4, 2024, and other reports that CareDx has filed with the SEC. Any of these may cause CareDx’s actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied by CareDx’s forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. CareDx expressly disclaims any obligation, except as required by law, or undertaking to update or revise any such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nCareDx has presented in this release certain financial information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and also on a non-GAAP basis, including non-GAAP cost of testing services, non-GAAP cost of product, non-GAAP cost of patient and digital solutions, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP other income, net, non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin (%), non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP basic and diluted net income (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP operating expenses. \n\nWe define non-GAAP net income (loss) and per share results as the GAAP net loss and per share results excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation; changes in estimated fair value of contingent consideration; acquisition-related impairment charges and amortization of purchased intangible assets and related tax effects; costs involved with completing an acquisition; unrealized loss on investments; restructuring charges and certain other charges. \n\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP net income (loss) before interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and other (income) expense, net. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in assessing our operating results through the eyes of management and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core business operating results over multiple periods. Management believes this non-GAAP information is useful for investors, when considered in conjunction with CareDx’s GAAP financial statements, because management uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting, and financial planning purposes. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and should only be used to supplement an understanding of CareDx’s operating results as reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided immediately following the financial tables. \n\n**CareDx, Inc.** **Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations**

The addition of haplotyping has the potential to improve the likelihood of long-term successful donor-recipient matching. \n\n“This collaboration reflects CareDx’s commitment to innovation in the transplant field, highlighted by our industry first with AlloSeq Tx 17, the first HLA typing solution to cover 17 loci,” said John W. Hanna, CareDx President and CEO. “Through this partnership, HLA labs will gain early access to cutting-edge solutions, positioning them at the forefront of evaluating innovative donor-recipient matching methods.” \n\nCareDx’s AlloSeq Tx 17 is the market-leading NGS-based, HLA typing solution that uses an innovative hybrid-capture workflow to efficiently streamline donor matching studies in HLA typing while providing expanded gene content, beyond 11 classical HLA loci, for more in-depth results. Dovetail Genomic’s LinkPrep technology introduces a groundbreaking method for generating comprehensive HLA haplotypes. LinkPrep technology is a next-generation rapid Hi-C method that uses short-read sequencing technology to provide direct phasing information from linked long-range reads without relying on any imputation approaches. This enables long distance inter-locus phasing and haplotype determination. Combining AlloSeq Tx with LinkPrep offers researchers the opportunity to evaluate the benefits of high precision and comprehensive HLA haplotypes for donor-recipient matching. \n\n“We believe that Dovetail Genomic’s LinkPrep technology’s unique ability to capture haplotype-aware genetic variation will be a game-changer for applications like HLA testing,” expressed Matt Easterday, Ph.D., J.D., CEO of Dovetail Genomics. “The ability to haplotype through the entire HLA region offers the transplant community an important new tool for optimizing transplant matching.” \n\nThe performance of the combined AlloSeq Tx and LinkPrep technology on clinical study samples will be showcased at the 50 th annual American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics ([ASHI](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fprotect.checkpoint.com%2Fv2%2F___https%3A%2Fashiannualmeeting.eventscribe.net%2Findex.asp%3Flauncher%3D1___.YzJ1OmdpbG1hcnRpbmdyb3VwOmM6bzpiMjAwNjIwY2JkNTdiYjcxMWEwOWRiNzljNjlmOGRkOTo2OjA1OGM6N2NhN2Q3NzA3NmNlZmI2ZDc4ZWFjMDkwYTRkZjhjOWM0YzJhNzMxMmNkYWQ5MWI2NWRmYmQ0N2FjNGFjMjllMDpwOlQ6Rg&esheet=54140864&newsitemid=20241023997211&lan=en-US&anchor=ASHI&index=4&md5=7ad87852aeb386fd21d381e2cadade1f)) meeting in both a poster session and a CareDx symposium titled “Future of Transplant Solutions: Innovation Across the Pre-and Post-Transplant Journey” on October 23, 2024.
