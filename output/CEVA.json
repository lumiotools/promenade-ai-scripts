CEVA has been supporting the Volkswagen business in PAC since 2010 and has played a crucial role in their logistics operations, particularly in recent years.\n\nThe Volkswagen Group is a German vehicle manufacturer that sells products in 153 countries. Besides Volkswagen, other popular vehicles include Audi, SEAT, Bentley, Porsche, Ducati, and more. The Volkswagen Group delivered more than nine million vehicles to customers worldwide in 2023, representing an 11.8% increase year-over-year.\n\nCEVA provides Volkswagen with warehousing services and distribution for automotive parts and accessories, including logistics to**export to more than 30 countries**. PAC is the **largest automotive parts distribution center in Latin America** and the largest one that CEVA operates, servicing over 600 car dealers. PAC is the only distribution center supporting the Volkswagen Group in Brazil, serving as a strategic location for growth and distribution across Latin America.\n\n![automotive parts distribution center](/_ipx/w_5120&f_png/images-spx/x_large_picture/4b7d5054-66ea-42f4-acf7-14afdea389ea_low%20\\(2\\).png)\n\n#### A growth mindset\n\nOver the past 12 years, CEVA‚Äôs relationship with Volkswagen has undergone significant transformation, characterized by productivity and prosperity. Volkswagen is investing R$13 billion in logistics in S√£o Paulo‚Äîpart of which will be directed to the Parts and Accessories Center to support the automation and digital transformation of the facility. CEVA is already making significant advances in digitalization and artificial intelligence technologies across its Latin American sites to promote operational efficiency and sustainability.\n\n![automotive parts distribution center](/_ipx/w_5120&f_png/images-spx/x_large_picture/4cde5c02-668f-4d96-b6cd-6dedd5d787f9_low%20\\(2\\).png)\n\nPAC is a complex logistics compound with large volumes processed daily and a strong track record of stability and productivity levels. The 132,000 square meter facility is operated by over 400 employees and processes more than 6,000 packages per day. It‚Äôs one of CEVA‚Äôs global benchmark facilities when it comes to productivity and efficiency given the sheer volumes processed and the complexities of the operations achieved.\n\n#### CEVA Logistics Parts and Accessories Center - Vinhedo (S√£o Paulo), Brazil\n\n![CEVA Logistics Parts and Accessories Center](/_ipx/w_5120&f_png/images-spx/x_large_picture/Artboard%201%20copy%203@2x%20\\(1\\).png)\n\n#### Focus on sustainability\n\nBeyond its large scale and impressive productivity, the CEVA team at PAC is proud of recent sustainability initiatives and key milestones, including the use of 100% renewable energy (LED lighting, solar and wind energy) and the recent Zero Waste Certification achieved. The facility uses packaging materials made from recycled cardboard and implemented a water waste system to reduce overall consumption.\n\nThe sustainability achievements of PAC demonstrate CEVA‚Äôs commitment to innovative and environmentally responsible logistics solutions. PAC has been an important part of CEVA‚Äôs history, and we are looking forward to the growth that the next decade will bring.\n\n![Cookiebot session tracker icon loaded](https://imgsct.cookiebot.com/1.gif?dgi=4b3211cb-ab32-4552-acdf-825d53f4ed4c)\n"

As a leading logistics provider, CEVA Logistics is well positioned at the forefront of this evolution, implementing a cohesive Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and sustainability initiatives that span from warehouse operations to transportation solutions.\n\n**CEVA‚Äôs Global CSR and Sustainability Leader, Beno√Æt Tinetti,** reflects on CEVA‚Äôs recent achievements in the arena, challenges, vision for the future, and how CEVA is helping customers reach their own sustainability goals.\n\n#### Tell us about CEVA‚Äôs CSR and sustainability strategy overall. \n\nThe foundation of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy is based on three pillars and aligned with that of our parent company the CMA CGM Group. **Acting for People** which is caring for our employees and local communities where we do work and do business. **Acting for Planet** meaning contributing to a growth model that respects the environment and natural resources. And, **Acting for Fair Trade** , building a responsible value chain in collaboration with partner, customers and suppliers.\n\nOur**Acting for Planet** pillar is focused on creating and implementing sustainable logistics throughout the entire supply chain. We aim to fight climate change and air pollution through three main levers: our transport fleet, warehouses, and through our low-carbon transport and logistics solutions. Another aspect of this pillar is promoting a circular economy, and we do this through aggressive waste prevention, reuse and recycling measures, and leveraging sustainable packaging solutions across our network. Additionally, we leverage ecologists to help take action on the ground locally in managing water efficiency and biodiversity assessments to understand our impacts and make improvements.\n\nAs a leading global logistics provider, we are responsible for decarbonizing our own assets but also play a major role in encouraging our suppliers and subcontractors to invest in the technologies of tomorrow. The decarbonization of the logistics industry cannot be achieved alone‚Äîit takes investment and commitment from all parties to make the biggest impact. Because of this, we aim to be transparent about our CSR and sustainability strategy and initiatives‚Äîwe're proud of what we‚Äôre doing and want to bring sustainable logistics to life across the globe. We active communicate our goals, progress and challenges which can be seen in our recent [CSR Executive Summary Report](/en/news-and-media/Newsroom/ceva-unveils-2023-csr-summary-report).\n\n#### What are CEVA‚Äôs current sustainability goals? And how close are you to achieving them?\n\nTogether with our parent company, the CMA CGM Group, we aim to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 across all activities with an ambitious decarbonization strategy.\n\nTo support this, our 2025 decarbonization goals and progress to reach them include:\n\n![ceva_2025-decarbonization-goals-graphic](/_ipx/w_5120&f_png/images-spx/x_large_picture/ceva_2025-decarbonization-goals-graphic_2401x1351.png)\n\n#### How does CEVA track progress against its CSR roadmap?\n\nWe have 11 CSR KPIs that we track on a quarterly basis at CEVA and the CMA CGM Group. Each has annual targets and quarterly reporting. If we‚Äôre not on track to meet a target, we put a corrective action plan in place. Our CSR metrics are categorized into our CSR strategy pillars I mentioned before.\n\n  * [**Acting for Planet**](https://www.cevalogistics.com/en/who-we-are/commitments/csr/acting-for-planet): with goals that track climate impact and energy efficiency\n\n\n  * [**Acting for People**](https://www.cevalogistics.com/en/who-we-are/commitments/csr/acting-for-people): with goals that track employee health and safety, training and diversity\n\n\n  * [**Acting for Fair Trade**](https://www.cevalogistics.com/en/who-we-are/commitments/csr/acting-for-fair-trade): with goals that track sustainable procurement, ethics and compliance\n\n\n\n#### What areas do you think present a particular challenge? Why?\n\nRegarding decarbonization, which is a key commitment at CEVA but also for our customers, the major challenge in the coming years relates to the extra cost of low-carbon fuels, whatever the mode of transport. These fuels will be essential to reach net zero carbon. This extra cost is directly linked to the availability of these alternative fuels and the required scale-up to democratize their use. It is reasonable to think that logistics will cost more in the coming years than it does now due to this common objective to reduce carbon emissions. A fair split of this premium is necessary for its acceptance by all actors.\n\n#### What are some of CEVA‚Äôs key CSR and sustainability achievements in the last year?\n\nIt has been a big year for us in terms of progress in CSR and sustainability‚Äîa truly exciting time to be a part of CEVA Logistics. One of our biggest points of recognition this year was earning **[a Gold Medal and an overall score of 76 out of 100 from EcoVadis](https://www.cevalogistics.com/en/news-and-media/Newsroom/press-release/ceva-is-awarded-a-gold-medal-by-ecovadis)** in its annual sustainability performance assessment. The Gold Medal achievement places CEVA in the top 1% overall for the logistics industry and top 5% for\n\ncompanies overall. It represents a significant 12-point improvement from 2023, highlighting our continued progress in CSR initiatives. The assessment evaluated CEVA‚Äôs sustainability performance in four key categories: Environment, Labor and Human Rights, Ethics and Sustainable Procurement. CEVA scored particularly high in the Environment category, earning a particularly high score of 90 out of 100.\n\nOther important achievements include:\n\n  * Reached 100% LED lighting across all our facilities in Latin America\n  * Implemented new solar photovoltaic projects with for example 25,000 m¬≤ in Mexico, 2,200 m¬≤ in France and 500 m¬≤ in Australia\n  * In 2024, CEVA has avoided more than 26,000 tons of emissions thanks to more than 10 million liters of sustainable maritime and aviation fuel\n  * In the first half of 2024, CEVA‚Äôs recycling services saved more than 10,000 kilograms of plastic from being used\n  * Received Green Supply Partners 2024 recognition by Inbound Logistics, a top employer certification in Columbia, and ESG champion award in Poland\n  * Launched the HumanFabWorkCare program across three sites in France and an employee volunteering program in eight countries for 13,000 employees\n  * Hosted a decarbonization hackathon for last mile delivery in New York with customers\n\n\n\n#### How is CEVA supporting its customers in reaching their own sustainability goals?\n\nOur customers rely on us to help them decarbonize their own supply chain operations. With innovation being a key part of our organization‚Äôs culture, we‚Äôre always looking for ways to improve, invent, and invest in creative sustainable logistics solutions. In line with our commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we are proud to announce the launch of our [**FORPLANET sub-brand for sustainable and logistics solutions**](https://www.cevalogistics.com/en/forplanet). The new suite of logistics solutions enables our customers to reduce the environmental impact of their supply chains by leveraging low-carbon transport and circular economy solutions.\n\nIn addition, with many customers needing to accurately report on their activities for internal CO2 monitoring or external regulatory requirements, CEVA FORPLANET solutions provide accurate data and CO2e calculations to ensure proper reporting. The CEVA FORPLANET solutions will address the vast majority of CEVA‚Äôs emissions‚Äîscope 3 emissions account for 95% of the company‚Äôs 2023 level.\n\nAs the new suite for its sustainable logistics offering, CEVA FORPLANET includes solutions around measuring, optimizing and shifting to low-carbon transport. The solutions include modal shift, as well as alternative fuels for air, ocean and road transport.\n\nCEVA also offers customers a tailor-made consulting approach for customers interested in a deeper partnership to transform their supply chains using the suite of CEVA FORPLANET solutions through a five-step transformation program. \n\n#### Why does it matter for CEVA?\n\nThere are many reasons CSR and sustainability are important to CEVA. It's important to understand that freight transport and logistics represent about 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions, so as a leading global logistics provider, we have a responsibility to act.\n\nAlso, our customers are increasingly integrating CSR and sustainability into their selection process and business requirements. We‚Äôre prepared to help companies in their quest to decarbonize their supply chains with sustainable logistics solutions and measures to track CO2 emissions and data to track progress on sustainability targets. Civil society, including consumers, media and NGOs, are evolving their practices and are expecting that CSR performance will be embedded in corporate governance and strategy.\n\nThere are other external factors as well. Public authorities are setting more stringent regulations to ensure the transparency of CSR information‚Äîto reach the same level as financial reporting‚Äîand to reduce CO2 emissions in line with the Paris agreement.\n\n#### Discover more\n\n[![ceva-csr-3pillars-sqr](/_ipx/w_5120&f_jpeg/images-spx/ratio_100_x_large_picture/ceva-csr-3pillars-sqr_600x600.jpg)Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) - SustainabilityWe are committed to preparing the supply chains of the future.We are committed to preparing the supply chains of the future.

Every year CEVA handles more than 10,000 high-value vehicles across more than 27 countries with the utmost care, utilizing our fleet of closed and open trucks to ensure secure and flexible transport options. Our expertise lies in managing time-sensitive and appointment-based deliveries for clients across Europe, as well as in the UK and Morocco, while providing tailored solutions to meet local requirements and specific business needs. \n\nTo learn more about this specialized service we‚Äôve sat down with **Raphael Bouzeloc, CEVA‚Äôs FVL Special Transport Manager**. With 10 years of experience in Finished Vehicle Logistics, Raphael shares insights into how CEVA meets the unique demands of this field. \n\n#### What are the main challenges faced in transporting special vehicles? \n\nEach day, we transport exceptional vehicles that hold not only financial value but also deep historical, and often emotional value. For this reason, they require optimal, safe, and secure handling, transport, and storage conditions to preserve their integrity. For prototype testing, the pre-production phase, and new model launches, maintaining full confidentiality during transport is crucial. \n\nAs the market becomes increasingly demanding and fast-paced, adhering to strict deadlines is non-negotiable. Whether it‚Äôs for auto events, testing, or homologation trials for new models, ensuring reliable and responsive deliveries is vital. In the research and development field, for instance, reducing development cycles is a major challenge for some of our clients. In this area, being a proactive transport partner is key to allowing them to focus on their core projects by taking care of the logistical elements. \n\nIn this quickly evolving landscape, traceability also plays a crucial role. Providing visibility at every step throughout the transport process brings peace of mind to customers. Finally, adopting more efficient transport practices to minimize carbon footprint and reduce environmental impact remains a key priority. We‚Äôre always aiming for efficiency‚Äîless miles, faster transit, and reduced carbon emissions. \n\n![ceva-fvl-special-transport-europe](/_ipx/w_5120&f_png/images-spx/ratio_100_x_large_picture/ceva-fvl-special-transport-europe-3.png)\n\n#### How is CEVA addressing these new challenges? \n\nWe started our Special transport operations in France and have since rolled out our fleet of enclosed transport vehicles to several key European countries including Spain, Germany, Italy, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. This wider geographic coverage enhances our responsiveness and helps minimize empty kilometers, thereby reducing CO‚ÇÇ emissions. \n\nGiven the high value of the vehicles we transport, it is crucial that our fleet is diverse and well-maintained. We operate a fleet of 50 trucks specially designed and equipped with advanced suspension systems to ensure smooth transport. Additionally, our secure loading systems, including hydraulic ramps and platforms, allow for safe loading and unloading, preventing any contact that could damage the vehicles. This includes three refrigerated trailers which are frequently used for temperature-sensitive operations during testing or vehicle homologation processes. Our fleet is equipped with the latest generation of advanced geolocation devices (real-time GPS tracking), ensuring full transparency throughout transport. \n\n![ceva-fvl-special-transport-europe](/_ipx/w_5120&f_png/images-spx/ratio_100_x_large_picture/ceva-fvl-special-transport-europe-2.png)\n\nIn addition, the expertise and training of our Special Vehicle transport team, particularly our drivers, are key factors in our success. We have a rigorous selection process to ensure employees bring the right experience and are committed to customer satisfaction. While our drivers share a passion for cars, we ensure they receive thorough training to meet the high standards required for handling high-value vehicles. Each new driver completes a hands-on onboarding program, spending their first month paired with a senior driver to learn our operational practices and undergo continuous training to stay up to date on both technical skills and safety standards. \n\nBecause our customers expect seamless service, we offer door‚Äìto-door solutions covering customs management, insurance, storage, and vehicle preparation whenever needed. We adapt to specific requests, whether it‚Äôs coordinating precise delivery times or arranging customized routes. In short, our goal is to provide bespoke, reliable, and low-carbon transport solutions that drive our customers‚Äô success with all their special vehicle needs.\n\n#### Could you share with us a few stories of some transport projects you have completed? \n\nWe were recently involved in a mission for a leading OEM, the worldwide mobility partner of the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee. \n\nWe delivered 250 Accessible People Movers (APMs) for the Olympic and Paralympic venues. The project was complex due to the unique challenges of such a demanding event: tight schedules, strict access protocols, and unpredictable logistical constraints. \n\nOur customer was satisfied with the service, valuing our flexibility, transparent communication, and ability to adapt to last-minute changes while ensuring on-time deliveries across the Olympic and Paralympic sites. \n\n![ceva-fvl-special-transport-europe](/_ipx/w_5120&f_png/images-spx/ratio_100_x_large_picture/ceva-fvl-special-transport-europe-5_600x600.png)\n\n#### What makes CEVA unique in the transport of special vehicles? \n\nWhat sets us apart is our ability to operate as a truly global partner across Europe.
