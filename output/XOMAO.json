MIPLYFFA™ is indicated for use in combination with miglustat for the treatment of neurological manifestations of NPC in adult and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older.  \nRezolute | Announced the sunRIZE Phase 3 clinical trial investigating ersodetug (RZ358) in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) will begin enrolling patients in the U.S. in early 2025¹.Received FDA clearance to initiate Phase 3 registrational study for ersodetug for the treatment of hypoglycemia due to tumor hyperinsulinism².  \nJohnson & Johnson | Presented neoadjuvant TAR-200 plus cetrelimab Phase 2 data in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are ineligible or refuse neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy and are scheduled for radical cystectomy at the European Society of Medical Oncology 2024 Congress³.  \n  \n**Subsequent Events**\n\nPartner | Event  \n---|---  \nTwist Bioscience | XOMA Royalty completed a $15 million royalty monetization agreement with Twist, acquiring 50% of the future milestones and royalties and adding 60-plus partnered early-stage programs across 30 companies enabled by Twist Bioscience’s Biopharma Solutions business unit to the XOMA Royalty portfolio.  \nJohnson & Johnson | Announced one of two Phase 3 clinical trials in difficult to treat muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) that included treatment with cetrelimab was being discontinued for not showing superiority to chemoradiation during a scheduled interim analysis⁴. Cetrelimab continues to be investigated in multiple other clinical trials.  \n  \n**Anticipated 2024 Events of Note**\n\nPartner | Event  \n---|---  \nTakeda | On December 12, 2024, Takeda will be hosting an R&D Day: Focus on Late-State Pipeline and Market Opportunity and has commented publicly mezagitamab will be discussed during this investor event.  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nXOMA Royalty recorded total income and revenues of $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, which included $6.5 million in estimated income associated with two commercial products in our portfolio. In the third quarter of 2023, XOMA Royalty reported total income and revenue of $0.8 million. \n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting transitory clinical trial costs related to KIN-3248, an asset acquired in the Kinnate acquisition, which the Company currently is winding down. R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2023 were $25,000.\n\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $8.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with $6.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase of $1.6 million was primarily comprised of $1.4 million in total costs incurred after our acquisition of Kinnate, which included $1.1 million in legal and consulting costs, $0.1 million in information technology costs, and $0.1 million in insurance costs. The remainder of the increased G&A expense reflects an increase of $0.2 million for salaries and related costs.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, as a result of communications with Agenus, XOMA Royalty evaluated the status of the partnered programs underlying the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement for potential impairment and recorded a one-time, non-cash impairment charge of $14.0 million and a reduction of royalty receivables of $14.0 million associated with Agenus.\n\nIn the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, G&A expenses included $2.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nTotal interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was $3.5 million, representing interest and costs related to the Blue Owl Loan established in December 2023.\n\nThe Company reported total other income, net, of $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to total other income, net, of $0.3 million in the corresponding period of 2023. The $1.6 million increase reflects a $1.3 million increase in investment income due to higher balances on our investments and the change in the market price for XOMA Royalty’s shares of Rezolute common stock.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $17.2 million, compared to a net loss of $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily resulting from the $14.0 million non-cash impairment related to the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, XOMA Royalty had cash and cash equivalents of $146.8 million (including $4.8 million in restricted cash). On December 31, 2023, XOMA Royalty had cash and cash equivalents of $159.6 million (including $6.3 million in restricted cash). During the third quarter of 2024, XOMA Royalty received $9.9 million in cash from royalty and commercial payments. Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter was $8.6 million. On October 15, 2024, the Company paid a total of $1.4 million in cash dividends on the 8.625% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Nasdaq: XOMAP) and the 8.375% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Nasdaq: XOMAO).\n\n**About XOMA Royalty Corporation**\n\nXOMA Royalty is a biotechnology royalty aggregator playing a distinctive role in helping biotech companies achieve their goal of improving human health.

In some cases, you can identify such forward-looking statements by terminology such as “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “seek,” “project,” “expect,” “may,” “will”, “would,” “could” or “should,” the negative of these terms or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of XOMA Royalty’s performance, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. These statements are based on assumptions that may not prove accurate, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to certain risks inherent in the biotechnology industry, including those related to the fact that our product candidates subject to out-license agreements are still being developed, and our licensees may require substantial funds to continue development which may not be available; we do not know whether there will be, or will continue to be, a viable market for the products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest; and if the therapeutic product candidates to which we have a royalty interest do not receive regulatory approval, our third-party licensees will not be able to market them. Other potential risks to XOMA Royalty meeting these expectations are described in more detail in XOMA Royalty's most recent filing on Form 10-Q and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consider such risks carefully when considering XOMA Royalty's prospects. Any forward-looking statement in this press release represents XOMA Royalty's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release and should not be relied upon as representing its views as of any subsequent date. XOMA Royalty disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by applicable law.\n\nEXPLANATORY NOTE: Any references to “portfolio” in this press release refer strictly to milestone and/or royalty rights associated with a basket of drug products in development. Any references to “assets” in this press release refer strictly to milestone and/or royalty rights associated with individual drug products in development.\n\nAs of the date of this press release, the commercial assets in XOMA Royalty’s milestone and royalty portfolio are VABYSMO® (faricimab-svoa), OJEMDA™ (tovorafenib), MIPLYFFA™ (arimoclomol), XACIATO™ (clindamycin phosphate) vaginal gel 2%, IXINITY® [coagulation factor IX (recombinant)], and DSUVIA® (sufentanil sublingual tablet).

(NYSE: OWL).\n\n“The Blue Owl financing provides us with significant non-dilutive capital to drive shareholder value through stock repurchases and additional royalty and milestone acquisitions,” stated Brad Sitko, Chief Investment Officer of XOMA. “This capital infusion comes at an opportune time given the existing state of the biotech funding market, providing us with an opportunity to accelerate the growth of our royalty and milestones portfolio, which currently consists of two marketed products, two programs in or near registration, five assets in Phase 3 development, and over 60 assets in earlier stages of development.”\n\n“Blue Owl’s Life Science efforts are focused on credit, royalty, and equity investments in innovative healthcare and life sciences companies and products.

Additionally, XOMA has issued to Blue Owl warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 120,000 shares of XOMA’s common stock in three equal tranches with strike prices of $35.00, $42.50, and $50.00 per share, respectively, resulting in implied premiums of 122%, 170%, and 217% to the price of XOMA’s common stock at closing, respectively.\n\n**Advisors** Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP served as XOMA’s legal advisor while Blue Owl was advised by Cooley LLP.\n\n**About XOMA Corporation** XOMA is a biotechnology royalty aggregator playing a distinctive role in helping biotech companies achieve their goal of improving human health.

MIPLYFFA™ is indicated for use in combination with miglustat for the treatment of neurological manifestations of NPC in adult and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older.  \nRezolute | Announced the sunRIZE Phase 3 clinical trial investigating ersodetug (RZ358) in patients with congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) will begin enrolling patients in the U.S. in early 2025¹.Received FDA clearance to initiate Phase 3 registrational study for ersodetug for the treatment of hypoglycemia due to tumor hyperinsulinism².  \nJohnson & Johnson | Presented neoadjuvant TAR-200 plus cetrelimab Phase 2 data in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are ineligible or refuse neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy and are scheduled for radical cystectomy at the European Society of Medical Oncology 2024 Congress³.  \n  \n**Subsequent Events**\n\nPartner | Event  \n---|---  \nTwist Bioscience | XOMA Royalty completed a $15 million royalty monetization agreement with Twist, acquiring 50% of the future milestones and royalties and adding 60-plus partnered early-stage programs across 30 companies enabled by Twist Bioscience’s Biopharma Solutions business unit to the XOMA Royalty portfolio.  \nJohnson & Johnson | Announced one of two Phase 3 clinical trials in difficult to treat muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) that included treatment with cetrelimab was being discontinued for not showing superiority to chemoradiation during a scheduled interim analysis⁴. Cetrelimab continues to be investigated in multiple other clinical trials.  \n  \n**Anticipated 2024 Events of Note**\n\nPartner | Event  \n---|---  \nTakeda | On December 12, 2024, Takeda will be hosting an R&D Day: Focus on Late-State Pipeline and Market Opportunity and has commented publicly mezagitamab will be discussed during this investor event.  \n  \n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nXOMA Royalty recorded total income and revenues of $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, which included $6.5 million in estimated income associated with two commercial products in our portfolio. In the third quarter of 2023, XOMA Royalty reported total income and revenue of $0.8 million. \n\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $0.8 million in the third quarter of 2024, reflecting transitory clinical trial costs related to KIN-3248, an asset acquired in the Kinnate acquisition, which the Company currently is winding down. R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2023 were $25,000.\n\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses were $8.0 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with $6.4 million in the third quarter of 2023. The increase of $1.6 million was primarily comprised of $1.4 million in total costs incurred after our acquisition of Kinnate, which included $1.1 million in legal and consulting costs, $0.1 million in information technology costs, and $0.1 million in insurance costs. The remainder of the increased G&A expense reflects an increase of $0.2 million for salaries and related costs.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, as a result of communications with Agenus, XOMA Royalty evaluated the status of the partnered programs underlying the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement for potential impairment and recorded a one-time, non-cash impairment charge of $14.0 million and a reduction of royalty receivables of $14.0 million associated with Agenus.\n\nIn the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, G&A expenses included $2.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses.\n\nTotal interest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was $3.5 million, representing interest and costs related to the Blue Owl Loan established in December 2023.\n\nThe Company reported total other income, net, of $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to total other income, net, of $0.3 million in the corresponding period of 2023. The $1.6 million increase reflects a $1.3 million increase in investment income due to higher balances on our investments and the change in the market price for XOMA Royalty’s shares of Rezolute common stock.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $17.2 million, compared to a net loss of $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily resulting from the $14.0 million non-cash impairment related to the Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, XOMA Royalty had cash and cash equivalents of $146.8 million (including $4.8 million in restricted cash). On December 31, 2023, XOMA Royalty had cash and cash equivalents of $159.6 million (including $6.3 million in restricted cash). During the third quarter of 2024, XOMA Royalty received $9.9 million in cash from royalty and commercial payments. Net cash used in operating activities during the quarter was $8.6 million. On October 15, 2024, the Company paid a total of $1.4 million in cash dividends on the 8.625% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Nasdaq: XOMAP) and the 8.375% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (Nasdaq: XOMAO).\n\n**About XOMA Royalty Corporation**\n\nXOMA Royalty is a biotechnology royalty aggregator playing a distinctive role in helping biotech companies achieve their goal of improving human health.

The Company has an extensive and growing portfolio of assets (asset defined as the right to receive potential future economics associated with the advancement of an underlying therapeutic candidate).

In some cases, you can identify such forward-looking statements by terminology such as “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “estimate,” “plan,” “seek,” “project,” “expect,” “may,” “will”, “would,” “could” or “should,” the negative of these terms or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of XOMA Royalty’s performance, and you should not place undue reliance on such statements. These statements are based on assumptions that may not prove accurate, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated due to certain risks inherent in the biotechnology industry, including those related to the fact that our product candidates subject to out-license agreements are still being developed, and our licensees may require substantial funds to continue development which may not be available; we do not know whether there will be, or will continue to be, a viable market for the products in which we have an ownership or royalty interest; and if the therapeutic product candidates to which we have a royalty interest do not receive regulatory approval, our third-party licensees will not be able to market them. Other potential risks to XOMA Royalty meeting these expectations are described in more detail in XOMA Royalty's most recent filing on Form 10-Q and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Consider such risks carefully when considering XOMA Royalty's prospects. Any forward-looking statement in this press release represents XOMA Royalty's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release and should not be relied upon as representing its views as of any subsequent date.
