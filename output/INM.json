(NASDAQ: INM) (“InMed” or the “Company”), a pharmaceutical company focused on developing a pipeline of proprietary small molecule drug candidates for diseases with high unmet medical needs, announced that a peer-reviewed scientific study entitled _“Cannabinol modulates the endocannabinoid system and shows TRPV1-mediated anti-inflammatory properties in human keratinocytes”_ has been published in the international journal [Biofactors](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/arMnRcemZA). This Company-sponsored study demonstrates the biological activity of cannabinol (“CBN”) and its potential anti-inflammatory effects in skin diseases.\n\nThe study, conducted in collaboration with Dr. Mauro Maccarrone at Università degli Studi dell’Aquila, investigated how CBN modulates the major elements of the endocannabinoid system (“ECS”) and activated receptors known to be involved in the inflammatory pathways of the skin. CBN was found to: \n\n  * prevent keratinocyte inflammation via vanilloid receptor 1 (“TRPV1”);\n  * express mitogen-activated protein kinases in inflamed keratinocytes;\n  * modulate the enzymes that regulate both AEA and 2-AG (endocannabinoids);\n  * increase expression of cannabinoid receptor 1 (“CB1”) at the gene level; and\n  * reduce the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines: interleukin (IL)-8, IL-12, IL-31 while increasing the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. \n\n\n\nThe anti-inflammatory activity demonstrated in this study suggests the potential of cannabinol to regulate epidermal functions and provide a protective role in the skin.\n\n“This peer-reviewed study provides scientific evidence of the distinct anti-inflammatory biological activity of cannabinol,” said Dr. Mauro Maccarrone, one of InMed’s scientific advisors. “Results from this study further support cannabinol’s therapeutic and cosmetic application in inflammatory skin conditions.”\n\n“Our drug development programs have been focused on the role of inflammation in various diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, age-related macular degeneration and epidermolysis bullosa and how rare cannabinoids and their analogs may be able to modulate the inflammation process,” commented InMed’s Senior VP, Preclinical Research and Development, Dr. Eric Hsu. “This important research into endocannabinoid system modulation not only helps in the advancement and selection of InMed’s potential drug candidates but also deepens our understanding of the ECS targets involved in specific disease areas. The endocannabinoid system is involved in almost every aspect of the body’s functioning, holding significant potential for therapeutic intervention.” \n\nThe journal article can be accessed here: [https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/biof.2122](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/2EW47hR7qm) _._\n\nDr. Mauro Maccarrone is a leader in cannabinoid research and is the recipient of the 2025 Career Achievement Award by the International Cannabinoid Research Society and is a member of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board.\n\n**About InMed:**\n\nInMed Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company focused on developing a pipeline of proprietary small molecule drug candidates targeting the CB1/CB2 receptors.

(NASDAQ: INM) (“InMed” or the “Company”), a pharmaceutical company focused on developing a pipeline of proprietary small molecule drug candidates for diseases with high unmet medical needs, today reports financial results for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2025 which ended September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company’s full financial statements and related MD&A for the first quarter ended September 30, 2024, are available at [www.inmedpharma.com](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/v1NjqUYKxm), [www.sedar.com](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/JgLyWCDwQ7) and at [www.sec.gov](https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/Gm371Ia8my).\n\nEric A. Adams, InMed Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Fiscal 2025 has commenced on a positive trajectory, with notable progress across our pharmaceutical programs and commercial operations. Our Alzheimer’s treatment candidate, INM-901, demonstrated robust progress in the first quarter, with initial read-out from a long-term preclinical study providing strong data, including achieving statistical significance in certain behavioural criteria. We are encouraged by the promising data supporting this program and the multiple potential mechanisms of action observed with this drug candidate. The Alzheimer’s research landscape is rapidly evolving, with increasing attention on neuroinflammation and other key mechanisms, aligning closely with InMed’s research focus and direction. We look forward to communicating additional long-term preclinical data in calendar 4Q 2024.”\n\nAdams continued, “On the corporate front, the Company’s recent announcement to implement a reverse split to regain Nasdaq compliance became effective today, November 14, 2024, underpinning the Company’s commitment to maintaining its listing on a major exchange while actively exploring strategic opportunities to enhance long-term shareholder value.”\n\n**Business Update – Pharmaceutical Development Programs**\n\n**INM-901: Targeting multiple biological pathways associated with Alzheimer’s disease**\n\nINM-901 is a proprietary small molecule drug candidate with multiple mechanisms of action, currently in development as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. In the first quarter, the Company announced key milestones, including positive behavioral data from long-term preclinical studies that reinforce and enhance previous findings. Additionally, new data showed that INM-901 can be administered orally, achieving therapeutic levels in the brain comparable to those obtained through intraperitoneal (“IP”) injection, a standard method of drug administration in preclinical neurodegenerative research. Ongoing studies are also examining receptor interactions to better understand the mechanisms of action (“MoA”) and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (“DMPK”).\n\nNext steps include conducting further molecular analyses from the recently completed long-term preclinical dosing study to more precisely characterize the drug’s mechanisms of action. Data read-out is anticipated in the calendar 4Q 2024.\n\n**INM-089: Targeting the treatment of dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (“AMD”)**\n\nINM-089 is a proprietary small molecule drug candidate being studied in the treatment of dry AMD. Next steps in the drug development pathway include additional _in vivo_ preclinical dose ranging studies, alongside continued Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) activities for both the drug substance and drug product. Following these efforts, Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) studies are set to commence.\n\n**Financial commentary:**\n\nBayMedica commercial business generated revenues of $1.3M for the three months ending September 30, 2024, compared to $0.9M for the same period last year, reflecting a 40% increase and a fourth consecutive quarter of consistent revenue. Additionally, BayMedica reported net income of $0.3M, or 24% as a percentage of sales, for the quarter, showing continued progress as a profitable business unit. BayMedica also continues to reduce manufacturing costs, which has led to improved margins over time.\n\nResearch and development and patent expenses were $0.8M for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $1.3M for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in research and development and patents expenses was primarily due to reduced spending on external contractors, patent fees, and compensation. We expect research and development expenses to increase in calendar year 2025 as the Company advances preclinical work on INM-901 and IND-enabling studies in ocular disease.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.6M, which compares to $6.6M at June 30, 2024. The Company continues to closely monitor expenses while advancing its pharmaceutical pipeline candidates. Based on current forecasts, the Company expects its cash will be sufficient to fund its planned operating expenses and capital expenditure through to the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2025, depending on the level and timing of BayMedica commercial revenues, as well as the level and timing of our operating expenses.\n\n**Table 1.

(**NASDAQ: INM**) (“**InMed** ” or the “**Company** “), a pharmaceutical company focused on developing a pipeline of proprietary small molecule drug candidates for diseases with high unmet medical needs, today announced, pursuant to a directors’ resolution, InMed will be consolidating all of its issued and outstanding share capital on the basis of one (1) post‐consolidation share for each twenty (20) pre‐consolidation common shares, no par value, of the Company (the “**Common Shares** “) in order to regain compliance with all of Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements (the “**Consolidation** “). \n\nThe Consolidation will result in the number of issued and outstanding Common Shares being reduced from 14,361,550 to approximately 718,078 Common Shares on a non-diluted basis, and each shareholder will hold the same percentage of Common Shares outstanding immediately after the Consolidation as such shareholder held immediately prior to the Consolidation.\n\nThe exercise price and number of Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, warrants or other convertible securities will be proportionately adjusted to reflect the Consolidation in accordance with the terms of such securities. Per the requirements of the _Business Corporations Act_ (British Columbia), under which the Company is regulated, if fractional shares are to be converted into whole shares, each fractional share remaining after the completion of the Consolidation that is less than half of a share must be cancelled and each fractional share that is at least half of a share must be rounded up to one whole share, therefore, no fractional shares will be issued as a result of the Consolidation. \n\nThe Company anticipates that the Consolidation will be deemed effective by Nasdaq on November 14, 2024, and the post-Consolidation Common Shares are anticipated to begin trading on a Consolidation-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market commencing at the market open on November 15, 2024. The Company’s trading symbol “INM” will remain unchanged, while the Common Shares will begin trading with a new CUSIP number of 457637700 and a new ISIN number of CA4576377002.\n\nRegistered shareholders holding physical share certificates will receive by mail a letter of transmittal advising of the Consolidation and containing instructions. Holders of Common Shares who hold uncertificated Common Shares (i.e., Common Shares held in book-entry form and not represented by a physical share certificate), either as registered holders or beneficial owners, will have their existing book-entry account(s) electronically adjusted by the Company’s transfer agent or, for beneficial shareholders, by their brokerage firms, banks, trusts or other nominees that hold in “street name” for their benefit. Such holders do not need to take any additional actions to exchange their pre-Consolidation Common Shares for post-Consolidation Common Shares.\n\n**About InMed**\n\nInMed Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company focused on developing a pipeline of proprietary small molecule drug candidates targeting the CB1/CB2 receptors. InMed’s pipeline consists of three separate programs in the treatment of Alzheimer’s, ocular and dermatological indications. Together with our subsidiary BayMedica, we are a global leader in the manufacturing, development and commercialization of products based on rare cannabinoids and their proprietary, small molecule drug analogs.
