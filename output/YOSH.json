(NASDAQ: YOSH) (\"Yoshiharu\" or the \"Company\"), a restaurant operator specializing in authentic Japanese ramen & rolls, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Grand opening of a new restaurant in San Clemente, CA, bringing the number of locations to 15 with 2 additional locations under construction.\n  * Entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MoU”) with Chengdu Octaday Entertainment Group through a Master License Agreement (“MLA”) for the Sichuan Province in China to introduce Yoshiharu Global’s Expanding Cuisine in Sichuan Province, China, with a rich and diverse culture and home to over 83 million people.\n  * Entered into a non-binding MoU with Xing Sheng Group through a MLA for the Liaoning Province in China to introduce a new flagship Yoshiharu restaurant in Shenyang, China, home to over 43 million people.\n  * Announced the planned entry into the lucrative and growing Korean BBQ (“KBBQ”) category, with synergies with existing ramen business expected to drive expanding market opportunity and footprint in high growth category.\n  * Closed a non-brokered $1.0 million private placement investment from an accredited investor and intends to use these proceeds for the expansion into the KBBQ segment.\n  * Nine months 2024 revenue increased 36.3% to $9.2 million.\n  * Restaurant-level contribution increased to $1.0 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 from $543,000 in the same period last year. \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“The third quarter of 2024 was highlighted by strong revenue growth, the grand opening of our 15th location, and new partnerships and initiatives, all positioning us to grow the brand and move us steadily towards profitability,” said James Chae, Yoshiharu’s President, CEO and Chairman of the Board. “In the quarter, revenue growth was driven by our restaurant service across Southern California, Las Vegas and diversified mix of service channels, including takeout and delivery. We have successfully optimized operating expenses while maintaining a strong Average Unit Volume (“AUV”) comparable to previous periods, despite continued headwinds from input costs, consumer price sensitivity, and higher cost of capital.\n\n“We continued to expand our presence and cuisine in both the US and international dining scenes in the third quarter. We celebrated the grand opening of our newest US location in San Clemente, CA, a classic beach town destination known for its beaches, world class surfing and vibrant dining scene. The new location benefits from excellent access and high visibility to I-5, drawing an estimated 8,300 visits a day and over 3 million visits a year, surrounded by an affluent population of more than 69,000 with an average household income of over $145,000 within a 3-mile radius.\n\n“In China, two new strategic non-binding Memorandum of Understandings (“MoU”) through Master License Agreements (“MLA”) will enable us to open locations across China. With Chengdu Octaday Entertainment Group, we are aiming to introduce Yoshiharu Global’s expanding cuisine in Sichuan Province, China, home to over 83 million people. The partnership presents multiple opportunities to open locations within Chengdu Octaday’s 30 corporate owned and managed hotels, theme parks and other destination attractions. We also partnered with Xing Sheng Group to introduce a new flagship Yoshiharu restaurant in Shenyang, China, home to over 43 million people. Xing Sheng Group’s real estate arm specializes in developing tourist attraction centers in Shenyang and is currently constructing China’s largest water park. This partnership offers us a prime opportunity to develop a flagship location within the water park, catering to both local residents and visiting tourists.\n\n“Recently we announced a new initiative to enter the lucrative and growing Korean BBQ (“KBBQ”) category, a highly complementary addition to our ramen business. Demand for KBBQ cuisine in the US has grown along with the popularity of Korean street food and the interest in new international flavors. The communal and interactive nature of KBBQ, with its extensive menus and relatively affordable prices, is a large part of this appeal. Armed with a $1.0 investment for this initiative, we believe we can capitalize on the resource and ingredient synergies between our existing offerings and KBBQ concept to enhance purchasing power, attract a wider audience, and explore cross-promotion opportunities to further solidify and expand the Yoshiharu brand. We also plan to explore further collaborative opportunities with Xing Sheng Group.\n\n“Looking ahead, we are expanding our US geographic footprint with two more locations currently under construction and expected to open in Menifee, CA in December 2024 and Ontario, CA in January 2025. We continue to focus on the bottom-line as we remain keen on reaching profitability in the near future, supported by new initiatives such as adding kiosks across our stores and utilizing cooking robots to reduce labor costs. We are poised for additional growth with two new partnerships in China and expansion into the Korean BBQ segment. Taken together, we believe our multi-dimensional growth strategy will expand the Yoshiharu brand and build long-term shareholder value,” concluded Chae.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenues increased 48.9% to $3.0 million compared to $2.0 million in the prior year period.

Specializing in Japanese ramen, Yoshiharu gained recognition as a leading ramen restaurant in Southern California within six months of its 2016 debut and has continued to expand its top-notch restaurant service across Southern California and Las Vegas, currently owning and operating 14 restaurants.\n\nFor more information, please visit [www.yoshiharuramen.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3C-jxBzM1z3yVJgu44NVJYgaEBE7Bt-KRuhn5F-OJKjsB0gcxaZOaHT1Pn6ICWIggym02QnMlywBzHf7kODkmyer8nt4uqXYXN9LuXSTsgg= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, non-cash lease expense and asset disposals, closure costs and restaurant impairments, as well as certain items, such as employee retention credit, litigation accrual, and certain executive transition costs, that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales. EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures which are intended as supplemental measures of our performance and are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company believes that EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and operating results. However, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company as a whole and such measures should be reviewed in conjunction with its GAAP financial results.\n\nThe Company believes that the use of EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware when evaluating EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, the Company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The Company’s computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.\n\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA in the Company’s SEC filings and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\n\nThe full reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 which can be found on the SEC ‘s website at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jE1eAQGSSDJH1Nsunq0rmPzCBs5oCaOvvs2F0fD_8ghP68ryQTEo9FLKfbhZBMm8BtUgqPxWuT2ZnPiZRUAbyA== \"Opens in a new window\") or the Company’s investor relations site at [ir.yoshiharuramen.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=x29tkPFidM6onnnC593dw9w-QmRAx0tqIfC_E6odyzF2XG2eryXfeKOPYL0RSDoDrsAWi5nmS01_Z6ag8R1tfK2eHmH6cEFUxkN7_NIF16M= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including without limitation, statements regarding our position to execute on our growth strategy, and our ability to expand our leadership position.

AUVs are calculated by dividing (x) annual sales for the fiscal\nyear presented for all such restaurants by (y) the total number of restaurants in that base. We make fractional adjustments\nto sales for restaurants that were not open for the entire fiscal year presented (e.g., a restaurant is closed for renovation)\nto annualize sales for such period of time. This measurement allows management to assess changes in consumer\nspending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base.\n• “Comparable restaurant sales growth” refers to the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable restaurant base.\nWe include restaurants in the comparable restaurant base that have been in operation for at least 3 months prior to the\nstart of the accounting period presented. Growth in comparable restaurant sales represents the percent change in sales\nfrom the same period in the prior year for the comparable restaurant base. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020\nand December 31, 2021, there were 5 and 6 restaurants, respectively, in our comparable restaurant base. This measure\nhighlights performance of these mature restaurants, as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded. The small\nnumber of restaurants in our comparable restaurant base may cause this measure to fluctuate and be unpredictable.\n• “EBITDA” is defined as net income before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization.\n• “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, non-cash rent expense and asset\ndisposals, closure costs and restaurant impairments.\n• “Restaurant-level Contribution” is defined as operating income plus depreciation and amortization and general and\nadministrative expenses.\n• “Restaurant-level Contribution margin” is defined as Restaurant-level Contribution divided by sales.\n• “Average check size” is defined as (x) sales, divided by (y) restaurant check count for a given period of time. This is an\nindicator which management uses to analyze the dollars spent per guest in our restaurants and aids management in\nidentifying trends in guest preferences and the effectiveness of menu changes and price increases.\n22\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n• EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin are intended as supplemental\nmeasures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We are presenting EBITDA,\nAdjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin because we believe that they provide\nuseful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and\noperating results. Additionally, we present Restaurant-level Contribution because it excludes the impact of general and administrative\nexpenses which are not incurred at the restaurant-level. We also use Restaurant-level Contribution to measure operating\nperformance and returns from opening new restaurants.\n• We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin\nprovides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s\nfinancial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nHowever, you should be aware that Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin are financial measures\nwhich are not indicative of overall results for the Company, and Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution\nmargin do not accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders because of corporate-level expenses excluded from such measures. In\naddition, you should be aware when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level\nContribution margin that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Our\npresentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-\nrecurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution\nmargin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not\ncalculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin in the same fashion.\n• Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin\nshould not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We\ncompensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level\nContribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin on a supplemental basis. For a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net restaurant operating income (loss) to Restaurant-level Contribution, see “Summary\nHistorical Financial and Operating Data”.\n23"

(NASDAQ: YOSH) (\"Yoshiharu\" or the \"Company\"), a restaurant operator specializing in authentic Japanese ramen & rolls, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Grand opening of a new restaurant in San Clemente, CA, bringing the number of locations to 15 with 2 additional locations under construction.\n  * Entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MoU”) with Chengdu Octaday Entertainment Group through a Master License Agreement (“MLA”) for the Sichuan Province in China to introduce Yoshiharu Global’s Expanding Cuisine in Sichuan Province, China, with a rich and diverse culture and home to over 83 million people.\n  * Entered into a non-binding MoU with Xing Sheng Group through a MLA for the Liaoning Province in China to introduce a new flagship Yoshiharu restaurant in Shenyang, China, home to over 43 million people.\n  * Announced the planned entry into the lucrative and growing Korean BBQ (“KBBQ”) category, with synergies with existing ramen business expected to drive expanding market opportunity and footprint in high growth category.\n  * Closed a non-brokered $1.0 million private placement investment from an accredited investor and intends to use these proceeds for the expansion into the KBBQ segment.\n  * Nine months 2024 revenue increased 36.3% to $9.2 million.\n  * Restaurant-level contribution increased to $1.0 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2024 from $543,000 in the same period last year. \n\n\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“The third quarter of 2024 was highlighted by strong revenue growth, the grand opening of our 15th location, and new partnerships and initiatives, all positioning us to grow the brand and move us steadily towards profitability,” said James Chae, Yoshiharu’s President, CEO and Chairman of the Board. “In the quarter, revenue growth was driven by our restaurant service across Southern California, Las Vegas and diversified mix of service channels, including takeout and delivery. We have successfully optimized operating expenses while maintaining a strong Average Unit Volume (“AUV”) comparable to previous periods, despite continued headwinds from input costs, consumer price sensitivity, and higher cost of capital.\n\n“We continued to expand our presence and cuisine in both the US and international dining scenes in the third quarter. We celebrated the grand opening of our newest US location in San Clemente, CA, a classic beach town destination known for its beaches, world class surfing and vibrant dining scene. The new location benefits from excellent access and high visibility to I-5, drawing an estimated 8,300 visits a day and over 3 million visits a year, surrounded by an affluent population of more than 69,000 with an average household income of over $145,000 within a 3-mile radius.\n\n“In China, two new strategic non-binding Memorandum of Understandings (“MoU”) through Master License Agreements (“MLA”) will enable us to open locations across China. With Chengdu Octaday Entertainment Group, we are aiming to introduce Yoshiharu Global’s expanding cuisine in Sichuan Province, China, home to over 83 million people. The partnership presents multiple opportunities to open locations within Chengdu Octaday’s 30 corporate owned and managed hotels, theme parks and other destination attractions. We also partnered with Xing Sheng Group to introduce a new flagship Yoshiharu restaurant in Shenyang, China, home to over 43 million people. Xing Sheng Group’s real estate arm specializes in developing tourist attraction centers in Shenyang and is currently constructing China’s largest water park. This partnership offers us a prime opportunity to develop a flagship location within the water park, catering to both local residents and visiting tourists.\n\n“Recently we announced a new initiative to enter the lucrative and growing Korean BBQ (“KBBQ”) category, a highly complementary addition to our ramen business. Demand for KBBQ cuisine in the US has grown along with the popularity of Korean street food and the interest in new international flavors. The communal and interactive nature of KBBQ, with its extensive menus and relatively affordable prices, is a large part of this appeal. Armed with a $1.0 investment for this initiative, we believe we can capitalize on the resource and ingredient synergies between our existing offerings and KBBQ concept to enhance purchasing power, attract a wider audience, and explore cross-promotion opportunities to further solidify and expand the Yoshiharu brand. We also plan to explore further collaborative opportunities with Xing Sheng Group.\n\n“Looking ahead, we are expanding our US geographic footprint with two more locations currently under construction and expected to open in Menifee, CA in December 2024 and Ontario, CA in January 2025. We continue to focus on the bottom-line as we remain keen on reaching profitability in the near future, supported by new initiatives such as adding kiosks across our stores and utilizing cooking robots to reduce labor costs. We are poised for additional growth with two new partnerships in China and expansion into the Korean BBQ segment. Taken together, we believe our multi-dimensional growth strategy will expand the Yoshiharu brand and build long-term shareholder value,” concluded Chae.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenues increased 48.9% to $3.0 million compared to $2.0 million in the prior year period.

Specializing in Japanese ramen, Yoshiharu gained recognition as a leading ramen restaurant in Southern California within six months of its 2016 debut and has continued to expand its top-notch restaurant service across Southern California and Las Vegas, currently owning and operating 14 restaurants.\n\nFor more information, please visit [www.yoshiharuramen.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3C-jxBzM1z3yVJgu44NVJYgaEBE7Bt-KRuhn5F-OJKjsB0gcxaZOaHT1Pn6ICWIggym02QnMlywBzHf7kODkmyer8nt4uqXYXN9LuXSTsgg= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, non-cash lease expense and asset disposals, closure costs and restaurant impairments, as well as certain items, such as employee retention credit, litigation accrual, and certain executive transition costs, that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales. EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures which are intended as supplemental measures of our performance and are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company believes that EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and operating results. However, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company as a whole and such measures should be reviewed in conjunction with its GAAP financial results.\n\nThe Company believes that the use of EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware when evaluating EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, the Company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The Company’s computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.\n\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA in the Company’s SEC filings and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\n\nThe full reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 which can be found on the SEC ‘s website at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jE1eAQGSSDJH1Nsunq0rmPzCBs5oCaOvvs2F0fD_8ghP68ryQTEo9FLKfbhZBMm8BtUgqPxWuT2ZnPiZRUAbyA== \"Opens in a new window\") or the Company’s investor relations site at [ir.yoshiharuramen.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=x29tkPFidM6onnnC593dw9w-QmRAx0tqIfC_E6odyzF2XG2eryXfeKOPYL0RSDoDrsAWi5nmS01_Z6ag8R1tfK2eHmH6cEFUxkN7_NIF16M= \"Opens in a new window\").\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including without limitation, statements regarding our position to execute on our growth strategy, and our ability to expand our leadership position. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the Company's beliefs, plans, goals, objectives, expectations, assumptions, estimates, intentions, future performance, other statements that are not historical facts and statements identified by words such as \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"intends\", \"plans\", \"believes\", \"seeks\", \"estimates\" or words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements reflect our current views about our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects, which are based on the information currently available to us and on assumptions we have made. Although we believe that our plans, intentions, expectations, strategies and prospects as reflected in, or suggested by, these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that the plans, intentions, expectations or strategies will be attained or achieved. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, as a result of various factors including those risks and uncertainties described in the Risk Factors and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of our filings with the SEC including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and subsequent reports we file with the SEC from time to time, which can be found on the SEC's website at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=jE1eAQGSSDJH1Nsunq0rmHIQhzcgOfRBj4mNyPWY9cIGKwrviKG3pt1SlsteZZmMUCjIVaHGFuW3BvcS7FrV9Q== \"Opens in a new window\"). Such risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, but are not limited to: the risk that our plans to maintain and increase liquidity may not be successful to remediate our past operating losses; the risk that we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if we are unable to identify appropriate sites for restaurant locations, expand in existing and new markets, obtain favorable lease terms, attract guests to our restaurants or hire and retain personnel; that our operating results and growth strategies will be closely tied to the success of our future franchise partners and we will have limited control with respect to their operations; the risk that we may face negative publicity or damage to our reputation, which could arise from concerns regarding food safety and foodborne illness or other matters; the risk that that minimum wage increases and mandated employee benefits could cause a significant increase in our labor costs; and the risk that our marketing programs may not be successful, and our new menu items, advertising campaigns and restaurant designs and remodels may not generate increased sales or profits. We urge you to consider those risks and uncertainties in evaluating our forward-looking statements. We caution readers not to place undue reliance upon any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this release, except as required by law.\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:** Larry W HolubDirectorMZ North America[YOSH@mzgroup.us](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6piPriYwTMg9TPZB4PjE-sXL8g7rRpA3uh2tn6g0hXFXXg1JZV49yNI6EB7157sZ-78J1we02vsH7Q_GZge4oA== \"Opens in a new window\") 312-261-6412\n\n**Yoshiharu Global Co.****Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n---  \n**_As of_** |  **_September 30,_****_2024_** |  **_December 31,_****_2023_**  \n**ASSETS**  \n**Current Assets:**  \nCash | $ | 1,712,064 | $ | 1,462,326  \nAccounts receivable | 36,397 | -

All statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K other than statements of historical fact, including statements\nregarding our future operating results and financial position, our business strategy and plans, market growth and trends, and objectives for future operations are forward-looking\nstatements. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking\nstatements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “contemplates,” “believes,”\n“estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or\nintentions.\nThese risks and uncertainties include, among other things: the risk that we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if we are unable to identify\nappropriate sites for restaurant locations, expand in existing and new markets, obtain favorable lease terms, attract guests to our restaurants or hire and retain personnel; the risk\nthat we may not be able to maintain or improve our comparable restaurant sales growth; that the restaurant industry is a highly competitive industry with many competitors; the\nrisk that our limited number of restaurants, the significant expense associated with opening new restaurants, and the unit volumes of our new restaurants makes us susceptible to\nsignificant fluctuations in our results of operations; the risk that we have incurred operating losses and may not be profitable in the future; the risk that our plans to maintain and\nincrease liquidity may not be successful; the risk that we depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more key personnel or an\ninability to attract, hire, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations; the risk that our\noperating results and growth strategies will be closely tied to the success of our future franchise partners and we will have limited control with respect to their operations; the\nrisk that we may face negative publicity or damage to our reputation, which could arise from concerns regarding food safety and foodborne illness or other matters; the risk that\nminimum wage increases and mandated employee benefits could cause a significant increase in our labor costs; that events or circumstances could cause the termination or\nlimitation of our rights to certain intellectual property critical to our business that is licensed from Yoshiharu Holdings Co., or that we could face infringements on our\nintellectual property rights and be unable to protect our brand name, trademarks and other intellectual property rights; the risk that challenging economic conditions may affect\nour business by adversely impacting numerous items that include, but are not limited to: consumer confidence and discretionary spending, the future cost and availability of\ncredit and the operations of our third-party vendors and other service providers; the risk that we, or our point of sale and restaurant management platform partners, may fail to\nsecure guests’ confidential, personally identifiable, debit card or credit card information or other private data relating to our employees or us; and the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, or a similar public health threat, on global capital and financial markets, general economic conditions in the United States, and our business and operations.\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and\nprospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in the section titled “Risk\nFactors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K or to conform such statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law.\nii\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS AFFECTING OUR COMPANY\nOur business is subject to multiple risks and uncertainties, as more fully described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We urge you\nto read the disclosures under the caption “Risk Factors” and this Annual Report in full. Our significant risks may be summarized as follows:\n● We have incurred operating losses and may not be profitable in the future. Our plans to maintain and increase liquidity may not be successful.\n● Our long-term success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully identify and secure appropriate sites and timely develop and expand our operations in existing\nand new markets.\n● New restaurants, once opened, may not be profitable, and the increases in average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales that we have experienced in the past\nmay not be indicative of future results.\n● Our limited number of restaurants, the significant expense associated with opening new restaurants, and the unit volumes of our new restaurants makes us susceptible\nto significant fluctuations in our results of operations.\n● Our sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales are less than we expect.\n● Negative publicity relating to one of our restaurants could reduce sales at some or all of our other restaurants.\n● The minimum wage, particularly in California, continues to increase and is subject to factors outside of our control.\n● New information or attitudes regarding diet and health could result in changes in regulations and consumer consumption habits that could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.\n● We are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.\n● Delays In Obtaining Construction Permits Can Have A Material Adverse Effect on Our Business.\n● We may become involved in lawsuits involving Yoshiharu Holdings Co. as the owner of intellectual property, or us as a licensee of intellectual property from\nYoshiharu Holdings Co., to protect or enforce intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.\n● A breach of security of confidential consumer information related to our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions, as well as a breach of security of\nour employee information, could substantially affect our reputation, business, financial condition of results of operations.\n● Our marketing programs may not be successful, and our new menu items, advertising campaigns and restaurant designs and remodels may not generate increased sales\nor profits.\n● We could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and\nother remedies.\n● Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\n● Failure to obtain and maintain required licenses and permits or to comply with alcoholic beverage or food control regulations could lead to the loss of our liquor and\nfood service licenses and, thereby, harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n● If we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a\ntimely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company.\n● We will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\n● We are an “emerging growth company,” and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will\nmake our common stock less attractive to investors.\n● Our management does not have experience managing a U.S. public company and our current resources may not be sufficient to fulfill our public company obligations.\n● Pursuant to the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for so long as we are an “emerging growth company.”\niii\nPART I\nItem 1. Business.\nOverview of Yoshiharu\nWe are a fast-growing Japanese restaurant operator and was borne out of the idea of introducing the modernized Japanese dining experience to customers all over the world.\nSpecializing in Japanese ramen, we gained recognition as a leading ramen restaurant in Southern California within six months of our 2016 debut and have continued to expand\nour top-notch restaurant service across Southern California, currently operating ten restaurants with an additional three new restaurant stores under construction/development.\nFurther, we entered into a material definitive agreement to acquire three existing restaurants in Las Vegas and expect to complete the acquisition in early second quarter 2024.\nWe take pride in our warm, hearty, smooth, and rich bone broth, which is slowly boiled for over twelve hours. Customers can taste and experience supreme quality and deep\nflavors. Combining the broth with the fresh, savory, and highest-quality ingredients, we serve the perfect, ideal ramen, as well as offers customers a wide variety of sushi rolls,\nbento menu and other favorite Japanese cuisine. Our acclaimed signature Tonkotsu Black Ramen has become a customer favorite with its slow cooked pork bone broth and\nfreshly made, tender chashu (braised pork belly).\nOur mission is to bring our Japanese ramen and cuisine to the mainstream, by providing a meal that customers find comforting. Since the inception of the business, we have\nbeen making our own ramen broth and other key ingredients such as pork chashu and flavored eggs from scratch, whereby upholding the quality and taste of our foods,\nincluding the signature texture and deep, rich flavor of our handcrafted broth. Moreover, we believe that slowly cooking the bone broth makes it high in collagen and rich in\nnutrients. We also strive to present food that is not only healthy, but also affordable. We feed, entertain and delight our customers, with our active kitchens and bustling dining\nrooms providing happy hours, student and senior discounts, and special holiday events. As a result of our vision, customers can comfortably enjoy our food in a friendly and\nwelcoming atmosphere.\nIn September 2022, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 2,940,000 shares of our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common\nStock”) at a public offering price of $4.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of $11,760,000. Net proceeds from the IPO were approximately $10.3 million after deducting\nunderwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of approximately $1.5 million.\nWe granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 441,000 additional shares (equal to 15% of the shares of Class A Common Stock sold in the IPO) to cover over-\nallotments, if any, which the underwriters did not exercise. In addition, we issued to the representative of the underwriters warrants to purchase a number of shares of Class A\nCommon Stock equal to 5.0% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A Common Stock sold in the IPO (including shares of Class A Common Stock sold upon exercise of\nthe over-allotment option). The representative’s warrants are exercisable at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the four-and-½-year period commencing\nsix months from the date of commencement of the sales of the shares of Class A Common Stock in connection with the IPO, at an initial exercise price per share of $5.00 (equal\nto 125% of the initial public offering price per share of Class A Common Stock). No representative’s warrants have been exercised.\nOn September 9, 2022, the our Class A Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “YOSH.”\nOn November 22, 2023, we filed a Certificate of Amendment (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse\nstock split of our Class A Common Stock and Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class B Common Stock” and, together with Class A common Stock,\n“Common Stock”), in the ratio of 1-for-10 (the “Reverse Stock Split”) effective at 11:59 p.m. eastern on November 27, 2023. The Class A Common Stock began trading on a\nsplit-adjusted basis at the market open on Tuesday, November 28, 2023.\nNo fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, any fractional shares that would have resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to\nthe next whole number. As a result, a total of 34,846 shares of Class A Common Stock were issued and total of 1,230,246 shares of Class A Common Stock were outstanding as\nof December 31, 2023. The Reverse Stock Split affects all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder’s percentage interest in our outstanding Common Stock,\nexcept for adjustments that may result from the treatment of fractional shares. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock and number of authorized, issued, and\noutstanding shares of the preferred stock were not changed.\nSupply Chain Disruption and Inflation\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs, especially in light of recent supply chain disruptions. We believe we\nhave experienced higher costs due to increased commodity prices and challenges sourcing our supplies due in part to global supply chain disruptions. Although historically, and\nas of December 31, 2023, global supply chain disruptions have not materially adversely affected our business, a substantial increase in the cost of, or inability to procure, the\nfood products most critical to our menu, such as canola oil, rice, meats, fish and other seafood, as well as fresh vegetables, could materially and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition or results from operations. Because we provide moderately priced food, we may choose not to, or may be unable to, pass along commodity price increases to\nconsumers. These potential changes in supply costs could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n1\nHistorically and as of the date hereof, inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations. Severe increases in inflation, however, could affect the global and U.S.\neconomies and could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, future volatile, negative, or uncertain\neconomic conditions and recessionary periods or periods of significant inflation may adversely impact consumer spending at our restaurants, which would materially adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such effects can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth.\nTo the extent that we are unable to offset such cost inflation through increased menu prices or increased efficiencies in our operations and cost savings, there could be a\nnegative impact on our business, sales and margin performance, net income, cash flows and the trading price of our common shares. We have been able to offset to some extent\nthese inflationary and other cost pressures through actions such as increasing menu prices and supply chain initiatives, however, we expect these inflationary and other cost\npressures to continue into the year 2024.\nOur Strengths\nExperienced Management Team Dedicated to Growth.\nOur team is led by experienced and passionate senior management who are committed to our mission. We are led by our Chief Executive Officer, James Chae. Mr. Chae\nfounded Yoshiharu in 2016 and has helped grow the business since that time. Mr. Chae leads a team of talented professionals with deep financial, operational, culinary, and real\nestate experience.\nCompelling Value Proposition with Broad Appeal.\nGuests can enjoy our signature ramen dishes or select from our variety of fresh sushi rolls, bento, and other Japanese cuisine. The high-quality dishes at affordable prices are the\nresult of our efficient operations. In addition, we believe our commitment to high-quality and fresh ingredients in our food is at the forefront of current dining trends as\ncustomers continue to seek healthy food options.\nAttractive Restaurant-Level Economics.\nAt Yoshiharu, we believe our rapid customer turnover, combined with our ability to deliver in 2 major day parts with lunch and dinner, allows for robust and efficient sales in\neach of our restaurants. Our average unit volume (“AUV”, as defined herein) was $1.2 million in 2022 and $1.1 million in 2023.\nQuality of Food and Excellence in Customer Service.\nWe place a premium on serving high-quality, authentic Japanese cuisine. We believe in customer convenience and satisfaction and have created strong, loyal and repeat\ncustomers who help expand the Yoshiharu network to their friends, family and co-workers.\n2\nOur Growth Strategies\nPursue New Restaurant Development.\nWe have pursued a disciplined new corporate owned growth strategy. Having expanded our concept and operating model across varying restaurant sizes and geographies, we\nplan to leverage our expertise opening new restaurants to fill in existing markets and expand into new geographies. While we currently aim to achieve in excess of 100% annual\nunit growth rate over the next three to five years, we cannot predict the time period of which we can achieve any level of restaurant growth or whether we will achieve this level\nof growth at all. Our ability to achieve new restaurant growth is impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including those described under the\ncaption “Risk Factors.” In particular, see “Risk Factors—Our long-term success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully identify and secure appropriate sites and\ntimely develop and expand our operations in existing and new markets” for specific risks that could impede our ability to achieve new restaurant growth in the future. We\nbelieve there is a significant opportunity to employ this strategy to open additional restaurants in our existing markets and in new markets with similar demographics and retail\nenvironments.\nDeliver Consistent Comparable Restaurant Sales Growth.\nWe have achieved positive comparable restaurant sales growth in recent periods. We believe we will be able to generate future comparable restaurant sales growth by growing\ntraffic through increased brand awareness, consistent delivery of a satisfying dining experience, new menu offerings, and restaurant renovations. We will continue to manage\nour menu and pricing as part of our overall strategy to drive traffic and increase average check. We are also exploring initiatives to grow sales of alcoholic beverages at our\nrestaurants, including the potential of a larger format restaurant with a sake bar concept. In addition to the strategies stated above, we expect to initiate sales of franchises in\n2024.\nIncrease Profitability.\nWe have invested in our infrastructure and personnel, which we believe positions us to continue to scale our business operations. As we continue to grow, we expect to drive\nhigher profitability both at a restaurant-level and corporate-level by taking advantage of our increasing buying power with suppliers and leveraging our existing support\ninfrastructure. Additionally, we believe we will be able to optimize labor costs at existing restaurants as our restaurant base matures and AUVs increase. We believe that as our\nrestaurant base grows, our general and administrative costs will increase at a slower rate than our sales.\nHeighten Brand Awareness.\nWe intend to continue to pursue targeted local marketing efforts and plan to increase our investment in advertising. We also are exploring the development of instant ramen\nnoodles which we would distribute through retail channels. We intend to explore partnerships with grocery retailers to provide for small-format Yoshiharu kiosks in stores to\npromote a limited selection of Yoshiharu cuisine.\nExperienced Management Team Dedicated to Growth.\nOur team is led by experienced and passionate senior management who are committed to our mission. We are led by our Chief Executive Officer, James Chae. Mr. Chae\nfounded Yoshiharu in 2016 and leads a team of talented professionals with deep financial, operational, culinary, and real estate experience.\nProperties\nAs of December 31, 2023, we operated ten restaurants in California and opened one new location in February 2024 in California. We operate a variety of restaurant formats,\nincluding in-line and end-cap restaurants located in retail centers of varying sizes. Our restaurants currently average approximately 1,578 square feet. We lease the property for\nour corporate offices and all of the properties on which we operate our restaurants.\n3\nThe table below shows the locations of our restaurants as of the date of this Report:\nStore Location Address Year Launched\nOrange 1891 N Tustin St, Orange, CA 92865 2016\nBuena Park 6970 Beach Blvd, #F206 Buena Park, CA 90621 2017\nWhittier 8426 Laurel Ave, STE A Whittier, CA 90605 2017\nChino 4004 Grand Ave STE C Chino, CA 91710 2019\nEastvale 4910 Hamner Ave STE 150, Eastvale, CA 91752 2020\nIrvine 3935 Portola Pkwy, Irvine, CA 92602 2021\nLa Mirada 12806 La Mirada Blvd, La Mirada, CA 90638 2022\nCerritos 11533 South St, Cerritos, CA 90703 2022\nCorona 440 N Mckinley St STE 101, Corona, CA 92879 2023\nGarden Grove 9812 Chapman Avenue Garden Grove, CA 92841 2023\nLaguna 32341 Golden Lantern, STE B, Laguna Niguel, CA 92677 1Q 2024*1\nMenifee 27311 Newport Road, Suite 320, Menifee, CA 92584 2Q 2024*2\nSan Clemente 638 Camino de Los Mares STE 16, San Clemente, CA 92673 2Q 2024*2\nLas Vegas 6125 S.

The majority of our restaurant leases have lease terms of 10\nyears, inclusive of customary extensions which are at the option of the company. Our restaurant leases generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes,\ninsurance, common area maintenance charges, and other operating costs. Some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds, although we\ngenerally do not expect to pay significant rent on these properties based on the thresholds in those leases. We do not own any real property.\nWe opened one restaurant in each year from 2019 through 2021, and we have opened two restaurants in 2022 and 2023. We also opened a new restaurant in February 2024, and\ncurrently have two new locations under construction/development. Further, we entered into a material definitive agreement to acquire three existing restaurants in Las Vegas\nand expect to close the acquisition in the early second quarter of 2024.\nWe anticipate approximately $350,000 in costs per new location in development, and has spent approximately $514,000 for the two locations under construction/development\nas of December 31, 2023.\nIn 2019, we closed our West Hollywood and Lynwood, California restaurants due to underperformance. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to open any specific\nnumber of restaurants in any year. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our long-term success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully\nidentify and secure appropriate sites and timely develop and expand our operations in existing and new markets.”\nSite Development and Expansion\nSite Selection Process\nWe consider site selection to be instrumental to our success. As part of our strategic site selection process, we receive potential site locations from networks of local brokers,\nwhich are then reviewed by our Development Team. This examination consists of an analysis of the lease terms and conditions, a profitability evaluation, as well as multiple\nsite visits during all times of the day, e.g., lunch, late afternoon, dinner, weekdays and weekends, to test for traffic. The Development Team holds regular meetings for site\napproval with other members of our senior management team in order to get a balanced perspective on a potential site.\n4\nOur current real estate strategy focuses on high-traffic retail centers in markets with a diverse population and above-average household income for the state. We believe we are\nattractive lessees for landlords given our ability to drive strong traffic comprised of above-average household income guests, and we imagine our bargaining power will become\nstronger as we accumulate more stores. In site selection, we also consider factors such as residential and commercial population density, restaurant visibility, traffic patterns,\naccessibility, availability of suitable parking, proximity to highways, universities, shopping areas and office parks, the degree of competition within the market area, and general\navailability of restaurant-level employees. We also invest in site analytics tools for demographic analysis and data collection for both existing and new market areas, which we\nbelieve allows us to further understand the market area and determine whether to open new restaurants in that location.\nOur flexible physical footprint, which has allowed us to open restaurants in size ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 square feet, allows us to open in-line and end-cap restaurant\nformats at strip malls and shopping centers and penetrate markets in both suburban and urban areas. We believe we have the ability to open additional restaurants in our existing\nmetropolitan areas. We also believe there is significant opportunity to employ the strategy in new markets with similar demographics across the U.S. and globally.\nExpansion Strategy\nWe plan to pursue a multi-facet expansion strategy by opening new corporate restaurants or acquiring existing restaurants in both new and existing markets, as well as utilizing\nthe franchise market. We believe this expansion will be crucial to executing our growth strategy and building awareness of Yoshiharu as a leading Japanese casual dining brand.\nExpansion into new markets occurs in parallel with ongoing evaluation of existing markets, with the goal of maintaining a pipeline of top-tier development opportunities. As\ndescribed under the heading Site Selection Process above, we use a systematic approach to identify and review existing and new markets.\nUpon selecting a new market, we typically build one restaurant to prove concept viability in that market. We have developed a remote management system whereby our senior\noperations team is able to monitor restaurants in real-time from our headquarters using approximately eight cameras installed in each restaurant. We utilize this remote\nmanagement system to maintain operational quality while minimizing inefficiencies caused by a lack of economies of scale in new markets.\nDue to our relatively small restaurant count, new restaurants have an outsized impact on our financial performance. In order to mitigate risk, we look to expand simultaneously\nin new and existing markets. We base our site selection on our most successful existing restaurants and frequently reevaluate our strategy, pacing and markets. We believe we\nare in the early stages of our growth story and that our restaurant model is designed to generate strong cash flow, attractive restaurant-level financial results and high returns on\ninvested capital, which we believe provides us with a strong foundation for expansion.\nRestaurant Design\nRestaurant design is handled by our Development Team in conjunction with outsourced vendor relationships, e.g., architects and general contractors. Our restaurant size\ncurrently averages approximately 1,500 square feet. Seating in our restaurant is comprised of a combination of table seating and bar seats with an average seating capacity of\n40-50 guests.\nWe are developing two main restaurant layouts. The standard restaurants will be built using our current layout and design which we believe evokes a modern and on-trend\nJapanese dining atmosphere. The second layout is a larger floor plan where we will utilize a full service restaurant and bar. We believe our see-through kitchens reflecting the\ncooks preparing first hand meals, amplify the lively bustle provided by the great casual atmosphere, and serve to highlight the ambiance of getting great food in a modern\nJapanese style ambiance.\n5\nConstruction\nConstruction of a new restaurant takes approximately 12 to 24 weeks once construction permits are issued. Our Development Team oversees the build-out process from\nengaging architects and contractors to design and build out the restaurant. The capital resources required to develop each new restaurant are significant. On average, we\nestimate our restaurant build-outs to cost approximately $350,000 - $550,000 per standard location, net of tenant allowances and pre-opening costs and assuming that we do not\npurchase the underlying real estate, but this figure could be significantly higher depending on the market, restaurant size, and condition of the premises upon delivery by\nlandlord. On average, we estimate that our restaurants require a cash build-out cost of approximately $350,000-$550,000 per restaurant, net of landlord tenant improvement\nallowances and pre-opening costs and assuming that we do not purchase the underlying real estate. Actual costs may vary significantly depending upon a variety of factors,\nincluding the site and size of the restaurant and conditions in the local real estate and labor markets.\nRestaurant Management and Operations\nRestaurant Management and Employees\nOur restaurants typically employ one restaurant manager, one or two supervisors, and approximately 8 to 12 additional team members. Managers, supervisors and management\ntrainees are cross-trained throughout the restaurant in order to create competency across critical restaurant functions, both in the dining area and in the kitchen.\nIn addition, our senior operations team monitors restaurants in real-time from our headquarters using our remote management system of approximately eight cameras installed\nin each restaurant. These team members are responsible for different components of the restaurant: cleanliness, service, and food quality.\nTraining and Employee Programs\nWe devote significant resources to identifying, selecting, and training restaurant-level employees. Our training covers leadership, team building, food safety certification,\nalcohol safety programs, sexual harassment training, and other topics. Management trainees undergo training for approximately 8 to 16 weeks in order to develop a deep\nunderstanding of our operations. In addition, we are developing extensive training manuals that cover all aspects of restaurant-level operations.\nOur traveling “opening team” provides training to team members in advance of opening a new restaurant. We believe the opening team facilitates a smooth opening process and\nefficient restaurant operations from the first day a restaurant opens to the public. The opening team is typically on-site at new restaurants from two weeks before opening to four\nweeks after opening.\nFood Preparation, Quality and Safety\nWe are committed to consistently providing our guests high quality, freshly prepared food. For other items we believe hand preparation achieves the best quality. Hand\npreparation of menu items includes, but is not limited to, frying tempura, slicing meat and fish and making pork bone broth. We believe guests can taste the difference in freshly\nprepared food and that adhering to these standards is a competitive advantage for our brand.\nFood safety is essential to our success and we have established procedures to help ensure that our guests enjoy safe, quality food. We require each employee to complete food\nhandler safety certification upon hiring. We have taken various additional steps to mitigate food quality and safety risks, including undergoing internal safety audits. We also\nconsider food safety and quality assurance when selecting our distributors and suppliers.\nMenu\nWe offer a diverse menu, including our signature ramen dishes, as well as sushi rolls, bento boxes, and other Japanese cuisine. The menu appeals to a wide range of customers,\nand we continue to improve upon the quality, taste and presentation. Additionally, we are able to serve the menu in a delivery and pickup format, as our food is designed to be\nenjoyed on premise or at customers’ homes or offices. We have entered the catering business through relationships with businesses who place large format orders (i.e., Bento\nboxes for corporate meetings or office lunches), for delivery or pick-up. We expect that our catering business, which has a higher-than-average order value, to grow due to the\nearly success we have experienced in the corporate channel.\n6\nNew Menu Introductions\nWe focus advertising efforts on new menu offerings to broaden our appeal to guests and drive traffic. Our menu changes twice per year to introduce new items and remove\nunderperforming items. We promote these new menu additions through various social media platforms, our website and in-restaurant signage.\nMarketing and Advertising\nWe use a variety of marketing and advertising channels to build brand awareness, attract new guests, increase dining frequency, support new restaurant openings, and promote\nYoshiharu as an authentic Japanese restaurant with high-quality cuisine and a distinctive dining experience. Our primary advertising channels include digital, social, and print.\nSocial Media\nWe maintain a presence on several social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram, allowing us to regularly communicate with guests, alert guests of new offerings,\nand conduct promotions. Our dining experience is built to provide our guests social media shareable moments, which we believe extends our advertising reach.\nSuppliers\nWe carefully select suppliers based on product quality and authenticity and their understanding of our brand, and we seek to develop long-term relationships with them. All\nsupply arrangements are negotiated and managed at the Yoshiharu corporate-level.\nFood. Our Vice President of Operations identifies and procures high-quality ingredients at competitive prices. Each store separately makes an order to the specific vendor, and\nthe invoices are submitted and paid by Yoshiharu at the corporate-level. We source mainly through the following Japanese-related distributors: JFC, a subsidiary of Kikkoman\nCorporation, Wismettac, a subsidiary of Nishimoto Co., Ltd., and Mutual Trading Co., Inc., a California corporation.\nPaper. Our Vice President of Operations negotiates long term supply agreements for our logo-branded paper including takeout bags and bowls, chopsticks, as well as uniforms.\nWe make a portion of our purchases annually in bulk at fixed prices, and deliver them to our warehouse in Anaheim, California. Each restaurant Manager receives the necessary\npaper supplies from our warehouse.\nManagement Information Systems\nWe utilize systems provided by Toast, Inc. for point of sale, contactless ordering, handheld ordering, online ordering and delivery, as well as marketing and payroll\nmanagement. We believe that Toast’s systems provide us and our customers with streamlined operations and allows us to efficiently turn tables and improve the sales\nconversion cycle, while reducing third-party commissions for online orders.\nRestaurant Industry Overview\nAccording to the National Restaurant Association (the “NRA”), restaurant industry sales in 2023 were over $1.0 trillion, up from $966 billion in 2022 and is forecast to grow to\n$1.1 trillion in 2024.\nThe restaurant industry is divided into several primary segments, including limited-service and full-service restaurants, which are generally categorized by price, quality of\nfood, service, and location. Yoshiharu sits at the intersection of these two segments offering the experience and food quality of a full-service restaurant and the speed of service\nof a limited-service restaurant. We primarily compete with other full-service restaurants, which, according to the NRA, had approximately$305 billion of sales in calendar year\n2022, up from $266 billion in 2021. The limited-service segment generated approximately $370 billion in calendar year 2022, or a roughly $30 billion increase from the prior\nyear.\n7\nAccording to the 2023 State of the Restaurant report, full-service restaurant sales are expected to increase to $324 billion in calendar year 2023, an increase of 6.2% from 2022\nand the limited-service segment is forecast to reach $395 billion in 2023, resulting in a 6.8% increase from 2022.\nWe believe that increased multiculturalism in the United States, driven in part by growth in the Asian demographic, contributes to a favorable macro environment for\nYoshiharu’s future growth. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Asian population is projected to be one of the fastest growing demographics in the United States,\nincreasing in size from 20 million people in calendar year 2020 to 24.4 million people by calendar year 2030. During this time, the Asian population’s share of the nation’s total\npopulation is projected to increase by 15%, from approximately 6% to 6.9%.\nAdditionally, we believe that Yoshiharu is well-positioned to grow our share of the restaurant market as consumers seek quality, value, healthier options, and authentic global\nand regional cuisine in their dining choices. According to the National Restaurant Association 2023 State of the Industry report, roughly 45% of family and casual dining\nrestaurants plan to add new menu items identified as healthy or nutritious in 2023.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will benefit from these long-term demographic trends, although we believe the projected growth in the Asian population and the Asian\ninfluence on dining trends will result in an increase in demand for Japanese and Asian foods.\nCompetition\nWe face significant competition from a variety of locally owned restaurants regional, and national chain restaurants offering both Asian and non-Asian cuisine, as well as\ntakeaway options from grocery stores. Direct competition for Yoshiharu comes primarily from Asian restaurants including other ramen noodles restaurants. Jinya Ramen Bar\noperates approximately 40 locations in the United States and also franchises their restaurants. We believe that we compete primarily based on product quality, dining\nexperience, ambience, location, convenience, value perception, and price. Our competition continues to intensify as competitors increase the breadth and depth of their product\nofferings and open new restaurants.\nSeasonality\nDue to Yoshiharu’s menu breadth and diversification of offerings, we do not experience significant seasonality.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 180 employees, of whom 20 were exempt employees and the remainder were non-exempt employees. None of our employees\nare unionized or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our current employee relations to be good.\nGovernment Regulation and Environmental Matters\nWe are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations relating, among others, to public and occupational health and safety,\nnutritional menu labeling, healthcare, the environment, sanitation and fire prevention. We operate each of our restaurants in accordance with standards and procedures designed\nto comply with applicable codes and regulations. However, an inability to obtain or retain health department or other licenses would adversely affect our operations. Although\nwe have not experienced, and do not anticipate, any significant difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any such problem could delay\nor prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a particular restaurant or group of restaurants. Additionally, difficulties, delays or failure to retain or renew\nlicenses, permits or approvals, or increased compliance costs due to changed regulations, could adversely affect operations at existing restaurants.\n8\nIn addition, in order to develop and construct restaurants, we must comply with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. Federal and state environmental\nregulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date, but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use\nand environmental factors could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs for new restaurants. We are also required to comply with the accessibility\nstandards mandated by the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, which generally prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability. We may in the\nfuture have to modify restaurants, for example, by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations\nfor disabled persons. While these expenses could be material, our current expectation is that any such actions will not require us to expend substantial funds.\nAlcoholic beverage control regulations require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license that\nmust be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our\nrestaurants, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, other relationships with alcohol\nmanufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. We are also subject in certain states to “dram shop”\nstatutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to\nthe intoxicated person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance.\nFurther, we are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various other\nfederal and state laws governing similar matters including minimum wages, overtime, workplace safety and other working conditions. Significant numbers of our food service\nand preparation personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage, and further increases in the minimum wage or other changes in these laws could increase\nour labor costs. Our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increasing menu prices will depend on the responses of our competitors and guests. Our distributors and\nsuppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs of goods and services supplied by us. We may also be subject\nto lawsuits from our employees, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and\nemployment matters, discrimination and similar matters.\nThere has been increased regulation of certain food establishments in the United States, such as the requirements to maintain a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points\n(“HACCP”) system. HACCP refers to a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of potential hazards from production,\nprocurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the finished product. Many states have required restaurants to develop and implement HACCP\nsystems and the U.S. government continues to expand the sectors of the food industry that must adopt and implement HACCP programs. We cannot assure you that we will not\nhave to expend additional time and resources to comply with new food safety requirements either required by current or future federal food safety regulation or legislation.\nAdditionally, our suppliers may initiate or otherwise be subject to food recalls that may impact the availability of certain products, result in adverse publicity or require us to\ntake actions that could be costly for us or otherwise harm our business.\nA number of states, counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose to consumers certain nutritional information or\nhave enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. Many of these requirements are inconsistent or interpreted differently from one\njurisdiction to another. These requirements may be different or inconsistent with requirements that we are subject to under the the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of\n2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, (collectively, the “ACA,”), which establishes a uniform, federal requirement for certain restaurants to\npost nutritional information on their menus. Specifically, the ACA requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations in the United States operating under the same name and\noffering substantially the same menus to publish the total number of calories of standard menu items on menus and menu boards, along with a statement that puts this calorie\ninformation in the context of a total daily calorie intake. The ACA also requires covered restaurants to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed\nnutritional information for each standard menu item, and to provide a statement on menus and menu boards about the availability of this information upon request. While our\nability to adapt to consumer preferences is a strength of our concepts, the effect of such labeling requirements on consumer choices, if any, is unclear at this time.\n9\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge,\nstorage, handling, release and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances (“environmental laws”). These environmental laws can provide for significant fines and\npenalties for non-compliance and liabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the\nrelease or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property\ndamage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances. We are not aware of any environmental laws that will materially affect our earnings or\ncompetitive position, or result in material capital expenditures relating to our restaurants. However, we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future,\nhow existing or future environmental laws will be administered, interpreted or enforced, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with, or to\nsatisfy claims relating to, environmental laws. It is possible that we will become subject to environmental liabilities at our properties, and any such liabilities could materially\naffect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments, gift cards and consumer credit, protection and fraud, and any failure or\nperceived failure to comply with these laws could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of\noperations.\nFurthermore, we are subject to import laws and tariffs which could impact our ability to source and secure food products, other supplies and equipment necessary to operate our\nrestaurants.\nFor a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see “Risk Factors.”\nIntellectual Property and Trademarks\nYoshiharu Holdings Co., our wholly owned subsidiary, owns a number of patents, trademarks and service marks registered or pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark\nOffice (“PTO”) including the following registrant trademarks: YOSHIHARU RAMEN (Trademark Reg. No. 5030823) and Design Mark YOSHIHARU RAMEN (Trademark\nReg. No. 5045588). In addition, we have registered the Internet domain name www.yoshiharuramen.com. The information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is\nnot part of this Report.\nWe believe that the trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights that we license from Yoshiharu Holdings Co. have significant value and are important to the\nmarketing and reputation of our brand. It is our policy to pursue registration of our intellectual property whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement thereof.\nHowever, we cannot predict whether steps taken to protect such rights will be adequate or whether Yoshiharu Holdings Co. will take steps to enforce such rights with regard to\nany intellectual property that we license from them. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We may become involved in lawsuits involving Yoshiharu\nHoldings Co. as the owner of intellectual property, or us as a licensee of intellectual property from Yoshiharu Holdings Co., to protect or enforce our intellectual property\nrights, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.” We are aware of third-party restaurants with names similar to our restaurant name in certain limited\ngeographical areas such as in California. However, we believe such uses will not adversely affect us.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are currently not involved in litigation that we believe will have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit,\nproceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self- regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the\nexecutive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our company’s or our\ncompany’s subsidiaries’ officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision is expected to have a material adverse effect.\n10\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses and may not be profitable in the future. Our plans to maintain and increase liquidity may not be successful.\nWe incurred a net loss of $3.0 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn September 2022, we consummated our IPO (the “IPO”) of 2,940,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at a public offering price of $4.00 per share, generating gross\nproceeds of $11,760,000. Net proceeds from the IPO were approximately $10.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of\napproximately $1.5 million.\nOn January 5, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with Alumni Capital LP, a Delaware limited partnership\n(“Alumni”), which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Alumni, and\nAlumni is obligated to purchase, up to an aggregate of $5,000,000 in shares of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe believe that the expected cash flow from operations, the proceeds from the IPO, and the proceeds from the Securities Purchase Agreement will be adequate to fund\noperating lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital obligations for at least the next 12 months and thereafter.\nOur long-term success is highly dependent on our ability to successfully identify and secure appropriate sites and timely develop and expand our operations in existing and\nnew markets.\nOne of the key means of achieving our growth strategies will be through opening and operating new restaurants on a profitable basis for the foreseeable future. We opened two\nnew restaurants in 2022 and in 2023, respectively, and opened one new restaurant in February 2024. We currently have two new locations under construction/development, and\nexpect to complete the acquisition of three existing restaurants in the early second quarter of 2024. We also plan to open an additional two to four new restaurants in 2024. We\nidentify target markets where we can enter or expand, taking into account numerous factors such as the locations of our current restaurants, demographics, traffic patterns and\ninformation gathered from various sources. We may not be able to open our planned new restaurants within budget or on a timely basis, if at all, given the uncertainty of these\nfactors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we operate more restaurants, our rate of expansion relative to the size of our\nrestaurant base will eventually decline.\nThe number and timing of new restaurants opened during any given period may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, without limitation:\n● identification and availability of locations with the appropriate size, traffic patterns, local retail and business attractions and infrastructure that will drive high levels of\nguest traffic and sales per unit;\n● competition in existing and new markets, including competition for restaurant sites;\n● the ability to negotiate suitable lease terms;\n● the lack of development and overall decrease in commercial real estate due to a macroeconomic downturn;\n● recruitment and training of qualified personnel in the local market;\n● our ability to obtain all required governmental permits, including zonal approvals, on a timely basis;\n● our ability to control construction and development costs of new restaurants;\n● landlord delays;\n● the proximity of potential sites to an existing restaurant, and the impact of cannibalization on future growth;\n● anticipated commercial, residential and infrastructure development near our new restaurants; and\n● the cost and availability of capital to fund construction costs and pre-opening costs.\nAccordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand as we may not correctly analyze the suitability of a location or anticipate all of the challenges\nimposed by expanding our operations. Our growth strategy, and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new restaurant, may cause our operating\nresults to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to expand in existing markets or penetrate\nnew markets, our ability to increase our sales and profitability may be materially harmed or we may face losses.\nOur restaurant base is geographically concentrated in California, and we could be negatively affected by conditions specific to California.\nAdverse changes in demographic, unemployment, economic, regulatory or weather conditions in California have had, and may continue to have, material adverse effects on our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations. As a result of our concentration in California, we have been, and in the future may be, disproportionately affected by\nadverse conditions in this specific market compared to other chain restaurants with a national footprint.\n11\nOur expansion into new markets may present increased risks due in part to our unfamiliarity with the areas and may make our future results unpredictable.\nWe opened two new restaurants in 2022 and in 2023, respectively, and opened one new restaurant in February 2024. We currently have two new locations under\nconstruction/development, and expect to complete the acquisition of three existing restaurants in the early second quarter of 2024. We plan to continue to increase the number\nof our restaurants in the next several years as part of our expansion strategy and expect to open an additional two to four new restaurants in 2024. We may in the future open\nrestaurants in markets where we have little or no operating experience. This growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new\nrestaurant may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Restaurants we open in\nnew markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction, occupancy or operating costs than restaurants we\nopen in existing markets, thereby affecting our overall profitability. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are\nmore difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets and there may be little or no market awareness of our brand in these new markets. We may need to make greater\ninvestments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity in new markets to build brand awareness. We also may find it more difficult in new markets to\nhire, motivate and keep qualified employees who share our vision, passion and business culture. If we do not successfully execute our plans to enter new markets, our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nNew restaurants, once opened, may not be profitable, and the increases in average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales that we have experienced in the past\nmay not be indicative of future results.\nNew restaurants may not be profitable and their sales performance may not follow historical patterns. In addition, our average restaurant sales and comparable restaurant sales\nmay not increase at the rates achieved over the past several years. Our ability to operate new restaurants profitably and increase average restaurant sales and comparable\nrestaurant sales will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n● consumer awareness and understanding of our brand;\n● general economic conditions, which can affect restaurant traffic, local labor costs and prices we pay for the food products and other supplies we use;\n● changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;\n● competition, either from our competitors in the restaurant industry or our own restaurants;\n● temporary and permanent site characteristics of new restaurants; and\n● changes in government regulation.\nIf our new restaurants do not perform as planned, our business and future prospects could be harmed. In addition, if we are unable to achieve our expected average restaurant\nsales, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur sales and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales are less than we expect.\nThe level of comparable restaurant sales growth, which represents the change in year-over-year sales for restaurants open for at least three months, could affect our sales\ngrowth. Our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends in part on our ability to successfully implement our initiatives to build sales. It is possible such initiatives\nwill not be successful, that we will not achieve our target comparable restaurant sales growth or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative, which may\ncause a decrease in our profitability and would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n12\nOur failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\nOur growth plan includes opening new restaurants. Our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems may be\ninadequate to support our planned expansion. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to hire, train\nand retain managers and team members. We may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on our management, restaurant teams\nand existing infrastructure which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur limited number of restaurants, the significant expense associated with opening new restaurants, and the unit volumes of our new restaurants makes us susceptible to\nsignificant fluctuations in our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, we operated eight and ten restaurants, respectively. We have opened one new restaurant in February 2024 and currently have two new\nlocations under construction/development. We expect to complete the acquisition of three existing restaurants in the early second quarter of 2024 and also plan to open an\nadditional two to four new restaurants in 2024. The capital resources required to develop each new restaurant are significant. On average, we estimate that our restaurants\nrequire a cash build-out cost of approximately $350,000-$550,000 per restaurant, net of landlord tenant improvement allowances and pre-opening costs and assuming that we\ndo not purchase the underlying real estate. Actual costs may vary significantly depending upon a variety of factors, including the site and size of the restaurant and conditions in\nthe local real estate and labor markets. The combination of our relatively small number of existing restaurants, the significant investment associated with each new restaurant,\nvariance in the operating results in any one restaurant, or a delay or cancellation in the planned opening of a restaurant could materially affect our business, financial condition\nor results of operations.\nA decline in visitors to any of the retail centers, shopping malls, lifestyle centers, or entertainment centers where our restaurants are located could negatively affect our\nrestaurant sales.\nOur restaurants are primarily located in high-activity areas such as retail centers, shopping malls, lifestyle centers, and entertainment centers. We depend on high visitor rates at\nthese centers to attract guests to our restaurants. Factors that may result in declining visitor rates include economic or political conditions, anchor tenants closing in retail\ncenters or shopping malls in which we operate, changes in consumer preferences or shopping patterns, changes in discretionary consumer spending, increasing petroleum\nprices, or other factors, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n13\nOpening new restaurants in existing markets may negatively affect sales at our existing restaurants.\nThe consumer target area of our restaurants varies by location, depending on a number of factors, including population density, other local retail and business attractions, area\ndemographics and geography. As a result, the opening of a new restaurant in or near markets in which we already have restaurants could adversely affect the sales of these\nexisting restaurants and thereby adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build our\nconsumer base for a new restaurant in the same market. Our core business strategy does not entail opening new restaurants that we believe will materially affect sales at our\nexisting restaurants, but we may selectively open new restaurants in and around areas of existing restaurants that are operating at or near capacity to effectively serve our guests.\nSales cannibalization between our restaurants may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations and could affect our sales growth, which could, in\nturn, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operating results and growth strategies will be closely tied to the success of our future franchise partners and we will have limited control with respect to their\noperations. Additionally, our franchise partners’ interests may conflict or diverge with our interests in the future, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nAs we grow, we will depend on the financial success and cooperation of our future franchise partners for our success. Our franchise partners will be independent business\noperators and will not be our employees, and as such we have limited control over how our franchise partners will run their businesses, and their inability to operate\nsuccessfully could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe will receive royalties, franchise fees, contributions to our marketing development fund, and other fees from our franchise partners. Additionally, we will sell proprietary\nproducts to our franchise partners at a markup over our cost to produce. We expect to establish operational standards and guidelines for our franchise partners; however, we will\nhave limited control over how our franchise partners’ businesses are run, including day to day operations. Even with these operation standards and guidelines, the quality of\nfranchised stores may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Consequently, our franchise partners may not successfully operate stores in a manner\nconsistent with our standards and requirements, such as quality, service and cleanliness, or may not hire and train qualified store managers and other store personnel or may not\nimplement marketing programs and major initiatives such as store remodels or equipment or technology upgrades, which may require financial investment. Even if such\nunsuccessful operations do not rise to the level of breaching the related franchise documents, they may be attributed by customers to our brand and could have a negative\nimpact on our business.\nOur franchise partners may not be able to secure adequate financing to open or continue operating their stores. If they incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends\ndeteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt, our franchise partners could experience financial distress or even bankruptcy. If a significant number of our\nfranchise partners were to become financially distressed, it could harm our operating results through reduced royalty revenue, marketing fees, and proprietary product sales and\nthe impact on our profitability could be greater than the percentage decrease in these revenue streams.\n14\nWhile we are responsible for ensuring the success of our entire system of stores and for taking a longer term view with respect to system improvements, our franchise partners\nwill have individual business strategies and objectives, which might conflict with our interests. Our future franchise partners may from time to time disagree with us and our\nstrategies and objectives regarding the business or our interpretation of our respective rights and obligations under the franchise agreement and the terms and conditions of the\nfranchise partner relationship. This may lead to disputes with our franchise partners and we expect such disputes to occur from time to time in the future. Such disputes may\nresult in legal action against us. To the extent we have such disputes, the attention, time and financial resources of our management and our future franchise partners will be\ndiverted from our stores, which could harm our business even if we have a successful outcome in the dispute.\nActions or omissions by our future franchise partners in violation of various laws may be attributed to us or result in negative publicity that affects our overall brand image,\nwhich may decrease consumer demand for our products. Franchise partners may engage in online activity via social media or activity in their personal lives that negatively\nimpacts public perception of our franchise partners’ or our operations or our brand as a whole. This activity may negatively affect franchise partners’ sales and in turn impact\nour revenue.\nIn addition, various state and federal laws govern our relationship with our future franchise partners and our potential sale of a franchise. A future franchise partner and/or a\ngovernment agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee/franchisor relationships that could result in the award of damages to a franchise partner and/or the\nimposition of fines or other penalties against us.\nOperating results at our restaurants could be significantly affected by competition in the restaurant industry in general and, in particular, within the dining segments of the\nrestaurant industry in which we compete.\nWe face significant competition from a variety of restaurants offering both Asian and non-Asian cuisine, as well as takeout offerings from grocery stores and other outlets\nwhere Asian food is sold. These segments are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, product quality, dining experience, ambience, location, convenience,\nvalue perception, and price. Our competition continues to intensify as competitors increase the breadth and depth of their product offerings and open new locations. These\ncompetitors may have, among other things, chefs who are widely known to the public that may generate more notoriety for those competitors as compared to our brand. We\nalso compete with many restaurant and retail establishments for site locations and restaurant-level employees.\nSeveral of our competitors offering Asian and related choices may look to compete with us on price, quality and service. Any of these competitive factors may materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on certain vendors and suppliers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain consistent price and quality throughout our restaurants depends in part upon our ability to acquire specified food products and supplies in sufficient\nquantities from third-party vendors and suppliers at a reasonable cost. We do not control the businesses of our vendors and suppliers and our efforts to specify and monitor the\nstandards under which they perform may not be successful. Furthermore, certain food items are perishable, and we have limited control over whether these items will be\ndelivered to us in appropriate condition for use in our restaurants. If any of our vendors or other suppliers are unable to fulfill their obligations to our standards, or if we are\nunable to find replacement providers in the event of a supply or service disruption, we could encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies,\nwhich could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we use various third-party vendors to provide, support and maintain most of our management information systems. We also outsource certain accounting, payroll\nand human resource functions to business process service providers. The failure of such vendors to fulfill their obligations could disrupt our operations. Additionally, any\nchanges we may make to the services we obtain from our vendors, or new vendors we employ, may disrupt our operations. These disruptions could materially adversely affect\nour business, financial condition or results of operations.\n15\nContinued supply chain disruptions and other forces beyond our control, and resulting changes in food and supply costs have and could continue to adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs, especially in light of recent supply chain disruptions. We believe we\nhave experienced higher costs due to increased commodity prices and challenges sourcing our supplies due in part to global supply chain disruptions. For example, we believe\nthat the cost of certain essential supplies (i.e. gloves and canola oil) has increased as a result of lower supply attributable to supply chain disruptions. Shortages or interruptions\nin the availability of certain supplies caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, food contamination, inclement weather or other conditions\nbeyond our control could also adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of our ingredients, which could harm our operations. Although historically and as of December\n31, 2023, global supply chain disruptions have not materially adversely affected our business, a substantial increase in the cost of, or inability to procure, the food products\nmost critical to our menu, such as canola oil, rice, meats, fish and other seafood, as well as fresh vegetables, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition or results from operations. Although we try to manage the impact that these fluctuations have on our operating results by, for example, diversifying our suppliers, we\nremain susceptible to continued increases in food and other essential supply costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such as the current supply chain interruptions,\ngeneral economic conditions, seasonal fluctuations, weather conditions, demand, food safety concerns, generalized infectious diseases, product recalls and government\nregulations.\nIf any of our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately, or our distribution or supply relationships are disrupted for any reason, our business, financial condition, results of\noperations or cash flows could be adversely affected. If we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time, that could\nincrease our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants, which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu. If that were to happen,\naffected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter, if guests change their dining habits as a result. In addition, because we\nprovide moderately priced food, we may choose not to, or may be unable to, pass along commodity price increases to consumers. These potential changes in food and supply\ncosts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations may be subject to the effects of a rising rate of inflation which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nSupply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of ingredients and supplies that are critical to our restaurant operations. The markets for some of our\ningredients, such as beef and produce, are particularly volatile due to factors beyond our control such as limited sources, seasonal shifts, climate conditions, recent inflationary\ntrends, military and geopolitical conflicts and industry demand, including as a result of animal disease outbreaks, international commodity markets, food safety concerns,\nproduct recalls and government regulation. In addition, for certain of our ingredients and other materials, we have a limited number of suppliers and distributors. We remain in\nregular contact with our major suppliers and to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain; however, in 2022 costs for certain supplies and\ningredients, such as produce, packaging, dairy, beef and chicken increased materially and rapidly, and inflationary pressures could continue and/or spread to more categories as\ninflation increases continue across the global supply chain. Our efforts to mitigate future price risk through forward contracts, strong partnerships with key suppliers, careful\nplanning and other activities may not fully insulate us from increases in commodity costs, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nAny increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu, such as chicken, beef, dairy, wheat, produce, rice, and pork, would have a particularly adverse effect on\nour operating results. If the cost of one or more ingredients significantly increases, we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items that use those ingredients, or one\nof our proteins, rather than pay the increased cost. Any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic and could adversely impact our sales\nand brand.\nChanges in economic conditions could materially affect our ability to maintain or increase sales at our restaurants or open new restaurants.\nThe restaurant industry depends on consumer discretionary spending. The United States in general or the specific markets in which we operate may suffer from depressed\neconomic activity, recessionary economic cycles, higher fuel or energy costs, low consumer confidence, high levels of unemployment, reduced home values, increases in home\nforeclosures, investment losses, personal bankruptcies, reduced access to credit or other economic factors that may affect consumers’ discretionary spending. Sales in our\nrestaurants could decline if consumers choose to dine out less frequently or reduce the amount they spend on meals while dining out. Negative economic conditions might\ncause consumers to make long-term changes to their discretionary spending behavior, including dining out less frequently on a permanent basis. If restaurant sales decrease, our\nprofitability could decline as we spread fixed costs across a lower level of sales. Reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures could\nresult from prolonged negative restaurant sales, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n16\nWe may need capital in the future, and we may not be able to raise that capital on favorable terms.\nDeveloping our business will require significant capital in the future. To meet our capital needs, we expect to rely on equipment financing and facility improvements, cash\nflows from operations, the proceeds from the IPO, future offerings and other third-party financing. Third-party financing in the future may not, however, be available on terms\nfavorable to us, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to various factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, lender sentiment.\nThese factors may make the timing, amount, or terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive. Our inability to raise capital could impede our growth and could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our operations, financial condition, liquidity and financial results.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. For the past two and one-half years, this contagious\nvirus, has continued to spread and has adversely affected workforces, customers, economies and financial markets globally. In response to this outbreak, many state and local\nauthorities mandated the temporary closure of non-essential businesses and dine-in restaurant activity or limited indoor dining capacities. COVID-19 and the government\nmeasures taken to control it have caused a significant disruption to our business operation. As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of our restaurants are\noperating at 100% indoor dining capacity; however, there can be no assurance that developments with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic and government measures taken to\ncontrol it will not adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nAdditionally, consumer behavior has changed and may fundamentally change as a result of COVID-19 in both the near and long term and such change may pose significant\nchallenges to our current service and business models. Traffic in restaurants, including ours, has been affected and may be materially and adversely affected with more\nconsumers relying on off-premises orders. All of this could materially and adversely impact sales at our restaurants and our growth prospects. We have made adjustments to our\nrestaurant operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and may have to re-design our service and business models to accommodate consumers’ changed behavior patterns. Any\nsuch attempted effort could result in capital expenditures, business disruption and lower margin sales, and may not be successful in growing our profitability.\nIn addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States may experience in the future, outbreaks of other viruses, such as norovirus, the bird/avian flu or other diseases. As we\nhave experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic, if a regional or global health pandemic occurs, depending upon its location, duration and severity, our business could be\nseverely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Brand\nNegative publicity relating to one of our restaurants could reduce sales at some or all of our other restaurants.\nOur success is dependent in part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brand and consumers’ connection to our brand. We may, from time to time, be faced\nwith negative publicity relating to food quality, restaurant facilities, guest complaints or litigation alleging illness or injury, health inspection scores, integrity of our or our\nsuppliers’ food processing, employee relationships or other matters, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are held to be responsible. The negative\nimpact of adverse publicity relating to one restaurant may extend far beyond the restaurant involved to affect some or all of our other restaurants, thereby causing an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. A similar risk exists with respect to unrelated food service businesses, if consumers associate those\nbusinesses with our own operations.\nThe considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that could be generated by such incidents. Many social\nmedia platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted on\nsuch platforms may be adverse to our interests and/or may be inaccurate. The dissemination of inaccurate or irresponsible information online could harm our business,\nreputation, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations, regardless of the information’s accuracy. The damage may be immediate without affording us an opportunity\nfor redress or correction.\n17\nAdditionally, employee claims against us based on, among other things, wage and hour violations, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination may also create negative\npublicity that could adversely affect us and divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations. A\nsignificant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in the number of successful claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results\nof operations. Consumer demand for our restaurants and our brand’s value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters create negative publicity or\notherwise erode consumer confidence in us or our restaurants, which would likely result in lower sales and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\nFood safety and foodborne illness concerns could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe cannot guarantee that our internal controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food safety issues at our restaurants, including any occurrences of foodborne\nillnesses such as salmonella, E. coli and hepatitis A. In addition, there is no guarantee that our restaurant locations will maintain the high levels of internal controls and training\nwe require at our restaurants. Furthermore, we rely on third-party vendors, making it difficult to monitor food safety compliance and increasing the risk that foodborne illness\nwould affect multiple locations rather than a single restaurant. Some foodborne illness incidents could be caused by third-party vendors and transporters outside of our control.\nNew illnesses resistant to our current precautions may develop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise, that could give rise to claims or allegations on\na retroactive basis. One or more instances of foodborne illness in any of our restaurants or markets or related to food products we sell could negatively affect our restaurant\nsales nationwide if highly publicized on national media outlets or through social media. This risk exists even if it were later determined that the illness was wrongly attributed\nto us or one of our restaurants. A number of other restaurant chains have experienced incidents related to foodborne illnesses that have had a material adverse effect on their\noperations. The occurrence of a similar incident at one or more of our restaurants, or negative publicity or public speculation about an incident, could materially adversely affect\nour business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have, from time to time, received borrowings from a related party controlled by James Chae, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which may become repayable\non demand. Any unexpected calls for repayment of a significant amount of such borrowings may adversely affect our business.\nWe have, from time to time, have received unsecured borrowings from James Chae and his affiliate APIIS Financial, Inc., a company 100% owned and controlled by our\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Chae, which is unsecured, non-interest bearing, and is repayable on demand. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the\nbalance was $24,720 and $172,720, respectively. If James Chae or his affiliate APIIS Financial, Inc. chooses to call for repayment of a significant of such borrowings, we may\nneed to use the net proceeds from the IPO, which may adversely impact our operations. Any failure to service such indebtedness or comply with any such obligations may also\ncause us to incur legal fees if lender brings an action for breach of contract, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects.\nWe are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long-term non-cancelable leases.\nWe do not own any real property. Payments under our operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating expenses and we expect the new restaurants we open in\nthe future will similarly be leased. The majority of our operating leases have lease terms of 10 years, inclusive of customary extensions which are at the option of our company.\nMost of our leases require a fixed annual rent which generally increases each year, and some require the payment of additional rent if restaurant sales exceed a negotiated\namount. Generally, our leases are “net” leases, which require us to pay all of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. We generally cannot cancel these leases.\nAdditional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term non-cancelable leases. If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we\nmay nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In\naddition, as each of our leases expires, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to pay increased occupancy\ncosts or to close restaurants in desirable locations. If we fail to negotiate renewals, we may have to dispose of assets at such restaurant locations and incur closure costs as well\nas impairment of property and equipment. Furthermore, if we fail to negotiate renewals, we may incur additional costs associated with moving transferable furniture, fixtures\nand equipment. These potential increased occupancy and moving costs, as well as closures of restaurants, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations.\nMacroeconomic conditions, including economic downturns, may cause landlords of our leases to be unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing\nfinancing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required tenant improvement allowances or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition, tenants at shopping centers in\nwhich we are located or have executed leases, or to which our locations are near, may fail to open or may cease operations. Decreases in total tenant occupancy in shopping\ncenters in which we are located, or to which our locations are near, may affect traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.\n18\nFailure to receive frequent deliveries of fresh food ingredients and other supplies could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain our menu depends in part on our ability to acquire ingredients that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. To date, notwithstanding the current\nsupply chain disruptions which we believe have attributed to increased costs, deliveries have been consistent and not a source of material disruption to our business. However,\nshortages or interruptions in the supply of ingredients caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, food contamination, inclement weather or other\nconditions could adversely affect the availability and quality of our ingredients in the future, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any\nof our distributors or suppliers performs inadequately, or our distribution or supply relationships are materially disrupted for any reason, our business, financial condition or\nresults of operations could be adversely affected. If we cannot replace or engage distributors or suppliers who meet our specifications in a short period of time, that could\nincrease our expenses and cause shortages of food and other items at our restaurants, which could cause a restaurant to remove items from its menu. If that were to happen,\naffected restaurants could experience significant reductions in sales during the shortage or thereafter, if guests change their dining habits as a result. This reduction in sales\ncould materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, our approach to competing in the restaurant industry depends in large part on our continued ability to provide authentic and traditional Japanese cuisine that is free\nfrom artificial ingredients. As we increase our use of these ingredients, the ability of our suppliers to expand output or otherwise increase their supplies to meet our needs may\nbe constrained. We could face difficulties to obtain a sufficient and consistent supply of these ingredients on a cost-effective basis.\nNew information or attitudes regarding diet and health could result in changes in regulations and consumer consumption habits that could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the adverse health effects of consuming certain foods could result in changes in government\nregulation and consumer eating habits that may impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. These changes have resulted in, and may continue to result in,\nlaws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food offerings, and they have resulted in, and may continue to result in, laws and regulations affecting\npermissible ingredients and menu offerings. For example, a number of jurisdictions have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose to\nconsumers certain nutritional information, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. These requirements may be different or\ninconsistent with requirements we are subject to under the ACA which establishes a uniform, federal requirement for certain restaurants to post nutritional information on their\nmenus. Specifically, the ACA requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations operating under the same name and offering substantially the same menus to publish the total\nnumber of calories of standard menu items on menus and menu boards, along with a statement that puts this calorie information in the context of a total daily calorie intake. The\nACA also requires covered restaurants to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information for each standard menu item, and to\nprovide a statement on menus and menu boards about the availability of this information upon request. Unfavorable publicity about, or guests’ reactions to, our menu\ningredients, the size of our portions or the nutritional content of our menu items could negatively influence the demand for our offerings, thereby adversely affecting our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.\nCompliance with current and future laws and regulations regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items may be costly and time-consuming. Additionally,\nif consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and we may experience higher\ncosts associated with the implementation of those changes, as well as adversely affect the attractiveness of our restaurants to new or returning guests. We cannot predict the\nimpact of any new nutrition labeling requirements. The risks and costs associated with nutritional disclosures on our menus could also impact our operations, particularly given\ndifferences among applicable legal requirements and practices within the restaurant industry with respect to testing and disclosure, ordinary variations in food preparation\namong our own restaurants, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of nutritional information obtained from third-party suppliers.\nWe may not be able to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our\nmenu offerings to trends in eating habits. The imposition of menu labeling laws and an inability to keep up with consumer eating habits could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations, as well as our position within the restaurant industry in general.\n19\nWe rely significantly on information technology, and any material failure, weakness, interruption or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our\nbusiness.\nWe rely significantly on information systems, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants for management of our supply chain, payment of obligations, collection of\ncash, credit and debit card transactions and other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability\nand capacity of these systems. Failures of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, or a breach in security of\nthese systems could result in delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital\ninvestments.\nOur marketing programs may not be successful, and our new menu items, advertising campaigns and restaurant designs and remodels may not generate increased sales or\nprofits.\nWe incur costs and expend other resources in our marketing efforts on new menu items, advertising campaigns and restaurant designs and remodels to raise brand awareness\nand attract and retain guests. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher sales. Additionally, some of our competitors\nhave greater financial resources, which enable them to spend significantly more on marketing and advertising and other initiatives than we are able to. Should our competitors\nincrease spending on marketing and advertising and other initiatives or our marketing funds decrease for any reason, or should our advertising, promotions, new menu items\nand restaurant designs and remodels be less effective than our competitors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nOur marketing efforts rely heavily on the use of social media. In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including weblogs (blogs),\nmini-blogs, chat platforms, social media websites, and other forms of Internet-based communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and\nother interested persons. Many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media, and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed, potentially making\nmore traditional social media platforms obsolete. As a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with\nguests and brand relevance. We also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their\nawareness of, engagement with, and loyalty to our brand. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher sales or increased\nbrand recognition.\nRisks Related to Our People and Culture\nWe depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more key personnel or an inability to attract, hire, integrate and retain highly\nskilled personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executives, including James Chae. We also rely on our leadership team in setting our strategic direction,\noperating our business, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, identifying expansion opportunities, arranging necessary financing, and for general and administrative\nfunctions. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business.\nThe loss or replacement of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could have a serious adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of\noperations.\nTo continue to execute our growth strategy, we also must identify, hire and retain highly skilled personnel. We might not be successful in continuing to attract and retain\nqualified personnel. Failure to identify, hire and retain necessary key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLabor disputes may disrupt our operations and affect our profitability, thereby causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of\noperations.\nAs an employer, we are presently, and may in the future be, subject to various employment-related claims, such as individual or class actions or government enforcement\nactions relating to alleged employment discrimination, employee classification and related withholding, wage-hour, labor standards or healthcare and benefit issues. Any future\nactions if brought against us and successful in whole or in part, may affect our ability to compete or could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results\nof operations.\n20\nThe minimum wage, particularly in California, continues to increase and is subject to factors outside of our control.\nWe have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid wage rates based on the applicable federal or state minimum wage. Since January 1, 2023, the State of\nCalifornia has a minimum wage of $15.50 per hour. Moreover, municipalities may set minimum wages above the applicable state standards, including in the municipalities in\nwhich we operate.\nThe federal minimum wage has been $7.25 per hour since July 24, 2009. Any of federally-mandated, state-mandated or municipality-mandated minimum wages may be raised\nin the future which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If menu prices are increased by us to cover increased\nlabor costs, the higher prices could adversely affect sales and thereby reduce our margins and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in employment laws may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include employee classification as exempt/non-exempt\nfor overtime and other purposes, minimum wage requirements, tips and gratuity payments, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, immigration status and other\nwage and benefit requirements. Significant additional government-imposed increases in the following areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating\nresults or cash flow:\n● minimum wages;\n● tips and gratuities;\n● mandatory health benefits;\n● vacation accruals;\n● paid leaves of absence, including paid sick leave; and\n● tax reporting.\nIf we face labor shortages, increased labor costs or unionization activities, our growth, business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants. We are currently experiencing labor shortages which is a risk that we share with our competitors.\nAvailability of qualified employees is scarce. Additionally, labor costs have increased due to recent minimum wage increases in California and the fact that we employ fewer\nemployees who are working extended hours and therefore we are experiencing an increase of overtime payable to such employees, If we continue to face labor shortages or\nincreased labor costs because of these factors or as a result of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, additional increases in federal, state or local\nminimum wage rates or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health insurance coverage), our operating expenses could increase and our growth could\nbe adversely affected. In addition, our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of well-qualified restaurant operators and\nmanagement personnel, as well as a sufficient number of other qualified employees, to keep pace with our expansion schedule. Qualified individuals needed to fill these\npositions are in short supply in some geographic areas. In addition, restaurants have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates. We are experiencing\nproblems in recruiting and retaining employees, and our ability to recruit and retain such individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in higher\nemployee turnover in existing restaurants, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n21\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain sufficiently qualified individuals, our business and our growth could be adversely affected, thereby adversely affecting or business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations. Competition for these employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs. In addition,\nadditional increases in the minimum wage would increase our labor costs. Additionally, costs associated with workers’ compensation are rising, and these costs may continue to\nrise in the future. We may be unable to increase our menu prices in order to pass these increased labor costs on to consumers, in which case our margins would be negatively\naffected, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, our employees may elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If a\nsignificant number of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation\narrangements, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain visas or work permits or to properly verify the employment eligibility of our employees.\nAlthough we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our\nknowledge, be unauthorized workers. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties, and if any of our workers are found to be\nunauthorized, we could experience adverse publicity that may negatively impact our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of\na significant number of employees who are unauthorized employees may disrupt our operations, cause temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees and\nresult in adverse publicity. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of\nfederal and state immigration compliance laws. These factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Litigation\nFailure to comply with antibribery or anticorruption laws could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar applicable laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and other corrupt practices are the subject of increasing\nemphasis and enforcement around the world. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, there can be no\nassurance that our employees, contractors, agents, or other third parties will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law. Any such violations or suspected\nviolations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial fines and significant investigation costs, and could also materially damage our reputation, brands,\ninternational expansion efforts and growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations. Publicity relating to any noncompliance or alleged noncompliance\ncould also harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDelays In Obtaining Construction Permits Can Have A Material Adverse Effect on Our Business.\nWe typically are able to negotiate approximately 6 months to complete a construction/development of our stores before we have to make our first lease payment.\nConstruction/development of a new restaurant takes approximately three - six months once construction permits (e.g., Health and City) are issued. Prior to the COVID-19\npandemic, permits took approximately two months to obtain. During the pandemic and as of December 31, 2023, construction permits have been significantly delayed, causing\nus to incur lease payments prior to the opening of such locations, which means prior to the generation of any revenues from such stores. A delay in construction permits has had\na direct impact on our ability to open our three stores currently under construction/development. We are also making lease payments on all three of such stores. There can be no\nassurance that construction permits will be timely obtained on future stores, or that they will ever be obtained (including with respect to the two restaurants under\nconstruction/development). There is also no assurance that we can successfully negotiate an abatement on any of our existing non-cancelable leases to alleviate such costs, or\nthat we will have the leverage to negotiate longer periods before the first rental payment is required to be made on future leases. A significant increase in lease payments prior\nto opening our stores could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and growth potential, since increased lease costs could cause us to divert cash away from opening\nnew stores. If we are unable to open new stores, we could be forced to cease operations.\n22\nWe may become involved in lawsuits involving Yoshiharu Holdings Co. as the owner of intellectual property, or us as a licensee of intellectual property from Yoshiharu\nHoldings Co., to protect or enforce intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.\nThird parties may sue Yoshiharu Holdings Co., our wholly owned subsidiary, or us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. The party claiming infringement might\nhave greater resources than we do to pursue its claims, and we could be forced to incur substantial costs and devote significant management resources to defend against such\nlitigation, even if the claims are meritless and even if we ultimately prevail. If the party claiming infringement were to prevail, we could be forced to pay significant damages,\nor enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements with the prevailing party. In addition, any payments we are required to make, and any injunction we are required to\ncomply with as a result of such infringement, could harm our reputation and our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInfringements on Yoshiharu Holdings Co.’s intellectual property rights, including Yoshiharu Holdings Co.’s service marks and trade secrets, could result in additional expense\nand could devalue our brand equity, as well as substantially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOther parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights, including those which we develop or otherwise license to use, and may thereby dilute our brand in the\nmarketplace. Any such infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a commitment of our time and resources to protect these rights through\nlitigation or otherwise.\nOur business prospects depend in part on our ability to develop favorable consumer recognition of the Yoshiharu name. Although the “YOSHIHARU RAMEN” word and\ndesign marks are federally registered marks owned by Yoshiharu Holdings Co., such marks could be imitated in ways that we or Yoshiharu Holdings Co. cannot prevent.\nAlternatively, third parties may attempt to cause us to change our name or not operate in a certain geographic region if our name is confusingly similar to their name. In\naddition, we rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, concepts, and recipes, some of which we license from Yoshiharu Holdings Co. Our methods or Yoshiharu Holdings\nCo.’s methods of protecting this information may not be adequate. Moreover, we or Yoshiharu Holdings Co. may face claims of misappropriation or infringement of third\nparties’ rights that could interfere with our use of this information. Defending these claims may be costly and, if unsuccessful, may prevent us from continuing to use this\nproprietary information in the future, and may result in a judgment or monetary damages. We do not maintain confidentiality and non-competition agreements with all of our\nexecutives, key personnel, or suppliers. If competitors independently develop or otherwise obtain access to the trade secrets, proprietary know-how, concepts, or recipes we rely\nupon to operate our restaurants, some of which we license from Yoshiharu Holdings Co., the appeal of our restaurants could be significantly reduced and our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGovernmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local regulations. Our restaurants are subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation,\nfood and occupational safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses, approvals or permits for our\nrestaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings or affect the operations at our existing restaurants. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators\nwith respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment,\npublic accommodations and other areas, including our restaurants. We may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example, by adding access ramps or redesigning certain\narchitectural fixtures, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. The expenses associated with these modifications could be material.\nOur operations are also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, which governs worker health and safety, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such\nmatters as minimum wages and overtime, and a variety of similar federal, state and local laws that govern these and other employment law matters. In addition, federal, state\nand local proposals related to paid sick leave or similar matters could, if implemented, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n23\nCompliance with environmental laws may negatively affect our business.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge, storage,\nhandling, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance and\nliabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous\ntoxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual\nor alleged exposure to, such hazardous or toxic substances at, on or from our restaurants. Environmental conditions relating to releases of hazardous substances at prior, existing\nor future restaurant sites could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, environmental laws, and the administration,\ninterpretation and enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, each of which could materially adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nA breach of security of confidential consumer information related to our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions, as well as a breach of security of our\nemployee information, could substantially affect our reputation, business, financial condition of results of operations.\nThe majority of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information\nhas been stolen. We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card\ninformation, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these types of incidents. We may ultimately be held liable for the unauthorized use of a\ncardholder’s card number in an illegal activity and be required by card issuers to pay charge-back fees. In addition, most states have enacted legislation requiring notification of\nsecurity breaches involving personal information, including credit and debit card information. Any such claim or proceeding could cause us to incur significant unplanned\nexpenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may have\na material adverse effect on us and could substantially affect our reputation and business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, our business requires the collection, transmission and retention of large volumes of guest and employee data, including personally identifiable information, in\nvarious information technology systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide services. The collection and use of such\ninformation is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as at the international level, in which regulatory requirements have been increasing. As our environment\ncontinues to evolve in the digital age and reliance upon new technologies becomes more prevalent, it is imperative we secure the privacy and sensitive information we collect.\nFailure to do so, whether through fault of our own information systems or those of outsourced third-party providers, could not only cause us to fail to comply with these laws\nand regulations, but also could cause us to face litigation and penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our brand’s\nreputation and image as an employer could also be harmed by these types of security breaches or regulatory violations.\n24\nWe could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other\nremedies.\nOur guests may file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging we caused an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants, or that we have problems with\nfood quality or operations. We may also be subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims\nand claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, equal opportunity, discrimination and similar matters, and we are\npresently subject to class action and other lawsuits with regard to certain of these matters and could become subject to additional class action or other lawsuits related to these\nor different matters in the future. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may\ndivert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or\nprospects, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to state and local “dram shop” statutes, which may subject us to uninsured liabilities. These statutes generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to\nrecover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Because a plaintiff may seek punitive damages, which may not be\nfully covered by insurance, this type of action could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. A judgment in such an action\nsignificantly in excess of, or not covered by, our insurance coverage could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity\nresulting from any such allegations may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nThere are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Such losses could have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our current insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in\nour business in areas such as workers’ compensation, general liability, auto and property. In the future, our insurance premiums may increase, and we may not be able to obtain\nsimilar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all. Any substantial inadequacy of, or inability to obtain, insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. As a public company, we intend to obtain directors’ and officers’ insurance. While we expect to obtain such coverage, we\nmay not be able to obtain such coverage at all or at a reasonable cost now or in the future. Failure to obtain and maintain adequate directors’ and officers’ insurance would likely\nadversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\nFailure to obtain and maintain required licenses and permits or to comply with alcoholic beverage or food control regulations could lead to the loss of our liquor and food\nservice licenses and, thereby, harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to various federal, state and local government regulations, including those relating to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages. Such\nregulations are subject to change from time to time. The failure to obtain and maintain licenses, permits and approvals relating to such regulations could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition or results of operations. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked, suspended or denied renewal for cause at any time if\ngovernmental authorities determine that our conduct violates applicable regulations. Difficulties or failure to maintain or obtain the required licenses and approvals could\nadversely affect our existing restaurants and delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants, which would adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nAlcoholic beverage control regulations generally require our restaurants to apply to a state authority and, in certain locations, county or municipal authorities for a license that\nmust be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of daily operations of our\nrestaurants, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, other relationships with alcohol\nmanufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. Any future failure to comply with these regulations\nand obtain or retain liquor licenses could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n25\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure & Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely\nmanner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company.\nIf material weaknesses or control deficiencies occur in the future, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately on a timely basis, which could cause our reported\nfinancial results to be materially misstated and result in the loss of investor confidence or delisting and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have not performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, such as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, nor have we engaged our\nindependent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of our internal control over financial reporting as of any balance sheet date or for any period reported in our\nfinancial statements.\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges to existing accounting rules or regulations may impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. Other new accounting rules or regulations and varying\ninterpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. For instance, accounting regulatory authorities have recently issued new\naccounting rules which require lessees to capitalize operating leases in their financial statements in the next few years. When adopted, such change would require us to record\nsignificant operating lease obligations on our balance sheet and make other changes to our financial statements. This and other future changes to accounting rules or regulations\ncould materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we expect to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, particularly after we are no longer an\n“emerging growth company” as defined under the JOBS Act. In addition, new and changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public\ndisclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, as well as under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the JOBS\nAct, have created uncertainty for public companies and increased costs and time that boards of directors and management must devote to complying with these rules and\nregulations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules of the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market regulate corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect\ncompliance with these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from sales-generating\nactivities. For example, we will be required to adopt new internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, we will incur additional expenses associated with\nour SEC reporting requirements and increased compensation for our management team. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur as a public\ncompany or the specific timing of such costs.\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will\nmake our common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor as long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that\nare applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” These exceptions provide for, but are not limited to, relief from the auditor attestation\nrequirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, less extensive disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements,\nexemptions from the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously\napproved and an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no\nlonger an “emerging growth company.” We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have $1.07 billion or\nmore in annual gross revenues; (ii) the date on which we become a “large accelerated filer” (which means the year-end at which the total market value of our common equity\nsecurities held by non-affiliates is $700 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter); (iii) the date on which we have issued\nmore than $1 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period; and (iv) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public\noffering. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock to be\nless attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the market price of our common stock may be more volatile.\n26\nOur management does not have experience managing a U.S. public company and our current resources may not be sufficient to fulfill our public company obligations.\nFollowing the closing of the IPO, we are subject to various regulatory requirements, including those of the SEC and Nasdaq Stock Market. These requirements include\nrecordkeeping, financial reporting and corporate governance rules and regulations. Our management team does not have experience in managing a U.S. public company and,\nhistorically, has not had the resources typically found in a public company. Our internal infrastructure may not be adequate to support our increased reporting obligations and\nwe may be unable to hire, train or retain necessary staff and may be reliant on engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome our lack of experience or employees.\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if our internal infrastructure is inadequate, including if we are unable to engage outside\nconsultants or are otherwise unable to fulfill our public company obligations.\nPursuant to the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for so long as we are an “emerging growth company.”\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second\nannual report that we file with the SEC as a public company, and generally requires in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” We\nwill be an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have $1.07 billion or more in annual gross revenues; (ii) the date on\nwhich we become a “large accelerated filer” (which means the year-end at which the total market value of our common equity securities held by non-affiliates is $700 million\nor more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter); (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt\nsecurities over a three-year period; and (iv) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)\nof the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An “emerging growth company” can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards\nuntil those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to “opt out” of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply\nwith new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS\nAct provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\n27\nItem 1B.

[Reserved.]\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read this discussion and analysis together with our audited financial statements, the notes to such statements and the other financial information included\nin this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under the\nsection entitled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. See\n“CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these\nstatements.\nOverview of Yoshiharu\nWe are a fast-growing Japanese restaurant operator and was borne out of the idea of introducing the modernized Japanese dining experience to customers all over the world.\nSpecializing in Japanese ramen, we gained recognition as a leading ramen restaurant in Southern California within six months of our 2016 debut and have continued to expand\nour top-notch restaurant service across Southern California, currently owning and operating ten restaurant stores. We have opened one new restaurant in February 2024 and\ncurrently have two new locations under construction/development. We expect to complete the acquisition of three existing restaurants in the early second quarter of 2024 and\nalso plan to open an additional two to four new restaurants in 2024.\nWe take pride in our warm, hearty, smooth, and rich bone broth, which is slowly boiled for over twelve hours. Customers can taste and experience supreme quality and deep\nflavors. Combining the broth with the fresh, savory, and highest-quality ingredients, we serve the perfect, ideal ramen, as well as offers customers a wide variety of sushi rolls,\nbento menu and other favorite Japanese cuisine. Our acclaimed signature Tonkotsu Black Ramen has become a customer favorite with its slow cooked pork bone broth and\nfreshly made, tender chashu (braised pork belly).\nOur mission is to bring our Japanese ramen and cuisine to the mainstream, by providing a meal that customers find comforting. Since the inception of the business, we have\nbeen making our own ramen broth and other key ingredients such as pork chashu and flavored eggs from scratch, whereby upholding the quality and taste of our foods,\nincluding the signature texture and deep, rich flavor of our handcrafted broth. Moreover, we believe that slowly cooking the bone broth makes it high in collagen and rich in\nnutrients. We also strive to present food that is not only healthy, but also affordable. We feed, entertain and delight our customers, with our active kitchens and bustling dining\nrooms providing happy hours, student and senior discounts, and special holiday events. As a result of our vision, customers can comfortably enjoy our food in a friendly and\nwelcoming atmosphere.\nWe operate in a large and rapidly growing market. We believe the consumer appetite for Asian cuisine is widespread across many demographics and have an opportunity to\nexpand in both existing and new U.S. markets, as well as internationally.\n29\nOur Growth Strategies\nPursue New Restaurant Development.\nWe have pursued a disciplined new corporate owned growth strategy. Having expanded our concept and operating model across varying restaurant sizes and geographies, we\nplan to leverage our expertise by opening new restaurants to fill in existing markets and expand into new geographies. While we currently aim to achieve in excess of 100%\nannual unit growth rate over the next three to five years, we cannot predict the time period of which we can achieve any level of restaurant growth or whether we will achieve\nthis level of growth at all. Our ability to achieve new restaurant growth is impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including but not limited to\nlandlord delays; competition in existing and new markets, including competition for restaurant sites; and the lack of development and overall decrease in commercial real estate\ndue to macroeconomic decline. We believe there is a significant opportunity to employ this strategy to open additional restaurants in our existing markets and in new markets\nwith similar demographics and retail environments.\nDeliver Consistent Comparable Restaurant Sales Growth.\nWe have achieved positive comparable restaurant sales growth in recent periods. We believe we will be able to generate future comparable restaurant sales growth by growing\ntraffic through increased brand awareness, consistent delivery of a satisfying dining experience, new menu offerings, and restaurant renovations. We will continue to manage\nour menu and pricing as part of our overall strategy to drive traffic and increase average check. We are also exploring initiatives to grow sales of alcoholic beverages at our\nrestaurants, including the potential of a larger format restaurant with a sake bar concept. In addition to the strategies stated above, we expect to initiate sales of franchises in late\n2024 or early 2025.\nIncrease Profitability.\nWe have invested in our infrastructure and personnel, which we believe position us to continue to scale our business operations. As we continue to grow, we expect to drive\nhigher profitability both at a restaurant-level and corporate-level by taking advantage of our increasing buying power with suppliers and leveraging our existing support\ninfrastructure. Additionally, we believe we will be able to optimize labor costs at existing restaurants as our restaurant base matures and average revenues per restaurant\nincrease. We believe that as our restaurant base grows, our general and administrative costs will increase at a slower rate than our sales.\nHeighten Brand Awareness.\nWe intend to continue to pursue targeted local marketing efforts and plan to increase our investment in advertising. We also are exploring the development of instant ramen\nnoodles which we would distribute through retail channels. We intend to explore partnerships with grocery retailers to provide for small-format Yoshiharu kiosks in stores to\npromote a limited selection of Yoshiharu cuisine.\nAppointment of New Director\nOn February 17, 2023, we accepted independent director Helen Lee’s formal resignation, effective immediately. Ms. Lee’s decision to resign was not due to any disagreement\nwith the company on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices (financial or otherwise). She was replaced on the same day by Ms. Harinne Kim.\n30\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue. Revenue represents sales of food and beverages in restaurants. Restaurant sales in a given period are directly impacted by the number of restaurants we operate and\ncomparable restaurant sales growth.\nFood and beverage. Food and beverage costs are variable in nature, change with sales volume and are influenced by menu mix and subject to increases or decreases based on\nfluctuations in commodity costs. Other important factors causing fluctuations in food and beverage costs include seasonality and restaurant-level management of food waste.\nFood and beverage costs are a substantial expense and are expected to grow proportionally as our sales grow.\nLabor. Labor includes all restaurant-level management and hourly labor costs, including wages, employee benefits and payroll taxes. Similar to the food and beverage costs that\nwe incur, labor and related expenses are expected to grow proportionally as our sales increase. Factors that influence fluctuations in our labor and related expenses include\nminimum wage and payroll tax legislation, the frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, healthcare costs and the performance of our restaurants.\nRent and utilities. Rent and utilities include rent for all restaurant locations and related taxes.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses are periodic non-cash charges that consist of depreciation of fixed assets, including\nequipment and capitalized leasehold improvements. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives, ranging from three to ten\nyears.\nDelivery and service fees. Our customers may order online through third party service providers such as Uber Eats, Door Dash, Grubhub and others. These third-party service\nproviders charge delivery and order fees to the company.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses include expenses associated with corporate and regional supervision functions that support the\noperations of existing restaurants and development of new restaurants, including compensation and benefits, travel expenses, stock-based compensation expenses for corporate-\nlevel employees, legal and professional fees, marketing costs, information systems, corporate office rent and other related corporate costs. General and administrative expenses\nare expected to grow as our sales grows, including incremental legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses incurred as a public company.\nAdvertising and marketing expenses. Advertising and marketing expenses include expenses associated with marketing campaigns and periodic advertising. Advertising and\nmarketing expenses are expected to grow leading up to planned openings of restaurant locations and is expected to stabilize as an average by location as our sales grows.\nInterest expenses. Interest expenses include non-cash charges related to our capital lease obligations and bank notes payable.\nIncome tax provision (benefit). Provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local current and deferred income tax expenses.\n31\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents selected comparative results of operations from our audited financial statements for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 compared\nto the three months and year ended December 31, 2022.

Revenues were $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of\napproximately $0.9 million, or 11.3%. The increase in sales for the year was partially driven by $0.3 million in sales for the period from one new restaurant opened in July 2022\nand another $0.7 million in sales from a new restaurant opened in April 2023, which were offset by a $0.1 million decrease in other restaurants. The seven restaurant locations\nthat were open through all of 2022 and 2023 experienced a slight decrease in sales. Combined average monthly sales for these locations decreased by 0.8% for the year 2023\ncompared to 2022. Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2022 were comparable to the three months ended December 31, 2022 although there was one more\nrestaurant opened in the comparable period.\nFood, beverage and supplies. Food, beverage and supplies costs were approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $2.2 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of approximately $0.2 million, or 9.9%. The increase in costs for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven\nby increases in revenues from the new restaurant opened in April 2023. As a percentage of sales, food, beverage and supply costs were comparable during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022. Food, beverage and supplies costs were approximately $590 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to $670\nthousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of approximately $80 thousand or 11.9%.\nLabor. Labor and related costs were approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nrepresenting an increase of approximately $0.6 million, or 15.4%. The increase in costs was largely driven by additional labor costs incurred with respect to a new restaurant\nopened in April 2023 and in December 2023. As a percentage of sales, labor and related costs slightly increased during the comparable years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022. Labor and related costs were approximately $1.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to $1.0 million for the three months ended December\n31, 2022, representing an increase of approximately $0.1 million, or 7.8%. The increase in costs was mainly due to the new restaurant opened in April 2023.\nRent and utilities. Rent and utilities expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 slightly increased compared to the year ended in December 31, 2022. The increase was\nprimarily a result of additional occupancy expenses incurred with respect to a new restaurant opened in April 2023. As a percentage of sales, rent and utilities expenses\ndecreased to 12.3% in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in costs as a percentage of sales was\nprimarily driven by the increases in sales volume from both existing restaurants and a new location. Rent and utilities expenses were approximately $289 thousand for the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2023 compared to $348 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of approximately $60 thousand, or\n17.1%.\nDelivery and service fees. Delivery and service fees incurred were approximately $564 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $526 thousand for the year\nended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of approximately $38 thousand or 7.3%, primarily due to an increase in food sales via delivery during the comparable\nperiod. As a percentage of sales, delivery and service fees ratio for the year ended December 31, 2023 was comparable to the ratio in the prior year due to comparable sales mix\nbetween the dining-in and take-out. Delivery and service fees incurred were approximately $149 thousand the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to $152\nthousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of approximately $3 thousand or 2.2% primarily due to a decrease in food sales via delivery\nduring the comparable period.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses incurred were approximately $546 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared\nto $658 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of approximately $113 thousand, or 17.1%. The decrease was primarily due to the changes in\nestimated depreciable lives for existing restaurants during the first quarter in 2022. As a result, the depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to\n5.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 7.9% for year ended December 31, 2022. Depreciation and amortization expenses incurred were approximately $149\nthousand for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to $103 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of approximately\n$46 thousand or 44.6% due to the increase in fixed assets during the comparable period.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were approximately $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $2.9 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of approximately $0.5 million or 18.5%. This increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily\ndue to the hiring of additional administrative employees, increases in professional services and corporate-level costs to support growth plans, and the construction/development\nof new restaurants. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 37.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023 from 34.8% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to the significant increase in necessary corporate costs mentioned above outpacing the increase in sales. General and administrative expenses\nwere approximately $719 thousands for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to $982 thousands for the three months ended December 31, 2022, representing a\ndecrease of approximately $263 thousands or 26.8%. This decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to the non-recurring expenses incurred for the IPO during\nthe comparing period in 2022.\nRelated party compensation: Compensation to James Chae was approximately $340 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $917 thousand for the year\nended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of approximately $577 thousand. With the IPO in September 2022, the board has approved a success bonus to James Chae\nfor the amount and the employment contract was made with James Chae in November 2022 for the management of our company. As a percentage of sales, related party\ncompensation was 3.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 11.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Compensation to James Chae was approximately $123\nthousand for the three months ended December 31, 2023 per the employment contract made in November 2022.\n33\nKey Performance Indicators\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and performance measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing\ninclude sales, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-level Operating Profit, Restaurant-level Operating Profit margin, Average Unit Volumes (“AUVs”), comparable\nrestaurant sales performance, and the number of restaurant openings.\nRevenue\nRevenue represents sales of food and beverages in restaurants, as shown on our statements of income. Several factors affect our restaurant sales in any given period including\nthe number of restaurants in operation, guest traffic and average check.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus stock-based\ncompensation expense, non-cash lease expense and asset disposals, closure costs and restaurant impairments, as well as certain items, such as employee retention credit,\nlitigation accrual, and certain executive transition costs, that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted\nEBITDA divided by sales. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures which are intended as supplemental measures of our performance and are neither required\nby, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain\nfinancial and business trends relating to our financial condition and operating results. However, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of the operating\nresults of the company as a whole and such measures should be reviewed in conjunction with our GAAP financial results.\nWe believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing\nour financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware when\nevaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of\nthese measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may\nnot be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with\nGAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review\nthe reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nYears Ended Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nNet income (loss), as reported $ (3,040,364) $ (3,487,367) $ 8,597 $ (1,121,116)\nInterest, net 218,153 88,300 31,276 26,424\nTaxes 48,647 19,245 19,579 6,576\nDepreciation and amortization 545,549 658,371 149,161 103,147\nEBITDA (2,228,015) (2,721,451) 208,613 (984,969)\nPPP loan forgiveness (a) - (385,900) - -\nRRF loan forgiveness (b) (700,454) - (700,454) -\nRestaurants opening costs (c) 545,841 169,790 114,769 103,27\nGain on disposal of fixed asset (8,920) - - -\nRelated party compensation (d) - 631,968 - -\nProfessional fees (e) - 66,686 - 66,686\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (2,391,548) $ (2,238,907) $ (377,072) $ (815,056)\n(a) Represents income recorded upon the forgiveness of payroll protection loans from the SBA.\n(b) Represents income recorded upon the forgiveness of loan from restaurant revitalization fund.\n(c) Represents expenses incurred to secure the restaurant locations under development and costs to reserve back-office managers to manage those restaurants.\n(d) Represents non-recurring IPO success bonus.\n(e) Represents non-recurring professional expenses incurred for the IPO preparation\nRestaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution Margin\nRestaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in\naccordance with, GAAP. We believe that Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin provide useful information to management and investors\nregarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and operating results. We expect Restaurant-level Contribution to increase in proportion to the\nnumber of new restaurants we open and our comparable restaurant sales growth.\nWe present Restaurant-level Contribution because it excludes the impact of general and administrative expenses, which are not incurred at the restaurant-level. We also use\nRestaurant-level Contribution to measure operating performance and returns from opening new restaurants. Restaurant-level Contribution margin allows us to evaluate the level\nof Restaurant-level Contribution generated from sales.\n34\nHowever, you should be aware that Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin are financial measures which are not indicative of overall results\nfor the company, and Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin do not accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders because of corporate-level\nexpenses excluded from such measures.\nIn addition, when evaluating Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to\nthose excluded when calculating these measures. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by\nunusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled\nmeasures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin in the same fashion.\nRestaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant- level Contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for\nanalysis of our results as reported under GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles net restaurant operating income to Restaurant-level Contribution and Restaurant-level Contribution margin for the years and three months ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYears Ended Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nNet restaurant operating income, as reported $ 364,394 $ 166,095 $ 218,125 $ 236,803\nDepreciation and amortization 545,549 658,371 149,161 103,147\nRestaurant-level Contribution $ 909,943 $ 824,466 $ 367,286 $ 339,950\nOperating profit margin 4.0% 2.0% 8.7% 9.3%\nRestaurant-level Contribution Margin (a) 9.9% 10.0% 14.7% 13.4%\n(a) Represents restaurant-level contribution divided by revenue.\nAverage Unit Volumes (AUVs)\n“Average Unit Volumes” or “AUVs” consist of the average annual sales of all restaurants that have been open for 3 months or longer at the end of the year presented. AUVs are\ncalculated by dividing (x) annual sales for the year presented for all such restaurants by (y) the total number of restaurants in that base. We make fractional adjustments to sales\nfor restaurants that were not open for the entire year presented (such as a restaurant closed for renovation) to annualize sales for such period of time. This measurement allows\nmanagement to assess changes in consumer spending patterns at our restaurants and the overall performance of our restaurant base.\nThe following table shows the AUVs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2023, respectively:\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nAverage Unit Volumes $ 1,067,726 $ 1,182,032\nComparable Restaurant Sales Growth\nComparable restaurant sales growth represents the change in year-over-year sales for restaurants open for at least three months prior to the start of the accounting period\npresented, including those temporarily closed for renovations during the year. Measuring our comparable restaurant sales growth allows us to evaluate the performance of our\nexisting restaurant base. Various factors impact comparable restaurant sales, including:\n● consumer recognition of our brand and our ability to respond to changing consumer preferences;\n● overall economic trends, particularly those related to consumer spending;\n● our ability to operate restaurants effectively and efficiently to meet consumer expectations;\n● pricing;\n● guest traffic;\n● per-guest spend and average check;\n● marketing and promotional efforts;\n● local competition; and\n● opening of new restaurants in the vicinity of existing locations.\n35\nThe following table shows the comparable restaurant sales growth for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nComparable restaurant sales growth (%) -0.8% 9.9%\nComparable restaurant base 7 5\nNumber of Restaurant Openings\nThe following table shows the growth in our restaurant base for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRestaurant activity:\nBeginning of period 8 6\nOpenings 2 2\nClosing - -\nEnd of period 10 8\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary uses of cash are for operational expenditures and capital investments, including new restaurants, costs incurred for restaurant remodels and restaurant fixtures.\nHistorically, our main sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations, borrowings from banks, and sales of common shares.\nIn September 2022, we consummated our IPO”) of 2,940,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at a public offering price of $4.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of\n$11,760,000. Net proceeds from the IPO were approximately $10.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of\napproximately $1.5 million.\nWe believe that the expected cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the IPO will be adequate to fund operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and working\ncapital obligations for at least the next 12 months and thereafter.\n36\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nYears ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nStatement of Cash Flow Data:\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (4,591,656) $ (3,798,770)\nNet cash used in investing activities (1,471,151) (1,473,275)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 1,386,347 10,694,064\nCash Flows Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $4,591,656, which resulted from net loss of $3,040,364, a non-cash charge of $545,549 for\ndepreciation and amortization which was offset by the forgiveness of Restaurant Revitalization Fund (“RRF”) of $700,454, a gain on disposal of fixed asset of $8,920 and net\ncash outflows of $1,387,467 from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily the result of\nan increase in other assets of $1,252,669, decreases due to related party expenses of $148,544 and accounts payable and accrued expenses of $33,915, which was offset by an\nincrease in other payables of $59,785. The increase in other assets of $1,252,669 primarily consists of a payment of $729,352 in escrow to acquire assets of three restaurants in\nLas Vegas, $294,276 in escrow to purchase a restaurant in Southern California and an investment of $300,000 in a financial company for a fixed interest income.\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $3,798,770, which resulted from net loss of $3,487,367, non-cash charges of $658,371 for\ndepreciation and amortization which was offset by the PPP loan forgiveness of $385,900, and net cash outflows of $583,874 from changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nThe net loss was significantly higher for the period relative to prior periods as a result of restaurant startup costs and increased general and administrative expenses. The net\ncash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily the result of a decrease of $1,276,193 due to related party expense, and an increase of $150,404 in\nother assets, partially offset by an increase of $867,049 in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The decreases in payables to related parties were the result of repayment of\nexpenditures incurred by the related parties in connection with the opening of new restaurants. The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the three new restaurants\nopened in July 2021, February 2022 and July 2022.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1,471,151 and $1,473,275, respectively. These expenditures in each period are\nprimarily related to purchases of property and equipment in connection with current and future restaurant openings and maintaining our existing restaurants.\n37\nCash Flows Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1,386,347, primarily due to $700,000 in advance from line of credit, refinanced and\nnew bank borrowings of $812,000 and $595,400 in loan payable to financial institution, offset by $715,892 of repayment of bank borrowings and $61,161 repayment of loan\npayable to financial institutions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $10,694,064, primarily due to $10,285,650 in net proceeds from the sale of 2,940,000\nshares of Class A Common Stock after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses in September 2022, $60,000 in proceeds from the sale of\nClass A Common Stock in December 2021, and $558,133 cash received through borrowings from banks, offset by $209,719 of repayment of borrowings.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents our commitments and contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023, as well as our long-term obligations:\nPayments due by period as of December 31, 2023\nTotal 2024-2025 2026-2027 2028 Thereafter\nCapital lease payments $ 7,913,897 $ 1,817,623 $ 1,801,876 $ 862,836 $ 3,431,562\nBank note payables 1,406,329 692,452 361,430 90,029 262,418\nEIDL loan payables 425,865 21,453 23,121 12,226 369,065\nLoans payable to financial institutions 534,239 534,239 - - -\nTotal contractual obligations $ 10,280,330 $ 3,065,767 $ 2,186,427 $ 965,091 $ 4,063,045\nIncome Taxes\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal and California state jurisdictions.\nWe are considered a U.S. corporation and a regarded entity for U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. Accordingly, a provision will be recorded for the anticipated tax\nconsequences of our reported results of operations for U.S. federal, state and foreign income taxes.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements for up\nto five years or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. The JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can delay adopting new\nor revised accounting standards until those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. Accordingly, our\nfinancial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2023, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to utilize estimates and make judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions\nthat management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates are evaluated by management on an ongoing basis, and the results of these evaluations form\na basis for making decisions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although actual results may differ from these\nestimates under different assumptions or conditions, management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are reasonable. The critical\naccounting policies affecting our financial reporting are summarized in Note 2 to the financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n38\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have determined that all other issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements are inapplicable or insignificant to us and once adopted are not expected to have a\nmaterial impact on our financial position.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe Financial Statements and Supplementary Data required by this Item 8 are incorporated by reference to information beginning on Page F-1 of this Form 10-K.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), as of December 31, 2023. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as\nof December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports\nthat we file or submit under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”) rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to\nallow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure.\nManagement has identified control deficiencies regarding inadequate accounting resources, the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control\nenvironment. Management believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of our accounting staff. The small size of our accounting outsourced staff may\nprevent adequate controls in the future due to the cost/benefit of such remediation.\nTo mitigate the current limited resources and limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and\naccounting professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties within the internal\ncontrol framework.\nThese control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of account balances that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial\nstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order to conclude that our\nfinancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were fairly stated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly,\nmanagement believes that despite our material weaknesses, our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in\naccordance with GAAP.\n39\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-\n15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that:\n● pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n● provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n● provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\nBecause of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, our management used the\ncriteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 2013 Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based upon this\nassessment, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2023 our internal controls over financial reporting were ineffective.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no\nmatter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating\nthe benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nTrading Plans\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, no director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of the company adopted or terminated a “Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.\nNot applicable.\nPART III\nItem 10.

As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the\ncorporate governance rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a controlled company, exemptions under the standards free us from the obligation to comply with certain corporate\ngovernance requirements, including the requirements:\n● that a majority of our board of directors consists of “independent directors,” as defined under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market;\n● that we have, to the extent applicable, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written\ncharter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities;\n● that we have a Compensation Committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and\nresponsibilities; and\n● for an annual performance evaluation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee.\nSince we intend to avail ourselves of the “controlled company” exception under the Nasdaq Stock Market rules, we do not have a Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee. These exemptions do not modify the independence requirements for our Audit Committee, and we are in compliance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the\nExchange Act and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nBased on the Nasdaq Stock Market corporate governance rules and the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act, our board of directors has determined\nthat Jay Kim, Harinne Kim and Yusil Yeo are each an independent director.\nCorporate Governance and Board Structure\nOur board of directors currently consists of four members. Our bylaws provide that our board of directors shall consist of at least three directors but not more than eleven\ndirectors and the authorized number of directors may be fixed from time to time by resolution of our board of directors. Based on the corporate governance rules of the Nasdaq\nStock Market, Jay Kim, Harinne Kim and Yusil Yeo are independent directors.\nThe authorized number of directors may be changed by resolution of the board of directors. Vacancies on the board of directors can be filled by the affirmative vote of a\nmajority of the remaining directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, and shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the stockholders or until his or her successor\nis duly elected and qualified. Mr. Chae serves as the Chairman of our board of directors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure & Ownership of\nOur Common Stock.”\nOur directors hold office until the earlier of their death, resignation, retirement, qualification or removal or until their successors have been duly elected and qualified.\nWe have not made any material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to the registrant’s board of directors since our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\n42\nOur board of directors has fully implemented our corporate governance initiatives upon the closing of the IPO. We believe these initiatives comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nand the rules and regulations of the SEC adopted thereunder. In addition, we believe our corporate governance initiatives comply with the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nOur board of directors will continue to evaluate, and improve upon as appropriate, our corporate governance principles and policies.\nOur board of directors has adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to each of our directors, officers and employees. The code addresses various topics,\nincluding:\n● compliance with laws, rules and regulations;\n● conflicts of interest;\n● insider trading;\n● corporate opportunities;\n● competition and fair dealing;\n● fair employment practices;\n● recordkeeping;\n● confidentiality;\n● protection and proper use of company assets; and\n● payments to government personnel.\nThe full text of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on our website at ir.yoshiharuramen.com. We intend to provide on our website all disclosures that are\nrequired by law or market rules in regard to any amendments to, or waivers from, any provision of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nBoard Committees\nOur board of directors has two standing committees: an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee. Each of the committees report to the board of directors as they deem\nappropriate, and as the board of directors may request. In the future, our board of directors may establish other committees, as it deems appropriate, to assist it with its\nresponsibilities. We comply with the requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market with respect to committee composition of independent directors as they become applicable to us.\nEach committee has the composition, duties and responsibilities described below.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee provides assistance to the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities regarding the integrity of financial statements, our compliance with\napplicable legal and regulatory requirements, the integrity of our financial reporting processes including its systems of internal accounting and financial controls, the\nperformance of our internal audit function and independent auditor and our financial policy matters by approving the services performed by our independent accountants and\nreviewing their reports regarding our accounting practices and systems of internal accounting controls. The Audit Committee also oversees the audit efforts of our independent\naccountants and takes action as it deems necessary to satisfy itself that the accountants are independent of management.\nOur Audit Committee consists of Jay Kim, Harinne Kim and Yusil Yeo with Ms. Yeo serving as the Audit Committee chairperson.\n43\nJay Kim, Harinne Kim and Yusil Yeo meet the definition of “independent directors” for the purposes of serving on an Audit Committee under applicable SEC and Nasdaq Stock\nMarket rules, and we are in compliance with these independence requirements. In addition, Jay Kim, Harinne Kim and Yusil Yeo qualify as our “audit committee financial\nexperts,” as such term is defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K.\nIn general, an “audit committee financial expert” is an individual member of the audit committee or board of directors who:\n● understands generally accepted accounting principles and financial statements;\n● is able to assess the general application of such principles in connection with accounting for estimates, accruals and reserves;\n● has experience preparing, auditing, analyzing or evaluating financial statements comparable to the breadth and complexity to our financial statements;\n● understands internal controls over financial reporting; and\n● understands audit committee functions.\nOur board of directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, which is available on our corporate website at https://ir.yoshiharuramen.com/corporate-\ngovernance/governance-documents.\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee oversees our overall compensation structure, policies and programs, and assesses whether our compensation structure establishes appropriate\nincentives for officers and employees. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to compensation of our chief executive\nofficer and other executive officers, evaluates the performance of these officers in light of those goals and objectives, sets the compensation of these officers based on such\nevaluations and reviews and recommends to the board of directors any employment-related agreements, any proposed severance arrangements or change in control or similar\nagreements with these officers. The Compensation Committee also grants stock options and other awards under our stock plans. The Compensation Committee will review and\nevaluate, at least annually, the performance of the Compensation Committee and its members and the adequacy of the charter of the Compensation Committee.\nOur Compensation Committee consists of Jay Kim and Harinne Kim, with Mr. Kim serving as the Compensation Committee chairperson.\nOur board of directors has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee, which is available at https://ir.yoshiharuramen.com/corporate-governance/governance-\ndocuments. As a controlled company, we may rely upon the exemption from the requirement that we have a Compensation Committee composed entirely of independent\ndirectors, although our Compensation Committee consists entirely of independent directors.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks\nWe anticipate that none of our employees will serve on the Compensation Committee. None of the members of our Compensation Committee has ever been an officer or\nemployee of us.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nOur board of directors has adopted corporate governance guidelines in accordance with the corporate governance rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n44\nRisk Oversight\nOur board of directors is currently responsible for overseeing our risk management process. The board of directors focuses on our general risk management strategy and the\nmost significant risks facing us and ensures that appropriate risk mitigation strategies are implemented by management. The board of directors is also apprised of particular risk\nmanagement matters in connection with its general oversight and approval of corporate matters and significant transactions.\nOur board of directors does not have a standing risk management committee, but rather will administer this oversight function directly through our board of directors as a\nwhole, as well as through various standing committees of our board of directors that address risks inherent in their respective areas of oversight. In particular, our board of\ndirectors will be responsible for monitoring and assessing strategic risk exposure, our Audit Committee will be responsible for overseeing our major financial risk exposures\nand the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures and our Compensation Committee will assess and monitor whether any of our compensation\npolicies and programs has the potential to encourage unnecessary risk-taking. In addition, our Audit Committee oversees the performance of our internal audit function and\nconsider and approve or disapprove any related-party transactions.\nOur management is responsible for day-to-day risk management. This oversight includes identifying, evaluating, and addressing potential risks that may exist at the enterprise,\nstrategic, financial, operational, compliance and reporting levels.\nRisk and Compensation Policies\nWe have analyzed our compensation programs and policies to determine whether those programs and policies are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.\nLeadership Structure of the Board of Directors\nThe positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are presently the same person and we do not have a lead independent director. As our bylaws and corporate\ngovernance guidelines do not require that our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions be separate, our board of directors believes that having positions be held by the\nsame person is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time. As of December 31, 2023, we have determined that the leadership structure of our board of directors has\npermitted our board of directors to fulfill its duties effectively and efficiently and is appropriate given the size and scope of our company and its financial condition.\nCompliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to\nfile with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities. These executive officers, directors, and\ngreater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by such reporting persons. Based solely on our\nreview of such forms furnished to us and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2023, all reports\napplicable to our executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were filed in a timely manner in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.\nShort Swing Profit Disgorgement\nJames Chae, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has disbursed $2,500 to us in order for us to recapture short swing profits received by James when he acquired shares\nand sold them for a profit in 2023.\nInsider Trading Policy\nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics prohibits our directors, officers, and employees from purchasing or selling our securities while being aware of material, non-public\ninformation about our company as well as disclosing such information to others who may trade in securities of our company, and otherwise requires compliance with insider\ntrading laws. We are in the process of developing a more robust insider trading policy that will apply to our directors, officers, and employees that will prohibit: (i) trading our\nsecurities during certain established periods and when in possession of material non-public information; (ii) unless approved in advance in limited circumstances by the policy\nadministrator, the hedging of our securities, including short sales or purchases or sales of derivative securities based on our securities; and (iii) the use of our securities to secure\na margin or other loan.\nItem 11. Executive Compensation\nCompensation Philosophy\nOur compensation philosophy includes:\n● pay for performance;\n● fair compensation that is competitive with market standards;\n● compensation mix according to growth stage of our company as well as job level; and\n● incentivizing employees to work for long-term sustainable and profitable growth of our company.\n45\nObjective of Executive Compensation Program\nThe objective of our compensation program is to provide a fair and competitive compensation package in the industry to each named executive officer (“NEO”) that will enable\nus to:\n● attract and hire outstanding individuals to achieve our mid-term and long-term visions;\n● motivate, develop and retain employees; and\n● align the financial interests of each named executive officer with the interests of our stakeholders including stockholders and encourage each named executive\nofficer to contribute to enhance value of our company.\nOur named executive officers for the year 2023, were:\n● James Chae, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and\n● Soojae Ryan Cho, Chief Financial Officer.\nAdministration\nFollowing the consummation of this offering, our Compensation Committee, which includes two independent directors, will oversee our executive compensation program and\nwill be responsible for approving the nature and amount of the compensation paid to our NEOs. The committee will also administer our equity compensation plan and awards.\nElements of Compensation\nOur compensation program for NEOs consists of the following elements of compensation, each described in greater depth below:\n● base salaries;\n● performance-based bonuses;\n● equity-based incentive compensation; and\n● general benefits.\nBase Salary\nBase salaries are an annual fixed level of cash compensation to reflect each NEO’s performance, role and responsibilities, and retention considerations.\nPerformance-Based Bonus\nTo incentivize management to drive strong operating performance and reward achievement of our company’s business goals, our executive compensation program includes\nperformance-based bonuses for NEOs. Our Compensation Committee has established annual target performance-based bonuses for each NEO during the first quarter of the\nfiscal year.\n46\nEquity Compensation\nWe may pay equity-based compensation to our NEOs in order to link our long-term results achieved for our stockholders and the rewards provided to NEOs, thereby ensuring\nthat such NEOs have a continuing stake in our long-term success.\nGeneral Benefits\nOur NEOs are provided with other fringe benefits that we believe are commonly provided to similarly situated executives.\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following table summarizes the compensation awarded to, earned by or paid to our NEOs for the years 2023 and 2022:\nSummary Compensation Table – Officers\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j)\nChange in\nPension\nValue and\nNon-equity Nonqualified\nName and Incentive deferred\nPrincipal Stock Option plan compensation All other\nPosition Year Salary Bonus Awards Awards compensation earnings compensation Total\n($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($) ($)\nJames Chae,\nCEO\nand Chairman of\nthe Board 2023 $ 285,000 $ 55,000 -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- $ 340,000\nSoojae Ryan\nCho,\nCFO 2023 $ 144,000 -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- $ 144,000\nJames Chae,\nCEO\nand Chairman of\nthe Board 2022 $ 285,000 $ 632,000 -0- -0- -0- -0- -0- $ 917,000\nSoojae Ryan\nCho,\nCFO 2022 $ 91,000 -0- $ 56,000 -0- -0- -0- -0- $ 147,000\nNarrative to Summary Compensation Table\nWe entered into an employment contract on November 21, 2022 with James Chae as Chief Executive Officer for an annual salary of $285,000. There is no stock options and/or\nwarrants program at this time, but one may be developed in the future. A copy of the employment contract is attached hereto as an exhibit.\n47\nWe engaged Soojae Ryan Cho effective May 23, 2022 to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the company, effective immediately. The company’s offer letter provides for\nemployment at will, for an initial term through May 22, 2023, which shall automatically renew annually, unless we determine not to renew the term with 60 days prior written\nnotice. We have agreed to compensate Mr. Cho $144,000 per year, with yearly adjustments, based on performance. Mr. Cho shall also receive a restricted stock grant equal to\n$56,000 in shares of Class A Common Stock which will vest 3 months from the date of engagement. A copy of the offer letter is attached hereto as an exhibit.\nExcept as set forth above we do not currently have employment agreements with any of our NEOs.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at the Year End\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding equity awards for each of the NEOs.\nPayments Upon Termination or Change in Control\nNone of our NEOs are entitled to receive payments or other benefits upon termination of employment or a change in control.\nRetirement Plans\nWe do not maintain any deferred compensation, retirement, pension or profit-sharing plans.\nOmnibus Equity Incentive Plan\nOn February 4, 2022, we adopted an incentive plan, which we refer to as the 2022 Plan, the material terms of which are described below.\nKey Features\nThe 2022 Plan includes a number of provisions that promote best practices by reinforcing the alignment between equity compensation arrangements for eligible employees,\nnon-employee directors and other service providers and stockholders’ interests. These provisions include, but are not limited to, the following (which are qualified in their\nentirety by the actual text of the 2022 Plan, which is attached as an exhibit to this Report):\n● No Discounted Options or SARs. Stock options and SARs (as defined below) generally may not be granted with exercise prices lower than the market value of the\nunderlying shares on the grant date.\n● No Repricing without Stockholder Approval. Other than in connection with a change in our capitalization, at any time when the purchase price of a stock option or\nSAR is above the market value of a share, we will not, without stockholder approval, reduce the purchase price of the stock option or SAR and will not exchange the\nstock option or SAR for a new award with a lower (or no) purchase price or for cash.\n● No Transferability. Awards generally may not be transferred, except as otherwise provided in the 2022 Plan will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless\napproved by the Board and/or the Compensation Committee.\n● No Automatic Grants. The 2022 Plan does not provide for automatic grants to any individual.\n● Multiple Award Types. The 2022 Plan permits the issuance of nonstatutory stock options (NSOs), incentive stock options (ISOs), stock appreciation rights (SARs),\nrestricted stock units (RSUs), restricted stock, other stock-based awards, and cash awards. This breadth of award types will enable us to tailor awards in light of the\naccounting, tax, and other standards applicable at the time of grant.\n● Clawbacks. All awards, amounts or benefits received or outstanding under the 2022 Plan will be subject to clawback, cancellation, recoupment, rescission, payback,\nreduction or other similar action in accordance with our clawback or similar policy or any applicable law related to such actions.\n● Independent Oversight. The 2022 Plan is administered by a committee of independent members of the board of directors.\n48\nMaterial Features of the 2022 Plan\nThe material terms of the 2022 Plan are summarized below. This summary of the 2022 Plan is not intended to be a complete description of the 2022 Plan and is qualified in its\nentirety by the actual text of the 2022 Plan.\nEligibility and Participation. Awards may be granted under the 2022 Plan to officers, employees, and consultants of the company and its subsidiaries and to non-employee\ndirectors of the company. Any of these awards may—but need not—be made as performance incentives to reward attainment of performance goals in accordance with the terms\nand conditions hereof.\nPlan Administration. The Board of Directors has power and authority related to the administration of the 2022 Plan as are consistent with our corporate governance documents\nand applicable law. Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee administers the 2022 Plan.\nType of Awards. The following types of awards are available for grant under the 2022 Plan: ISOs, NSOs, SARs, restricted stock, RSUs, other stock-based awards, and cash\nawards.\nNumber of Authorized Shares. The total number of shares authorized to be awarded under the Plan will not exceed 1,500,000 Shares of Class A common stock, or Shares.\nShares issued under the Plan will consist in whole or in part of authorized but unissued Shares, treasury Shares, or Shares purchased on the open market or otherwise, all as\ndetermined by us from time to time. Subject to adjustment under Section 15 of the 2022 Plan, 1,500,000 Shares available for issuance under the Plan will be available for\nissuance as Incentive Stock Options.\nShare Counting. Any award settled in cash will not be counted as Shares for any purpose under the Plan. If any Award expires, or is terminated, surrendered, or forfeited, in\nwhole or in part, the unissued Shares covered by that award will again be available for the grant of awards. In the case of any substitute award, such substitute award will not be\ncounted against the number of Shares reserved under the 2022 Plan.\nStock Options and SARs\nGrant of Options and SARs. The Compensation Committee may award ISOs, NSOs (together, “options”), and SARs to grantees under the 2022 Plan. SARs may be awarded\neither in tandem with or as a component of other awards or alone.\nExercise Price of Options and SARs. A SAR will confer on a grantee a right to receive, upon exercise thereof, the excess of (1) the fair market value of one Share on the date of\nexercise over (2) the SAR exercise price. The Award Agreement for a SAR (except those that constitute substitute awards) will specify the SAR Exercise Price, which will be\nfixed on the grant date as not less than the fair market value of a Share on that date. A SAR granted in tandem with an outstanding option after the grant date of such option will\nhave a SAR Exercise Price that is equal to the option price, provided that the SAR Exercise Price may not be less than the fair market value of a Share on the grant date of the\nSAR.\nVesting of Options and SARs. The Board and/or Compensation Committee will determine the terms and conditions (including any performance requirements) under which an\noption or SAR will become exercisable and will include that information in the award agreement.\nSpecial Limitations on ISOs. An option will constitute an ISO only if the grantee of the option is an employee of the company or any subsidiary of the company and to the\nextent that the aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the option is granted) of the Shares with respect to which all ISOs held by such grantee become exercisable\nfor the first time during any calendar year (under the 2022 Plan and all other plans of the grantee’s employer and its affiliates) does not exceed $100,000. This limitation will be\napplied by taking options into account in the order in which they were granted.\n49\nRestricted Shares and RSUs\nAt the time of grant, the Compensation Committee may establish a period of time and any additional restrictions including the satisfaction of corporate or individual\nperformance objectives applicable to an award of Restricted Shares or RSUs. Each award of Restricted Shares or RSUs may be subject to a different restricted period and\nadditional restrictions. Neither Restricted Shares nor RSUs may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the Restricted Period or\nbefore the satisfaction of any other applicable restrictions. Unless the Compensation Committee otherwise provides in an award agreement, holders of Restricted Shares will\nhave rights as stockholders, including voting and dividend rights.\nOther Stock-Based Awards\nThe Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, grant other stock-based awards. The terms of other stock-based awards will be set forth in the applicable award\nagreements, subject to the 2022 Plan requirements.\nPerformance Awards\nThe right of a grantee to exercise or receive a grant or settlement of any award, and the timing thereof, may be subject to such performance terms conditions as may be\nspecified by the Compensation Committee. It may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance\nterms or conditions.\nEffect of Certain Transactions\nAdjustments for Changes in Capitalization. If changes in our common stock occur by reason of any recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, reverse split, combination of\nshares, exchange of shares, stock dividend or other distribution payable in stock, or other increase or decrease in the common stock without receipt of consideration by our\ncompany, or if there occurs any spin-off, split-up, extraordinary cash dividend or other distribution of assets by our company, the number and kinds of shares for which grants\nof awards may be made, the number and kinds of shares for which outstanding awards may be exercised or settled, and the performance goals relating to outstanding awards,\nwill be equitably adjusted by the company.\nAdjustments for Certain Transactions. Except as otherwise provided in an award agreement, in the event of a corporate transaction, the 2022 Plan and the awards will continue\nin effect in accordance with their respective terms, except that after a corporate transaction either (1) each outstanding award will be treated as provided for in the agreement\nentered into in connection with the corporate transaction or (2) if not so provided in such agreement, each grantee will be entitled to receive in respect of each Share subject to\nany outstanding awards, upon exercise or payment or transfer in respect of any award, the same number and kind of stock, securities, cash, property, or other consideration that\neach stockholder was entitled to receive in the corporate transaction in respect of one Share. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, such stock,\nsecurities, cash, property or other consideration will remain subject to all of the terms and conditions (including performance criteria) that were applicable to the awards before\nsuch corporate transaction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the treatment of outstanding options and SARs under in connection with a corporate transaction in\nwhich the consideration paid or distributed to the stockholders is not entirely shares of common stock of the acquiring or resulting corporation may include the cancellation of\noutstanding options and SARs upon consummation of the corporate transaction as long as, at the election of the Compensation Committee, (A) the holders of affected options\nand SARs have been given a period of at least 15 days before the date of the consummation of the corporate transaction to exercise the options or SARs (to the extent otherwise\nexercisable) or (B) the holders of the affected options and SARs are paid (in cash or cash equivalents) in respect of each Share covered by the Option or SAR being canceled an\namount equal to the excess, if any, of the per Share price paid or distributed to stockholders in the corporate transaction (the value of any noncash consideration to be\ndetermined by the Compensation Committee) over the option price or SAR Exercise Price, as applicable.\n50\nChange in Control. For any Awards outstanding as of the date of a change in control, either of the following provisions will apply, depending on whether, and the extent to\nwhich, awards are assumed, converted, or replaced by the resulting entity in a change in control, unless otherwise provided by an award agreement:\n(1) To the extent such awards are not assumed, converted or replaced by the resulting entity in the change in control, then upon the change in control such outstanding\nawards that may be exercised will become fully exercisable, all restrictions with respect to such outstanding awards, other than for performance awards, will lapse and become\nvested and nonforfeitable, and for any outstanding performance awards the target payout opportunities attainable under such awards will be deemed to have been fully earned\nas of the change in control based upon the greater of (A) an assumed achievement of all relevant performance goals at the “target” level or (B) the actual level of achievement\nof all relevant performance goals against target as of our fiscal quarter end preceding the change in control.\n(2) To the extent such awards are assumed, converted, or replaced by the resulting entity in the change in control, if, within 24 months after the date of the change in\ncontrol, the service provider has a separation from service by us other than for cause (which may include a separation from service by the service provider for “good reason” if\nprovided in the applicable award agreement), then such outstanding awards that may be exercised will become fully exercisable, all restrictions with respect to such outstanding\nawards, other than for performance awards, will lapse and become vested and nonforfeitable, and for any outstanding performance awards the target payout opportunities\nattainable under such awards will be deemed to have been fully earned as of the separation from service based on the greater of an assumed achievement of all relevant\nperformance goals at the “target” level or the actual level of achievement of all relevant performance goals against target as of our fiscal quarter end preceding the change in\ncontrol.\nTerm of Plan. Unless earlier terminated by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, the authority to make grants under the 2022 Plan will terminate on the tenth\nanniversary of the 2022 Plan’s effective date.\nEmployee Benefits\nAll of our full-time employees are eligible to participate in health and welfare plans maintained by us, including:\n● medical, dental and vision benefits; and\n● basic life and accidental death & dismemberment insurance.\nOur NEOs participate in these plans on the same basis as other eligible employees. We do not maintain any supplemental health and welfare plans for our NEOs.\nNonqualified Deferred Compensation\nOur NEOs did not earn any nonqualified deferred compensation benefits from us during the years 2022 and 2023.\nDirector Compensation\nOur employee directors did not receive any compensation for serving as a member of our board of directors during the year ended December 31, 2023. We plan to implement a\ncompensation plan for our non-employee directors, such that non-employee directors will receive an annual cash retainer and/or an annual grant of stock options.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of our voting securities as of April 1, 2024, based on information obtained from the\npersons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of ordinary shares, by:\n● each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding ordinary shares;\n● each of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns our ordinary shares; and\n● all our executive officers and directors as a group.\nIn the table below, percentage ownership is based on 1,230,246 shares of our Class A Common Stock and 100,000 of our Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding as of\nApril 1, 2023.\nUnless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all ordinary shares beneficially owned by\nthem. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement warrants or rights as these warrants and rights are not exercisable or\nconvertible within 60 days of the date of this Report.\nUnless otherwise indicated, the address of each individual listed in this table is c/o Yoshiharu Global Co., 6940 Beach Blvd. Suite D-705, Buena Park, CA 90621.\nNumber of Percent of Class Number of Percent of Class\nClass A Shares A Common Class B Shares B Common Percent of Total\nBeneficially Stock Beneficially Stock Voting Power(2)\nName of Beneficial Owner Owned(1) Outstanding(2) Owned(1) Outstanding(2) (3)\nJames Chae 648,100 52.68% 100,000 100.00% 73.90%\nSoojae Ryan Cho 1,400 * - - *\nJay Kim 10,000 * - - *\nHarinne Kim 2,500 * - - *\nYusil Yeo 1,000 * - - *\nAll NEOs and Directors as a Group (5 persons) 663,000 53.89% 100,000 100.00% 74.57%\n* Beneficial ownership of less than 1.0% is omitted.\n(1) A person is considered to beneficially own any shares: (i) over which such person, directly or indirectly, exercises sole or shared voting or investment power, or (ii) of\nwhich such person has the right to acquire beneficial ownership at any time within 60 days (such as through exercise of stock options or warrants). Unless otherwise\nindicated, voting and investment power relating to the shares shown in the table for our directors and executive officers is exercised solely by the beneficial owner or\nshared by the owner and the owner’s spouse or children.\n(2) Shares of our Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of our convertible preferred stock are deemed outstanding for purposes of computing the percentage shown\nabove. In addition, for purposes of this table, a person or group of persons is deemed to have “beneficial ownership” of any shares of Common Stock that such person has\nthe right to acquire within 60 days after the date of this prospectus.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\nRelationship with James Chae\nIn September 2021, Yoshiharu Holdings Co. was formed by James Chae as an S corporation for the purpose of acquiring all of the equity in each of the seven restaurant store\nentities which were previously founded and wholly owned directly by James Chae and all of the intellectual property in the business held by James Chae in exchange for an\nissuance of 9,450,900 shares to James Chae, which constituted all of the issued and outstanding equity in Yoshiharu Holdings Co. Such transfers were completed in the fourth\nquarter of 2021.\n52\nYoshiharu Global Co. was incorporated on December 9, 2021 in Delaware by James Chae. On December 9, 2021, James Chae contributed 100% of the equity in Yoshiharu\nHoldings Co. to Yoshiharu Global Co. in exchange for the issuance by Yoshiharu Global Co. of 9,450,900 shares of Class A Common Stock to James Chae. On December 10,\n2021, we redeemed 670,000 shares of Class A Common Stock from James Chae at par ($0.0001 per share). In December 2021, we conducted a private placement solely to\naccredited investors and sold 670,000 shares of Class A Common Stock at $2.00 per share, which our board of directors determined to reflect the then current fair market value\nof our Class A Common Stock. We have exchanged 1,000,000 shares held by James Chae into 1,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock immediately prior to the IPO.\nEffective February 7, 2022, our board and stockholders unanimously approved the form of amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which clarifies the automatic\nconversion of Class B common stock held by James Chae into Class A Common Stock, among other things, a copy of which is attached to this Report as an exhibit.\nAs of December 31, 2023, James Chae owned 100% of our outstanding Class B Common Stock (100,000 shares), and 52.7% of our Class A Common Stock, and 73.9% of our\ntotal voting power. Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, while our Class A Common Stock, which is the class of stock we sold in the IPO and is the only class of\nstock that is publicly traded, has one vote per share. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control\ntransaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nProcedures for Approval of Related Party Transactions\nOur board of directors has adopted a written related person transaction policy, which sets forth the policies and procedures for the review and approval or ratification of related\nparty transactions. This policy will be administrated by our Audit Committee. These policies provide that, in determining whether or not to recommend the initial approval or\nratification of a related party transaction, the relevant facts and circumstances available shall be considered, including, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the\ninterested transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the\nrelated party’s interest in the transaction.\nItem 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services.\nWe have appointed BF Borgers CPA PC (“BFB”) to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023.

Our Audit\nCommittee is also responsible for the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm (including resolution of disagreements\nbetween management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related\nwork. The independent registered public accounting firm was engaged by, and reports directly to, our Audit Committee.\nOur Audit Committee pre-approves all audit services and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for us by our independent\nregistered public accounting firm, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)\n(C) of Regulation S-X, provided that all such excepted services are subsequently approved prior to the completion of the audit.

Form 10-K Summary\nNot applicable.\n54\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Yoshiharu Global Co. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Yoshiharu Global Co. as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related statements of operations, stockholders’\nequity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present\nfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then\nended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our\naudit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/S/ BF Borgers CPA PC\nBF Borgers CPA PC (PCAOB ID 5041)\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021\nLakewood, CO\nApril 1, 2024\nF-1\nYoshiharu Global Co. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash $ 1,832,661 $ 6,509,121\nInventories 73,023 60,899\nTotal current assets 1,905,684 6,570,020\nNon-Current Assets:\nProperty and equipment, net 4,092,950 3,158,428\nOperating lease right-of-use asset, net 5,459,708 5,980,888\nOther assets 1,561,022 308,353\nTotal non-current assets 11,113,680 9,447,669\nTotal assets $ 13,019,364 $ 16,017,689\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 647,811 $ 744,101\nLine of credit 1,000,000 300,000\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 572,230 458,803\nCurrent portion of bank notes payables 414,378 265,943\nCurrent portion of loan payable, EIDL 10,526 39,652\nLoans payable to financial institutions 534,239 -\nDue to related party 24,176 172,720\nOther payables 65,700 5,915\nTotal current liabilities 3,269,060 1,987,134\nOperating lease liabilities, less current portion 5,689,535 6,261,767\nBank notes payables, less current portion 991,951 1,020,143\nRestaurant revitalization fund - 700,454\nLoan payable, EIDL, less current portion 415,339 410,348\nTotal liabilities 10,365,885 10,379,846\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders’ Equity (Deficit)\nClass A Common Stock - $0.0001 par value;

NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nYoshiharu Global Co. (“Yoshiharu”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 9, 2021. Yoshiharu did not have significant transactions since formation.\nYoshiharu has the following wholly owned subsidiaries:\nName Date of Formation Description of Business\nGlobal JJ Group, Inc.

The Company offers a variety of Japanese ramens, rice bowls, and appetizers.\nUnless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms “Yoshiharu” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer collectively to Yoshiharu and, where\nappropriate, its subsidiaries.\nPrior to September 30, 2021, the Yoshiharu business (the “Business”) consisted of the first seven separate entities listed above (collectively, the “Entities”), each wholly\nowned by James Chae (“Mr. Chae”), and each holding one (1) store, except for JJ, which held two stores and the Business’s intellectual property (the “IP”). Effective\nOctober 2021, JJ transferred the IP to Mr. Chae. Effective October 2021, Mr. Chae contributed 100% of the equity interests in each of the Entities to Yoshiharu Holdings\nCo., a California corporation (“Holdings”), for purposes of consolidating the Business operations into a single entity. Mr. Chae was issued an aggregate 3,205,000 shares in\nHoldings, which reflected the aggregate number of shares originally issued to Mr. Chae by the Entities, in exchange for 100% of each Entity (on a 1 for 1 share exchange\nbasis). In addition, effective October 2021, Mr. Chae transferred the IP to Holdings in exchange for the issuance of 6,245,900 shares in Holdings in order to bring his total\nshareholdings in Holdings up to an aggregate 9,450,900 shares.\nOn December 9, 2021, Yoshiharu completed a share exchange agreement whereby Mr. Chae, the sole stockholder of Holdings, received 9,450,900 shares of Yoshiharu,\nrepresenting 100% of issued shares at that time, and Yoshiharu received all of the shares of Holdings. This recapitalization was accounted for in accordance with the\n“Transactions Between Entities Under Common Control” subsections of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805-50, Business Combinations, which requires that\nthe receiving entity recognize the net assets received at their historical carrying amounts. A common-control transaction has no effect on the parent’s consolidated financial\nstatements. No value was ascribed to the shares issued for the transfer of the IP since the only relevance of the aggregate number of shares issued to Mr. Chae in Holdings\nwas to effect the 1 for 1 share exchange with Yoshiharu upon its incorporation in Delaware. ASC 805-50 also prescribes that, if the recognition of the net assets results in a\n“change in the reporting entity,” the receiving entity presents the transfer in its separate financial statements retrospectively. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities and the\nhistorical operations that are reflected in these consolidated financial statements are those of the subsidiaries and are recorded at the historical cost basis of the subsidiaries.\nOn November 22, 2023, Yoshiharu Global Co. (the “Company”) filed a Certificate of Amendment (the “Certificate of Amendment”) to the Company’s Amended and\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of its issued Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”) and Class B\ncommon stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class B Common Stock” and, together with Class A common Stock, “Common Stock”), in the ratio of 1-for-10 (the “Reverse\nStock Split”) to be effective at 11:59 p.m. eastern on November 27, 2023. The Common Stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis at the market open on Tuesday,\nNovember 28, 2023.\nNo fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, any fractional shares that would have resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded\nup to the next whole number. As a result, total of 34,846 shares of Class A common stock were issued and total of 1,230,246 shares of Class A common stock were\noutstanding as of December 31, 2023. The Reverse Stock Split affects all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder’s percentage interest in the Company’s\noutstanding Common Stock, except for adjustments that may result from the treatment of fractional shares. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock of the\nCompany and number of authorized, issued, and outstanding shares of the preferred stock of the Company were not changed.\nF-6\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) as promulgated in the\nUnited States of America. The consolidated financial statements include Yoshiharu and its wholly owned subsidiaries listed in Note 1 above as of December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021 and for the years then ended. All intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nInitial Public Offering\nIn September 2022, the Company consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 2,940,000 shares of its class A common stock at a public offering price of $4.00\nper share, generating gross proceeds of $11,760,000. Net proceeds from the IPO were approximately $10.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and\ncommissions and other offering expenses of approximately $1.5 million.\nThe Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 441,000 additional shares (equal to 15% of the shares of class A common stock sold in the IPO)\nto cover over-allotments, if any, which the underwriters did not exercise. In addition, the Company issued to the representative of the underwriters warrants to purchase a\nnumber of shares of class A common stock equal to 5.0% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock sold in the IPO (including shares of Class A common\nstock sold upon exercise of the over-allotment option). The representative’s warrants will be exercisable at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, during the\nfour-and-½-year period commencing six months from the date of commencement of the sales of the shares of Class A common stock in connection with the IPO, at an\ninitial exercise price per share of $5.00 (equal to 125% of the initial public offering price per share of class A common stock). No representative’s warrants have been\nexercised.\nOn September 9, 2022, the Company’s stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “YOSH.”\nDeferred Offering Costs\nDeferred offering costs were expenses directly related to the IPO. These costs consisted of legal, accounting, printing, and filing fees. The deferred offering costs were\noffset against the IPO proceeds in September 2022 and were reclassified to additional paid-in capital upon completion of the IPO.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported\nin our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Such estimates include accounts receivables, accrued liabilities, income taxes, long-lived assets, and\ndeferred tax valuation allowances. These estimates generally involve complex issues and require management to make judgments, involve analysis of historical and future\ntrends that can require extended periods of time to resolve, and are subject to change from period to period. In all cases, actual results could differ materially from\nestimates.\nMarketing\nMarketing costs are charged to expense as incurred. Marketing costs were approximately $121,000 and $149,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, and are included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nDelivery Fees Charged by Delivery Service Providers\nThe Company’s customers may order online through third party service providers such as Uber Eats, Door Dash, and others. These third-party service providers charge\ndelivery and order fees to the Company. Such fees are expensed when incurred. Delivery fees are included in delivery and service fees in the accompanying consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from sales is recognized when food and beverages are sold to customers. Revenue represents sales net of discounts and sales taxes collected from customers.\nF-7\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nInventories\nInventories, which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, consist primarily of perishable food items and supplies. Cost is determined using the first-in, first\nout method.\nSegment Reporting\nASC 280, Segment Reporting, requires public companies to report financial and descriptive information about their reportable operating segments. The Company identifies\nits operating segments based on how executive decision makers internally evaluates separate financial information, business activities and management responsibility.\nAccordingly, the Company has one reportable segment, consisting of operating its stores.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Major improvements are capitalized, and minor replacements, maintenance and\nrepairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold\nimprovements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the lease term of the related asset. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\nFurniture and equipment 5 to 7 years\nLeasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or term of lease\nVehicles 5 years\nIncome Taxes\nThe accounting standard on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax\nreturn should be recorded in the financial statements. Under that guidance, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more\nlikely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the\nfinancial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The\nCompany had no unrecognized tax benefits identified or recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2023.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWhen circumstances, such as adverse market conditions, indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may be impaired, the Company performs an analysis to\nreview the recoverability of the asset’s carrying value, which includes estimating the undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest charges) from the expected future\noperations of the asset. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, operating trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand,\ncompetition and other factors. If the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that\nthe carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Any impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses, which reduce net income.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are accounts receivable and other receivables arising from its normal business\nactivities. The Company has a diversified customer base. The Company controls credit risk related to accounts receivable through credit approvals, credit limits and\nmonitoring procedures. The Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, based upon factors surrounding the credit risk, establishes an\nallowance, if required, for un-collectible accounts and, as a consequence, believes that its accounts receivable related credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is limited.\nF-8\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company utilizes ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure, for valuing financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined\nas the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the\nmeasurement date. The guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of\nunobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or\nliability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s\nassumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. The guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair\nvalue:\nLevel 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe Company’s financial instruments consisted of cash, operating lease right-of-use assets, net, accounts payable and accrued expenses, notes payables, and operating lease\nliabilities. The estimated fair value of cash, operating lease right-of-use assets, net, and notes payables approximate its carrying amount due to the short maturity of these\ninstruments.\nLeases\nIn accordance with ASC 842, Leases, the Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. A lease is a contract that provides the right to control\nan identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. For identified leases, the Company determines whether it should be classified as an operating or\nfinance lease. Operating leases are recorded in the balance sheet as: right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) and operating lease liability. An ROU asset represents the Company’s\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and an operating lease liability represents the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU\nassets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease and measured based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.\nThe ROU asset also includes deferred rent liabilities. The Company’s lease arrangement generally does not provide an implicit interest rate. As a result, in such situations\nthe Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The\nCompany includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option in the measurement of its ROU asset and operating\nlease liability. Lease expense for the operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has a lease agreement with lease and non-lease\ncomponents, which are accounted for as a single lease component.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”). ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising\nfrom a lease for both financing and operating leases. ASU 2016-02 will also require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial\nstatement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company evaluated ASU 2016-02 and adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2019.\nF-9\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, “Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases” (“ASU 2018-10”). The amendments in ASU 2018-10 provide\nadditional clarification and implementation guidance on certain aspects of the previously issued ASU 2016-02 and have the same effective and transition requirements as\nASU 2016-02. ASU 2018-10 supersedes the current lease guidance in ASC Topic 840, Leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize for all leases,\nwith the exception of short-term leases, a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis.\nConcurrently, lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the\nlease term. ASU 2018-10 is effective for emerging growth companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption\npermitted. The guidance is required to be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest\ncomparative periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2019.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements,” (“ASU 2018-11”). The amendments in ASU 2018-11 related to transition\nrelief on comparative reporting at adoption affect all entities with lease contracts that choose the additional transition method and separating components of a contract\naffect only lessors whose lease contracts qualify for the practical expedient. The amendments in ASU 2018-11 are effective for emerging growth companies for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2019.\nIn March 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-01, “Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements” (“Topic 842”) (“ASU 2019-01”). These amendments align the guidance\nfor fair value of the underlying asset by lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers in Topic 842 with that of existing guidance. As a result, the fair value of the underlying\nasset at lease commencement is its cost, reflecting any volume or trade discounts that may apply. However, if there has been a significant lapse of time between when the\nunderlying asset is acquired and when the lease commences, the definition of fair value (in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement) should be applied (Issue 1). ASU 2019-01\nalso requires lessors within the scope of Topic 942, Financial Services—Depository and Lending, to present all “principal payments received under leases” within investing\nactivities (Issue 2). Finally, the ASU exempts both lessees and lessors from having to provide certain interim disclosures in the fiscal year in which a company adopts the\nnew leases standard (Issue 3). The transition and effective date provisions apply to Issue 1 and Issue 2. They do not apply to Issue 3 because the amendments for that Issue\nare to the original transition requirements in Topic 842.\nThis amendment is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is\npermitted. The Company evaluated ASU 2019-01 and adopted this guidance as of January 1, 2019.\nCOVID-19 Impact on Concentration of Risk\nThe novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has significantly impacted health and economic conditions throughout the United States and globally, as public concern\nabout becoming ill with the virus has led to the issuance of recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to practice social distancing or self-\nquarantine. The Company is continually monitoring the outbreak of COVID-19 and the related business and travel restrictions and changes to behavior intended to reduce\nits spread, and its impact on operations, financial position, cash flows, inventory, supply chains, purchasing trends, customer payments, and the industry in general, in\naddition to the impact on its employees. We have experienced significant disruptions to our business due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related suggested and mandated\nsocial distancing and shelter-in-place orders.\nF-10\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments\nOperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU\nassets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Generally,\nthe implicit rate of interest in arrangements is not readily determinable and the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease\npayments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on its understanding of what its credit rating would be. The operating lease ROU asset\nincludes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our variable lease payments primarily consist of maintenance and other operating expenses from our real\nestate leases. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is\nincurred. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum\nlease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to account for these lease and non-lease components as a single lease\ncomponent.\nIn accordance with ASC 842, the components of lease expense were as follows:\nDecember 31,\nFor the years ended 2023 2022\nOperating lease expense $ 978,504 $ 530,722\nTotal lease expense $ 978,504 $ 530,722\nIn accordance with ASC 842, other information related to leases was as follows:\nDecember 31,\nFor the years ended 2023 2022\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 826,307 $ 538,909\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 826,307 $ 538,909\nWeighted-average remaining lease term—operating leases 8.0 Years\nWeighted-average discount rate—operating leases 7%\nOperating\nYear ending: Lease\n2023 $ 893,761\n2024 923,862\n2025 919,143\n2026 882,733\n2027 862,836\nThereafter 3,431,562\nTotal undiscounted cash flows $ 7,913,897\nReconciliation of lease liabilities:\nWeighted-average remaining lease terms 8.0 Years\nWeighted-average discount rate 7%\nPresent values $ 6,261,765\nLease liabilities—current 572,230\nLease liabilities—long-term 5,689,535\nLease liabilities—total $ 6,261,765\nDifference between undiscounted and discounted cash flows $ 1,652,132\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company may be involved in certain legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business.

(“us”, “our,” “we” or the “Company”) has one class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the\n“Exchange Act”): our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Common Stock”).\nThe following descriptions of our capital stock and certain provisions of Certificate of Incorporation, our Bylaws and Delaware law are summaries. You should also refer to the\ntext of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws, which are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report.\nAuthorized and Outstanding Capital Stock\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 4,900,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, and 1,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class B\nCommon Stock” and together with the Class A Common Stock, the “Common Stock”).\nClass A Common Stock\nPursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the “Certificate of Incorporation”), holders of our Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote on all matters\nsubmitted to a vote of stockholders, and holders of our Common Stock will not be entitled to cumulative voting in the election of directors. This means that the holders of a\nmajority of the combined voting power of our outstanding Common Stock will be able to elect all of the directors then standing for election. Subject to the rights, if any, of the\nholders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, holders of our Class A Common Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends out of any of our funds legally available when,\nas and if declared by our Board of Directors. Upon the dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the company, subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of our preferred stock,\nthe holders of our Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the assets of the company available for distribution to its stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of\nshares held by them. Holders of Class A Common Stock will not have preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund\nprovisions applicable to our Class A Common Stock.\nClass B Common Stock\nPursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation, our Class B Common Stock has the same rights as our Class A Common Stock except for (i) certain conversion rights as described\nbelow under “Conversion Rights,” and (ii) on all matters to be voted on by stockholders, holders of our Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share while holders\nof our Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of preferred stock, holders of our Class B\nCommon Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends out of any of our funds legally available when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Upon our dissolution,\nliquidation or winding up, subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of our preferred stock, the holders of shares of our Common Stock shall be entitled to receive the assets of\nthe company available for distribution to its stockholders ratably in proportion to the number of shares held by them. Holders of Class B Common Stock will not have\npreemptive or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our Class B Common Stock. All outstanding shares of Class B\nCommon Stock are fully paid and nonassessable.\nJames Chae, our Chief Executive Officer, is the only holder of shares of Class B Common Stock.\nConversion Rights\nShares of Class A Common Stock have no conversion rights.\nEach share of Class B Common Stock shall automatically be converted into one fully paid and non-assessable share of Class A Common Stock upon the earliest of (A) the date\nsuch shares cease to be beneficially owned (as such term is defined under Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) by James Chae and (B) at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the date that\nMr. Chae ceases to beneficially own (as such term is defined under Section 13(d)) at least 25% of the voting power of all the outstanding shares of capital stock of the company.\nExcept for the foregoing conversion rights of the Class B Common Stock and provisions applicable equally to both Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock,\nincluding, but not limited to, the repurchase of such shares by us, there are no provisions which otherwise limit the lifespan of the Class B Common Stock or would require\nconversion to Class A Common Stock.\nVoting Rights\nExcept as required by Delaware law or except as otherwise provided in our Certificate of Incorporation, holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock will\nvote together as a single class on all matters presented to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors. Each holder of Class A Common Stock is entitled to one\nvote for each share held of record on the applicable record date for all of these matters, while each holder of Class B Common Stock is entitled to 10 votes for each share held\nof record on the applicable record date for all of these matters.\nHolders of Class A Common Stock have no cumulative voting rights or preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for any stock or other securities, and there are no conversion\nrights or redemption or sinking fund provisions with respect to Class A Common Stock. Class B Common Stock is identical in all respects to Class A Common Stock, except\nwith respect to voting and conversion rights.\nAnti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation, Our Bylaws, and Delaware Law\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws contain certain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another party from acquiring control\nof us. These provisions and certain provisions of Delaware law, which are summarized below, may discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These\nprovisions also may encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our Board of Directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our\npotential ability to negotiate with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us because negotiation of these\nproposals could result in an improvement of their terms.\nStockholder meetings. Under our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, only the Board of Directors, or the chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer\nwith the concurrence of a majority of the Board of Directors, may call special meetings of stockholders.\nRequirements for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals. Our Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the\nnomination of candidates for election as directors.\nStockholder action by written consent permitted only if our parent company and its affiliates own a majority of the voting power of the Common Stock. Our Certificate of\nIncorporation authorizes the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting. This provision will, in certain situations, make it more difficult for stockholders,\nwho are not our parent company or its affiliates, to take action opposed by the Board of Directors.\nAmendment of provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation. Our Certificate of Incorporation requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the combined\nvoting power of our outstanding Common Stock in order to amend any provision of our Certificate of Incorporation.\nAmendment of provisions in the Bylaws. Our Bylaws will require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding\nCommon Stock in order to amend any provision of our Bylaws.\nControlled company. As discussed above, our Class B Common Stock has 10 votes per share, while Class A Common Stock. 100% of our Class B Common Stock is held by\nJames Chae, our Chief Executive Officer. Until our dual class structure terminates, James Chae will be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval\neven if he owns significantly less than 50% of the number of shares of our outstanding Common Stock. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any\npotential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nDelaware Anti-Takeover Statute. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that we are not subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In\ngeneral, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a\nperiod of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder.\nThe provisions of Delaware law and the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as amended, could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting\nhostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our Class A Common Stock that often result from actual or rumored\nhostile takeover attempts. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult\nto accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.\nExclusive Forum\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws each contain an exclusive forum provision providing that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and\nexclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing\nby, any of our directors, officers, employees, agents or stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation\nLaw, our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws, or (4) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, each provision states that it\nshall not apply to actions arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nIn addition, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nSecurities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provisions will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the\nSecurities Act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance\nwith the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe exclusive forum provisions, if enforced, may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors,\nofficers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an\naction, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and growth prospects. For example, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware recently determined that a provision stating that U.S. federal\ndistrict courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe registrar and transfer agent for our Common Stock is VStock Transfer, LLC, located at 18 Lafayette Place Woodmere, New York 11598.\nListing\nOur Class A Common Stock is traded on Nasdaq under the symbol “YOSH.”\nExhibit 17.1\nRESIGNATION LETTER OF HELEN LEE\nHelen Y.

Accordingly, in accordance with the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq Rules”),\nSection 10D and Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (“Rule 10D-1”), the Board has adopted this Policy (the “Policy”) to\nprovide for the recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-based Compensation from Executive Officers.

The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate and provide the relevant documentation as\nrequired to Nasdaq.\n(ii) The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on the particular facts and\ncircumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as set forth in Section B(2) below, in no event may the Company accept an amount that is less than the\namount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation in satisfaction of an Executive Officer’s obligations hereunder.\n(iii) To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received under any duplicative\nrecovery obligations established by the Company or applicable law, it shall be appropriate for any such reimbursed amount to be credited to the amount of\nErroneously Awarded Compensation that is subject to recovery under this Policy.\n(iv) To the extent that an Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company when due, the Company shall take all actions\nreasonable and appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Executive Officer. The applicable Executive Officer shall\nbe required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n(2) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated by Section B(1) above if the Committee\n(which, as specified above, is composed entirely of independent directors or in the absence of such a committee, a majority of the independent directors serving on the Board)\ndetermines that recovery would be impracticable and any of the following three (3) conditions are met:\n(i) The Committee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before\nmaking this determination, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such attempt(s) and\nprovide such documentation to Nasdaq;\n(ii) Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022, provided that, before determining that it would be\nimpracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on violation of home country law, the Company has obtained an opinion\nof home country counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation and a copy of the opinion is provided to Nasdaq; or\n(iii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to\nmeet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and regulations thereunder.\n(3) The Board may also cancel or recoup Incentive-based Compensation if the Executive Officer, without the consent of the Company, (A) has engaged in or engages\nin activity that is in conflict with or adverse to the interests of the Company or any affiliate thereof while employed by or providing services to the Company or any affiliate\nthereof, including fraud or conduct intentionally contributing to any material financial restatements or irregularities, or (B) violates in any material respect a non-competition,\nnon-solicitation, non-disparagement or non-disclosure covenant or agreement with the Company or any affiliate thereof, as determined by the Board, and fails to cure such\nviolation in all material respects within thirty (30) days of demand by the Company, or if the Executive Officer’s employment or service is terminated for cause.\nC. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS\nThe Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy required by applicable U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings and rules, including\nwithout limitation, filing a copy of this Policy and any amendments thereto as an exhibit to the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K.\n2 of 4\nD. PROHIBITION OF INDEMNIFICATION\nThe Company shall not be permitted to insure or indemnify any Executive Officer against (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid, returned\nor recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of its rights under this Policy. Further, the Company shall not enter\ninto any agreement that exempts any Incentive-based Compensation that is granted, paid or awarded to an Executive Officer from the application of this Policy or that waives\nthe Company’s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the\nEffective Date of this Policy).\nE. ADMINISTRATION AND INTERPRETATION\nThis Policy shall be administered by the Committee, and any determinations made by the Committee shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nThe Committee is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate, or advisable for the administration of this Policy\nand for the Company’s compliance with Nasdaq Rules, Section 10D, Rule 10D-1 and any other applicable law, regulation, rule or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq\npromulgated or issued in connection therewith.\nF. AMENDMENT; TERMINATION\nThe Committee may amend this Policy from time to time in its discretion and shall amend this Policy as it deems necessary. Notwithstanding anything in this Section F\nto the contrary, no amendment or termination of this Policy shall be effective if such amendment or termination would (after taking into account any actions taken by the\nCompany contemporaneously with such amendment or termination) cause the Company to violate any federal securities laws, SEC rule or Nasdaq rule.\nG.
