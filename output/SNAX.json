(“Stryve” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: SNAX), an emerging healthy snacking platform and leader in the air-dried meat snack industry in the United States, today reports financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company reported continued revenue growth, improved gross margins, and reduced operating expenses, highlighting the effectiveness of its transformation strategy.\n\nKey highlights include net sales of $5.7 million, reflecting a 36.4% increase from the third quarter of 2023, and more than doubling gross profit year over year with a gross margin of 21.7%, as compared to 13.3% in the prior-year period.\n\n**Q3 2024 – Momentum Continues with Expanded Distribution and Enhanced Financial Performance**\n\nStryve’s transformation continued in the third quarter of 2024, delivering year-over-year improvements in gross margin, lower operating expenses, and a narrowed Adjusted EBITDA loss. The Company’s focus on profitable growth, operational efficiency, and cost discipline is yielding results. Stryve’s expanded retail presence includes key wins with BJ’s Wholesale, Wawa, Circle K, and others, reflecting strong demand for its air-dried meat snack brands. The recent $2.9 million equity raise, alongside strategic partnerships like Dot Foods, aims to provide some relief to the working capital constraints and support the Company’s ongoing transformation efforts.\n\n**Chris Boever, Chief Executive Officer, commented,** “In Q3 2024, Stryve Foods continued to build momentum as we executed our transformation with discipline and focus. Our achievements in expanding distribution and driving margin improvements demonstrate the power of our strategy and our team’s commitment. We’re excited about our progress as we strengthen Stryve’s position in the healthy protein snacking category. The initiatives we’ve implemented provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth and profitability in the quarters to come.”\n\n**Recent Business Updates and Strategic Initiatives**\n\n  * **Distribution Expansion** : Building on Q2’s momentum, Stryve successfully secured new placements across major retailers, including BJ’s Wholesale, Wawa, Circle K, and other prominent grocery and convenience channels​​. Additionally, the Company has just secured new chainwide distribution with a leading retailer that will feature its products in thousands of new locations beginning in Q1 2025.\n\n\n  * **Streamlining Operations** : The Company’s recently announced a strategic partnership with Dot Foods that will further enhance its distribution reach nationwide, beginning in Q4’24. This partnership will help to streamline Stryve’s distribution and fulfillment operations and enhance service levels for the Company’s retail partners nationwide.\n\n\n  * **New Product Launch - High Steaks** : Stryve launched High Steaks, a high-protein, human-grade pet treat brand, in response to strong consumer demand for clean-label pet snacks​. This new product line reinforces the Company’s commitment to growth through innovation and category expansion.\n\n\n  * **Capital Raise** : In November 2024, the Company raised $2.9 million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity through a public offering, providing additional working capital to support Stryve’s increased order volume and run rate demand​. The Company sold 3,670,886 shares of its Class A common stock and common stock equivalents and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,341,722 shares of its Class A common stock at a combined public offering price of $0.79 per share (or prefunded warrant) and associated common warrants. Each share of Class A common stock (or prefunded warrant) was sold together with two warrants each to purchase one share of Class A common stock. The common warrants have an exercise price of $0.79 per share, are exercisable following stockholder approval, and have a term of exercise equal to five years following date of the stockholder approval. The closing of the offering occurred on November 12, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Alex Hawkins, Chief Financial Officer, said,** “We are pleased with our financial progress in the third quarter, highlighted by our improved gross margin and reduced operating expenses year over year. Our recent $2.9 million capital raise will help to restore our service levels and catch up to our run rate demand from existing distribution. We will continue to look for ways to address the inventory build required to support our upcoming distribution expansion in Q1. These expected increased volumes should contribute meaningfully in our efforts to close the gap to profitability. As we look forward, we remain focused on optimizing operations, securing and managing our capital efficiently, and delivering value to our shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net sales of $5.7 million, up 36.4% as compared to the third quarter a year ago. This is primarily the result of increased consumption of our products at retail by consumers.\n\n\n  * Gross profit of $1.2 million compared to $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, translating to a gross margin of 21.7% versus 13.3% in the prior-year period. This improvement highlights the Company’s focus on productivity and operational efficiency.\n\n\n  * Operating loss of ($2.3) million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to an operating loss of ($3.6) million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Other Expense of $0.8 million, primarily related to interest expenses, down from $1.1 million in the prior-year period.\n\n\n  * Net loss of ($3.1) million, or ($0.95) per share, as compared to a net loss of ($4.8) million, or ($2.14) per share, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Adjusted loss per share¹ of ($0.89) in the third quarter of 2024, favorably comparing to an adjusted loss per share of ($1.66) in the prior-year period.\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss¹ of ($1.7) million for the third quarter of 2024, representing a 31.5% improvement over the ($2.5) million Adjusted EBITDA loss in the prior-year quarter. \n\n\n\n**Year-to-Date 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net sales of $16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, up 11.2% as compared to the comparable period a year ago. The mix of net sales improved year over year in part due to the Company’s discontinuation of certain retail programs, rationalization of low-quality revenue, which included the discontinuation of slow-moving and margin losing items some of which was still present in the prior year period while improved sell-through and growth in quality core accounts more than offset the rationalized revenues so far this year.\n\n\n  * Gross profit of $3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, compared to gross profit of $2.6 million in prior year period. The current year period’s improved performance is primarily attributable to enhanced sales-mix and better utilization of the facilities partially offset by higher commodity costs than in the prior year period.\n\n\n  * Operating loss of ($7.5) million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, as compared to operating loss of ($11.3) million in the prior year period representing a 33.1% improvement.\n\n\n  * Other Expense of $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, is approximately flat compared to $2.5 million in the comparable period a year ago. This is in part attributable to approximately $0.3 million of a non-cash loss on the extinguishment of debt in the current year period related to the accounting treatment of the repricing of the warrants connected to the extension of the promissory notes issued on April 19, 2023. The prior year period was burdened by approximately $0.9 million in interest expense related to the accounting treatment of the warrants issued in connection with those same bridge notes issued in April 2023. The remaining difference is primarily attributable to interest expense on new convertible bridge notes put in place during the current year period.\n\n\n  * Net loss of ($10.0) million, or ($3.22) per share for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, as compared to a net loss of ($13.7) million, or ($6.41) per share, in the prior year period.\n\n\n  * Adjusted loss per share¹ of ($2.87) for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, which compares favorably to adjusted loss per share of ($5.44) for the year-ago period.\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss¹ of ($5.5) million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, which represents a 34.0% improvement compared to ($8.4) million in the prior year period. \n\n\n\n¹ Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted loss per share are a non-GAAP financial measure as defined and reconciled to GAAP below.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.

(“Stryve” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: SNAX), an emerging healthy snacking platform and leader in the air-dried meat snack industry in the United States, today reports financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company reported continued revenue growth, improved gross margins, and reduced operating expenses, highlighting the effectiveness of its transformation strategy.\n\nKey highlights include net sales of $5.7 million, reflecting a 36.4% increase from the third quarter of 2023, and more than doubling gross profit year over year with a gross margin of 21.7%, as compared to 13.3% in the prior-year period.\n\n**Q3 2024 – Momentum Continues with Expanded Distribution and Enhanced Financial Performance**\n\nStryve’s transformation continued in the third quarter of 2024, delivering year-over-year improvements in gross margin, lower operating expenses, and a narrowed Adjusted EBITDA loss. The Company’s focus on profitable growth, operational efficiency, and cost discipline is yielding results. Stryve’s expanded retail presence includes key wins with BJ’s Wholesale, Wawa, Circle K, and others, reflecting strong demand for its air-dried meat snack brands. The recent $2.9 million equity raise, alongside strategic partnerships like Dot Foods, aims to provide some relief to the working capital constraints and support the Company’s ongoing transformation efforts.\n\n**Chris Boever, Chief Executive Officer, commented,** “In Q3 2024, Stryve Foods continued to build momentum as we executed our transformation with discipline and focus. Our achievements in expanding distribution and driving margin improvements demonstrate the power of our strategy and our team’s commitment. We’re excited about our progress as we strengthen Stryve’s position in the healthy protein snacking category. The initiatives we’ve implemented provide a strong foundation for sustainable growth and profitability in the quarters to come.”\n\n**Recent Business Updates and Strategic Initiatives**\n\n  * **Distribution Expansion** : Building on Q2’s momentum, Stryve successfully secured new placements across major retailers, including BJ’s Wholesale, Wawa, Circle K, and other prominent grocery and convenience channels​​. Additionally, the Company has just secured new chainwide distribution with a leading retailer that will feature its products in thousands of new locations beginning in Q1 2025.\n\n\n  * **Streamlining Operations** : The Company’s recently announced a strategic partnership with Dot Foods that will further enhance its distribution reach nationwide, beginning in Q4’24. This partnership will help to streamline Stryve’s distribution and fulfillment operations and enhance service levels for the Company’s retail partners nationwide.\n\n\n  * **New Product Launch - High Steaks** : Stryve launched High Steaks, a high-protein, human-grade pet treat brand, in response to strong consumer demand for clean-label pet snacks​. This new product line reinforces the Company’s commitment to growth through innovation and category expansion.\n\n\n  * **Capital Raise** : In November 2024, the Company raised $2.9 million in gross proceeds from the sale of equity through a public offering, providing additional working capital to support Stryve’s increased order volume and run rate demand​. The Company sold 3,670,886 shares of its Class A common stock and common stock equivalents and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,341,722 shares of its Class A common stock at a combined public offering price of $0.79 per share (or prefunded warrant) and associated common warrants. Each share of Class A common stock (or prefunded warrant) was sold together with two warrants each to purchase one share of Class A common stock. The common warrants have an exercise price of $0.79 per share, are exercisable following stockholder approval, and have a term of exercise equal to five years following date of the stockholder approval. The closing of the offering occurred on November 12, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Alex Hawkins, Chief Financial Officer, said,** “We are pleased with our financial progress in the third quarter, highlighted by our improved gross margin and reduced operating expenses year over year. Our recent $2.9 million capital raise will help to restore our service levels and catch up to our run rate demand from existing distribution. We will continue to look for ways to address the inventory build required to support our upcoming distribution expansion in Q1. These expected increased volumes should contribute meaningfully in our efforts to close the gap to profitability. As we look forward, we remain focused on optimizing operations, securing and managing our capital efficiently, and delivering value to our shareholders.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net sales of $5.7 million, up 36.4% as compared to the third quarter a year ago. This is primarily the result of increased consumption of our products at retail by consumers.\n\n\n  * Gross profit of $1.2 million compared to $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, translating to a gross margin of 21.7% versus 13.3% in the prior-year period. This improvement highlights the Company’s focus on productivity and operational efficiency.\n\n\n  * Operating loss of ($2.3) million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to an operating loss of ($3.6) million in the same quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Other Expense of $0.8 million, primarily related to interest expenses, down from $1.1 million in the prior-year period.\n\n\n  * Net loss of ($3.1) million, or ($0.95) per share, as compared to a net loss of ($4.8) million, or ($2.14) per share, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n\n  * Adjusted loss per share¹ of ($0.89) in the third quarter of 2024, favorably comparing to an adjusted loss per share of ($1.66) in the prior-year period.\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss¹ of ($1.7) million for the third quarter of 2024, representing a 31.5% improvement over the ($2.5) million Adjusted EBITDA loss in the prior-year quarter. \n\n\n\n**Year-to-Date 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net sales of $16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, up 11.2% as compared to the comparable period a year ago. The mix of net sales improved year over year in part due to the Company’s discontinuation of certain retail programs, rationalization of low-quality revenue, which included the discontinuation of slow-moving and margin losing items some of which was still present in the prior year period while improved sell-through and growth in quality core accounts more than offset the rationalized revenues so far this year.\n\n\n  * Gross profit of $3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, compared to gross profit of $2.6 million in prior year period. The current year period’s improved performance is primarily attributable to enhanced sales-mix and better utilization of the facilities partially offset by higher commodity costs than in the prior year period.\n\n\n  * Operating loss of ($7.5) million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, as compared to operating loss of ($11.3) million in the prior year period representing a 33.1% improvement.\n\n\n  * Other Expense of $2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, is approximately flat compared to $2.5 million in the comparable period a year ago. This is in part attributable to approximately $0.3 million of a non-cash loss on the extinguishment of debt in the current year period related to the accounting treatment of the repricing of the warrants connected to the extension of the promissory notes issued on April 19, 2023. The prior year period was burdened by approximately $0.9 million in interest expense related to the accounting treatment of the warrants issued in connection with those same bridge notes issued in April 2023. The remaining difference is primarily attributable to interest expense on new convertible bridge notes put in place during the current year period.\n\n\n  * Net loss of ($10.0) million, or ($3.22) per share for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, as compared to a net loss of ($13.7) million, or ($6.41) per share, in the prior year period.\n\n\n  * Adjusted loss per share¹ of ($2.87) for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, which compares favorably to adjusted loss per share of ($5.44) for the year-ago period.\n\n\n  * Adjusted EBITDA loss¹ of ($5.5) million for the nine months ended September 30ᵗʰ, 2024, which represents a 34.0% improvement compared to ($8.4) million in the prior year period. \n\n\n\n¹ Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted loss per share are a non-GAAP financial measure as defined and reconciled to GAAP below.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.

Stryve’s management team uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share to make operating and strategic decisions, evaluate performance and comply with indebtedness related reporting requirements. Below are details on this non-GAAP measure and the non-GAAP adjustments that the management team makes in the definition of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings Per Share.

BUSINESS\nOverview\nStryve is an emerging healthy snacking company which manufactures, markets and sells differentiated healthy snacking products that Stryve believes can disrupt traditional\nsnacking categories. Stryve’s mission is “to help Americans snack better and live happier, better lives.” Stryve offers convenient snacks that are lower in sugar and\ncarbohydrates and higher in protein than other snacks. Stryve offers all-natural, delicious snacks which it believes are nutritious and offer consumers a convenient healthy\nsnacking option for their on-the-go lives.\nStryve’s current product portfolio consists primarily of air-dried meat snack products marketed under the Stryve®, Kalahari®, Braaitime®, and Vacadillos® brand names.\nUnlike beef jerky, Stryve’s all-natural air-dried meat snack products are made of beef and spices, are never cooked, generally contain zero grams of sugar, and are free of\nmonosodium glutamate (MSG), gluten, nitrates, nitrites, and preservatives. As a result, Stryve’s products are Keto and Paleo diet friendly. Further, based on protein density and\nsugar content, Stryve believes that its air-dried meat snack products are some of the healthiest shelf-stable snacks available today. Stryve also sells human-grade air-dried pet\ntreats marketed under the Two Tails® and Primal Paws brand names.\nStryve distributes its products in major retail channels, primarily in North America, including grocery, club stores, convenience stores and other retail outlets, as well as directly\nto consumers through its owned e-commerce websites as well as direct to consumer through the Amazon platform.\nStryve believes increased consumer focus in the U.S. on health and wellness will continue to drive growth of the nutritional snacking category and increase demand for Stryve’s\nproducts. Stryve has made substantial investments since its inception in product development, establishing its manufacturing facility, and building its marketing, sales and\noperations infrastructure to grow its business through both branded and private label opportunities. Stryve intends to continue to invest in product innovation and acquisition,\nimproving its supply chain, increasing its manufacturing capacity, and expanding its marketing and sales initiatives to continue its growth.\nStryve’s Strengths\nAligned with consumer trends. Stryve believes that a number of consumer trends in the U.S. will continue to drive the growth of the nutritional snacking category and increase\nthe demand for Stryve’s products. These trends include:\n•greater consumer focus on health and wellness;\n•nutrition guidance which recommends increased consumption of smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day;\n•preference for convenient, “better-for-you” snacks;\n•desire to reduce carbohydrate and sugar consumption; and\n•preference for snacks and other foods without additives or preservatives.\nStryve’s products are aligned with these trends, offering high protein content with limited ingredients, and generally contain zero grams of sugar, and are free of monosodium\nglutamate (MSG), gluten, nitrates, nitrites, and preservatives. Stryve believes its products appeal to consumers interested in an active lifestyle who are seeking protein rich, low-\ncarbohydrate snacking options, many of whom do not currently purchase meat snacks. Based on prior studies reviewed by Stryve's management, the Company believes that less\nthan a third of its target consumers, the healthy snack seekers in the United States, had purchased a meat snack in the prior 12 months. Stryve believes that with increased\nmarketing and consumer education, Stryve’s meat products will appeal to healthy snack seekers.\nScalable platform with an attractive market opportunity. The healthy snacking market is projected to be in excess of $150 billion by 2030 according to Statista and management\nestimates that the meat snack category alone is approximately $10 billion in size today. Stryve believes that it can leverage its relationships with its retail customers\n3\nand distributors to launch new products, brands and brand extensions, increase consumer recognition, and continue to expand its healthy snacking platform.\nManufacturing capacity to support growth. By manufacturing its own products, Stryve believes it can maintain pricing advantages against its competitors, achieve margins that\nsupport marketing spend, streamline innovation and new product development, and capitalize on potential private label opportunities. Stryve believes that its state-of-the-art\nmanufacturing facility can support its near-term growth plans with limited additional capital expenditures and is the only facility of scale with a full grant of inspection from the\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) to produce air-dried, never-cooked, shelf-stable meat snack products.\nExperienced management team. We have built an experienced team of industry veterans with collectively over 50 years of experience across multiple branded consumer\nproduct, food and nutrition categories. Our CEO, Christopher Boever, previously served in various senior management roles at Hormel Foods Corp, Conagra Brands, Inc.,\nPinnacle Foods Corp, and Hain Celestial North America. Our co-founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Ted Casey, was the founder and CEO of Dymatize Nutrition,\na nutrition supplement company. Alex Hawkins, our Chief Financial Officer, has experience acquiring, growing, and exiting businesses as a Principal at Rosewood Private\nInvestments, a private equity firm. Katie Grady, our Chief Customer Officer, previously served as Vice President of Sales at Living Greens Farm and The Hain Celestial Group.\nData-driven direct-to-consumer business. Stryve has developed a meaningful direct-to-consumer business for its brands. By utilizing a data-driven approach to digital\nmarketing, Stryve believes that it can more accurately target its ideal consumers.\nStryve’s Strategy\nPursue distribution growth in retail stores, augment private label opportunities, and expand its international distribution. Stryve has a strong relationship with leading retailers\nand distributors, including Walmart, Costco, Aldi, UNFI, KeHe, 7-Eleven and others. Stryve is working to expand its retail customer base store penetration across the grocery,\nmass, and convenience segments, as well as expanding the number of products available for sale at retail locations by adding additional product variations. Stryve is also\nworking to grow its private label business with its retail customers, which can support Stryve’s efforts to place its branded products in those customers’ locations. In addition,\nStryve may seek to develop relationships with international partners to expand its product sales outside the U.S. beyond its current very limited distribution in Canada and\nMexico.\nLeverage manufacturing capacity and existing platform to expand and strengthen product offerings. Stryve believes that its manufacturing facility located in Madill, Oklahoma\nis the largest air-drying meat facility operating in the United States, and one of only a limited number of such facilities approved by the USDA. This currently provides a barrier\nto entry for potential competitors to enter the air-dried meat snack category. Stryve plans to strengthen and expand its existing product offerings with new and innovative flavors\nand formats, simple ingredients, and packaging alternatives, to complement its current products and take advantage of its manufacturing capabilities. In addition, Stryve will\ncontinue to enhance, strengthen and expand its existing product offerings with new and innovative flavors and forms, simple ingredients and packaging alternatives.\nLeverage its e-commerce business as a competitive advantage. Stryve officially launched its Stryve.com direct-to-consumer business in the second quarter of 2020 and has sold\nits products directly to consumers through Amazon since 2018. Through 2021 e-commerce had been a key channel for growth for Stryve. While strategies have shifted to focus\ngrowth efforts on retail distribution, Stryve will utilize its direct relationship with consumers to better respond to trends in the market place, to test new product innovation, and\nto leverage these learnings in its sales story to retailers. Stryve uses focused targeted digital media to acquire, engage and retain consumers, including newsletters and discounts\nfor initial and repeat consumer orders. E-commerce sales provide Stryve with attractive gross margins, prompt payment, and the ability to gather critical marketing data and test\nnew product innovations.\nCapture market share while introducing healthy snackers to the meat snack category. By gaining retail distribution and competing within the existing meat snack category,\nStryve plans to capture market share from its meat snack competitors. Its superior products offer a better-for-you option without sacrificing taste. Stryve will seek to drive trial\nwith existing meat snack consumers though performance driven trade promotions and effective shopper marketing programs in partnership with its retailers.

Additionally, Stryve’s marketing strategy also focuses on building brand awareness, consumer trial building\nbrand loyalty through digital and social media strategies and tactics. Utilizing a combination of paid and earned media, intelligent e-mail and text campaigns designed to build\nconsumer awareness.\nTarget Demographics\nStryve’s target consumers are “healthy snack seekers,” many of whom eat meat, but who do not commonly purchase products from the meat snacks category. Stryve believes\nthat through their differentiated and innovative air-dried meat products and marketing efforts it will be able to bring healthy snack seekers to Stryve’s products. Stryve has\nsegmented healthy snack seekers group into five different sub-groups; fit and focused, disciplined and dieters, runners, cyclists, and the largest category, families in motion.\nStryve believes that these groups have above average household income, read nutritional labels and are seeking healthy snacks for themselves and their families. Stryve\nbelieves there is significant opportunity to expand its marketing, education and product sales to healthy snack seekers who are not necessarily looking for a biltong meat snack,\nbut are looking for health snacks that are high in protein with minimal sugar, low in carbohydrates, are free of monosodium glutamate (MSG), gluten, nitrates, nitrites, and\npreservatives, are Keto and Paleo diet-friendly and are all natural. In addition, Stryve hopes to gain ubiquitous availability to shoppers in the traditional meat snack category\noffering an alternative to jerky and meat sticks, thus, providing current jerky and meat stick consumers a ‘better for you’ alternative.\nBuilding Brand Awareness and Driving Product Trials\nStryve seeks to expand its consumer base and grow its business by educating consumers about its product benefits and taste in order to encourage product trials and support\nrepeat purchases resulting in customer loyalty and value. Stryve uses a variety of marketing and advertising strategies to connect with consumers, including paid digital media,\npaid influencers, organic social media efforts and in-person product displays and sampling.\nStryve dedicates a substantial portion of its marketing and advertising spending to digital marketing channels. Stryve’s website, www.stryve.com, and each of its brand’s\nwebsites, contain information about the product benefits and how\n6\nit is made, and nutritional information regarding the benefits of Stryve’s products. Stryve utilizes a data-driven approach in its e-commerce strategy, with specific consumer\nsegmentation and messaging tailored for different audiences.\nStryve extensively uses social media and online platforms including Google, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. These platforms allow Stryve to directly reach\ndesirable target audiences, offering product discounts and promotions, and educating consumers about the health benefits of its products.

Consumers can sign up for newsletter emails\non its website for access to information about its products and recipes. Stryve also seeks to build repeat purchases by using targeted discounts and promotions as well as\ninformation on product innovation through intelligent email flows, text messages and subscribe and save offerings.\nManufacturing\nSubstantially all of Stryve’s products are manufactured in the United States at its manufacturing facility in Madill, Oklahoma. Stryve believes that manufacturing its products\nsupports higher margins and speed to market, and facilitates its ability to take advantage of private label opportunities.\nSuppliers. Stryve relies on a limited number of vendors to supply it with beef and other raw materials. Stryve does not have any formal contracts or agreements in place with\nany meat providers, and tests the market regularly to optimize its commodity pricing. Stryve purchases the majority of its beef through beef brokers from suppliers located in\nthe United States. Given the minimally processed nature of air-dried production, the quality of the beef used in Stryve’s products is important. Currently, Stryve believes it can\nreplace its current suppliers of beef without significant impact to its business. The availability of grass-fed beef in the United States can be scarce at times, and may require\nStryve to seek such beef internationally to produce its grass-fed products. However, any disruption in the supply of beef or a substantial increase in the cost of beef could\nmaterially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe other principal ingredients used to manufacture Stryve products include vinegar, flavoring and spices, packaging, and lamb casings. These ingredients are generally readily\navailable in the market from many suppliers, Stryve believes that it can within a reasonable period of time make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of an\ninterruption of supply.\nProduction Process. Stryve believes that its manufacturing facility is the largest USDA approved air-dried meat manufacturing facility in the United States and that its\nextensive food safety procedures are proprietary. The manufacturing process for Stryve’s air-dried products generally consists of cutting whole muscle beef into steaks, mixing\nthe steaks with spices, air-drying the meat, slicing and packaging finished products.\nFood Safety and Quality. Stryve dedicates substantial resources to ensure that consumers receive safe, high quality food products, including, but not limited to, third-party\ntesting programs. Stryve’s manufacturing facility has a SQF Level II Food Safety Certification by the Safe Quality Food Institute. Stryve’s facility is inspected daily by the\nUSDA and other regulators such as state and local inspectors and is required to follow rigorous food safety guidelines. Stryve believes that the combination of USDA\nrequirements for approving air-drying meat facilities and USDA restrictions on importing air-dried or uncooked meats into the United States creates a barrier to entry for\ncompanies seeking to compete with Stryve’s products.\nQuality Control. Stryve developed quality protocols and procedures with its products and unique manufacturing processes in mind. Stryve performs testing on every lot of\nproduction intended to ensure that its products match Stryve’s standards, including by conducting sampling at various times throughout the production process.\nStorage & fulfillment. Stryve leases real property in Frisco, Texas, where it stores some finished product and conducts its fulfillment operations. Stryve leases approximately\n70,928 square feet of floor space within the Frisco, Texas property to serve as a distribution center. Stryve fulfills the majority of its orders from its facility in Frisco, Texas,\nusing commercial freight carriers. Stryve fulfills certain orders by key customers through a retail consolidator. Stryve also partners with Amazon to fulfill its direct-to-consumer\nsales made on the Amazon platform.\n7\nDistribution\nStryve distributes its products through a number of channels:\nRetailers. Stryve distributes, either directly or through a distributor, its products in major retail channels, primarily in North America, including mass, convenience, grocery,\nclub stores, and other retail outlets. Growing distribution is a key strategy for Stryve. Despite the Company's historical success at gaining points of distribution, its brands are not\nubiquitously available in stores. Gaining retail distribution will help support net sales growth as well as allow for more efficient marketing spend as consumers will have more\nopportunities to buy the Company's products. Sales to Stryve’s largest retailers, Walmart Inc. and McLane Company, Inc. represented 21% and 13%, respectively of its net sales\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023. Stryve continued to deepen its relationship with customers throughout 2023.\nDirect-to-Consumer E-Commerce. Stryve launched its stryve.com direct-to-consumer business in the second quarter of 2020, and has sold its products on Amazon since 2018.\nStryve utilizes a data-driven approach to grow the e-commerce space with specific customer segmentation and messaging tailored for each audience. Stryve sells products\ndirectly to consumers through its websites, including Stryve.com, Eatbiltong.com, Vacadillos.com and Braaitime.com.\nPrivate Label. Stryve also manufactures and sells its products under private labels for certain retailers, including Aldi, Inc.\nInternational. Stryve currently offers its products for sale to a limited extent in Canada and Mexico through distribution partners. International sales represent an area for\npotential expansion.\nProduct Innovation\nStryve seeks to capitalize on the capacity of its manufacturing facility by expanding its product line to include additional dried meat snack products and flavors and form\nvarieties, and expanding into additional meat snack products. Stryve’s innovation strategy is based on its ongoing research into consumers’ healthy lifestyle, nutritional needs\nand preferences.\nIntellectual Property\nStryve currently owns domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to its business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are\nvalid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Stryve believes the protection of its trademarks, domain names,\ntrade dress and trade secrets are important to its success. Stryve protects its intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of trademark, trade dress and trade secret\nlaws. Stryve also owns all of the recipes and specifications to its products.\nCompetition\nStryve competes in both retail and e-commerce channels with companies which make beef jerky and meat snacking products, as well companies in the healthy snacking industry\nwhich sell meal replacement bars and other healthy snacks.\nThe snack industry is large and intensely competitive. In the meat snack market, Stryve’s competitors include Jack Links, Slim Jim (Conagra), Tillamook, Matador (Frito-Lay),\nCountry Archer, Chef’s Cut, Krave, Old Trapper, Chomps, Epic and others. In addition, the healthy snacking industry is fragmented and highly competitive, and includes\nmakers of protein bars, protein shakes and other specialty healthy snacks. Competitive factors include product quality, taste, brand awareness among consumers, nutritional\ncontent, simpler and less processed ingredients, innovation, variety of snacks offered, grocery aisle placement, access to retailer shelf space, price, advertising and promotion,\nproduct packaging and package design.\n8\nStryve’s current and potential competitors may offer products similar to its products, and a wider range of products than it offers, and may offer such products at more\ncompetitive prices than Stryve. Many of Stryve’s competitors have resources substantially greater than it has and sells brands that are more widely recognized than Stryve’s\nbrands.\nRegulation and Compliance\nStryve, along with its brokers, distributors, ingredients and packaging suppliers, is subject to laws and regulations in the United States promulgated by federal, state and local\ngovernment authorities.

achieve or sustain profitability.\nStryve has experienced net losses since its inception. In the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Stryve incurred net losses of $19.0 million and $33.2 million,\nrespectively, and has outstanding debt obligations and lease liabilities totaling $11.7 million and $4.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. Stryve's operating\nexpenses and capital expenditures may increase in the foreseeable future as it continues to increase its customer base and supplier network, expand its product offerings and\nbrands, expand marketing channels, invest in facilities, hire additional employees and enhance technology and production capabilities. The efforts to grow may prove more\nexpensive than anticipated, and Stryve may not succeed in increasing its revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the potentially increased expenses. In addition, many of\nStryve’s expenses, including certain costs associated with its existing and any future manufacturing facilities, are fixed and may impact Stryve's ability to reduce its losses.\nAccordingly, Stryve may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability, repay its outstanding indebtedness and it may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nOur financial statements contain a statement regarding a substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe incurred net losses of $19.0 million and $33.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and have an accumulated deficit of approximately\n$136.3 million from the inception of the Company prior to the Business Combination through December 31, 2023. In addition, we have $8.4 million of outstanding\nindebtedness that is due within the next 12 months. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 are prepared in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of\nbusiness. We have evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern\nwithin one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued and based on an evaluation of the conditions described in Item 7 – Liquidity and Capital\nResources and Note 2 – Liquidity and Going Concern to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, such conditions raise substantial doubt\nabout our ability to continue as a going concern.\n16\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from the ordinary\ncourse of business operations when they become due. We are also currently evaluating several different strategies to enhance our liquidity position. These strategies may\ninclude, but are not limited to, pursuing additional actions under our business transformation plan, and seeking additional financing from both the public and private markets\nthrough the issuance of equity or debt securities. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time. We need additional funding to execute our\nbusiness plan and continue operations. If capital is not available to us when, and in the amounts needed, we could be required to liquidate our inventory and assets, cease or\ncurtail operations, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws or similar state\nproceedings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital we need to continue our operations.\nThe substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may affect the price of our Class A common stock, may impact our relationship with third parties with\nwhom we do business, including our customers, vendors, lenders and employees, may impact our ability to raise additional capital and may impact our ability to comply going\nforward with covenants in our debt agreements.\nStryve will need additional capital and it may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nStryve will need to access additional capital to finance its operations. However, financing may not be available to Stryve on acceptable terms, or at all. Stryve’s ability to obtain\nadditional financing will be subject to several factors, including market conditions, its operating performance and investor sentiment and any financial or operating covenants\nrequired. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing unattractive, if available. If Stryve cannot generate sufficient funds from\noperations or raise additional capital on a timely basis when needed, its growth or operations could be impeded and its ability to continue as a going concern would be materially\nimpacted.\nStryve may not have or be able to generate sufficient cash to meet its current or future debt service obligations.\nStryve’s ability to meet its current or future debt service obligations or to refinance its current or future debt, depends on its operating and financial performance, which will be\naffected by Stryve’s ability to successfully implement its business strategy as well as general macroeconomic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond its\ncontrol. As of December 31, 2023, Stryve has $8.4 million of outstanding indebtedness due within the next twelve months. If Stryve cannot generate sufficient cash to meet its\ndebt service requirements or if Stryve is unable to refinance its debt, Stryve may, among other things, need to delay planned capital expenditures or investments or sell material\nassets to meet those obligations.\nIf Stryve is not able to refinance any or all of its current or future debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets, including engaging in sale and leaseback transactions, on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all, it may not be able to satisfy its debt obligations. In that event, borrowings under other debt agreements or instruments that contain\ncross-default or cross-acceleration provisions with respect to other indebtedness may become payable on demand and Stryve may not have sufficient funds to repay all of its\ndebts.\nGeneral economic or geopolitical conditions, including inflationary conditions, ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and the impact of pandemics, may disrupt\nStryve’s business, including, among other things, consumption and trade patterns, supply chain, and production processes, each of which could materially and adversely\naffect Stryve's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve's overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced\nsignificant economic and market downturns in the past, and are likely to experience additional cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity is impacted by\nfalling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets,\ninflation, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly, and the full impact of such conditions can be\ndifficult to predict, such as the future expectations in this inflationary environment. In addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential\ntrade wars and other events beyond our control, such as ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally\nand increase the volatility of global financial markets. The actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic,\n17\npandemic or similar widespread public health concern could also materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse and uncertain economic conditions, such as those caused by inflation or a pandemic, may impact distributor, retailer and consumer demand for Stryve’s products. In\naddition, Stryve’s ability to manage normal commercial relationships with its suppliers, distributors, retailers, consumers and creditors may suffer. Consumers may shift\npurchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns. Distributors and retailers may become more conservative in response to these\nconditions and seek to reduce their inventories. Stryve’s results of operations depend upon, among other things, its ability to maintain and increase sales volume with existing\ndistributors and retailer customers, its ability to attract new consumers, the financial condition of its consumers, and its ability to provide products that appeal to consumers at\nattractive prices. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse effect on Stryve’s sales and ability to achieve profitability, which could materially and\nadversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBeef, other raw material and packaging costs can be volatile and have recently risen significantly as a result of inflation, supply chain issues, pandemics and other factors,\nwhich negatively impact the ability of Stryve to achieve profitability and its gross margins.\nStryve purchases large quantities of raw materials to make its products, including beef. Historically, beef prices have fluctuated in response to a number of factors, including\nchanges in the United States government farm support programs, changes in international agricultural and trading policies, weather, animal disease and other conditions. In\naddition, Stryve purchases and uses significant quantities of cardboard, film and plastic to package its products. Costs of raw materials, ingredients and packaging are volatile\nand can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, weather conditions, consumer demand and changes in governmental\ntrade and agricultural programs.\nThroughout 2022 and into 2023, the price volatility of beef, raw materials and other supplies Stryve purchases has increased significantly as a result of COVID-19 measures,\ninflation, transportation costs, the war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and other factors. It is unclear when and whether and if such prices will normalize. Stryve may\nnot be able to implement price increases for its products to cover any increased costs and any price increases it does implement may result in lower sales volumes. If Stryve is\nnot successful in managing its beef, raw material and packaging costs, or if it is unable to increase prices to cover increased costs and maintain the Company's gross margins or\nif such price increases reduce sales volumes, then such increases in costs will adversely affect its business, profitability, gross margins, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nStryve relies on a limited number of third-party suppliers, and may not be able to obtain beef and other raw materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities to produce\nits products or meet the demand for its products.\nStryve relies on a limited number of vendors and key brokers to supply it with beef and other raw materials, and its financial performance depends in large part on its ability to\npurchase beef and other raw materials in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. Stryve is not assured of continued supply or pricing of beef or other raw materials. Stryve\ntypically does not have any formal contracts or agreements in place with any meat providers and purchases meat as demand requires in order to produce its products. Any of\nStryve’s suppliers could discontinue or seek to alter their relationship with Stryve. Over the last three years as beef suppliers across North America faced production challenges,\nthe price of beef and other raw meats were increasing volatile and trending upwards. If Stryve’s suppliers continue to experience problems with their businesses, finances, labor\nrelations, ability to import raw materials, costs, production, insurance and reputation, as well as natural disasters, fires or other catastrophic occurrences, it could impair Stryve’s\nability to obtain sufficient raw materials at competitive prices and negatively impact Stryve's gross margins.\nGiven the minimally processed nature of biltong production, the quality of the beef used in Stryve’s products is important. Currently, the availability of grass-fed beef in the\nUnited States can be scarce at times, and may require Stryve to seek such beef internationally. Any interruption in the supply of high quality beef due to supply, disease, war,\ncost of transportation, labor shortages or other unforeseen circumstances would negatively impact Stryve’s business. If Stryve needs to replace an existing beef supplier or\nanother supplier of raw materials, there can be no assurance that supplies will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all, or that a new supplier would allocate\nsufficient capacity to Stryve in order to meet its requirements, fill orders in a timely manner or meet Stryve’s\n18\nquality standards. Any disruption (or price increases) in the supply of beef or other raw materials from its suppliers could materially and adversely affect its business,\nprofitability, gross margins, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve may not be able to compete successfully in the highly competitive snacking and nutritional snacking industry.\nStryve’s competitors include companies selling beef jerky and other meat snacks, as well as companies in the nutritional snack industry in general, including those selling meal\nreplacement bars and other healthy snacks. The snacking industry is large and intensely competitive. Competitive factors include product quality, taste, brand awareness among\nconsumers, nutritional content, simpler and less processed ingredients, innovation of “on-trend” snacks, variety of snacks offered, grocery aisle placement, access to retailer\nshelf space, price, advertising and promotion, product packaging and package design. Stryve competes in this market against numerous multinational, regional and local\ncompanies principally based on product taste and quality, brand recognition and loyalty, nutritional content, marketing, advertising and price. Views towards nutritional\nsnacking, and other nutritional approaches, are cyclical, with constantly changing consumer perceptions. If consumers do not perceive that a meat-based, low-carb, low-sugar\nand protein-rich eating approach is healthy or effective, Stryve’s business could be adversely affected.\nMany of Stryve’s competitors have resources substantially greater than Stryve and sell brands that are more widely recognized than its brands and may offer generic or private-\nlabel products at more competitive prices than its brands. Stryve’s current and potential competitors may offer products similar to its products, offer a wider range of products\nthan it offers, offer such products at more competitive prices than Stryve or decide to build a biltong facility and start competing directly with Stryve’s biltong products. Local\nor regional markets often have significant additional competitors, many of whom offer products similar to Stryve’s and may have unique ties to regional or national retail\nchains. Other label, generic or store-branded products may be a less expensive option for consumers than Stryve products, making it more difficult to sell Stryve branded\nproducts. Any increased or new competition from existing meat snacking companies, including an expansion of their products to biltong products, or new products or entrants\nfrom other nutritious snack companies, could cause reductions in Stryve’s sales, require it to reduce prices, or both, which could materially and adversely affect its business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nStryve’s brand and reputation may be diminished due to real or perceived quality or health issues with its products, including meat, which could materially and adversely\naffect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReal or perceived quality or food safety concerns or failures to comply with applicable food regulations and requirements, whether or not based on fact and whether or not\ninvolving Stryve (such as incidents involving meat-based products in general), could cause negative publicity and reduced confidence in Stryve, its brand or products, or meat-\nbased products in general, which could in turn harm its reputation and sales, and could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough Stryve believes it has rigorous food safety and quality control processes, there can be no assurance that its products will always comply with the standards set for its\nproducts.\nStryve has no control over its products once purchased by consumers. Consumers may improperly store Stryve’s products, which may adversely affect their quality and safety.\nIf consumers do not perceive Stryve’s products to be safe or of high quality, then the value of its brand would be diminished. The growing use of social and digital media by\nconsumers and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative publicity about Stryve, its brands or\nproducts, on social, digital or other media could seriously damage its brands and reputation, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\n19\nProduct removals, damaged product or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We may become involved in lawsuits and\nlegal proceedings alleging that the consumption of any of our products causes or caused injury, illness or death. Any such product removal, damaged product or an adverse\nresult in any litigation related to such a product removal or damaged product could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results in future periods,\ndepending on the costs of the product removal from the market, the destruction of product inventory, diversion of management time and attention, contractual and other claims\nmade by customers that we supply, loss of key customers, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is\nunsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could\nbe adversely affected if our customers or consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.\nIf Stryve fails to implement its growth strategies successfully, timely, or at all, its ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability could be materially and adversely\naffected.\nStryve’s success depends in large part on its ability to implement its growth strategies effectively. Stryve expects to continue its focus on nutritious meat snack products and\nmay seek to add additional brands and other products to its portfolio. Stryve’s ability to expand successfully depends on, among other things, its ability to identify, and\nsuccessfully cater to, new demographics and consumer trends, develop new products, secure shelf space in grocery stores, wholesale clubs and other retailers, increase its direct\ne-commerce sales, increase consumer awareness of its brands, enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third-party retailers and other potential distributors of\nits products, and compete with numerous other companies and products.\nConsumers are constantly seeking new products and strategies to achieve their healthy eating goals. Stryve’s success depends heavily on its ability to anticipate changes in\nconsumer preferences, the technical capability of its innovation staff in developing and testing product prototypes, including complying with applicable governmental\nregulations, and the success of its management and sales and marketing teams in marketing its new and existing products, including familiarizing consumers in the United States\nwith biltong. Failure to develop and market new products that appeal to consumers may lead to a decrease in Stryve’s sales and impact its ability to achieve profitability.\nAdditionally, the development and introduction of new products requires substantial research, development and marketing expenditures, which Stryve may be unable to recoup\nif the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance.\nStryve may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategies, expand its brands, develop brand loyalty or continue to maintain growth in sales at its current rate, or at\nall. If Stryve fails to implement its growth strategies or if it invests resources in growth strategies that prove unsuccessful, its sales and ability to achieve profitability may be\nnegatively affected, which would materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Stryve fails to effectively manage its manufacturing and production capacity, its business and operating results and brand reputation could be harmed.\nIf Stryve does not have sufficient capacity to meet its customers’ demands and to satisfy increased demand, it will need to expand its operations, supply and manufacturing\ncapabilities. Stryve may not be able to effectively scale production processes and effectively manage its supply chain requirements. Stryve may not be able to accurately\nforecast demand for its products, since its forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. Any failure to accurately forecast demand for its products may affect Stryve’s ability to\nobtain adequate manufacturing capacity (whether its own manufacturing capacity or co-manufacturing capacity) in order to meet the demand for its products, which could harm\nits brand and business, and in some cases may result in discounts, credits or other payments to customers or distributors if it is unable to fulfill orders placed by them in a timely\nmanner or at all.\nIf Stryve overestimates demand for its products, it may have significantly underutilized assets and may experience reduced margins. If Stryve does not accurately align its\nmanufacturing capabilities with demand for its products, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n20\nMost of Stryve’s air-dried meat products are manufactured in its single facility in Oklahoma and any damage to or disruption at this facility would materially and adversely\naffect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve manufactures substantially all of its air-dried meat products at a single facility in Oklahoma. A natural disaster, tornado, fire, power interruption, pandemic, work\nstoppage (due to a pandemic or otherwise), regulatory or food safety issue or other problem at this facility would significantly disrupt Stryve’s ability to manufacture and deliver\nits products and operate its business. Stryve’s manufacturing facility and equipment is costly and may require substantial time to replace or repair if necessary. During such\ntime, Stryve may not be able to find suitable co-manufacturers to replace the output from Stryve’s facility on a timely basis or at a reasonable cost, if at all. Stryve may also\nexperience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production because of regulatory issues, equipment failure or delays in raw material deliveries. Any such disruption or\nunanticipated event may cause significant interruptions or delays in Stryve’s business. While Stryve has property and business interruption insurance for its manufacturing\nfacility, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of Stryve’s potential losses, and may not continue to be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any disruption in the\noperation of Stryve’s manufacturing facility, or damage to a material amount of its equipment or inventory, would materially and adversely affect its business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nStryve currently relies on sales to a limited number of retailers and losing one or more such retailers could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nA significant portion of Stryve’s sales is generated from a limited number of retailers. These retailers, or other large customers, may take actions that affect Stryve for reasons it\ncannot anticipate or control, such as their financial condition, changes in their business strategy or operations, the perceived quality of Stryve’s products and the availability of\ncompeting products. There can be no assurance Stryve’s customers will continue to purchase its products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past.\nStryve’s customers rarely provide it with firm, long- or short-term volume purchase commitments. As a result, Stryve could have periods with limited orders for its products\nwhile still incurring costs related to workforce maintenance, marketing, manufacturing and general corporate expenses. Stryve may not find new customers to supplement its\nrevenue in periods when it experiences reduced purchase orders, or recover fixed costs incurred during those periods, which could materially and adversely affect Stryve’s\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidation of customers or the loss of a significant customer could negatively impact Stryve’s sales and ability to achieve profitability.\nSupermarkets in North America and elsewhere continue to consolidate. This consolidation has produced larger, more sophisticated organizations with increased negotiating and\nbuying power that are able to resist price increases, as well as operate with lower inventories, decrease the number of brands that they carry, and increase their emphasis on\nprivate label products, all of which could negatively impact Stryve’s business. The consolidation of retail customers also increases the risk that a significant adverse impact on\ntheir business could have a corresponding material adverse impact on Stryve’s business.\nThe loss of any large customer, the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of any business from a large customer for an extended length of time could negatively\nimpact Stryve’s sales and ability to achieve profitability. Furthermore, as retailers consolidate, they may reduce the number of branded products they offer in order to\naccommodate private label products and generate more competitive terms from branded suppliers. Consequently, Stryve’s financial results may fluctuate significantly from\nperiod to period based on the actions of one or more significant retailers. A retailer may take actions that affect Stryve for reasons that cannot be anticipated or controlled, such\nas their financial condition, changes in their business strategy or operations, the introduction of competing products or the perceived quality of Stryve’s products. Despite\noperating in different channels, Stryve’s retailers sometimes compete for the same consumers. Because of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from this competition, retailers\nmay take actions that could negatively affect Stryve’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n21\nStryve’s growth may be limited if it is unable to add additional shelf or retail space for its products.\nStryve’s results will depend on its ability to drive revenue growth, in part, by expanding the distribution channels for its products. However, Stryve’s ability to do so may be\nlimited by an inability to secure additional shelf or retail space for its products. Shelf and retail space for nutritional snacks is limited and subject to competitive and other\npressures, and there can be no assurance that retail operators will provide sufficient shelf space nor that online retailers will provide Stryve online access to their platform to\nenable Stryve to meet its growth objectives.\nChanges in retail distribution arrangements may result in the temporary loss of retail shelf space and disrupt sales of food products which could materially and adversely\naffect Stryve’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, retailers may change distribution centers that supply some of their retail stores. If a new distribution center or partner has not previously distributed Stryve’s\nproducts in that region, it may take time for a retailer’s distribution center or partner to begin distributing new products in its region. Even if a retailer approves a new\ndistribution method in a region, Stryve’s sales may decline while the transition in distribution method takes place. If Stryve does not get approval to have its products offered in\na new distribution region or if getting this approval takes longer than anticipated, Stryve’s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and\nadversely affected.\nAdditionally, Stryve relies on the performance of distribution partners to ensure the timely and accurate distribution of its products to certain retail customers. Should one of\nthese distributions partners fail to timely and accurately distribute Stryve’s products, it may result in limited products available for purchase, poor supplier reviews, and\npotentially loss of retail shelf space which could materially and adversely affect Stryve’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSlotting fees and customer charges or charge-backs for promotion allowances, cooperative advertising, and product or packaging damages, as well as undelivered or unsold\nfood products may disrupt Stryve’s customer relationships and could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRetailers may charge slotting fees for access to shelf space and often enter into promotional and advertising arrangements with manufacturers that result in the sharing of\npromotional and advertising costs among the retail customer, distributor or manufacturer. As the retail industry has consolidated and become more competitive, retailers have\nsought greater participation by manufacturers in cooperative promotional and advertising arrangements and may seek to pass on unanticipated increases in promotional and\nadvertising costs to distributors and manufacturers. If Stryve is charged significant and unanticipated promotional allowances or advertising charges directly or indirectly by\nretail customers, or if Stryve, its third-party distributors, retailers or its other direct or indirect customers take substantial charge-backs or return material amounts of its\nproducts, its operating results and liquidity could be harmed, perhaps substantially. Moreover, unresolved disagreements with retail customers concerning invoiced costs to\ncarry its products could significantly disrupt or cause the termination of customer relationships. If Stryve fails to effectively manage costs and charges concerning promotional\nallowances, advertising charges, charge-backs or returns, such failures could materially and adversely affect Stryve’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve offers a limited number of products and any change in consumer demand for air dried meat products or meat products in general could materially and adversely\naffect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDried meat snack products have been the focal point of Stryve’s sales, product development and marketing efforts and Stryve believes that such products will continue to\nconstitute the primary portion of its sales and cash flow for the foreseeable future. Any change in consumer perceptions or negative developments associated with the\nconsumption, safety, health or benefits of the human consumption of meat, including but not limited to biltong and beef jerky products, could cause a decrease in demand for air\ndried meat or meat products in general, which would negatively impact Stryve’s business and operations. Stryve may also be unable to convince healthy snackers to try its meat\nsnack products. In addition, Stryve cannot be certain that it will be able to expand to new product offerings, as the food industry in general involves evolving consumer\npreferences and new and changing nutritional and health-related concerns. If Stryve is unable to identify and react appropriately to changes in consumer trends, demands and\n22\npreferences, it may experience reduced demand and price reduction for its products, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nStryve may not successfully increase production capacity at its manufacturing facility or its facility may not operate in accordance with its expectations.\nStryve may on occasion experience unanticipated increases in orders of its products from retailers that it may not yet have the manufacturing capacity or capabilities to fulfill on\na timely basis. If Stryve cannot timely fill orders for its products, its reputation with these retailers may be harmed, which could materially and adversely affect its business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Any substantial delay in Stryve’s plan to increase the production capacity or capabilities of the facility may hinder Stryve’s ability\nto fill anticipated orders, grow its business or achieve profitability.\nFailure by transportation providers to deliver Stryve’s products on time, or at all, could result in lost sales.\nStryve relies upon third-party transportation providers for its product shipments. The utilization of delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel\nprices, employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet shipping needs. Stryve could face\nlogistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries or could incur costs and expend resources in connection with a change or providers. Any significant delays in product\nshipments could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Stryve fails to cost-effectively acquire new customers or retain its existing customers or its consumers, or if it fails to derive revenue from its existing customers consistent\nwith its historical performance, its business could be materially and adversely affected.\nStryve’s success, and its ability to increase revenue and achieve profitably, depends in part on its ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers, to retain existing customers,\nand to keep existing consumers engaged so that they continue to purchase Stryve’s products. If Stryve is unable to cost-effectively acquire new customers, retain existing\ncustomers or keep existing consumers engaged, its business, profitability, gross margins, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. If\nconsumers do not perceive Stryve’s product offerings to be healthy, of sufficient value and quality, or if it fails to offer new and relevant product offerings, it may not be able to\nattract or retain customers or engage existing consumers so that they continue to purchase products.\nStryve may face difficulties if it expands its operations into countries in which it has no prior operating experience.\nStryve may expand into countries other than the United States, such as less developed countries which may have less political, social or economic stability and less developed\ninfrastructure and legal systems. In addition, it may be difficult for Stryve to understand and accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in new\ngeographic markets. It would be costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote Stryve’s brands in international markets. If Stryve\nexpands its business into new countries, it may encounter regulatory, legal, personnel, technological and other difficulties that increase its expenses and/or delay its ability to\noperate profitably in such countries, which may have a material adverse effect on its business and brand.\nFailure to retain Stryve’s senior management may adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve’s success is substantially dependent on the continued service of certain members of its senior management, including but not limited to its Chief Executive Officer,\nChristopher Boever, and its Chief Financial Officer, Alex Hawkins. These executives have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of Stryve’s\nbusiness and for executing its growth strategy and are integral to its brand, culture and the reputation it enjoys with suppliers, distributors, customers and consumers. The loss of\nthe services of any of these executives could have a material adverse effect on Stryve’s business, financial condition and results of operations, as it may not be able to find\nsuitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all.\n23\nAdverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions or\ntransactional counterparties, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEvents involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in\nthe financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may\nin the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. Although we assess our banking and customer relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding\nsources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by\nfactors that affect us, the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability\nto perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial\nmarkets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry.\nIn addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or\ncosts and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing\non acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our\noperating expenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations, result in breaches of our contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour\nlaws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors described above or other related or similar factors not described above, could have material adverse\nimpacts on our liquidity and our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nAlthough we generally seek to diversify our cash and cash equivalents across several financial institutions in an attempt to minimize exposure to any one of these entities, we\ncurrently have cash and cash equivalents deposited in Origin Bank significantly in excess of federally insured levels where we currently hold approximately 100% of our cash.\nThe domestic bank deposit balances may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. If any of the financial institutions in which we have\ndeposited funds ultimately fails, we may lose our uninsured deposits at such financial institutions, and/or we may be required to move our accounts to another financial\ninstitution, which could cause operational difficulties, such as delays in making payments to our partners and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business\nand financial condition.\nStryve may enter into partnerships, acquisitions or joint ventures and it may not successfully integrate, operate or realize the anticipated benefits.\nStryve may pursue partnerships, acquisitions or joint ventures involving products that complement its existing products, as well as brands in new categories and new\ngeographies, to expand its business to include other nutritional snacks and potentially other food products. Stryve may not be able to successfully identify suitable partnerships,\nacquisition candidates, negotiate such partnerships or acquisitions of identified candidates on favorable terms, or integrate acquisitions it may complete.\nStrategic partnerships and acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase target\nprices and/or materially and adversely affect Stryve’s ability to consummate transactions on favorable terms. These risks include the potential unavailability of financial\nresources necessary to consummate acquisitions, the risk that Stryve overpays for an acquisition, the potential inability to identify all of the risks and liabilities inherent in a\ntarget company or assets notwithstanding diligence efforts, the diversion of management’s attention from the day-to-day operations of the business and additional strain on\nexisting personnel, increased leverage resulting from any debt financing that may be required to complete an acquisition, and the need to obtain regulatory or other\ngovernmental approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions.\nAny strategic partnerships or acquisitions may pose risks associated with entry into new geographic markets, distribution channels, lines of business or product categories,\nwhere Stryve may not have significant prior experience.\n24\nPotential strategic partnerships or acquisitions may entail significant transaction costs and require significant management time and distraction from its core business, even\nwhere it cannot consummate or decides not to pursue a particular transaction.\nIntegration of acquired entities can involve significant difficulties. These include the failure to achieve financial or operating objectives regarding an acquisition, systems,\noperational and managerial controls and procedures, the need to modify systems or to add management resources, difficulties in the integration and retention of consumers or\npersonnel and the integration and effective deployment of operations or technologies, amortization of acquired assets (which would reduce future reported earnings), possible\nadverse short-term effects on cash flows or operating results, integrating personnel with diverse backgrounds and organizational cultures, coordinating sales and marketing\nfunctions and retaining key personnel of an acquired business. Failure to manage these risks could have an adverse effect on Stryve’s business should Stryve pursue\npartnerships, acquisitions or join ventures.\nStryve relies upon Amazon, Shopify and other vendors to host and operate portions of its e-commerce business and platforms and any disruption of or interference with its\nuse of these services would adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve outsources the hosting and operation of some of its e-commerce business and platforms to infrastructures like Amazon, Shopify and other vendors. Customers of\nStryve’s products need to be able to access these platforms and websites to shop, review our product offerings and prices and purchase its products. Some of its vendors run\ntheir own platform that Stryve accesses, and it is, therefore, vulnerable to service interruptions. Stryve has experienced and expects that in the future it may experience\ninterruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website\nhosting disruptions and capacity constraints. Capacity constraints could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security\nattacks.\nIf Stryve’s customers are unable to purchase its products within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then Stryve’s business, financial condition and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected. In some instances, Stryve may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to its\ncustomers. Any of the above circumstances or events may possibly move customers to stop purchasing Stryve’s products, impair its ability to increase revenue from existing\ncustomers, impair its ability to grow its customer base and otherwise harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve relies on information technology systems and any inadequacy, failure, interruption or security breaches of those systems may harm its ability to operate its business.\nStryve is dependent on various information technology systems, including, but not limited to, networks, applications and outsourced services in connection with the operation of\nits business. A failure of information technology systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt Stryve’s business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and\nloss of sales, causing the business to suffer. In addition, Stryve’s information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond its\ncontrol, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, viruses and security breaches. Any such damage or interruption could materially and adversely affect its business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nA cybersecurity incident or other technology disruptions could negatively impact Stryve's business, financial condition, results of operations and relationships with\ncustomers.\nStryve uses computers in substantially all aspects of its business operations, including direct sales through its e-commerce website. It also uses mobile devices, social\nnetworking and other online activities to connect with employees, suppliers, distributors, customers and consumers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security\nbreaches, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Stryve’s business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive\nand/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers’ and suppliers’ information, private information about employees and financial and strategic\ninformation about it and its business partners. As Stryve continues to pursue growth strategies, it will also be expanding its reliance on information technologies, resulting in a\nlarger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If Stryve fails to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with acquisitions and new\ninitiatives, it may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. While Stryve has implemented measures\n25\nintended to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, its preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be effective. The theft, destruction, loss,\nmisappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with information technology systems or the technology systems\nof third parties on which it relies, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and\ncompetitive disadvantage all of which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to Stryve’s limited number of key employees, the loss of services of any of Stryve’s key employees could have a material adverse effect on Stryve’s business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nStryve must hire, retain and develop key employees at its corporate office and, manufacturing and warehouse facilities. Stryve competes to hire new personnel with the variety\nof skills needed to manufacture, sell and distribute our products. Unplanned or increased turnover of employees with key capabilities, failure to attract and develop personnel\nwith key capabilities, including emerging capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing skills, or failure to develop adequate succession plans for leadership positions or\nto hire and retain a workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our\ncompetitiveness. Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of key employees.\nThe labor market has become increasingly tight and competitive and we may face sudden and unforeseen challenges in the availability of labor, such as we have experienced\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our workforce caused by a pandemic or related policies and mandates, or as a\nresult of general macroeconomic factors, have led and could in the future lead to production or shipping delays, increased costs, including increased wages to attract and retain\nemployees and increased overtime to meet demand. Our ability to recruit and retain key employees could also be materially impacted if we fail to adequately respond to rapidly\nchanging employee expectations regarding fair compensation, an inclusive and diverse workplace, flexible working or other matters.\nIf Stryve is unable to continue to attract and retain key employees, it could have a material adverse effect on Stryve’s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nStryve’s only significant asset is its ownership interest in Holdings and such ownership may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable it to\npay any dividends on its outstanding shares or to satisfy its other financial obligations, including any payments required to be made by Stryve under the Tax Receivables\nAgreement.\nStryve is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of Class A common units of Holdings. Stryve is not expected to have independent means of\ngenerating revenue or cash flow, and its ability to pay its taxes, operating expenses (including expenses as a publicly traded company) and pay any dividends in the future will\nbe dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of its subsidiaries.\nThe financial condition and operating requirements of Stryve's subsidiaries may limit its ability to obtain cash from Holdings. There can be no assurance that Stryve's\nsubsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to enable Holdings to distribute funds to Stryve or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions, including negative\ncovenants under debt instruments will permit such distributions. If Holdings does not distribute sufficient funds to Stryve to pay its taxes or other liabilities, Stryve may default\non contractual obligations or have to borrow additional funds. In the event that Stryve is required to borrow additional funds, it could adversely affect its liquidity and subject it\nto additional restrictions imposed by lenders.\nStryve's subsidiary will be treated as a disregarded entity for United States federal income tax purposes and is wholly owned by Holdings, which will be taxed as a partnership\nUnited States federal income tax purposes. As such, both Holdings and Stryve's subsidiaries will not be subject to any entity-level United States federal income tax. Instead,\ntaxable income and taxable loss of Holdings and Stryve's subsidiaries will be allocated by Holdings, for United States federal income tax purposes, to the holders of Units of\nHoldings. Under the terms of the Amended Holdings Operating Agreement, Holdings is obligated to make pro rata tax distributions to holders of Units of Holdings calculated at\ncertain assumed rates. In addition to tax expenses, Stryve will also incur expenses related to its operations, including payment obligations under the Tax Receivables Agreement,\nwhich could be significant and some of which will be reimbursed (excluding payment obligations under the Tax Receivables Agreement). For so long as Stryve is the Managing\nMember (as defined in the Amended Holdings Operating Agreement) of Holdings, Stryve intends to cause\n26\nHoldings to make ordinary distributions and tax distributions to the holders of Units of Holdings on a pro rata basis in amounts sufficient to enable Stryve to cover all applicable\ntaxes, relevant operating expenses, payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement and dividends, if any, declared by Stryve. However, Holdings’ ability to make such\ndistributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions, including, but not limited to, retention of amounts necessary to satisfy the obligations of Holdings and its\nsubsidiaries and restrictions on distributions that would violate any applicable restrictions contained any debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of\nrendering Holdings insolvent. To the extent Stryve is unable to make payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will\naccrue interest until paid. Additionally, nonpayment for a specified period and/or under certain circumstances may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the\nTax Receivables Agreement and therefore accelerate payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement, which could be substantial.\nStryve anticipates that the distributions received from Holdings may, in certain periods, exceed its actual tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax\nReceivables Agreement. The Board, in its sole discretion, will make any determination from time to time with respect to the use of any such excess cash so accumulated, which\nmay include, among other uses, to pay dividends on the Company's Class A common stock. Stryve will have no obligation to distribute such cash (or other available cash other\nthan any declared dividend) to its shareholders.\nThe Tax Receivables Agreement (\"TRA\") requires Stryve to make cash payments to the TRA Holders in respect of certain tax benefits and such payments may be\nsubstantial. In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement may (i) exceed any actual tax benefits the Tax Group realizes or (ii) be accelerated.\nAt the Closing of the Business Combination, Stryve, Holdings and Seller entered into the Tax Receivables Agreement. Pursuant to the Tax Receivables Agreement, Stryve will\ngenerally be required to pay the TRA Holders 85% of the amount of savings, if any, in United States federal, state, local, and foreign taxes that are based on, or measured with\nrespect to, net income or profits, and any interest related thereto that the Tax Group realize, or are deemed to realize, as a result of certain Tax Attributes, which include:\n•tax basis adjustments resulting from taxable exchanges of Holdings Class B common units and Class V common stock (including any such adjustments resulting\nfrom certain payments made by Stryve under the Tax Receivables Agreement) acquired by Stryve from a TRA Holder pursuant to the terms of the Amended Holdings\nOperating Agreement; and\n•tax deductions in respect of portions of certain payments made under the Tax Receivables Agreement (each of the foregoing, collectively, the “Tax Attributes”).\nPayments under the Tax Receivables Agreement generally will be based on the tax reporting positions that Stryve determines (with the amount of subject payments determined\nin consultation with an advisory firm and subject to the review and consent of a representative of Stryve Foods Holdings, LLC), and the IRS or another taxing authority may\nchallenge all or any part of a position taken with respect to Tax Attributes or the utilization thereof, as well as other tax positions that Stryve may take, and a court may sustain\nsuch a challenge. In the event that any Tax Attributes initially claimed or utilized by the Tax Group are disallowed, the TRA Holders will not be required to reimburse Stryve for\nany excess payments that may previously have been made pursuant to the Tax Receivables Agreement, for example, due to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing\nauthorities. Rather, any excess payments made to such TRA Holders will be applied against and reduce any future cash payments otherwise required to be made by us to the\napplicable TRA Holders under the Tax Receivables Agreement, after the determination of such excess. However, a challenge to any Tax Attributes initially claimed or utilized\nby the Tax Group may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment and, even if challenged earlier, such excess cash payment may be greater than\nthe amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the Tax Receivables Agreement. As a result, there might not be future cash\npayments against which such excess can be applied, and Stryve could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement in excess of the Tax Group’s actual\nsavings in respect of the Tax Attributes.\nMoreover, the Tax Receivables Agreement will provide that, in certain early termination events, Stryve will be required to make a lump-sum cash payment to all the TRA\nHolders equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the Tax Receivables Agreement, which lump-sum payment\nwould be based on certain assumptions, including those relating to there being sufficient future taxable income of the\n27\nTax Group to fully utilize the Tax Attributes over certain specified time periods and that all Class B common units of Holdings and Class V common stock that had not yet been\nexchanged for Class A common stock are deemed exchanged for cash. The lump-sum payment could be material and could materially exceed any actual tax benefits that the\nTax Group realizes subsequent to such payment.\nPayments under the Tax Receivables Agreement will be Stryve's obligations and not obligations of Holdings. Any actual increase in Stryve's allocatable share of Holdings and\nits relevant subsidiaries’ tax basis in relevant assets, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement, will vary depending upon a\nnumber of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the market price of the Class A common stock at the time of an exchange of Seller Consideration Units by a TRA Holder\npursuant to the terms of the Amended Holdings Operating Agreement and the amount and timing of the recognition of the Tax Group’s income for applicable tax purposes.\nWhile many of the factors that will determine the amount of payments that Stryve will be required to make under the Tax Receivables Agreement are outside of Stryve's control,\nStryve expects that the aggregate payments it will be required to make under the Tax Receivables Agreement could be substantial and, if those payments substantially exceed\nthe tax benefit Stryve realizes in a given year or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on its financial condition, which may be material.\nAny payments made by Stryve under the Tax Receivables Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to the\nCompany. To the extent that Stryve is unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivables Agreement for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will\naccrue interest until paid. Additionally, nonpayment for a specified period and/or under certain circumstances may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the\nTax Receivables Agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the Tax Receivables Agreement. Furthermore, Stryve's future obligation to make payments under the\nTax Receivables Agreement could make Stryve a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the Tax Attributes\nthat may be deemed realized under the Tax Receivables Agreement.\nRegulatory Risks\nThe loss of Stryve’s USDA grant of inspection from its facility would materially adversely impact its business, financial condition and results of operations.t\nStryve has been granted a full grant of inspection with respect to its manufacturing facility in Oklahoma which allows Stryve to manufacture and produce its products. Stryve’s\noperations at its Oklahoma facility require inspections conducted under the supervision of a USDA inspector and requires Stryve to meet certain regulatory requirements\nincluding but not limited to having a written Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) plan, sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and other regulatory\nrequirements. If Stryve were to lose such grant of inspection, Stryve would be unable to operate its manufacturing facility in Oklahoma and the production of Stryve’s products\nwould cease immediately due to the prohibition of production under the Federal Meat Inspection Act of processing and distributing meat without federal inspection. Given the\ndifficulty in procuring USDA inspection approval of biltong production, it is unlikely that Stryve could procure alternative production of its biltong products in a timely fashion.\nAs a result, the loss of its grant of inspection would have an adverse effect on Stryve’s sales and ability to achieve profitability, which could materially and adversely affect its\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nStryve is subject to extensive government regulations and a failure to comply with such regulations could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nStryve’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade\nCommission (FTC) and by other federal, state, and local authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, transportation, distribution, and labeling of products that are\nmanufactured, produced and processed by it. Specifically, Stryve is subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated\nthereunder by the FDA and the Federal Meat Inspection Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the USDA. This comprehensive regulatory program governs, among\nother things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, labeling and safety of food and food ingredients. Under this regulatory program, the FDA requires that\nfacilities that manufacture food products comply with a range of requirements, including hazard analysis and preventative controls regulations, current good manufacturing\n28\npractices, or GMPs, and supplier verification requirements. Stryve’s processing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities and if Stryve\ncannot manufacture products that conform to the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, USDA or others, it may be subject to adverse inspection findings or enforcement\nactions, which could materially impact its ability to market its products or could result in a recall of a product that has already been distributed. The USDA has also issued strict\nregulations concerning the control of listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meat and poultry products and contamination by food borne pathogens such as E. coli and\nsalmonella and implemented a system of regulation known as the HACCP program. The HACCP program requires all meat processing plants to develop and implement sanitary\noperating procedures and other program requirements. OSHA oversees safety compliance and establishes certain employer responsibilities to help “assure safe and healthful\nworking conditions” and keep the workplace free of recognized hazards or practices likely to cause death or serious injury.\nIf a regulatory authority determines that Stryve has not complied with the applicable regulatory requirements, it could be subject to fines or lose its ability to process meat,\nwhich materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Stryve chooses to expand internationally, it will be subject to international regulations that could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nStryve will be subject to extensive regulations internationally where it manufactures, distributes and/or sells its products. Currently, Stryve offers it products to sale to domestic\nexport partners for distribution into Canada and Mexico and may expand to additional countries. Stryve’s products are subject to numerous food safety and other laws and\nregulations relating to the sourcing, manufacturing, storing, labeling, marketing, advertising and distribution of these products. If Stryve or its partners fail to comply with\napplicable laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, it could be subject to civil remedies or penalties, such as fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions\non the marketing or manufacturing of the products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions. In addition, enforcement of\nexisting laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and\ncreate other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment could limit Stryve’s business activities, increase its operating costs, reduce demand for its products or result in litigation.\nElements of Stryve’s business, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, health and safety practices, transportation and use\nof many of Stryve’s products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, and the laws and\nregulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which Stryve’s products or components thereof, such as packaging, may be\nmade, manufactured or sold. These laws, regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, because of a variety of factors, including political,\neconomic or social events. Such factors may include changes in:\n•food and drug laws (including FDA and USDA regulations) including those relating to manufacturing of ready to eat meat products;\n•laws related to product labeling;\n•advertising and marketing laws and practices;\n•laws and programs restricting the sale and advertising of certain products;\n•laws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients present in certain products;\n•laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption of products or ingredients or altering the package or portion size of certain products;\n•state consumer protection and disclosure laws;\n29\n•taxation requirements, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other limitations on the sale of certain products;\n•competition laws;\n•anti-corruption laws, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (the “Bribery\nAct”);\n•economic sanctions and anti-boycott laws, including laws administered by the United States Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”)\nand the European Union (“EU”) and the sanctions imposed on Russia due to its recent invasion of Ukraine;\n•laws relating to export, re-export, transfer, tariffs and import controls, including the Export Administration Regulations, the EU Dual Use Regulation and the customs\nand import laws administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection;\n•employment laws;\n•privacy laws; and\n•farming and environmental laws.\nNew laws, regulations or governmental policies and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes, tariffs or other limitations on the sale of\nStryve’s products, ingredients in its products or commodities used in the production of its products, may alter the environment in which it does business and, therefore, may\naffect its operating results or increase its costs or liabilities.\nLegal claims, government investigations or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject Stryve to civil and criminal penalties.\nStryve operates in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. Consequently, Stryve is subject to heightened risk of legal claims,\ngovernment investigations or other regulatory enforcement actions. Although Stryve has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws\nand regulations, there can be no assurance that its employees, temporary workers, contractors or agents will not violate its policies and procedures. Moreover, a failure to\nmaintain effective control processes could lead to violations, unintentional or otherwise, of laws and regulations. Legal claims, government investigations or regulatory\nenforcement actions arising out of Stryve’s failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could\nmaterially and adversely affect Stryve’s product sales, reputation, financial condition and operating results; including a cessation of operations at Stryve’s manufacturing\nfacility. In addition, the costs and other effects of defending potential and pending litigation and administrative actions may be difficult to determine and could materially and\nadversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFood safety and food-borne illness incidents or advertising or product mislabeling may materially adversely affect Stryve’s business by exposing it to lawsuits, product\nrecalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing its operating costs and reducing demand for its product offerings.\nSelling food for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, and there is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety.\nUnexpected side effects, illness, injury or death related to allergens, food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents caused by products Stryve sells, or involving its\nsuppliers, could result in the discontinuance of sales of these products or its relationships with such suppliers, or otherwise result in increased operating costs, regulatory\nenforcement actions or harm to its reputation. Shipment of adulterated or misbranded products, even if inadvertent, can result in criminal or civil liability. Such incidents could\nalso expose Stryve to product liability, negligence or other lawsuits, including consumer class action lawsuits. Any claims brought against Stryve may exceed or be outside the\nscope of its insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against Stryve that is more than its policy limits or not covered by its policies or not subject to insurance would\nhave to be paid from cash reserves, which would reduce is capital resources.\n30\nThe occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs,\ndisruptions in supply and a reduction in sales. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination or regulatory noncompliance, whether or not caused by Stryve’s actions, could\ncompel Stryve, its suppliers, distributors or customers, depending on the circumstances, to conduct a recall in accordance with FDA and/or USDA regulations, and comparable\nstate laws. Food recalls could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of product inventory, lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of\ntime and potential loss of existing distributors or customers and a potential negative impact on the ability to attract new customers due to negative consumer experiences or\nbecause of an adverse impact on Stryve’s brand and reputation. The costs of a recall could exceed or be outside the scope of Stryve’s insurance policy coverage or limits.\nIn addition, food companies have been subject to targeted, large-scale tampering as well as to opportunistic, individual product tampering, and Stryve, like any food company,\ncould be a target for product tampering. Forms of tampering could include the introduction of foreign material, chemical contaminants and pathological organisms into\nconsumer products as well as product substitution. Recently issued FDA regulations will require companies like Stryve to analyze, prepare and implement mitigation strategies\nspecifically to address tampering designed to inflict widespread public health harm. If Stryve does not adequately address the possibility, or any actual instance, of product\ntampering, it could face possible seizure or recall of its products and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, which could materially and adversely affect its business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nStryve may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to its business.\nStryve’s ability to compete effectively depends in part upon protection of its rights in trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and other intellectual property and other proprietary\nrights. Stryve’s use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect its intellectual\nproperty and other proprietary rights may be inadequate. Stryve may not be able to preclude third parties from using its intellectual property rights with respect to its products,\nits processes with respect to the air-drying of its meat products in a manner satisfactory to the USDA and other regulators, and may not be able to leverage its branding beyond\nits current product offerings. In addition, Stryve’s trademark or other intellectual property applications may not always be granted. Third parties may oppose Stryve’s\nintellectual property applications, or otherwise challenge its use of its trademarks or other intellectual property. Third parties may infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate\nStryve’s intellectual property, and changes in applicable laws could serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections available for its intellectual property. Any legal\naction that Stryve may bring to protect its brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful and expensive and could divert management’s attention from other\nbusiness concerns. Any litigation or claims brought against Stryve, for trademark infringement or related matters, even without merit, could result in substantial costs and\ndiversion of its resources. A successful claim of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or other violation against Stryve could\nprevent it from providing its products or services, or could require it, if it is unable to license such third-party intellectual property on reasonable terms, to redesign or rebrand its\nproducts or product packaging. Any of the foregoing results could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Securities Generally\nThe price for our securities has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.\nFluctuations in the price of Stryve’s securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment. The trading price of Stryve’s securities has been volatile and subject\nto wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond its control. Any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your\ninvestment in Stryve’s securities and its securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them. In such circumstances, the trading price of Stryve’s\nsecurities may not recover and may experience a further decline.\nFactors affecting the trading price of our securities may include:\n31\n•actual or anticipated fluctuations in quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar\n•changes in the market’s expectations about our operating results;\n•success of competitors;\n•operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n•changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the industries in which we operate in general;\n•operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n•our ability to market new and enhanced products on a timely basis, including the continued appeal and reputations of celebrity endorsers;\n•changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n•commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us;\n•changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n•the volume of shares of Class A common stock available for public sale;\n•any major change in our Board or management;\n•sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock by us or our directors, executive officers or significant shareholders or the perception that such sales could\noccur; and\n•general economic and political conditions such as recessions, pandemics, interest rates, fuel prices, international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism.\nBroad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and Nasdaq,\nhave experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The\ntrading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for the stock of other companies that\ninvestors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions, or results of operations. A decline in the market\nprice of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and can lead to stockholder\nlitigation.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading\nrestrictions.\nOur securities are currently listed on the Nasdaq. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences,\nincluding:\n•a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n•reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n•a determination that shares of our Class A common stock are “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly\nresulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares;\n•a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n•a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\n32\nThe Company previously received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) notifying the Company that the closing bid price for the\nCompany’s Class A common stock has been below the minimum $1.00 per share required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5550(a)(2) (“Rule 5550(a)(2)”). While the Company completed a reverse stock split to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule, there can be no assurance the our stock price\ndoes not trade below the $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing in the future..\nIf our securities are delisted from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) or the failure to satisfy another applicable Nasdaq rule, such delisting would have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the trading price and ability to transfer our securities.\nIf Stryve does not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, it could fail to report its financial results accurately.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for Stryve to provide reliable financial reports. Stryve may discover areas of its internal control over financial\nreporting that need improvement. Stryve has not historically documented its internal controls, and if in the future Stryve identifies a control deficiency that rises to the level of a\nmaterial weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting, this material weakness may adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report financial\ninformation timely and accurately and, as a result, its financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a\ncombination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial\nstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If Stryve fails to properly and efficiently maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting, it could\nfail to report its financial results accurately.\nDelaware law and the Charter contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or\ndiscourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nThe Charter and the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\") contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an\nacquisition deemed undesirable by the Company Board, and therefore depress the trading price of the Company’s Class A common stock. These provisions could also make it\ndifficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by the current members of the Company Board or taking other corporate\nactions, including effecting changes in management. Among other things, the Charter and the Bylaws include provisions regarding:\n•a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of the Company\nBoard;\n•the ability of the Company Board to issue shares of preferred stock, including “blank check” preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those\nshares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n•the limitation of the liability of, and the indemnification of, the Company’s directors and officers;\n•the right of the Company Board to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Company Board or the resignation, death or removal of a director,\nwhich prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on the Company Board;\n•the requirement that directors may only be removed from the Company Board for cause;\n•the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the Company Board, the chairman of the Company Board or the Company’s chief\nexecutive officer, which could delay the ability of stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n33\n•controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of the Company Board and stockholder meetings;\n•the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of 66 2/3% of the voting power of the outstanding voting capital stock of the Company, voting together as a single\nclass to amend, alter, change or repeal certain provisions in the Charter and the Bylaws, respectively, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before\nannual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in the Company Board and also may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to\nfacilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n•the ability of the Company Board to amend the Bylaws, which may allow the Company Board to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit\nthe ability of an acquirer to amend the Bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n•advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to the Company Board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a\nstockholders’ meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in the Company\nBoard and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise\nattempting to obtain control of the Company;\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in the Company Board or management.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, the Company is generally subject to provisions of Delaware law, including the DGCL. Although the Company elected not to be\ngoverned by Section 203 of the DGCL, certain provisions of the Charter do, in a manner substantially similar to Section 203 of the DGCL, prohibit certain Company\nstockholders (other than those stockholders who are party to a stockholders’ agreement with the Company) who hold 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding capital stock\nfrom engaging in certain business combination transactions with the Company for a specified period of time unless certain conditions are met.\nAny provision of the Charter, the Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive\na premium for their shares of the Company’s capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for the Company’s common stock.\nProvisions in the Charter and Delaware law may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against the directors and officers of the Company.\nThe Charter requires that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of\nthe State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim of\nbreach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company’s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim\nagainst the Company, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Charter or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against\nthe Company, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over\nthe indispensable parties named as defendants therein. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims under the Exchange Act, but will apply to other state and federal\nlaw claims including actions arising under the Securities Act. Section 22 of the Securities Act, however, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits\nbrought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would\nenforce such a forum selection provision as written in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act.\nAlthough we believe this provision will benefit the Company by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies,\nthe provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against the Company’s directors and officers.\n34\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose Stryve to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on its reputation or business.\nThe per share price of the Class A common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject\nto securities litigation, including class action litigation. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, from time to time, Stryve may be party to other various claims\nand litigation proceedings. Stryve evaluates these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of\npotential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, it may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to\nmanagement at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from its assessments and estimates.\nLawsuits may divert Stryve’s management’s attention, and Stryve may incur significant expenses in defending any lawsuits. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings\nare inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in any legal dispute may result in monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief, which could have a material\nadverse effect on Stryve’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage Stryve’s reputation\nand make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance. Furthermore, while Stryve maintains insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance\ndoes not cover all types of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions, as well as limits on amounts recoverable.\nOur management’s ability to require holders of our redeemable Warrants to exercise such redeemable Warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer\nshares of Class A commons stock upon their exercise of the redeemable Warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their redeemable Warrants\nfor cash.\nIf we call Warrants for redemption after the redemption criteria described elsewhere herein have been satisfied, our management will have the option to require any holder that\nwishes to exercise his Warrants (including any Warrants held by our initial shareholders or their permitted transferees) to do so on a “cashless basis.” If our management\nchooses to require holders to exercise their Warrants on a cashless basis, the number of shares of Class A common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it\nwould have been had such holder exercised his Warrants for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential “upside” of the holder’s investment in the Company.\nThe terms of the Warrants may be amended in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding\nWarrants.\nThe Warrants were issued in registered form pursuant to a warrant agreement (the “Warrant Agreement”) between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Warrant\nAgent, and us. The Warrant Agreement provides that the terms of the Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any\ndefective provision. The Warrant Agreement requires the approval by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Warrants (including the Private Warrants) in order to\nmake any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, the terms of the Warrants may be amended in a manner adverse to a holder if holders\nof at least a majority of the then outstanding Warrants approve of such amendment. We may amend the terms of the Warrants with the consent of at least a majority of the then\noutstanding Warrants to effect any change thereto, including to increase the exercise price of the Warrants, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares\npurchasable upon exercise of a Warrant.\nThe Warrants may not be in the money at the time they become exercisable, and they may expire worthless.\nThe outstanding warrants as of December 31, 2023 are out of the money. There can be no assurance that the Warrants will be in the money following the time they become\nexercisable and prior to their expiration, and as such, the Warrants may expire worthless.\nOur Private Warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of our Warrants could have a material effect on our future financial results.\n35\nThe Company classifies the Private Warrants as liabilities at their fair value and adjusts the Warrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-\nmeasurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company’s statement of operations. As a result of the recurring fair\nvalue measurement, our financial statements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly and such fluctuations are outside of our control. We expect that we will recognize\nnon-cash gains or losses on our Private Warrants each reporting period and those amounts could be material.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act and have taken advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to\nemerging growth companies; this could make the Company’s securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare the Company’s performance\nwith other public companies.\nWe are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (\"JOBS Act\"), and have taken\nadvantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are not applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but\nnot limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding\nexecutive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on certain executive\ncompensation matters. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We may remain an emerging growth company until\nthe earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which our total annual gross revenue of at\nleast $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock that are\nheld by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30 and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three\nyear period, meaning that the occurrence of one or more of the aforementioned events or circumstances could cause our loss of that status prior to the fifth anniversary of the\ndate of our IPO. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the securities less\nattractive as a result of reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market\nfor our securities and the trading prices of the securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until\nprivate companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange\nAct) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the\nextended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not\nto opt out of such extended transition period. Accordingly, when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an\nemerging growth company, will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard, unless early adoption is permitted by the\nstandard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company\nwhich has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock\nafter price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our\ncommon stock.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\n36\nThe Board recognizes the critical importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees. The Board is actively\ninvolved in oversight of the Company’s risk management program, and cybersecurity represents an important component of the Company’s overall approach to enterprise risk\nmanagement (“ERM”). The Company’s cybersecurity policies, standards, processes, and practices are fully integrated into the Company’s ERM program and are based on\nrecognized frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the International Organization for Standardization and other applicable industry\nstandards. In general, the Company seeks to address cybersecurity risks through a comprehensive, cross-functional approach that is focused on preserving the confidentiality,\nsecurity and availability of the information that the Company collects and stores by identifying, preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and effectively responding to\ncybersecurity incidents when they occur.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nAs one of the critical elements of the Company’s overall ERM approach, the Company’s cybersecurity program is focused on the following key areas:\n•risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise information\ntechnology environment;\n•technical safeguards that are designed to protect the Company’s information systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection\nsystems, anti-malware functionality and access controls;\n•the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security procedures;\n•training and awareness programs for employees that include periodic and ongoing assessments to drive adoption and awareness of cybersecurity processes and\nprocedures;\n•a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and\n•a third-party risk management process for service providers, suppliers, and vendors.\nNo risks from previous cybersecurity threats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect Stryve’s business, financial condition, results of operations\nand relationships with customers. We describe whether and how risks related to cybersecurity threats are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and relationships with customers, in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernance\nOur Board is engaged in the oversight of cybersecurity threat risk management. As reflected in the Audit Committee’s charter, the Board has specifically delegated\nresponsibility for oversight of cybersecurity matters to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee regularly receives updates on cybersecurity risks and the security and\noperations of our information technology systems from our Chief Financial Officer. The Board and the Audit Committee also receive prompt and timely information regarding\nany cybersecurity incident that meets established reporting thresholds, as well as ongoing updates regarding any such incident until it has been addressed.\nManagement is responsible for developing cybersecurity programs. These individuals' expertise in IT and cybersecurity generally has been gained from a combination of\neducation, including relevant degrees, and prior work experience. They are informed by their respective cybersecurity teams about, and monitor, the prevention, detection,\nmitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents as part of the cybersecurity programs described above.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nStryve leases its manufacturing facility in Madill, Oklahoma that it opened in 2019. The 52,000 square foot facility sits on approximately 18 acres of land, allowing for possible,\nfuture expansion. Stryve’s corporate headquarters are located in Plano, Texas and recently changed its mailing address to a post office box while it navigates a potential\n37\noffice relocation for its corporate staff. Stryve leases the property for its former corporate office, which occupies approximately 6,600 square feet. In addition, Stryve leases a\ndistribution facility in Carrollton, Texas, which occupies approximately 8,400 square feet. In 2022, Stryve leased a distribution facility in Frisco, Texas. The Company relocated\ndistribution from the Madill and Carrollton facilities to this 70,928 square facility. During 2023, the Company entered into agreements to sublease the Carrollton, Texas\ndistribution facility and the former corporate office in Plano, Texas.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. We are not currently a party to any\nmaterial legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources\nand other factors and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained.\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\n38\nPART II\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur Class A common stock and Warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “SNAX” and SNAXW,” respectively.\nStockholders\nOn March 25, 2024, there were 2,784,151, shares of our Class A common stock outstanding, held of record by 53 holders, and 10,997,500 Warrants to purchase 733,166 shares\nof Class A common stock for $172.50 per share outstanding, held of record by 10 holders. The number of record holders does not include The Depository Trust Company\nparticipants or beneficial owners holding shares through nominee names. We also have outstanding 10,294,118 warrants to purchase 686,274 shares of Class A common stock\nat an exercise price of $54.00 per share. In addition, we have 382,892 outstanding shares of Class V common stock, held of record by 75 holders that are convertible into shares\nof Class A common stock on a one for one basis as of March 25, 2024.\nDividends\nWe have never paid any cash dividends. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general\nfinancial condition from time to time. The payment of any cash dividends will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors, and our Board of Directors will consider\nwhether or not to institute a dividend policy. It is presently expected that we will retain all earnings for use in our business operations and, accordingly, it is not expected that our\nBoard of Directors will declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\n39\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of Stryve’s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Stryve’s consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking\nstatements that reflect Stryve’s plans, estimates and beliefs. Stryve’s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that\ncould cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere particularly in the sections titled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements” elsewhere in this report.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to “Stryve,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” herein refer to Stryve Foods, Inc.\nWe effected a 1-for-15 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A and Class V common stock, par value $0.0001\nper share, effective as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on July 14, 2023. All share and per share amounts were retroactively adjusted for all periods presented to give effect to this\nreverse stock split, including reclassifying an amount equal to the reduction in par value of the Company’s common stock to additional paid-in capital. See Note 1 to our\nconsolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this\nreport. Due to rounding, certain totals and subtotals may not foot and certain percentages may not reconcile.\nOverview\nStryve is an emerging healthy snacking company which manufactures, markets and sells highly differentiated healthy snacking products that Stryve believes can disrupt\ntraditional snacking categories. Stryve’s mission is “to help Americans snack better and live happier, better lives.” Stryve offers convenient snacks that are lower in sugar and\ncarbohydrates and higher in protein than other snacks. Stryve offers all-natural, delicious snacks which it believes are nutritious and offer consumers a convenient healthy\nsnacking option for their on-the-go lives.\nStryve’s current product portfolio consists primarily of air-dried meat snack products marketed under the Stryve®, Kalahari®, Braaitime®, and Vacadillos® brand names.\nUnlike beef jerky, Stryve’s all-natural air-dried meat snack products are made of beef and spices, are never cooked, most contain zero grams of sugar, and are free of\nmonosodium glutamate (MSG), gluten, nitrates, nitrites, and preservatives. As a result, Stryve’s products are Keto and Paleo diet friendly. Further, based on protein density and\nsugar content, Stryve believes that its air-dried meat snack products are some of the healthiest shelf-stable snacks available today.\nStryve distributes its products in major retail channels, primarily in North America, including mass, convenience, grocery, club stores, and other retail outlets, as well as directly\nto consumers through its e-commerce websites, as well as direct to consumer through the Amazon platform.\nStryve believes increased consumer focus in the U.S. on health and wellness will continue to drive growth of the healthy snacking category and increase demand for Stryve’s\nproducts. Stryve has made substantial investments since its inception in product development, establishing its manufacturing facility, and building its marketing, sales and\noperations infrastructure to grow its business. As a result, Stryve has reported net losses since its inception. Stryve intends to continue to invest in productivity, product\ninnovation, improving its supply chain, enhancing and expanding its manufacturing capabilities, and expanding its marketing and sales initiatives to drive continued growth.\nTransformation Strategy\nIn May of 2022, Stryve announced a leadership change with Chris Boever stepping in as the new Chief Executive Officer of the Company. With this change in leadership,\nmanagement thoughtfully reviewed the business, strategy, near-term prospects, and its path to profitability. From this, management began executing on a three-phase\ntransformation plan to drive the Company towards a profitable, self-sustaining model. The first phase of the transition began in immediately and is focused on cost reduction,\nrevenue rationalization, pricing, and organizational design.\n40\nThe second phase began later in 2022 and is focused on improvements in quality, talent, and maximizing value through productivity. Management believes the benefits of the\nefforts within each of these phases will be compounding as the changes and improvements are been built into the Company's ongoing operating model.\nAs part of the transformation, Management has identified certain one-time write-downs for assets that were non-core to the go-forward plan as well as identified necessary\nwrite-downs of inventory and incurring one-time employee costs related to actions taken to reorganize the business and its objectives in line with the strategic direction that Mr.\nBoever has for the enterprise. These charges began in the second quarter of 2022, and continued to a lesser extent throughout 2023, including in the fourth quarter of 2023, with\nManagement identifying additional items related to the transformation.\nIn 2024, the final phase of the transformation is now underway. It is focused on accelerating quality growth through brand reinvigoration, enhanced sales strategies, disciplined\npromotional activity, and new partnerships to help expand the reach of our brands. We expect to continue to garner new retail distribution in both measured and non-measured\nchannels supported, sustain and build upon the increases we've seen in our retail consumption metrics, ultimately increasing our market share within the category while seeking\nto maintain an optimized spending profile across the business.\nNew Packaging & Retail Distribution Growth\nA key piece of our retail growth strategy is tied to making the product more available and approachable. To accomplish this we completed a strategic redesign of our packaging\nwith retail conversion at the forefront of design considerations. We collaborated with both consumers and retailers as we sought to optimize the packaging for retail conversion.\nWe received a positive response from many retail partners on the new designs, garnering additional distribution in the process. We began manufacturing select items in the new\npackaging during the second quarter of 2023 and towards the end of the second quarter, our new packaging began to ship to select retailers and distributors. We have begun to\nsee year-over-year gains in our retail distribution footprint, and price-mix ultimately leading to increased retail sales and market share within measured distribution channels.\nWe are encouraged by the initial consumer and retailer response to our updated packaging and are excited to share that as the new packaging has made its way through\ndistribution and onto shelves for consumers that the impact on our retail consumption data has been significant. The Stryve brand's retail dollar velocity, which represents the\namount of sales retailers generate per store per week of the brand across all of our distribution footprint in measured channels, has increased 39.3% year-over-year since the\nintroduction of the new-look packaging. While the Stryve brand received the most significant redesign, we enhanced our other brands as well. In the aggregate, all of our retail\nbrands showed a similar improvement with retail dollar velocity up 23.7% on a combined basis across all measured channels in the same period. The retail data mentioned\nabove is sourced from SPINS and represents the 4-weeks prior to February 25, 2024. We see similar but accelerating trends in the 12-week and 24-week data, which we believe\nreflects the gradual roll out of the new packaging through distribution over the time period.\nImproving Quality of Revenue\nAs an extension of the restructuring plans, we evaluated our revenue base in the second half of 2022 and have taken steps to improve or eliminate low-quality revenue sources in\norder to drive long-term value-creating growth. Key considerations in these rationalization decisions included assessments of strategic alignment, complexity, and profitability.\nAnd with respect to assessing the profitability of a particular revenue stream specifically, we evaluated our revenues on a gross margin basis, a net margin basis, and a cash\nconversion basis. Accordingly, we acknowledge that meaningful portion of net sales in the prior year and in the early part of 2023 came from products, customers, and/or\nchannels that have been rationalized. Further, this strategic rationalization, in some cases, required us to sell inventory through discount or liquidation channels during 2023\nwhich affected our gross margin. Despite the negative impact on to net sales that this rationalization has had, our most valuable revenues are supported by improved trends in\nthe retail consumption of our products.\nAdditionally, we took actions to improve the quality of our revenue in 2023 through improving our price-mix by working strategically with of some of our large retail partners\nto introduce new products that improved our unit economics while creating a more attractive consumer offering. As with any packaging transition, however, there can be\nirregular revenue flows as distributors, wholesalers and retailers sell through the legacy items in stock in\n41\nanticipation of launching the new offering. This dynamic did negatively affect our Q4 2023 volumes as one of our largest retail relationships executed a planned phase-out of\nour prior offering in anticipation of a January 2024 launch of our new offering. Since that launch in January 2024, not only have we improved our unit-economics with our\ncustomer due to the transition, but we have also experienced significantly improved retail velocity on the new SKUs.\nOptimizing Spend and Reducing Losses\nOur 2023 results are a product of the progress we have made on our cost mitigation strategies. We examined every area of spending throughout our business and identified ways\nto drive efficiencies, eliminate unnecessary expense, and focus on the highest and best use of each dollar. The resulting impact is a 43.3% year-over-year reduction in total\noperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in a 53.1% year-over-year improvement in our Adjusted EBITDA Loss for the same period despite lower\nsales when comparing to the prior year period.\nTaking a step back, and comparing our EBITDA Loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 with the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, which roughly coincides\nwith the leadership transition and marks the beginning of our transformation initiatives, we have seen a $27.9 million improvement in our EBITDA Loss.\nWe believe that our optimized spending plan has benefited from portfolio-wide price increases taken in 2022 and productivity initiatives throughout our supply chain. While we\nintend to continue to invest to drive meaningful growth in net sales, we are doing so in a disciplined manner that acknowledges the fundamental changes in direct-to-consumer\nadvertising markets and shopper behavior. By monitoring our unit economics closely, maintaining an optimized spending profile, and seeking to meaningfully grow net sales,\nwe believe we will be able to drive further reductions in our net losses moving forward.\nWe believe that we have entered the final phase of our planned transformation. The first two phases focused on reducing expenses while improving the quality of our revenues\nthrough rationalization and price actions to recover our unit economics. The last phase is about accelerating quality growth and reaping the benefits of operating leverage\nthrough a redesigned cost structure.\nAt-The-Market Equity Facility\nIn June 2023, the Company entered into an at-the-market equity offering sales agreement with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, that established a program pursuant to which\nwe may offer and sell up to $5.7 million of our Class A common stock from time to time in at-the-market transactions. As of December 31, 2023, $4.0 million remains\navailable under the facility and the following shares were sold during the fourth quarter of 2023:\nThree Months\nEnded December 31,\n2023\n(In thousands, except share and per share information)\nNumber of common shares sold 206,816\nWeighted average sale price per share $ 2.99\nGross proceeds $ 619\nNet proceeds $ 600\nDuring March 2024, the Company provided notice to Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC that it was terminating the at-the-market equity offering sales agreement.\nApril 2023 Financing Transaction\nOn April 19, 2023, we issued an aggregate of $4.1 million in principal amount of secured promissory notes (the “Notes”) to select accredited investors (including certain\nmembers of the Company’s management and Board of Directors) (the “Lenders”). The Notes carry an interest rate of 12% and have a maturity December 31, 2023. Each\nLender that purchased Notes received a warrant (the “Warrants”) to purchase 1/15th of one share of the Company’s Class A common stock for each $0.5134 of principal\namount of the Notes, for an aggregate of 7,964,550 Warrants\n42\nconvertible to 530,970 shares of Class A common stock. Each Warrant is exercisable immediately, has an exercise price per share of Class A common stock equal to $7.701 per\nwhole share and will expire three years and three months from the date of issuance and may be exercised on a cashless basis if a registration statement registering the resale of\nthe shares issuable upon exercise is not effective. The Company accounted for the transaction by allocating the proceeds between the Notes and Warrants based on their relative\nfair values as of the closing date of the facility. The allocation resulted in the fair value of the warrants to be treated as a discount to the Notes of $1.4 million that is being\namortized over the term of the Notes. Accordingly, the Company recognized non-cash interest expense of $1.4 million in connection with the discount for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nIn January 2024, the Notes were amended to extend the maturity date of the Notes from December 31, 2023 to the earlier of (i) December 31, 2024, or (ii) the closing of the\nnext sale or series of related sales by the Company of its equity securities from which the Company receives gross proceeds of not less than $3.0 million, excluding proceeds\nfrom the warrants held by the Lenders and the Company’s existing at the market equity facility with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC. As consideration, the Company (i)\nreduced the exercise price on the outstanding warrants issued to the lenders in April 2023 from $7.701 per split-adjusted share to $2.75 per split-adjusted share and (ii) agreed to\nissue 53,559 shares of Class A common stock to certain electing lenders as payment in full for interest accrued on the Notes held by those electing lenders through December\n31, 2023 (at a value of $2.75 per share). The value of the accrued interest satisfied by the payment of 53,559 shares of Class A common stock to the electing lenders was\n$147,288.\nSupply Chain Challenges & Increased Cost Environment\nThroughout 2022, we experienced certain supply chain challenges that negatively affected our ability to supply the demands to all of our channels of trade and negatively\nimpacted our gross margins. While we have made efforts to mitigate these challenges, these factors have continued to have an impact on our financial results during 2023 and\nmay continue to have an impact into 2024.\nWe expect many of these inflationary pressures to persist in the near future, including the price of beef, which may negatively impact our gross margins if we are unsuccessful\nin mitigating these through our procurement strategies, ability to influence sales mix, and pricing initiatives. We continue to track new developments affecting these inflationary\npressures as we execute on our strategies to lessen the impact of these challenges and cost increases including but not limited to, price increases, strategic sourcing, improving\nour manufacturing yields, investing in further automation, and rationalizing spend throughout the organization.\nInvestments to Grow Asset Base\nSince the consummation of the Business Combination in July 2021, we have augmented our capacities so that we can more efficiently flex our run-rate production levels, if\nneeded, to satisfy outsized new distribution lay-in orders and/or national programs without materially straining our ordinary course day-to-day production.\n43\nResults of Operations –Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2022\nThe following table sets forth selected items in our consolidated financial data in dollar amounts and as a percentage of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2023\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2022.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands) % of sales % of sales\nSALES, net $ 17,710 100.0% $ 29,946 100.0%\nCOST OF GOODS SOLD (exclusive of depreciation shown separately\nbelow) $ 15,277 86.3% 30,657 102.4%\nGROSS PROFIT (LOSS) 2,433 13.7% (711) (2.4)%\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nSelling expenses 7,452 42.1% 14,674 49.0%\nOperations expense\n1,772 10.0% 4,392 14.7%\nSalaries and wages 6,423 36.3% 10,505 35.1%\nDepreciation and amortization expense 2,221 12.5% 1,961 6.5%\nGain on disposal of fixed assets (10) (0.1)% (75) (0.2)%\nTotal operating expenses 17,858 100.8% 31,457 105.0%\nOPERATING LOSS (15,425) (87.1)% (32,168) (107.4)%\nOTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME\nInterest expense (3,632) (20.5)% (896) (3.0)%\nChange in fair value of Private Warrants 21 0.1% 108 0.4%\nOther expense (4) (0.0)% (259) (0.9)%\nTotal other (expense) income (3,615) (20.4)% (1,047) (3.5)%\nNET LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES (107.5 (110.9\n$ (19,040) )% $ (33,215) )%\nSales, net. Net sales decreased by $12.2 million from $29.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 to $17.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023\nrepresenting a reduction of 40.7% for the comparable periods. The primary driver of net sales in 2022 was a chain-wide limited-time savings event with one of the nation's\nlargest retailers in the second quarter of 2022. We did not seek to repeat this program during the year ended December 31, 2023, as part of our rationalization and\ntransformation initiatives along with other rationalized revenue, including both SKU and customer rationalization. Overall this strategic rationalization of revenue was the\nlargest contributor to the year-over-year decline in net sales.\nCost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold decreased by $15.4 million from $30.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to $15.3 million in the year ended December 31,\n2023, which was driven primarily by decreased sales volume, improved sourcing, and productivity initiatives in 2023. Additionally, inflationary pressures on inputs, primarily\nbeef, have partially offset some of the productivity and yield improvements we have made to our cost of goods on a variable rate basis in the latter half of 2023.\nGross Profit (Loss). Gross profit increased $3.1 million from $(0.7) million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2023. As a\npercent of net sales, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 13.7% which is higher than comparable period ended December 31, 2022 of (2.4)%. A few primary\nfactors contribute to this performance:\n•We instituted a continuous price action review process in which we look to protect our unit economics in light of the inflationary environment. This process resulted in\ntwo meaningful portfolio-wide price increases in the second half of 2022 which benefited the 2023 period.\n•During the second half of 2022 and into the 2023, we implemented mitigating strategies to lessen the impact of supply chain challenges and cost increases including but\nnot limited to, strategic sourcing, improving our manufacturing yields, and labor optimization.\n44\n•We evaluated our revenue base in the second half of 2022 and have taken steps to improve or eliminate low-quality revenue sources in order to drive long-term value-\ncreating growth. While this has benefited margins by eliminating negative gross margin sales that occurred in the prior year period, this has also resulted in significantly\nlower plant and labor utilization in 2023 which has partially muted the gross margin impact we would expected to receive from progress we've made on a unit economic\nbasis if fully utilized.\n•We experienced increasing pressure on direct labor wage rates in 2022. These inflationary pressures necessitated increases to our direct labor rates throughout 2022 and\nresulting in a higher labor rate in 2023 as compared to the prior year period.\n•Despite the effects on gross profit from lower volumes and volatile commodities throughout the year, our rationalization efforts, and transformation initiatives in pricing,\nmix, and productivity generated a 16.1 point improvement in our gross margin year over year. This speaks to the significant strides we've made to enhance our unit\neconomics which we believe will allow us to expand gross margins meaningfully as we scale our volumes due to better utilization.\nOperating Expenses.\n•Selling expenses. Selling expenses decreased by $7.2 million from $14.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to $7.5 million in the year ended December\n31, 2023. We decreased our spend with respect to our marketing efforts including digital media advertising and paid search in 2023 compared to the same period in\n2022 in favor of increasing our focus on strategies to support retail velocities. Further, by streamlining the organization and creating a more focused approach, we\nwere able to make meaningful progress in reducing our spend attributable to professional fees. In addition, as part of management's go-forward plan in the second\nquarter of 2022, certain non-core assets have been written down or reserved against. This includes fully reserving against approximately $1.5 million of prepaid media\nassets which had been held on the balance sheet. There was no activity recorded against such reserves in 2023.\n•Operations expenses. Operations expenses decreased by $2.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. In\naddition to the reduction in volume, our overall sales mix for the year ended December 31, 2023 and working in partnership with our retail and distributor customers\nto drive efficiencies for all parties allowed us to utilize more favorable modes of transportation relative to the prior year period which helped contribute to the\nreduction.\n•Salaries and wages. Salaries and wages decreased $4.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, decreasing\nfrom $10.5 million to $6.4 million. This decrease is mostly attributable to the transformation and productivity efforts of the Company.\n•Depreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $0.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year\nended December 31, 2023 and is primarily attributable to the timing of capital expenditures.\nOperating Loss. Operating loss decreased by $16.8 million from $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023\nand primarily attributable to our transformation efforts resulting in improved gross margins and decreased total operating expenses offset by rationalized volumes.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $2.7 million from $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nInterest expense includes non-cash interest of $1.4 million stemming from the warrants issued in connection to the debt financing consummated in April 2023. In addition,\ninterest expense increased by $0.3 million related to the Revenue Loan and Security Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), $0.4 million related to the Invoice Purchase and\nSecurity Agreement (the \"PSA\"), and $0.5 million related to the Notes which were not in place in the prior year period. Notwithstanding a potential charge related to the\namendments of the Notes which occurred in January 2024, the impact of the accounting treatment of the warrants from the April 2023 financing has been fully amortized as of\nyear-end 2023 and accordingly, we expect to see a meaningful decrease in our interest expense in 2024 related to the Notes.\n45\nNet Loss Before Income Taxes. Net loss decreased $14.2 million from $33.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $19.0 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023 with the decrease primarily attributable to our transformation efforts resulting in decreased operating expenses and improved gross margins and partially offset by an\nincrease in interest expense.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures and believe it is useful to investors as it provides additional information to facilitate comparisons of historical operating results, identify\ntrends in operating results, and provide additional insight on how the management team evaluates the business. Our management team uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and\nAdjusted Earnings per Share to make operating and strategic decisions, evaluate performance and comply with indebtedness related reporting requirements. Below are details on\nthese non-GAAP measures and the non-GAAP adjustments that the management team makes in the definition of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Earnings per\nShare. We believe these non-GAAP measures should be considered along with Net Loss Before Income Taxes and Net Loss, the most closely related GAAP financial measure.\nReconciliations between EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings per Share, Net Loss Before Income Taxes, and Net Loss are below, and discussion regarding\nunderlying GAAP results throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The presentation of non-GAAP financial\ninformation should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA. Stryve defines EBITDA as Net Loss before Interest Expense, Income Tax (Benefit) Expense, and Depreciation and Amortization Expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Stryve defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted as necessary for certain items listed below in the table.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to their most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is Net Loss Before Income Taxes, for\nthe twelve months ended December 31, 2023.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nNet loss before income taxes $ (19,040) $ (33,215)\nInterest expense 3,632 896\nDepreciation and amortization expense 2,221 1,961\nEBITDA $ (13,187) $ (30,358)\nAdditional Adjustments:\nSeverances and One-Time Employee Related Costs — 1,713\nOne-Time Reserves and Write Downs — 2,562\nStock Based Compensation Expense 1,156 1,052\nATM Facility Setup Fees/Expenses 93 —\nLegacy Product - Maui Relief Donations & Liquidation Sales 157 —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (11,781) $ (25,031)\nAdjusted EBITDA. The Company improved its negative Adjusted EBITDA by 52.9% when comparing the year ended December 31, 2023 with 2022. The $13.3 million\nimprovement year-over-year was driven by the Company's transformational initiatives with improved gross margins and rationalized spending.\nAdjusted Earnings per Share. Stryve defines Adjusted Earnings per Share as its Basic/Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share adjusted as necessary for certain items listed in the\ntable below:\n46\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands except share and per share information)\nNet loss $ (19,040) $ (33,140)\nWeighted average shares outstanding 2,215,417 2,048,185\nBasic & Diluted Net Loss per Share $ (8.59) $ (16.18)\nAdditional Adjustments:\nSeverances and One-Time Employee Related Costs — 0.84\nOne-Time Reserves and Write Downs — 1.25\nStock Based Compensation Expense 0.52 0.51\nNon-Cash Interest Attributable to Warrants Issued in Connection with Notes * 0.62 —\nATM Facility Setup Fees/Expenses 0.04 —\nLegacy Product - Maui Relief Donations & Liquidation Sales 0.07 —\nAdjusted Earnings per Share $ (7.34) $ (13.58)\n* The Company allocated the proceeds from the April 2023 Financing transaction between the Notes and Warrants based on their relative fair values as of the closing date\nof the facility. The allocation resulted in the fair value of the warrants to be treated as a discount to the Notes of $1.4 million that is being amortized through December 31,\n2023. Accordingly, the Company recognized non-cash interest expense in connection with the discount of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview. The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which\ncontemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In accordance with ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about\nan Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going concern (Subtopic 205-40), we have evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise\nsubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the Consolidated Financial Statements are issued.\nWe have historically funded our operations with cash flow from operations, equity capital raises, and notes payable agreements from shareholders and private investors, in\naddition to institutional loans. Our principal uses of cash have been debt service, capital expenditures and working capital, and funding operations. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, we incurred an operating loss of $15.4 million and used cash in operations of $7.4 million. As of December 31, 2023, we have approximately $11.7 million\nof indebtedness and working capital excluding cash and debt of $0.5 million which compares to the $7.2 million as of December 31, 2022.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, we secured a term loan in the maximum amount of $6.0 million, with $4.0 million being advanced upon execution and up to two additional\n$1.0 million advances available to us subject to performance hurdles. Additionally, we secured an asset based line of credit with a $8.0 million credit limit subject to accounts\nreceivable and inventory balances. The term loan and asset based line of credit were secured in order to augment our liquidity, as needed, through the execution of\nmanagement's plan. The Company had drawn $4.0 million of the term loan and $3.7 million (net of repayments) of the asset based line of credit as of December 31, 2023. See\nNote 9 to our financial statements included herein for a description of the asset based line of credit and Note 10 for a description of the term loan. During March 2024, the asset\nbased line of credit was amended to extend the initial term twenty four (24) months after the date of the amendment, followed by automatic annual renewal terms unless the\nCompany or the Lender provide written notice pursuant to the PSA prior to the end of any term.\nSince the beginning of our transformation initiatives, we have experienced a slower sell-through of our rationalized slow-moving, and obsolete inventory than expected due to\nmany factors, including other consumer packaged goods companies conducting similar inventory management and rationalization programs throughout 2022 and early in 2023\ncreating a surplus of goods in the channels commonly used to sell off this type of rationalized slow-moving, or obsolete\n47\ninventory. However, in the latter half of 2023, we were able to reduce our inventory levels significantly through scaled back production, ordinary course sales of inventory, and\naccelerated by liquidation sales and or write-off of slow-moving and obsolete inventory. Over the course of 2023, we largely held inventory steady through the first half and\nthen accelerated our draw down in the second half bringing our total reduction in inventory to $3.1 million year-over-year\nOn April 19, 2023, we issued an aggregate of $4.1 million in principal amount of secured promissory notes to select accredited investors carrying a 12% accrued interest rate to\nhelp support the working capital and growth needs of the business. The aggregate principal amount of the notes is inclusive of $1.2 million from related parties. We amended\nthe terms in January 2024 to extend the maturity date from December 31, 2023 to the earlier of (i) December 31, 2024, or (ii) the closing of the next sale or series of related\nsales by the Company of its equity securities from which the Company receives gross proceeds of not less than $3.0 million, excluding proceeds from the warrants held by the\nLenders and the Company’s existing at the market equity facility with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC.\nIn June 2023, we entered into an at-the-market equity offering sales agreement with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, that established a program pursuant to which we may\noffer and sell up to $5.7 million of our Class A common stock from time to time in at-the-market transactions. The Company sold an aggregate of 401,766 shares under the at-\nthe-market equity facility for gross proceeds of $1.7 million as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, $4.0 million remains available under the facility. During\nMarch 2024, the Company provided notice to Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC that it was terminating the at-the-market equity offering sales agreement.\nWhile these most recent financings have provided us with liquidity to support our near-term goals, we are still evaluating several different strategies to enhance our liquidity\nposition. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, pursuing additional actions under our business transformation plan, seeking to refinance or extend the term of such\ndebt and seeking additional financing from both the public and private markets through the issuance of equity or debt securities. The outcome of these matters cannot be\npredicted with any certainty at this time. We need additional funding to execute our business plan and continue operations. If capital is not available to us when, and in the\namounts needed, we could be required to liquidate our inventory and assets, cease or curtail operations, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations, or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws or similar state proceedings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the capital we\nneed to continue our operations.\nIn 2024, as we focus on accelerating quality growth, we will likely have to make investments in our working capital to support increased distribution with new and existing\nretailers coming online throughout the year. Many of these distribution resets have been secured in large part due to our new packaging design, improved product quality, and\nthe resulting improvements in our retail consumption metrics. Accordingly, we will have to build net new inventories to support these upcoming resets. This investment in\ninventory ahead of sales has and may continue to put pressure on our liquidity position given the structure and terms of our credit facilities and has required us to seek external\nfinancing. While we anticipate the increased volumes will result in improved financial results and a significantly narrowed cash loss over time, we do anticipate continued\ngrowth which, depending on the rate of growth, may require more external financing.\nWe have prepared cash flow forecasts which indicate that based on our expected operating losses and cash consumption due to growth in working capital, we believe that absent\nan infusion of sufficient capital there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months after the date our consolidated financial statements\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 are issued. The Company's plan includes the items noted above as well as securing additional external financing which likely includes\nraising debt or equity capital assuming its is available to us. While we believe our plan, if successfully executed, will alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt, these\nplans are not entirely within the Company's control including our ability to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms, if at all.\n48\nCash Flows.

Net cash used in operating activities decreased $21.2 million from $28.6 million through the year ended December 31, 2022 compared\nto $7.4 million through the year ended December 31, 2023. This decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in net losses of $14.2 million during the year ended December\n31, 2023, as compared to the prior year period, a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $5.4 million and the April 2023 Financing transaction amortization of $1.4\nmillion. The change in operating assets and liabilities that impacted our use of cash in operations include an increase in inventory of $4.1 million and an increase of $1.5\nmillion in accounts payable due to timing of payments.\nNet Cash used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased from $3.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 to $0.1 million in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, representing a $3.5 million decrease in cash consumed when comparing the same period year over year. We believe our current manufacturing and\nfulfillment assets are generally sufficient to meet the near-term potential demand for our products and don't foresee the need for significant capital expenditures to facilitate\ngrowth in the coming quarters.\nNet Cash provided by Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities generated $23.4 million less in cash for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to\nthe year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily the January 2022 PIPE transaction as well as the Loan Agreement which initially funded in the prior year period. In the year\nended December 31, 2023, we generated cash from financing activities of $7.3 million primarily driven by the proceeds from the $4.1 million in secured promissory notes, $2.4\nmillion in proceeds from PSA and $1.7 million in proceeds from the at-the-market equity facility offset by debt payments.\nDebt and credit facilities. The information below represents an overview of the Company’s debt and prior credit facilities.\nThe Company’s long-term debt as of December 31 is as follows:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nRevenue Loan and Security Agreement, net of debt issuance costs $ 3,792 $ 3,889\nBroken Stone Agreement 20 52\nLess: current portion (336) (245)\nTotal long-term debt, net of current portion $ 3,476 $ 3,697\nAs of December 31, short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt consisted of the following:\n(In thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nInvoice Purchase and Security Agreement, net of debt issuance costs $ 3,568 $ 1,046\n4,089\nPromissory Notes, net of debt discount and debt issuance costs —\nCommercial Premium Finance Agreement 270 725\nCurrent portion of long-term obligations 336 245\nTotal short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt $ 8,263 $ 2,016\n49\nFuture minimum principal payments on debt as of December 31, 2023, are as follows for the years ending December 31:\n2024 $ 8,498\n2025 753\n2026 1,554\n2027 1,154\n2028 —\nThereafter —\n$ 11,960\nOn April 19, 2023, we issued an aggregate of $4.1 million in principal amount of secured promissory notes to select accredited investors carrying a 12% accrued interest rate to\nhelp support the working capital and growth needs of the business. The aggregate principal amount of the notes is inclusive of $1.2 million from related parties. We amended\nthe terms in January 2024 to extend the maturity date from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024.\nCertain Factors Affecting Our Performance\nStryve’s management believes that the Company’s future performance will depend on many factors, including the following:\nAbility to Expand Distribution in both Online and Traditional Retail Channels. Stryve’s products are sold through a growing number of traditional retail channels where the\nCompany has an opportunity to acquire new consumers. Traditional retail channels include mass stores, grocery chains, natural food outlets, club stores, convenience stores,\nand drug stores, all either direct or through distribution partners. Stryve works closely with retailers to establish plans for distribution expansion and promotional opportunities.\nStryve is also growing its consumer base through both paid and organic means both online as well. Online consumer acquisitions typically occur through the Company’s\nportfolio of DTC e-commerce websites and Amazon.com. The Company’s online consumer acquisition program includes paid and unpaid social media, search, and display\nmedia.\nAbility to Acquire and Retain Consumers at a Reasonable Cost. Stryve’s management believes an ability to consistently acquire and retain consumers at a reasonable cost\nrelative to projected life-time value will be a key factor affecting future performance. To accomplish this goal, Stryve intends to strategically allocate advertising and\npromotional spend between online and offline channels, including shopper marketing and trade promotions in partnership with is retail customers. Stryve's promotional\nactivities will mostly be focused on increasing consumer awareness and driving trial of our products. Further, we acknowledge that changes to third-party algorithms or the\nability to leverage retailer programs that may be utilized directly, or indirectly, by Stryve in its advertising efforts may impact the effectiveness of Stryve's advertising which\nmay increase its overall cost to acquire and retain consumers. Further, management believes the performance of its packaging designs on shelf at retail will be key in driving\ntrial with new consumers.\nAbility to Drive Repeat Usage of Our Products. Stryve accrues substantial economic value from repeat consumers who consistently purchase its products either online or in\ntraditional retail. The pace of Stryve’s growth rate will be affected by the repeat usage dynamics of existing and newly acquired customers. The Company utilizes a number of\nmethods to drive repeat behavior including intelligent e-mail and text campaigns, targeted digital media, and subscribe and save incentives as well as in-store trade promotion\nstrategies.\nAbility to Expand Gross Margins. Stryve’s overall profitability will be impacted by its ability to expand gross margins through effective sourcing of raw materials, managing\nproduction yields and drying times, controlling labor and shipping costs, as well as spreading other production-related costs over greater manufacturing volumes. Additionally,\nStryve's ability to expand gross margins will be influenced by its revenue channel and customer mix as well as by Stryve's ability to pass price increases to its customers.\nAbility to Expand Operating Margins. The Company’s ability to expand operating margins will be impacted by its ability to effectively manage its fixed and variable operating\nexpenses as net sales increase.\n50\nAbility to Manage Supply Chain and Expand Production In-line with Demand. Stryve’s ability to grow and meet future demand will be affected by its ability to effectively plan\nfor and source inventory from a variety of suppliers located inside and outside the United States. Additionally, efficiently scaling production capacity ahead of growth in net\nsales will be critical to the Company’s ability to meet future demand without disruption.\nAbility to Optimize Key Components of Working Capital. Stryve’s ability to reduce cash burn in the near-term and eventually generate positive cash flow will be partially\nimpacted by the Company’s ability to effectively manage the key components of working capital which have a direct impact on the cash conversion cycle. Maintaining and\nsecuring sufficient liquidity to support ongoing investments in working capital required to facilitate growth will be key as Stryve seeks to optimize its components working\ncapital and supply chain.\nSeasonality. Because Stryve is so early in its lifecycle of growth, it is difficult to discern the exact magnitude of seasonality affecting its business. Any evidence of seasonality in\nthe Company's revenue is not clearly discernible from the Company’s historical growth. However, there does seem to be seasonal factors affecting its commodity inputs,\nprimarily beef, that has developed since the pandemic. Understanding potential trends in seasonality will be key in Stryve’s management of its expenses, liquidity, and working\ncapital.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2023. We do not participate in transactions that\ncreate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of\nfacilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt\nor commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have various contractual obligations and other commitments that require payments at certain specified periods. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations\nand commitments as of December 31, 2023:\nPayments due by period\n(In thousands) Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 years 4 to 5 years 6 years and beyond Total\nOperating lease obligations $ 931 $ 1,558 $ 1,481 $ 4,808 $ 8,778\nFinancing lease obligations 758 1,561 $ 1,624 3,896 7,839\nTotal contractual obligations $ 1,689 $ 3,119 $ 3,105 $ 8,704 $ 16,617\nStryve is also responsible for all monthly expenses related to the leased facilities, including insurance premiums, taxes and other expenses, such as utilities. During 2023, the\nCompany entered into agreements to sublease the Carrollton, Texas distribution facility and the former corporate office in Plano, Texas. See further discussion at Note 16.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risks\nStryve’s future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from\nadverse changes in market prices and interest rates.\nConcentration of credit risk. The balance sheet items that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, and accounts receivable. The\nCompany continuously evaluates the credit worthiness of its customers’ financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains cash balances in\nbank accounts that may, at times, exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limits of $250,000 per institution. The Company incurred no losses from such\naccounts and management considers the risk of loss to be minimal.\n51\nAs of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, customer concentrations in excess of 10% consolidated sales and accounts receivable are below. No vendors represented more\nthan 10% of purchases or accounts payable.\nAccounts Accounts\nSales Purchases Receivable Payable\nCustomer A 21% — 17% —\nCustomer B 13% — — —\nCustomer C 11% — — —\nCustomer D 10% — 20% —\nInterest rate risk. Stryve is subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowing based on a variable interest rate. Derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate\nswap agreements and interest rate cap agreements, are not currently but may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from Stryve’s\nvariable rate debt obligations that are expected to remain outstanding. Interest rate changes do not affect the market value of such debt, but could impact the amount of Stryve’s\ninterest payments, and accordingly, Stryve’s future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. Additionally, changes in prevailing market interest rates\nmay affect Stryve’s ability to refinance existing debt or secure new debt financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, management acknowledges that both foreign and domestic\ncentral bank actions as well as geopolitical uncertainty and conflict, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, may have unpredictable effects on the Company's exposure to interest\nrate risk either directly or indirectly.\nForeign currency risk. Stryve is exposed to changes in currency rates as a result of its revenue generated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Revenue and profit generated\nby international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, the operations that are\nimpacted by foreign currency risk are less than 5% of Stryve’s net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and therefore, the risk of this is not significant.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, management acknowledges that both foreign and domestic central bank actions as well as geopolitical uncertainty and conflict, such as Russia's\ninvasion of Ukraine, may have unpredictable effects on the Company's exposure to foreign currency risk either directly or indirectly.\nRaw material risk. Stryve’s profitability depends, among other things, on its ability to anticipate and react to raw material costs, primarily beef. The price of beef and other raw\nmaterials are subject to many factors beyond Stryve’s control, including general economic conditions, inflation, processing labor shortages, cost of feed, demand, natural\ndisasters, weather and other factors that may affect beef supply chain participants. Changes in the prices of beef and other raw materials have already negatively affected\nStryve's results of operations, and any continued or further changes could have a material impact on Stryve’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, management acknowledges that both foreign and domestic central bank actions as well as geopolitical uncertainty and conflict, such as Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, may have unpredictable effects on the Company's exposure to risks in its procurement of raw materials.\nInflation risk. Inflation may impact Stryve’s revenue and cost of services and products, Stryve believes the effects of inflation on its business, financial condition and results of\noperations have been material to date which management hopes to alleviate through mitigating strategies. However, there can be no assurance that any mitigation strategies\nmanagement employs will be effective or that its business, financial condition and results of operations will not be materially impacted by continued inflation in the future.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, management acknowledges that both foreign and domestic central bank actions as well as geopolitical uncertainty and conflict, such as Russia’s\ninvasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, may have unpredictable effects on the Company's exposure to inflation risk either directly or indirectly.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenue,\nresults of operations, and comprehensive net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet during, and as of, the reporting periods.\nThese estimates, assumptions, and judgments are necessary and are made based on our historical experience, market trends and on other assumptions and factors that we believe\nto be\n52\nreasonable under the circumstances because future events and their effects on our results of operations and value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty. These\nestimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained. We may periodically be faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our\ncontrol and may not be known for a prolonged period of time. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those\nestimates or assumptions.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\namounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed herein are those that management\nconsiders to be the most critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Estimates\nare used for, but not limited to revenue recognition, allowance for credit losses and customer allowances, inventory valuation, impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets,\nincremental borrowing rate for leases, and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. All of these estimates reflect management’s judgment about current economic and\nmarket conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. If such conditions persist longer or deteriorate\nfurther than expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates could change, which may result in future impairments of assets among other effects.\nGoing concern. In accordance with ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), we have\nevaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after\nthe date that the consolidated financial statements are issued.\nDetermining the extent to which conditions or events raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and the extent to which mitigating plans sufficiently\nalleviate any such substantial doubt requires significant judgment and estimation by us. Our significant estimates related to this analysis may include identifying business factors\nsuch as size, growth and profitability used in the forecasted financial results and liquidity. Further, we make assumptions about the probability that management's plans will be\neffectively implemented and alleviate substantial doubt and our ability to continue as a going concern. We believe that the estimated values used in our going concern analysis\nare based on reasonable assumptions. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from those estimates. See Note 2, Liquidity\nand Going Concern, for more information about our going concern assessment.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses, Returns, and Deductions. Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. Accounts\nreceivables, less credit losses, reflects the net realizable value of receivables and approximates fair value. We account for accounts receivable, less credit losses, under ASU\n2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. We evaluate our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for credit loss based on a combination of factors. When aware\nthat a specific customer has been impacted by circumstances such as bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, potentially\nmaking it unable to meet its financial obligations, we record a specific allowance for doubtful account to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is\ncollectible. We also record allowances for credit loss for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical\ncollection experience, and an evaluation of current and projected economic conditions at the balance sheet date. Accounts receivables are charged off against the reserve for\ncredit losses after we determine that the potential for recovery is remote. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for credit losses and returns and deductions totaled\n$1.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively. Total bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition of Biltong USA Inc., and Braaitime LLC in 2018.\nGoodwill is accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. Goodwill is reviewed and tested for\nimpairment on a reporting unit level annually.\n53\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, effective for periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2019, with an election to adopt early. The ASU requires only a one-step qualitative impairment test, whereby a goodwill impairment loss will be measured\nas the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. It eliminates Step 2 of the current two-step goodwill impairment test, under which a goodwill impairment\nloss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is required in\nestimating fair value and performing goodwill impairment tests.\nThe Company presents a single segment for purposes of financial reporting and prepared its consolidated financial statements upon that basis. The Company considered ASC\n350-20-35-35 related to reporting unit determination and the aggregation of components into one reporting unit.\nThe economic characteristics considered were whether:\n1) The nature of the products and services are similar\n2) The type of class of customer for products and services are similar\n3) The methods used to distribute the products or provide the services are similar\n4) The manner in which an entity operates and the nature of those operations is similar\nThe Company has concluded it has one operating segment based on the nature of products that the Company sells, an intertwined production and distribution model, the\ninternal management structure and information that is regularly reviewed by the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker, for the purpose of assessing performance and\nallocating resources. The Company also determined it has one reporting unit.\nThe Company assessed the recoverability of goodwill using a qualitative analysis. For the year ended December 31, 2023, net loss for the Company (reporting unit) improved.\nIn addition to reviewing the financial performance of the reporting unit, the Company's management also reviewed various events or circumstances that may affect fair value in\nthe following categories: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, and other relevant entity-specific events. In doing so, the Company's\nmanagement determined if each event or circumstance would have an adverse, neutral, or positive impact on the business and assessed the relative impact of each.\nBased on this analysis, the Company's management has determined that it is more than likely that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount as of\nDecember 31, 2023. As a result, no impairments were made to Goodwill.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot required for smaller reporting companies.\n54\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following information is included in this Item 8:\nReport of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 56\nConsolidated Balances Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 57\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 58\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity (Deficit) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 59\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 60\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 61\n55\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of\nStryve Foods, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryve Foods, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements\nof operations,, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as\nthe “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph – Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 2, the\nCompany has a significant working capital deficiency, has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These\nconditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The\nconsolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our\naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum llp\nMarcum llp\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\nNew York, NY\nApril 1, 2024\n56\nSTRYVE FOODS,

(“Stryve” or the “Company”) is an emerging healthy snacking company which manufactures, markets and sells highly differentiated healthy snacking\nproducts. The Company offers convenient snacks that are lower in sugar and carbohydrates and higher in protein than other snacks. The Company is headquartered in Plano,\nTX and recently changed its mailing address to a post office box while it navigates a potential office relocation for its corporate staff. The Company has manufacturing\noperations in Madill, Oklahoma and fulfillment operations in Frisco, Texas.\nReverse Stock Split\nOn July 13, 2023, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a First Certificate of Amendment to its First Amended and Restated Certificate of\nIncorporation (the “Certificate”) to effect a 1-for-15 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”) of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par\nvalue $0.0001 per share, effective as of 12:01 p.m. Eastern Time on July 14, 2023.\nAs a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every fifteen shares of common stock issued and outstanding were automatically reclassified into one share of common stock. No\nfractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who otherwise would have been entitled to receive fractional shares because they held\na number of shares of common stock not evenly divisible by the Reverse Stock Split ratio were automatically entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the value of such\nfractional share based on the closing price of the common stock as of the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split.\nThe Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of authorized shares of Class V common stock from 200,000,000 to 15,000,000 while the number of authorized shares of Class\nA common stock and the par value for both Class A and Class V common stock remained unchanged.\nAll outstanding options, warrants, restricted stock units and similar securities entitling their holders to receive or purchase shares of common stock were adjusted as a result of\nthe Reverse Stock Split, as required by the terms of each security.\nAll share and per share amounts were retroactively adjusted in the Company's financial statements for all periods presented to give effect to this reverse stock split, including\nreclassifying an amount equal to the reduction in par value of the Company’s common stock to additional paid-in capital.\nNote 2 - Liquidity and Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which\ncontemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. In accordance with ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties\nabout an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going concern (Subtopic 205-40), we have evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise\nsubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the Consolidated Financial Statements are issued.\nWe have historically funded our operations with cash flow from operations, equity capital raises, and note payable agreements from shareholders and private investors, in\naddition to institutional loans. Our principal uses of cash have been debt service, capital expenditures and working capital, and funding operations. The Company incurred net\nlosses of approximately $19.0 million during the twelve months ending December 31, 2023. Cash used in operating activities was approximately $7.4 million for the same\nperiod. As of December 31, 2023, we have working capital deficit of $7.4 million which compares to the $5.8 million working capital we maintained as of December 31,\n2022.\nLate in the third quarter of 2022, we secured a term loan in the maximum amount of $6.0 million, with $4.0 million being advanced upon execution and up to two additional\n$1.0 million advances available to us subject to performance hurdles. Additionally, we secured an asset based line of credit with a $8.0 million credit limit subject to accounts\nreceivable and inventory balances. The term loan and asset based line of credit were secured in order to augment our liquidity, as needed, through the execution of\nmanagement's plan. The Company had drawn $4.0 million of the term\n61\nloan and $3.7 million (net of repayments) of the asset based line of credit as of December 31, 2023. See Note 9 for a description of the asset based line of credit and Note 10\nfor a description of the term loan.\nWe are currently evaluating several different strategies to enhance our liquidity position. These strategies may include, but are not limited to, pursuing additional actions under\nour business transformation plan, and seeking additional financing from both the public and private markets through the issuance of equity or debt securities. The outcome of\nthese matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time. We need additional funding to execute our business plan and continue operations. If capital is not available\nto us when, and in the amounts needed, we could be required to liquidate our inventory and assets, cease or curtail operations, which could materially harm our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations, or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws or similar state proceedings. There can be no assurance that we will be able\nto raise the capital we need to continue our operations.\nWe have prepared cash flow forecasts which indicate that based on our expected operating losses and cash consumption due to growth in working capital, we believe that\nabsent an infusion of sufficient capital there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months after the date the consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2023 are issued. The Company's plan includes the items noted above as well as securing external financing which may include\nraising debt or equity capital. These plans are not entirely within the Company's control including our ability to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms, if at all.\nNote 3 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)\nand include all information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nPrior period reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Specifically, the presentation of\nchanges in inventory to conform with the current period presentation on the consolidated statements of cash flows and the presentation of stockholders equity in the\nconsolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity (deficit) resulting from effecting the reverse stock split.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed herein are those that management considers\nto be the most critical to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. Estimates are\nused for, but not limited to revenue recognition, allowance for credit losses and customer allowances, inventory valuation, impairments of goodwill and long-lived assets,\nincremental borrowing rate for leases, and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. All of these estimates reflect management’s judgment about current economic and\nmarket conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. If such conditions persist longer or deteriorate\nfurther than expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates could change, which may result in future impairments of assets among other effects.\nGoing Concern\nIn accordance with ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), we have evaluated whether\nthere are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that\nthe consolidated financial statements are issued.\nDetermining the extent to which conditions or events raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and the extent to which mitigating plans\nsufficiently alleviate any such substantial doubt requires significant\n62\njudgment and estimation by us. Our significant estimates related to this analysis may include identifying business factors such as size, growth and profitability used in the\nforecasted financial results and liquidity. Further, we make assumptions about the probability that management's plans will be effectively implemented and alleviate\nsubstantial doubt and our ability to continue as a going concern. We believe that the estimated values used in our going concern analysis are based on reasonable\nassumptions. However, such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from those estimates. See Note 2, Liquidity and Going Concern,\nfor more information about our going concern assessment.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses, Returns, and Deductions\nAccounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. Accounts receivables, less credit losses, reflects the net realizable value of receivables and\napproximates fair value. We account for accounts receivable, less credit losses, under ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses. We evaluate our accounts\nreceivable and establish an allowance for credit loss based on a combination of factors. When aware that a specific customer has been impacted by circumstances such as\nbankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer’s operating results or financial position, potentially making it unable to meet its financial obligations, we record a specific\nallowance for doubtful account to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible. We also record allowances for credit loss for all other\ncustomers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical collection experience, and an evaluation of current and projected\neconomic conditions at the balance sheet date. Accounts receivables are charged off against the allowance for credit losses after we determine that the potential for recovery\nis remote.\nAs of December 31, the allowance for credit losses consisted of the following:\n2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ 117,360 $ 1,236,497\nProvisions 1,520,679 717,144\nWrite-offs - (1,836,281)\nEnding balance $ 1,638,039 $ 117,360\nTotal bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $697,876 and $372,363, respectively. Provisions related to returns and deductions for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $822,803 and $344,780, respectively.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe balance sheet items that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and accounts receivable. The Company continuously\nevaluates the credit worthiness of its customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains cash balances in bank accounts that\nmay, at times, exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limits of $250,000 per institution. The Company incurred no losses from such accounts and\nmanagement considers the risk of loss to be minimal.\nFor the years ended December 31, the following customers represented more than 10% of consolidated sales. No vendors represented more than 10% of purchases.\n2023 2022\nCustomer A 21% 12%\nCustomer B 13% —\nCustomer C 11% —\nCustomer D 10% —\nCustomer E — 30%\nAs of December 31, the following customers represented more than 10% of accounts receivable. No vendors represented more than 10% of the accounts payable balance.\n63\n2023 2022\nCustomer A 17% 10%\nCustomer C — 10%\nCustomer D 20%\nCustomer F — 27%\nRevenue Recognition Policy\nThe Company manufactures and markets a broad range of protein snack products through multiple distribution channels. The products are offered through branded and\nprivate label items. Generally, the Company considers all revenues as arising from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized based on the five-step process outlined\nin ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:\n(1)Identification of the contract with a customer\n(2)Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\n(3)Determination of the transaction price\n(4)Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n(5)Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation\nThe Company’s revenue derived from the sale of branded and private label products is considered variable consideration as the contract includes discounts, rebates,\nincentives and other similar items. Generally, revenue is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the product, which may occur upon either\nshipment or delivery of the product. The payment terms of the Company’s contracts are generally net 30 to 60 days, although early pay discounts are offered to customers.\nThe Company regularly experiences customer deductions from amounts invoiced due to product returns, product shortages, and delivery nonperformance penalty fees. This\nvariable consideration is estimated using the expected value approach based on the Company’s historical experience, and it is recognized as a reduction to the transaction\nprice in the same period that the related product sale is recognized.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products to customers. Revenue is recognized when the\nCompany satisfies its performance obligations under the contract by transferring the promised product to its customer.\nThe Company’s contracts generally do not include any material significant financing components.\nPerformance Obligations\nThe Company has elected the following practical expedients provided for in ASC 606:\n(1)The Company has excluded from its transaction price all sales and similar taxes collected from its customers.\n(2)The Company has elected to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the\nentity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.\n(3)The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related good transfers as fulfillment activities instead of\nassessing such activities as performance obligations.\n64\n(4)The portfolio approach has been elected by the Company as it expects any effects would not be materially different in application at the portfolio level compared\nwith the application at an individual contract level.\n(5)The Company has elected not to disclose information about its remaining performance obligations for any contract that has an original expected duration of one\nyear or less.\nNeither the type of good sold nor the location of sale significantly impacts the nature, amount, timing, or uncertainty of revenue and cash flows.\nInventory\nInventories consist of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods, are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value determined using the average cost method. The\nCompany reviews the value of items in inventory and provides write-downs and write-offs of inventory for obsolete, damaged, or expired inventory. Write-downs and write-\noffs are included in cost of goods sold.\nPrepaid Media Spend\nIn 2020, the Company entered into a bartering arrangement with an independent full-service corporate trade company, a vendor, whereas the Company will provide\ninventory in exchange for media credits. The Company has the right to utilize this asset as credits against future media buying services with this vendor. No inventory was\nexchanged during 2022 and 2023. The Company fully reserved for the $1,489,028 in media credits as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. As the Company has significantly\nreduced its media spend, it is unlikely the unused media credits will be utilized prior to expiring.\nThe Company accounts for barter transactions under ASC Topic No. 845, Nonmonetary Transactions. Barter transactions with commercial substance are recorded at the\nestimated fair value of the products exchanged, unless the products received have a more readily determinable estimated fair value. Revenue associated with barter\ntransactions is recorded at the time of the exchange of the related assets.\nAdvertising Costs\nIn accordance with ASC 720-35, Advertising Costs, advertising and marketing costs are charged to operations in the period incurred. Advertising and marketing expenses for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $907,450 and $5,740,567 respectively and are included in selling expenses in the accompanying statements of\noperations. Advertising costs during the year ended December 31, 2022 include the reserve of $1,489,028 in media credits.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs are costs incurred to obtain new debt financing. Debt issuance costs are presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the\ncarrying value of the debt and are accreted to interest expense using the effective interest method.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and consist primarily of building, equipment and leasehold improvements. Depreciation expense\nis recognized using the straight-line method over its estimated useful life of three to twenty years.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the equipment or improvement. Such\namortization is recorded as depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUpon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in\nloss from operations. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.\n65\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for potential impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. Potential\nimpairment is assessed when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Recoverability of\nthese assets is assessed based on undiscounted expected future cash flows from the assets, considering a number of factors, including past operating results, budgets and\neconomic projections, market trends, and product development cycles. If impairments are identified, assets are written down to their estimated fair value. The Company has\nnot recognized any impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nLeases\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use\n(ROU) assets, current operating lease liabilities, and noncurrent operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant\nand equipment, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs and current maturities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nOperating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at\ncommencement date. Variable payments are not included in ROU assets or lease liabilities and can vary from period to period based on asset usage or our proportionate\nshare of common costs. The implicit rate within our leases is generally not determinable and, therefore, the incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement is utilized to\ndetermine the present value of lease payments. We estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on third-party lender quotes to obtain secured debt in a like currency for a\nsimilar asset over a timeframe similar to the term of the lease. The ROU asset also includes any lease prepayments made and any initial direct costs incurred and excludes\nlease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for\nminimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have elected not to recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of\n12 months or less.\nThe Company accounts for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all asset classes.\nRecognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. Operating lease\nexpense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, whereas the amortization of finance lease assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the\nestimated useful life of the underlying asset or the lease term. Operating lease expense and finance lease amortization are presented in cost of goods sold or operations\nexpense in our consolidated statements of operations depending on the nature of the leased item. Interest expense on finance lease obligations is recorded over the lease term\nand is presented in Interest expense, based on the effective interest method. All operating lease cash payments and interest on finance leases are presented within cash flows\nfrom operating activities and all finance lease principal payments are presented within cash flows from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition of Biltong USA Inc., and Braaitime LLC in 2018.\nGoodwill is accounted for in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. Goodwill is not amortized and is reviewed and tested for impairment on a\nreporting unit level annually.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is\nless than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a\nquantitative test to identify and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss. The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the\ncarrying amount exceeds fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered impaired, and that excess is recognized as a goodwill impairment loss. A significant amount\nof judgment is required in estimating fair value and performing goodwill impairment tests. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no impairment of\ngoodwill.\nIntangible Assets\n66\nOn December 11, 2020, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Kalahari Snacks, LLC, entered into an asset purchase agreement with Kalahari Brands, Inc. consisting\nprincipally of its brands and marks, to acquire certain assets and liabilities of Kalahari Brands for a purchase price of $5,867,344. In terms of the asset purchase agreement, a\npost-closing working capital adjustment was applied to the purchase price. The adjustment of $113,237 was applied against the Kalahari Seller Note.\nThe brand name is accounted for in accordance with ASC 350 and amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years and reviewed or impairment whenever changes or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The fair value is then compared to the carrying value and an impairment charged is\nrecognized by the amount in which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there was no impairment of the\nintangible asset.\nStock Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation awards including restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and restricted stock units with a market condition are accounted for in accordance\nwith ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation . The Company expenses the fair value of stock awards granted to employees and members of the board of directors\nover the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period. Compensation cost for stock-based awards issued to employees is measured using the estimated fair\nvalue at the grant date. The Company accounts for forfeitures when they occur.\nStock-based awards issued to non-employees, including directors for non-board-related services, are accounted for based on the fair value of such services received or the\nfair value of the awards granted on the grant date, whichever is more reliably measured. Stock-based awards subject to service-based vesting conditions are expensed on a\nstraight-line basis over the vesting period. Stock-based awards subject to a market-based condition are expensed over the derived service period.\nWarrants\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable\nauthoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The\nassessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether\nthe warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company’s own common stock and\nwhether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity\nclassification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end\ndate while the warrants are outstanding.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at\nthe time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair\nvalue on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter.\nAccordingly, the Company classifies the private warrants issued to Andina's original stockholders (the \"Private Warrants\") as liabilities at their fair value and adjusts the\nwarrants to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized\nin the consolidated statements of operations.\n67\nNet Income (Loss) per Share\nThe Company reports both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock\noutstanding and excludes the dilutive effect of warrants, stock options, and other types of convertible securities. However, for the year ended December 31, 2022, certain\npre-funded warrants are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share as the pre-funded warrants were exercisable for nominal value. Diluted earnings per share is\ncalculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and the dilutive effect of stock options, warrants and other types of convertible\nsecurities are included in the calculation. Dilutive securities are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation if their effect is anti-dilutive, such as in periods\nwhere the Company would report a net loss.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company excluded the common stock equivalents summarized below, which entitle the holders thereof to ultimately acquire\nshares of common stock, from its calculation of earnings per share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nPrivate Warrants 197,500 197,500\nPublic Warrants 10,800,000 10,800,000\nWarrants - January 2022 Offering 10,294,118 10,294,118\nWarrants - April 2023 Financing 7,964,550 —\nRestricted Stock Awards - unvested 57,780 26,700\n29,313,948 21,318,318\nThe weighted average number of shares outstanding for purposes of per share calculations includes the Class V shares on as-exchanged basis.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive loss is equal to net loss as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, as the Company did not have any other comprehensive\nincome or loss for the periods presented.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method of ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires the Company to recognize current tax\nliabilities or receivables for the amount of taxes as estimated are payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax\nconsequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases of assets and liabilities and the expected\nbenefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the\nyears in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in\noperations in the period enacted. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The\nultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the period in which\nrelated temporary differences become deductible.\nOn July 20, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed a business combination (the \"Business Combination\") pursuant to that certain Business Combination\nAgreement (the \"Business Combination Agreement\"). Under the terms of a Tax Receivable Agreement (the “TRA”) as part of the Business Combination Agreement, the\nCompany generally will be required to pay to the Seller 85% of the applicable cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal and state income tax based on its ownership in Andina\nHoldings, LLC that the Company is deemed to realize in certain circumstances as a result of the increases in tax basis and certain tax attributes resulting from the Business\nCombination as described below. This is accounted for in conjunction with the methods used to record income tax described above.\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10 related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements. ASC 740-\n10 prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial\n68\nstatement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns.\nThe benefit of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the Company income tax returns is recognized in the financial statements if such positions are more likely than\nnot of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and\nmeasured pursuant to the interpretation are referred to as “unrecognized benefits”. A liability is recognized (or amount of net operating loss carryover or amount of tax\nrefundable is reduced) for an unrecognized tax benefit because it represents an enterprise’s potential future obligation to the taxing authority for a tax position that was not\nrecognized as a result of applying the provisions of ASC 740-10. Interest costs and related penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are required to be calculated, if\napplicable. The Company's policy is to classify assessments, if any, for tax related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2023\nand 2022, no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. We do not expect any significant changes in our unrecognized tax benefits in the next year.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nIn conjunction with the Business Combination, the Company entered into the TRA with Seller and Holdings. Pursuant to the TRA, the Company is required to pay Seller 85%\nof the amount of savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax that the Company actually realizes as a result of (a) tax basis adjustments resulting from\ntaxable exchanges of Class B common units of Holdings and Class V common stock of the Company acquired by the Company in exchange for Class A common stock of the\nCompany and (b) tax deductions in respect of portions of certain payments made under the TRA. All such payments to the Seller are the obligations of the Company. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, there have been 383,898 shares of Class B common units of Holdings and Class V common stock of the Company exchanged for Class A common stock\nof the Company. The Company has not recognized any change to the deferred tax asset for changes in tax basis, as the asset is not more-likely-than-not to be realized.\nAdditionally, the company has not recognized the TRA liability as it is not probable that the TRA payments would be paid based on the Company's historical loss position\nand would not be payable until the company realizes tax benefit.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, a line of credit, promissory notes payable and long-term debt. The\ncarrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and promissory notes payable approximate their respective fair values because of the short-term maturities\nor expected settlement date of these instruments. The line of credit has variable interest rates the Company believes reflect current market rates for notes of this nature. The\nCompany believes the current carrying value of long-term debt approximates its fair value because the terms are comparable to similar lending arrangements in the\nmarketplace.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with\nASC 815. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then\nre-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such\ninstruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current\nor non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments –Credit Losses (Topic 326) –Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-\n13”). ASU 2016-13 replaces the “incurred loss” credit losses framework with a new accounting standard that requires management's measurement of the allowance for\ncredit losses to be based on a broader range of reasonable and supportable information for lifetime credit loss estimates. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 as of\nJanuary 1, 2023, which did not result in any material changes to the Company’s financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470- 20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s\nOwn Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible\n69\nInstruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”), which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities\nand equity. This ASU (1) simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock by removing the existing guidance in ASC 470-20, Debt:\nDebt with Conversion and Other Options, that requires entities to account for beneficial conversion features and cash conversion features in equity, separately from the host\nconvertible debt or preferred stock; (2) revises the scope exception from derivative accounting in ASC 815-40 for freestanding financial instruments and embedded features\nthat are both indexed to the issuer’s own stock and classified in stockholders’ equity, by removing certain criteria required for equity classification; and (3) revises the\nguidance in ASC 260, Earnings Per Share, to require entities to calculate diluted earnings per share (EPS) for convertible instruments by using the if-converted method. In\naddition, entities must presume share settlement for purposes of calculating diluted EPS when an instrument may be settled in cash or shares. For SEC filers, excluding\nsmaller reporting companies, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early\nadoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method\nwhich did not result in any changes to the Company’s financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires public entities to\ndisclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported\nmeasure of segment profit or loss. All public entities will be required to report segment information in accordance with the new guidance starting in annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2023. The Company is determining the impact on our business.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which enhances the\ntransparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by requiring; (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation\nand (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. For public\nbusiness entities, the standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not\nyet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is determining the impact of the ASU 2023-09 on its financial statements.\nNote 4 - Inventory\nAs of December 31, inventory consisted of the following:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nRaw materials $ 1,475,657 $ 1,614,712\nWork in process 703,117 308,569\nFinished goods 3,021,205 6,335,361\nTotal Inventory $ 5,199,979 $ 8,258,642\nReserves for inventory obsolescence are recorded as necessary to reduce obsolete inventory to estimated net realizable value or to specifically reserve for obsolete inventory.\nWrite-downs and write-offs included in cost of goods sold for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $82,391 and $694,662, respectively.\nNote 5 - Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nAs of December 31, prepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following:\nAs of As of\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nInsurance $ 378,199 $ 721,960\nMarketing and advertising $ 82,053 161,196\nVendor deposits $ 21,038 495,040\nOther $ 239,392 172,521\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets $ 720,682 $ 1,550,717\n70\nNote 6 - Property & Equipment, net\nAs of December 31, property and equipment consisted of the following:\nAs of As of\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nPlant and equipment $ 8,219,929 $ 7,649,405\nFurniture and fixtures 26,246 42,825\nLeasehold improvements 4,265,380 4,537,488\nWebsite 111,002 111,002\nLand 242,333 242,333\nBuilding 1,399,200 1,399,201\nTotal cost 14,264,090 13,982,254\nLess accumulated depreciation (7,113,314 ) (5,165,681 )\nProperty and equipment, net $ 7,150,775 $ 8,816,573\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1,978,760 and $1,718,739 respectively.\nNote 7 – Intangible Assets, net\nThe intangible assets consist of the acquired brand assets of Kalahari, which as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, had a carrying value of $4,119,690 and $4,362,024,\nrespectively.

Pursuant to the PSA, the subsidiaries agree to sell eligible accounts receivable to the Lender for an amount\nequal to the face amount of each account receivable less a reserve percentage. The PSA was amended to decrease the maximum amount potentially available to be deployed\nby the Lender at any given time from $15,000,000 to $8,000,000.

In determining the need for a valuation\nallowance, the Company assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether future taxable income would be generated to permit use of the existing\ndeferred tax assets (“DTAs”). As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, a significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the three-year cumulative loss before\ntaxes. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective\n75\nevidence, such as projections for future growth. The Company determined that there is uncertainty regarding the utilization of certain DTAs such as the investment in Andina\nHoldings, LLC, federal and state operating losses and state net operating losses, and the interest expense limitation. Therefore, a valuation allowance has been recorded\nagainst the DTAs for which it is more-likely-than-not they will not be realized. The amount of DTA considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future\ntaxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional\nweight is given to subjective evidence such as projections for growth.\nThe Company has established a 100% valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets as the Company does not believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be\nrealized. The Company's valuation allowance increased by approximately $9,426,230 and $5,170,541 in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n2023 2022\nBeginning balance $ 13,784,320 $ 8,613,779\nCharged to costs and expenses 9,426,229 5,170,541\nEnding balance $ 23,210,549 $ 13,784,320\nUpon audit, tax authorities may challenge all or part of a tax position. A tax position successfully challenged by a taxing authority could result in an adjustment to our\nprovision for income taxes in the period in which a final determination is made. The Company did not maintain any unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nThe Company has United States federal tax net operating losses (NOLs) of $40,998,295 and state NOLs of $19,813,263 as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe Company has federal and state NOLs of $28,294,533 and $13,852,988. The federal NOLs are carried forward indefinitely and the state NOLs will expire between 2036\nand 2042.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various state jurisdictions. All periods since inception are subject to examination by these taxing authorities,\nwhere applicable. The Company is not currently under United States federal or state income tax examinations by tax authorities.\nTax Receivable Agreement Liability\nIn conjunction with the Business Combination, the Company also entered into a TRA with the Seller and Holdings. Pursuant to the TRA, the Company is required to pay the\nSeller 85% of the amount of savings, if any, in United States federal, state, local and foreign income tax that the Company actually realizes as a result of (a) tax basis\nadjustments resulting from taxable exchanges of Class B common units of Holdings and Class V common stock of the Company acquired by the Company in exchange for\nClass A common stock of the Company and (a) tax deductions in respect of portions of certain payments made under the TRA. All such payments to the Seller are the\nobligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2023, there have been 383,898 shares of Class B common units of Holdings and Class V common stock of the Company\nexchanged for Class A common stock of the Company.\nThe estimation of liability under the TRA is by its nature imprecise and subject to significant assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future taxable income. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as the realizability of the tax benefit is not at the more\nlikely than not threshold. Since the benefit has not been recorded, the Company has determined that the TRA liability is not probable and therefore no TRA liability existed\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nNote 12 - Shareholders’ Equity\nThe Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (“Charter”) authorizes the issuance of 425,000,000 shares, of which 400,000,000 shares are Class A\ncommon stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 15,000,000 shares of Class V common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value\n$0.0001 per share. The Reverse Stock Split reduced the number of authorized shares of Class V common stock from 200,000,000 to 15,000,000 while the number of\nauthorized shares of Class A common stock and the par value for both Class A and Class V common stock remained unchanged.\n76\nWarrants\nPublic Warrants\nThe Company has outstanding 10,997,500 warrants convertible into 733,166 shares of Class A common stock that were issued prior to the Business Combination, of which\n10,800,000 convertible into 720,000 shares of Class A common stock are referred to as public warrants and 197,500 convertible into 13,166 shares of Class A common stock\nare Private Warrants. Each warrant represents the right to purchase 1/15th of a share of the Company’s Class A common stock at a price of $172.50 per whole share. The\nwarrants expire on July 20, 2026.\nThe Company may call the public warrants for redemption (but not the Private Warrants), in whole and not in part, at a price of $.01 per Public Warrant:\n•at any time while the Public Warrants are exercisable,\n•upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each public warrant holder,\n•if, and only if, the reported last sale price of shares of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $270.00 per share, for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day\nperiod ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to public warrant holders, and\n•if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to shares of Class A common stock underlying such public warrants at the time of\nredemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption.\nThe right to exercise will be forfeited unless the warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption.\nPrivate Warrants\nThe Company has agreed that so long as the Private Warrants are still held by its initial shareholders or their affiliates, it will not redeem such Private Warrants and will allow\nthe holders to exercise such Private Warrants on a cashless basis (even if a registration statement covering shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such\nwarrants is not effective). As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 there were 197,500 Private Warrants outstanding.\nPre-Funded Warrants\nOn September 15, 2021, the Company entered into a Share Repurchase Agreement with various entities (collectively, the “Investors”) whereby the Company repurchased an\naggregate of 53,333 shares of Class A common stock (the “Repurchase Shares”) from the Investors. The purchase price for the Repurchase Shares was the issuance of an\naggregate of 53,333 pre-funded warrants to acquire an equal number of shares of Class A common stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”). During May 2022, the Pre-Funded\nWarrants were exercised in full.\nOn January 6, 2022, the Company sold 166,462 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, and, in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 519,812\nshares of common stock and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 686,274 shares of common stock (the “January 2022 Offering”). The common stock and warrants were\nsold at a combined purchase price of $51.00 per share (less $0.0001 per share for pre-funded warrants). Each warrant has an exercise price per share of common stock equal\nto $54.00 and will expire five years from the date of issuance and may be exercised on a cashless basis if a registration statement registering the shares issuable upon exercise\nis not effective. The Company received gross proceeds from the offering of approximately $35 million before deducting estimated offering expenses. As of December 31,\n2022, the pre-funded warrants issued in the January 2022 Offering were exercised in full on a cashless basis.\n77\nApril 2023 Warrants\nOn April 19, 2023, the Company issued certain lenders warrants (the “April 2023 Warrants”) to purchase 1/15th of a share of the Company’s Class A common stock for each\n$0.5134 of principal amount of the Notes, for an aggregate of 7,964,550 warrants convertible to 530,970 shares of Class A common stock. The aggregate amount of the April\n2023 Warrants is inclusive of 2,288,664 warrants convertible to 152,577 shares of Class A common stock associated with related parties. Each warrant is exercisable\nimmediately, has an exercise price per share of Class A common stock equal to $7.701 per whole share and will expire three years and three months from the date of issuance\nand may be exercised on a cashless basis if a registration statement registering the resale of the shares issuable upon exercise is not effective. The exercise price was\nsubsequently reduced to $2.75. See Note 17 for further discussion. The warrant holder will be prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from exercising the Warrants for\nshares of the Company’s Class A common stock to the extent that immediately prior to or after giving effect to such exercise, the warrant holder, together with its affiliates\nand other attribution parties, would own more than 4.99% or 9.99%, as applicable, of the total number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock then issued and\noutstanding, which percentage may be changed at the warrant holders’ election to a higher or lower percentage not in excess of 9.99% upon 61 days’ notice to the Company.\nThe Company agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the shares of Class A common stock underlying the Warrants within 60 days and to have the\nregistration statement declared effective within 30 days thereafter. As of December 31, 2023, there were 7,964,550 April 2023 Warrants outstanding.\nStryve Foods, Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”)\nThe Incentive Plan allows the Company to grant stock options, restricted stock unit awards and other awards at levels determined appropriate by its board of directors and/or\ncompensation committee. The Incentive Plan also allows the Company to use a broad array of equity incentives and performance cash incentives in order to secure and retain\nthe services of its employees, directors and consultants, and to provide long-term incentives that align the interests of its employees, directors and consultants with the\ninterests of its stockholders. The Incentive Plan is administered by the Company’s board of directors or its compensation committee, or any other committee or subcommittee\nor one or more of its officers to whom authority has been delegated (collectively, the “Administrator”). The Administrator has the authority to interpret the Incentive Plan and\naward agreements entered into with respect to the Incentive Plan; to make, change and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Incentive Plan; to make changes to, or\nreconcile any inconsistency in, the Incentive Plan or any award agreement covering an award; and to take any other actions needed to administer the Incentive Plan.\nThe Incentive Plan permits the Administrator to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), performance shares, performance units, shares of Class A common\nstock, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), cash incentive awards, dividend equivalent units, or any other type of award permitted under the Incentive Plan. The\nAdministrator may grant any type of award to any participant it selects, but only employees of the Company or its subsidiaries may receive grants of incentive stock options\nwithin the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Awards may be granted alone or in addition to, in tandem with, or (subject to the repricing prohibition\ndescribed below) in substitution for any other award (or any other award granted under another plan of the Company or any affiliate, including the plan of an acquired entity).\nThe Company has reserved a total of 457,664 shares of Class A common stock for issuance pursuant to the Incentive Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under\nthe Incentive Plan will be reduced on the date of the grant of any award by the maximum number of shares, if any, with respect to which such award is granted. However, an\naward that may be settled solely in cash will not deplete the Incentive Plan’s share reserve at the time the award is granted. If (a) an award expires, is canceled, or terminates\nwithout issuance of shares or is settled in cash, (b) the Administrator determines that the shares granted under an award will not be issuable because the conditions for issuance\nwill not be satisfied, (c) shares are forfeited under an award, (d) shares are issued under any award and the Company reacquires them pursuant to its reserved rights upon the\nissuance of the shares, (e) shares are tendered or withheld in payment of the exercise price of an option or as a result of the net settlement of outstanding stock appreciation\nrights or (f) shares are tendered or withheld to satisfy federal, state or local tax withholding obligations, then those shares are added back to the reserve and may again be used\nfor new awards under the Incentive Plan. However, shares added back to the reserve pursuant to clauses (d), (e) or (f) in the preceding sentence may not be issued pursuant to\nincentive stock options.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had 114,706 shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the Incentive Plan.\n78\nNote 13 - Stock Based Compensation\nThe Company's stock-based awards that result in compensation expense consist of restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted stock awards (RSAs). As of December 31,\n2023, the Company had 114,706 shares available for grant under its stock plans. As of December 31, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to all unvested\nstock-based compensation awards was $1,911,964 is expected to be recognized over the next four years. RSUs generally vest over three years and RSAs generally vest from\none to four years.\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs)\nThe following table summarizes the Company's RSU activity:\nNonvested Restricted Stock Units\nWeighted Average\nRestricted Stock Award Date Fair Value\nUnits Per Share\nRestricted Stock at January 1, 2023 14,578 $ 48.47\nGranted 189,450 4.90\nForfeited (4,289) 64.62\nVested (6,533) 45.54\nRestricted Stock at December 31, 2023 193,205 $ 5.18\nThe fair value of RSUs is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's stock on the grant date. The fair value of RSUs with a market condition is\ndetermined based on a Monte Carlo valuation simulation using.\nRestricted Stock Awards (RSAs)\nThe following table summarizes the Company's RSA activity:\nNonvested Restricted Stock Awards\nWeighted Average Weighted Average\nRestricted Stock Award Date Fair Value Director Award Date Fair Value\nAwards Per Share Stock Awards Per Share\nRestricted Stock at January 1, 2023 42,200 $ 27.92 7,500 $ 12.45\nGranted 22,500 3 68,956 5.49\nForfeited — — — —\nVested (11,922) 32.45 (71,456) 6.17\nRestricted Stock at December 31, 2023 52,778 $ 16.09 5,000 $ 12.45\nThe fair value of RSAs is determined based on the closing market price of the Company's stock on the grant date.\nStock Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company has a long-term incentive plan under which the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the authority to grant share-based awards to Company\nemployees and non-employees. Stock based compensation costs associated with employee RSU and RSA grants are recorded as a separate component of salaries and wages\non the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, $710,248 and $835,733, respectively, were recorded in salaries and wages.\nStock based compensation costs associated with non-employee RSU and RSA grants are recorded as a separate component of selling expenses on the consolidated statements\nof operations. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, $445,960 and $215,977, respectively, were recorded in selling expenses. Stock based compensation expense\nfor service-based awards that contain a graded vesting schedule is recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company accounts for forfeitures when they occur.\n79\nNote 14 - Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company follows the guidance in ASC 820, for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period and non-financial\nassets and liabilities that are remeasured and reported at fair value at lease annually.\nThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale\nof the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with\nmeasuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to\nclassify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted), for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted\nprices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from\nvaluation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. In some circumstances, the inputs used to\nmeasure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in\nits entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nNote 15 - Related Party Transactions\nSale and Leaseback\nOn May 26, 2021, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with OK Biltong Facility, LLC (“Buyer”), an entity controlled by a member of the Company’s\nboard of directors, pursuant to which the parties consummated a sale and leaseback transaction (the “Sale and Leaseback Transaction”) of the Company’s manufacturing\nfacility and the surrounding property in Madill, Oklahoma (the “Real Property”) for a total purchase price of $7,500,000.\nIn connection with the consummation of the Sale and Leaseback Transaction, the Company entered into a lease agreement (the “Lease Agreement”) with Buyer pursuant to\nwhich the Company leased back the Real Property from Buyer for an initial term of twelve (12) years unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with the terms of\nthe Lease Agreement. Under the Lease Agreement, the Company’s financial obligations include base rent of approximately $60,000 per month, which rent will increase on an\nannual basis at two percent (2%) over the initial term and two-and-a-half percent (2.5%) during any extension term. The Company is also responsible for all monthly expenses\nrelated to the leased facility, including insurance premiums, taxes and other expenses, such as utilities. Under the Lease Agreement, the Company has three (3) options to\nextend the term of the lease by five (5) years for each such option and a one-time right and option to purchase the Real Property at a price that escalates over time and, if Buyer\ndecides to sell the Real Property, the Company has a right of first refusal to purchase the Real Property on the same terms offered to any third party.\nThe Company determined that the sale and leaseback transaction contained continuing involvement and thus used the financing method consistent with ASC 842. The\ntransfer did not qualify as a sale, hence it is considered a \"failed\" sale and both parties account for it as a financing transaction. Accordingly, a financing obligation related to\nthe operating lease in the amount of the sale price ($7,500,000) has been booked and the corresponding assets on the balance sheet are maintained. Under the finance method,\nrental payments are applied as amortization and/or interest expense on the financing obligation as appropriate using an assumed interest rate. The Company is accounting for\nthese as interest only payments because the Company's incremental cost to borrow when applied to the financing obligation is greater than the rental payments under the Lease\nAgreement. The Company recognized interest expense of $741,715 and $727,171 during the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n80\nPromissory Notes\nOn April 19, 2023, the Company issued an aggregate of $1,175,000 in Notes to related parties. See Note 10 for a description of the Notes and Note 12 for further discussion\non the warrants issued in connection with the Notes. The balance owed to related parties was $1,273,893 inclusive of $98,893 of accrued interest as of December 31, 2023.\nOther\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company purchased approximately $1,007 and $143,420, respectively, in goods from an entity controlled by a\nmember of the Company’s Board of Directors (the \"Related Party Manufacturer\"). The balance owed to the Related Party Manufacturer as of December 31, 2023 and 2022\nwas $807 and $0, respectively.\nThe Company previously had note receivables due from certain directors, officers and employees of the Company. The note receivables and the accrued interest was forgiven\nin connection with the Business Combination on July 20, 2021. The forgiveness of these note receivables resulted in non-cash compensation expense to the related parties for\nthe year ended December 31, 2021. The Company agreed to reimburse the related parties for their portion of income taxes related to the non-cash compensation. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the balance owed to the related parties was $278,771 and $632,946, respectively.\nIn connection with the PSA, a named executive officer of the Company granted the Lender a security interest in certain personal property owned by the named executive\nofficer to further secure the Company's obligations under the PSA. See further discussion at Note 9. As consideration for granting the security interest to the Lender, the\nCompany agreed to pay the name executive officer a fee of $100,000 and reimbursement of out of pocket expenses. The balance owed to the name executive officer as of\nDecember 31, 2023 is $100,000.\nNote 16 - Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Leases\nThe Company held three lease agreements for office and warehouse space in Texas as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s lease contracts have remaining terms ranging\nfrom 3 years to 11 years, some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years. During 2023, the Company subleased the office and former warehouse\nspace.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid $908,863 and $279,883, respectively, for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities. Rent\nexpense under the leases was $1,118,564, and $406,817, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Rent expense is net of sublease income of $280,120\nand $0 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOther Balance Sheet information related to operating leases as of December 31 was as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nOperating leases, Right-of-use assets, net $ 4,609,666 $ 5,009,954\nWeighted average remaining lease term, in years 10 11\nWeighted Average Discount Rate 13% 13%\nThe following table presents the balance of Operating lease obligations:\n362,165 327,915\nOperating lease liabilities (current) $ $\nOperating lease liabilities (long-term) $ 4,371,963 $ 4,734,128\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 4,734,128 $ 5,062,043\n81\nFuture minimum payments and sublease rental income required under the lease agreements as of December 31, 2023 follows:\nYear Ended December 31, Operating Lease Payments Sublease Rental Income\n2024 $ 930,990 $ 268,960\n2025 814,170 50,661\n2026 744,099 —\n2027 731,627 —\n2028 749,274 —\nThereafter 4,807,543 —\nTotal $ 8,777,703 $ 319,621\nLess: Imputed interest (4,043,575)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 4,734,128\nLitigation\nThe Company may be a party to routine claims brought against it in the ordinary course of business. After consulting with legal counsel, the Company does not believe that\nthe outcome of any such pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, as is inherent in legal\nproceedings, there is a risk that an unpredictable decision adverse to the Company could be reached. The Company records legal costs associated with loss contingencies as\nincurred. Settlements are accrued when, and if, they become probable and estimable.\nRegistration Rights Agreements\nThe Company is a party to various registration rights agreements with certain stockholders where it may be required to register securities for such stockholders in certain\ncircumstances.\nNote 17 - Subsequent Events\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to the date that the consolidated financial statements were issued.\nBased upon this review, other than as described below, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the\nconsolidated financial statements.\nAmendment to Promissory Notes\nDuring January 2024, the secured promissory notes (the “Notes”), discussed further at Note 10, were amended to extend the maturity date of the Notes from December 31,\n2023 to the earlier of (i) December 31, 2024, or (ii) the closing of the next sale or series of related sales by the Company of its equity securities from which the Company\nreceives gross proceeds of not less than $3.0 million, excluding proceeds from the warrants held by the Lenders and the Company’s existing at the market equity facility with\nCraig-Hallum Capital Group LLC. As consideration for the Final Lender’s entry into the Amendment, the Company (i) reduced the exercise price on the outstanding warrants\nissued to the lenders in April 2023 from $7.701 per split-adjusted share to $2.75 per split-adjusted share and (ii) agreed to issue shares of Class A common stock as payment\nin full for interest accrued on the Notes held through December 31, 2023 (at a value of $2.75 per share). The Company issued an aggregate of 53,559 shares of Class A\ncommon stock (at a value of $2.75 per share) to certain electing lenders as payment in full for interest accrued through December 31, 2023 on the Notes held by the lenders.\nThe value of the accrued interest satisfied by the payment of 53,559 shares of Class A common stock to the electing lenders was $147,288.\nAmendment to Invoice Purchase and Security Agreement\nDuring March 2024, the PSA, discussed further at Note 9, was amended to extend the initial term twenty four (24) months after the date of the amendment, followed by\nautomatic annual renewal terms unless the subsidiaries or the Lender provide written notice pursuant to the PSA prior to the end of any term.\nTermination of At the Market Offering Agreement\nDuring March 2024, the Company provided notice to Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC that it was terminating the At the Market Offering Agreement dated June 30, 2023\nbetween the Company and Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC.\n82\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to\nbe disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC’s\nrules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation\nof our current Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our “Certifying Officers”), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31,\n2023, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of\ndisclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent\nlimitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control\ndeficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and\nthere can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).\nManagement conducted an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

The following contains a description of our Class A Common Stock and Warrants, as well as certain related\nadditional information. This description is a summary only and does not purport to be complete. We encourage you to read the complete text of the Company’s amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation (our “Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation”) and bylaws, which we have incorporated by reference as exhibits to the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. References to “we,” “our” and “us” refer to the Company, unless the context otherwise requires.\nAuthorized and Outstanding Stock\nThe Charter authorizes the issuance of 425,000,000 shares, of which 400,000,000 shares are shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share,\n15,000,000 shares are shares of Class V Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares are shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share.\nAs of March 25, 2024, the Company had issued and outstanding:\n● 2,784,151 shares of Class A Common Stock;\n● 382,892 shares of Class V Common Stock;\n● 10,997,500 Warrants to purchase 1/15th of a share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $172.50 per share;\n● 10,294,118 warrants to purchase 1/15th of a share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $54.00 per share; and\nCommon Stock\nVoting. Pursuant to Charter, holders of Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to the\nstockholders for their vote or approval, except as required by applicable law. Holders of Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share\non all matters submitted to the stockholders for their vote or approval. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to\nvote.\nDividends. The holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends, as and if declared by the Company’s Board out of legally available funds. The\nholders of Class V Common Stock will not have any right to receive dividends.\nLiquidation Rights. Upon the Company’s liquidation or dissolution, the holders of all classes of common stock are entitled to their respective par value, and the\nholders of Class A Common Stock will then be entitled to share ratably in those of the Company’s assets that are legally available for distribution to stockholders after payment\nof liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any holders of preferred stock then outstanding. Other than their par value, the holders of Class V Common Stock will not have\nany right to receive a distribution upon a liquidation or dissolution of the Company.\nConversion, Transferability and Exchange. Subject to the terms of the Amended Holdings Operating Agreement and the Exchange Agreements, the members of\nHoldings (other than the Company) may from time to time tender shares of Class V Common Stock (together with an equal number of Class B Common Units) for an equal\nnumber of shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Agreements. The Company may not issue Class V Common Stock such that after the issuance the holder\nof such stock does not hold an identical number of Class B Common Units. The Class A Common Stock has no conversion or exchange rights.\nOther Provisions. None of the Class A Common Stock or Class V Common Stock has any pre-emptive or other subscription rights.\nPreferred Stock\nThe Company is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares will be shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The Company’s Board is authorized,\nsubject to limitations prescribed by DGCL and the Charter, to determine the terms and conditions of the preferred stock, including whether the shares of preferred stock will be\nissued in one or more series, the number of shares to be included in each series and the powers (including the voting power), designations, preferences and rights of the shares.\nThe Company’s Board also is authorized to designate any qualifications, limitations or restrictions on the shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The\nissuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of\nthe holders of Class A Common Stock and Class V Common Stock,\nwhich could have a negative impact on the market price of the Class A Common Stock. The Company has no current plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nWarrants\nWe have outstanding 10,997,500 Warrants outstanding that represent the right to purchase an equal number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock.\nEach redeemable Warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase 1/15th of a share of Class A Common Stock at a price of $172.50, subject to adjustment as discussed below,\nat any time commencing on or after July 20, 2021. However, except as set forth below, no Warrants will be exercisable for cash unless we have an effective and current\nregistration statement covering the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is not effective, warrant holders may, until such\ntime as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise Warrants on a\ncashless basis pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act provided that such exemption is available. If an exemption from\nregistration is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their Warrants on a cashless basis. The Warrants will expire on July 20, 2026 at 5:00 p.m., New York City time.\nWe may call the Warrants for redemption (excluding the Private Warrants), in whole and not in part, at a price of $.01 per Warrant:\n● at any time while the Warrants are exercisable,\n● upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption to each Warrant holder,\n● if, and only if, the reported last sale price of shares of Class A Common Stock equals or exceeds $270.00 per share, for any 20 trading days within a 30\ntrading day period ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders, and\n● if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to shares of Class A Common Stock underlying such Warrants at the time of\nredemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption.\nThe right to exercise will be forfeited unless the Warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. On and after the redemption date, a\nrecord holder of a Warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price for such holder’s Warrant upon surrender of such Warrant.\nThe redemption criteria for our Warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide Warrant holders a reasonable premium to the initial exercise\nprice and provide a sufficient differential between the then-prevailing share price and the Warrant exercise price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption\ncall, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below the exercise price of the Warrants.\nIf we call the Warrants for redemption as described above, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise Warrants to do so on a\n“cashless basis.” In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the Warrants for that number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the quotient\nobtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the\nWarrants and the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. For this purpose, “fair market value” shall mean the volume weighted average price of shares\nof Class A Common Stock for the 20 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of Warrants. Whether\nwe will exercise our option to require all holders to exercise their Warrants on a “cashless basis” will depend on a variety of factors including the price of shares of Class A\nCommon Stock at the time the Warrants are called for redemption, our cash needs at such time and concerns regarding dilutive share issuances.\nThe Warrants were issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Warrant Agent, and us. The\nWarrant agreement provides that the terms of the Warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but\nrequires the approval, by written consent or vote, of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Warrants in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of\nthe registered holders.\nThe exercise price and number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable on exercise of the Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the\nevent of a share dividend, extraordinary dividend or our recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation.\nThe Warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the Warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the Warrant Agent, with the exercise\nform on the reverse side of the Warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied\nby full payment of the exercise price, by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of Warrants being exercised. The Warrant holders do not have the rights\nor privileges of holders of shares of Class A Common Stock and any voting rights until they exercise their Warrants and receive shares of Class A Common Stock. After the\nissuance of shares of Class A Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on\nby shareholders.\nExcept as described above, no Warrants will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue shares of Class A Common Stock unless at the time a holder seeks\nto exercise such Warrant, a prospectus relating to shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants is current and shares of Class A Common Stock\nhave been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the Warrants. Under the terms of the Warrant\nagreement, we have agreed to use its best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current prospectus relating to shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon\nexercise of the Warrants until the expiration of the Warrants. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so and, if we do not maintain a current prospectus\nrelating to shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, holders will be unable to exercise their Warrants and we will not be required to settle any\nsuch Warrant exercise. If the prospectus relating to shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants is not current or if shares of Class A Common\nStock are not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the Warrants reside, we will not be required to net cash settle or cash settle the\nWarrant exercise, the Warrants may have no value, the market for the Warrants may be limited and the Warrants may expire worthless.\nWarrant holders may elect to be subject to a restriction on the exercise of their Warrants such that an electing Warrant holder (and his, her or its affiliates) would not\nbe able to exercise their Warrants to the extent that, after giving effect to such exercise, such holder (and his, her or its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% of\nshares of Class A Common Stock outstanding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any person who acquires a Warrant with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the\ncontrol of us, or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect, immediately upon such acquisition will be deemed to be the beneficial\nowner of the underlying Ordinary Shares and not be able to take advantage of this provision.\nNo fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the Warrants. If, upon exercise of the Warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a\nshare (as a result of a subsequent share dividend payable in shares of Class A Common Stock, or by a split up of shares of Class A Common Stock or other similar event), we\nwill, upon exercise, round up or down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of Class A Common Stock to be issued to the Warrant holder.\nPrivate Warrants\nWe have agreed that so long as the Private Warrants are still held by our initial shareholders or their affiliates, we will not redeem such Warrants and will allow the\nholders to exercise such Warrants on a cashless basis (even if a registration statement covering shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Warrants is not\neffective). However, once any of the Private Warrants are transferred from the initial purchasers or their affiliates, these arrangements will no longer apply. Additionally, Cowen\nhas agreed that it will not be permitted to exercise any Warrants underlying the purchase option issued to it and/or its designees upon consummation of the IPO after the five\nyear anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement for our IPO. Furthermore, because the Private Warrants were issued in a private transaction, the holders and\ntheir transferees will be allowed to exercise such Warrants for cash even if a registration statement covering shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such\nWarrants is not effective and receive unregistered shares of Class A Common Stock. As of March 25, 2024, 197,500 of the total 10,997,500 Warrants outstanding were Private\nWarrants.\nExclusive Forum\nThe Charter provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of\nChancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a\nclaim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to the Company or the Company’s stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a\nclaim against the Company, its directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or the Charter or the Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim\nagainst the Company, its directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal\njurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein.\nThis exclusive forum provision will not apply to claims under the Exchange Act, but will apply to other state and federal law claims including actions arising under\nthe Securities Act. Section 22 of the Securities Act, however, creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability\ncreated by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a forum selection provision as\nwritten in connection with claims arising under the Securities Act.\n\nExhibit 10.18\nSECOND AMENDMENT TO INVOICE PURCHASE AND SECURITY AGREEMENT\nThis amendment to the Invoice Purchase and Security Agreement (“Second Amendment”) is made and entered into this 26thday of March 2024 (the “Second\nAmendment Date”), by and among Stryve Foods, LLC dba Stryve Biltong, Vacadillos, Stryve Foods Company, B.

All recitals as stated above are incorporated and made a part of this First Amendment as if fully rewritten and restated at length\nherein.\n2.Capitalized Terms. All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have those meanings ascribed to them in the Note.\n3.Amendment to Maturity of the Note. The last sentence of the first paragraph on the Note is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced as follows: “The unpaid\nprincipal amount of this Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date.

Within five business days of the receipt of such notice, the Lender\nshall notify the Borrower in writing whether or not Lender desires to further amend the Note to incorporate the MFN Terms (the “MFN Election”). Upon receipt of the MFN\nElection, the Borrower and the Lender shall promptly execute an amendment to the Note incorporating the MFN Terms.

This First Amendment may not be orally changed or terminated, nor any of its provisions waived, except by an agreement in writing signed by the party\nagainst whom enforcement of any changes, termination or waiver is sought. Borrower hereby represents and warrants to Lender that it has full right, power and authority to\nenter into this First Amendment and that the person executing this First Amendment on behalf of Borrower is duly authorized to do so. In the event of any inconsistency\nbetween the terms and provisions of the Note and those of this First Amendment, the terms and provisions of this First Amendment shall control.\n{Remainder of Page Intentionally Left Blank; Signature Page to Follow}\n2\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Borrower and Lender have caused this First Amendment to be made, executed and delivered as of the\ndate above first written.\nBORROWER:\nSTRYVE FOODS, LLC,\nBy: Stryve Foods, Inc., its managing member\nBy:\nName: R. Alex Hawkins\nTitle: Chief Financial Officer\nLENDER:\n[●]\nBy:\nName:\nTitle:\nAdjusted Warrant Shares:\n3\n\nExhibit 19.1\nINSIDER TRADING POLICY\nThis Insider Trading Policy (the “Policy”) describes the standards of Stryve Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) with respect to trading, and causing the trading of,\nthe Company’s securities or securities of certain other publicly traded companies while in possession of confidential information about the Company and the companies with\nwhich the Company does business The Company’s Board of Directors has adopted this Policy to promote compliance with federal and state securities laws that prohibit certain\npersons who are aware of material, non-public information about a company from: (i) trading in securities of that company; or (ii) providing material, non-public information to\nother persons who may trade on the basis of that information.\nThis Policy is divided into two parts: Part I describes the Company’s prohibition on the unauthorized disclosure of material, non-public information, or the misuse of such\ninformation in trading and applies to all directors, officers and employees of the Company and their respective Family Members and Controlled Entities (each such term as\ndefined below); and Part II imposes special additional trading restrictions and applies to all Directors, Officers of the Company, and certain other employees that the\nCompany may designate from time to time as “Covered Persons” because of their position, responsibilities or their actual or potential access to material information, non-\npublic information.\nPART I\nWHAT IS INSIDER TRADING?\nOne of the principal purposes of the federal securities laws is to prohibit so-called “insider trading.” Simply stated, insider trading occurs when a person uses material nonpublic\ninformation obtained through involvement with the Company to make decisions to purchase, sell, give away or otherwise trade the Company’s securities or to provide that\ninformation to others outside the Company. The prohibitions against insider trading apply to trades, tips and recommendations by virtually any person, including all persons\nassociated with the Company, if the information involved is “material” and “nonpublic.” These terms are defined in this Policy under Part I below. The prohibitions would\napply to any director, officer or employee who buys or sells Company stock on the basis of material nonpublic information that he or she obtained about the Company, its\ncustomers, suppliers, or other companies with which the Company has contractual relationships or may be negotiating transactions.\nWHO DOES THIS APPLY TO?\nThis Policy applies to all trading or other transactions in the Company’s securities, including common stock, options and any other securities that the Company may issue, such\nas preferred stock, notes, bonds and convertible securities, as well as to derivative securities relating to any of the Company’s securities, whether or not issued by the Company.\nThis Policy applies to all employees of the Company, all officers of the Company and all members of the Company’s board of directors. This Policy also applies to:\n•family members who reside with any director, officer or employee of the Company, anyone else who lives in a director, officer or employee’s household, and any family\nmembers who do not live in an employee, officer or director’s household but whose transactions in Company Securities are directed by such employee, officer or director\nor are subject to their influence or control, such as parents or children who consult with such employee, officer or director before they trade in Company Securities\n(collectively, “Family Members”); and\n•any entities that an employee, officer or director influences or controls, including any corporations, partnerships or trusts (collectively referred to as “Controlled\nEntities”).\nWHAT IS PROHIBITED ACTIVITY?\na.No director, officer, employee or any of their respective Family Members or Controlled Entities may purchase or sell, or offer to purchase or sell, any Company\nsecurity, whether or not issued by\nthe Company, while in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company. (The terms “material” and “nonpublic” are defined below.)\nb.No director, officer, employee or any of their respective Family Members or Controlled Entities who knows of any material nonpublic information about the\nCompany may communicate that information to (“tip”) any other person or otherwise disclose such information without the Company’s authorization.\nc.No director, officer, employee or any of their respective Family Members or Controlled Entities may purchase or sell any security of any other company,\nwhether or not issued by the Company, while in possession of material nonpublic information about that company that was obtained in the course of his or her\ninvolvement with the Company. No director, officer, employee or any of their respective Family Members or Controlled Entities who knows of any such material\nnonpublic information may communicate that information to, or tip, any other person or otherwise disclose such information without the Company’s\nauthorization.\nd.For compliance purposes, you should never trade, tip or recommend securities (or otherwise cause the purchase or sale of securities) while in possession of\ninformation that you have reason to believe is material and nonpublic unless you first consult with, and obtain the advance approval of, the Compliance Officer\n(which is defined below).\ne.Covered Persons must “pre-clear” all trading in securities of the Company in accordance with the procedures set forth in Part II, Section 1 below.\nWHAT IS MATERIAL AND NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION?\nDefinition of “Material” Information.\nInsider trading restrictions come into play only if the information you possess is “material.” Materiality, however, involves a relatively low threshold. Information is generally\nregarded as “material” if it has market significance, that is, if its public dissemination is likely to affect the market price of securities, or if it otherwise is information that a\nreasonable investor would want to know before making a decision to buy, hold or sell securities\nThere is no bright line test for determining whether information is material. Such determination is based on the facts and circumstances in each situation. In general,\ninformation dealing with the following subjects is reasonably likely to be found material in particular situations:\n•Information regarding the Company’s earnings or results of operations;\n•Projections of future earnings or losses or other earnings guidance, or changes in projections or guidance\n•significant changes in the Company’s prospects;\n•significant write-downs in assets or increases in reserves;\n•developments regarding significant litigation or government agency investigations;\n•liquidity problems;\n•changes in earnings estimates or unusual gains or losses in major operations;\n•major changes in the Company’s management or the board of directors;\n•changes in dividends;\n•extraordinary borrowings;\n•major changes in accounting methods or policies;\n•award or loss of a significant contract;\n•cybersecurity risks and incidents, including vulnerabilities and breaches;\n•changes in debt ratings;\n•changes in relationships with major customers, including obtaining or losing customers;\n•important product developments or discoveries;\n•proposals, plans or agreements, even if preliminary in nature, involving mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, recapitalizations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements,\nor purchases or sales of substantial assets; and\n•offerings of Company securities.\nMaterial information is not limited to historical facts but may also include projections and forecasts. With respect to a future event, such as a merger, acquisition or introduction\nof a new product, the point at which negotiations or product development are determined to be material is determined by balancing the probability that the event will occur\nagainst the magnitude of the effect the event would have on a company’s operations or stock price should it occur. Thus, information concerning an event that would have a\nlarge effect on stock price, such as a merger, may be material even if the possibility that the event will occur is relatively small. When in doubt about whether particular\nnonpublic information is material, you should presume it is material.\nIf you are unsure whether information is material, you should either consult the Compliance Officer before making any decision to disclose such information (other\nthan to persons who need to know it) or to trade in or recommend securities to which that information relates or assume that the information is material.\nDefinition of “Nonpublic” Information\nInsider trading prohibitions come into play only when you possess information that is material and “nonpublic.” The fact that information has been disclosed to a few members\nof the public does not make it public for insider trading purposes. To be “public” the information must have been disseminated through recognized channels of distribution to\nreach the securities marketplace such as disclosure through the filing of a report with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), disclosure by release to a national\nbusiness and financial wire service (such as PR News, Dow Jones or Reuters) or a national newspaper (such as The Wall Street Journal).. Even after public disclosure of\ninformation about the Company, you must wait until the close of business on the second trading day after the information was publicly disclosed before you can treat the\ninformation as public. Nonpublic information may include:\n•information available to a select group of analysts or brokers or institutional investors;\n•undisclosed facts that are the subject of rumors, even if the rumors are widely circulated; and\n•information that has been entrusted to the Company on a confidential basis until a public announcement of the information has been made and enough time has elapsed\nfor the market to respond to a public announcement of the information (normally two trading days).\nAs with questions of materiality, if you are not sure whether information is considered public, you should either consult with the Compliance Officer or assume that\nthe information is nonpublic and treat it as confidential.\nARE THERE EXCEPTIONS?\nThe trading restrictions of this Policy do not apply to the following:\ni.401(k) Plan. Investing 401(k) plan contributions in a Company stock fund in accordance with the terms of the Company’s 401(k) plan. However, any\nchanges in your investment election regarding the Company’s stock are subject to trading restrictions under this Policy.\nii.Stock Option Exercises. This Policy does not apply to the exercise of an employee stock option acquired pursuant to the Company’s equity incentive\nplans or to the exercise of a share withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares of stock to satisfy tax withholding\nrequirements or the exercise price for the option. This Policy does apply, however, to any sale of stock as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an\noption or any other market sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay tax withholding amounts or exercise price of an option or otherwise.\niii.Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Awards. This Policy does not apply to the vesting or restricted stock or restricted stock units, or the\nexercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which you elect to have the Company withhold shares of stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements\nupon the vesting of any restricted stock or restricted stock units. This Policy does apply, however, to any market sale of restricted stock that has vested or\nshares received in settlement of restricted stock units.\niv.Transactions Not Involving a Purchase or Sale. Bona fide gifts are not transactions subject to this Policy unless you are delivering Company\nsecurities to discharge a legally binding commitment (although if you are a Covered Person, then you must follow the pre-clearance procedures below in\nconnection with any gifts). Further, transactions in mutual funds, most exchange traded funds, index funds or similar funds that are invested in Company\nsecurities are not transactions subject to this Policy.\nCONSEQUENCES FOR VIOLATIONS OF INSIDER TRADING.\nPenalties for trading on or communicating material nonpublic information can be severe, both for individuals involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers and\nsupervisors, and may include jail terms, criminal fines, civil penalties and civil enforcement injunctions. Given the severity of the potential penalties, compliance with this\nPolicy is absolutely mandatory.\na)For Individuals. A person who violates insider trading laws by trading when he or she has material nonpublic information (or tip such information to others) can be\nsentenced to:\n•A civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided;\n•A criminal fine of up to $5M;\n• A jail term of up to 20 years; and\n• A cease and desist order to stop the violation and penalties for violations of such orders or the federal securities laws.\nThe SEC can also seek substantial civil penalties from any person who, at the time of an insider trading violation, “directly or indirectly controlled the person who committed\nsuch violation,” which would apply to the Company and/or management and supervisory personnel. These control persons may be held liable for up to the greater of $1 million\nor three times the amount of the profits gained or losses avoided. Even for violations that result in a small or no profit, the SEC can seek penalties from a company and/or its\nmanagement and supervisory personnel as control persons.\nb)For a Company (as well as possibly any supervisory person) that fails to take appropriate steps to prevent illegal trading by an employee, or tipping of inside\ninformation by an employee, may be subject to:\n•A civil penalty of the greater of $1M or three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the employee’s violation; and\n•A criminal penalty of up to $25 million.\nEmployees who violate this Policy may be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, including dismissal for cause.\nPOST TERMINATION TRANSACTIONS\nThis policy continues to apply to transactions in the Company’s securities after termination of service to the Company. If an individual is in possession of material nonpublic\ninformation at the time service with the Company terminates, that individual may not trade in the Company’s securities until any such material nonpublic information has\nbecome public or is no longer material and/or the Company’s trading window has opened.\nPART II\nADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AND PROCEDURES\nThe Company has established additional procedures in order to assist it in the administration of this Policy, to facilitate compliance with laws prohibiting insider trading while in\npossession of material, non-public information and to avoid the appearance of any impropriety. These procedures are applicable only to those individuals listed below:\n1.Pre-Clearance of All Trades\nDirectors, officers and any employee who, by virtue of their position: (i) is designated by the Board of Directors as a Section 16 filer; (ii) regularly has access or generates\nmaterial, non-public information concerning the Company; (iii) are designated members of the corporate administrative group; or (iv) designated members of the corporate\naccounting group (each a “Covered Person”), are prohibited from trading in the Company’s securities at all times, even during periods that are not “blackout periods” (as\ndescribed below), without first contacting the Company’s Legal Department and receiving written approval pursuant to this Policy. This restriction also applies to transactions\nby a Covered Person’s spouse, domestic partner and any other persons living in a Covered Person’s household as well as to transactions by entities controlled by a Covered\nPerson. Trade pre-clearance requests must be submitted and approved by the Chief Compliance Officer using the attached form. (See, Attachment A: Request for Approval to\nTrade.)\nUsing the attached form, the General Counsel & Chief Compliance Officer must receive prior written approval from the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.\nIf a Covered Person has any questions, concerns or is otherwise uncertain about anything in this pre-clearance process, the Covered Person is directed to talk to the Company’s\nChief Compliance Officer. The Chief Executive Officer, the General Counsel & Chief Compliance Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer are under no obligation to approve a\nstock trade.\nPre-clearance is not required for purchases and sales of securities under an Approved 10b5-1 Plan. With respect to any purchase or sale under an Approved 10b5-1 Plan, the\nthird-party effecting transactions on behalf of the Company Insider should be instructed to send duplicate confirmations of all such transactions to the Compliance Officer.\nEVEN IF A COVERED PERSON RECEIVES PRE-CLEARANCE AND IT IS DURING A PERMITTED TRADING WINDOW, THE COVERED PERSON,\nINCLUDING ANY COMPANY, TRUST OR ENTITY CONTROLLED BY THE COVERED PERSON, THEIR SPOUSE, THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS OR\nOTHERS LIVING IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD, MAY NOT TRADE IN SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY OR A COVERED ENTITY IF THE COVERED\nPERSON IS IN POSSESSION OR AWARE OF MATERIAL, NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY OR ABOUT A COVERED ENTITY.\n2. Blackout Periods\nAll Covered Persons are prohibited from trading in the Company’s securities during blackout periods as defined below.\na)Quarterly Blackout Periods. Trading in the Company’s securities is prohibited during the period beginning at the close of the market on the date that is two weeks\nbefore the end of each fiscal quarter and ending at the close of business on the second trading day following the date the Company’s financial results are publicly\ndisclosed. During these periods, Covered Persons generally possess or are presumed to possess material nonpublic information about the Company’s financial results.\nb)Other Blackout Periods. From time to time, other types of material nonpublic information regarding the Company (such as negotiation of mergers, acquisitions or\ndispositions, investigation and assessment of cybersecurity incidents or new product developments) may be pending and not be publicly disclosed. While such material\nnonpublic information is pending, the Company may impose special blackout periods during which Covered Persons are prohibited from trading in the Company’s\nsecurities. If the Company imposes a special blackout period, it will notify the Covered Persons affected.\nc)Exceptions. These trading restrictions do not apply to transactions under a pre-existing written plan, contract, instruction, or arrangement under Rule 10b5-1 under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (an “Approved 10b5-1 Plan”) that:\na. has been reviewed and approved by the Compliance Officer and entered into in advance of any sale by at least the later of (1) 90 days after the adoption of the\nplan or (2) two business days following the disclosure of the Company’s financial results in a Form 10-Q or Form 10-K (relating to the\nfiscal quarter in which the plan was adopted, subject to a maximum cooling-off period of 120 days after adoption of the plan;\nb.was entered into in good faith by the Covered Person at a time when the Covered Person was not in possession of material nonpublic information about the\nCompany; and\nc. gives a third party the discretionary authority to execute such purchases and sales, outside the control of the Covered Person, so long as such third party does\nnot possess any material nonpublic information about the Company; or explicitly specifies the security or securities to be purchased or sold, the number of shares,\nthe prices and/or dates of transactions, or other formula(s) describing such transactions.\n3.Trading Window. Covered Persons are permitted to trade in the Company’s securities when no blackout period is in effect. However, even during this\ntrading window, a Covered Person who is in possession of any material nonpublic information should not trade in the Company’s securities until the\ninformation has been made publicly available or is no longer material. In addition, the Company may close this trading window if a special blackout period\nunder Part II, Section 1(b) above is imposed and will re-open the trading window once the special blackout period has ended.\n4.Prohibited Transactions\na)Company Insiders are prohibited from trading in the Company’s equity securities during a blackout period imposed under an “individual account” retirement or pension\nplan of the Company, during which at least 50% of the plan participants are unable to purchase, sell or otherwise acquire or transfer an interest in equity securities of the\nCompany, due to a temporary suspension of trading by the Company or the plan fiduciary.\nb)Covered Persons, including any person’s spouse, other persons living in such person’s household and minor children and entities over which such person exercises\ncontrol, are prohibited from engaging in the following transactions in the Company’s securities unless advance approval is obtained from the Compliance Officer:\n(i)Short-term trading. Company Insiders who purchase Company securities may not sell any Company securities of the same class for at least six months\nafter the purchase;\n(ii)Short sales. Company Insiders and Covered Persons may not sell the Company’s securities short;\n(iii) Options trading. Covered Persons may not buy or sell puts or calls or other derivative securities on the Company’s securities;\n(iv)Trading on margin or pledging. Covered Persons may not hold Company securities in a margin account or pledge Company securities as collateral for a\nloan; and\n(v)Hedging. Covered Persons may not enter into hedging or monetization transactions or similar arrangements with respect to Company securities.\nCOMPLIANCE OFFICER\nThe Company has designated its General Counsel as the individual responsible for administration of this Policy (the “Compliance Officer”).

Alex Hawkins\nChief Financial Officer\n\nExhibit 97.1\nStryve Foods, Inc.\nCompensation Recovery Policy1\n1.Purpose. The purpose of this Compensation Recovery Policy (this “Policy”) is to describe the circumstances under which Stryve Foods, Inc. (the “Company”) is required to or\nshall have the right to recover certain compensation paid to certain employees and independent contractors. Any references in compensation plans, agreements, equity awards\nor other policies to the Company’s “recoupment”, “clawback” or similarly-named policy shall be deemed to refer to this Policy.\n2.Mandatory Recovery of Compensation. In the event that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, the Company shall recover reasonably promptly the\namount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation.\n3.Definitions. For purposes of this Policy, the following terms, when capitalized, shall have the meanings set forth below:\n(a)“Accounting Restatement” shall mean any accounting restatement of the Company’s previously publicly issued financial statements required due to material\nnoncompliance of the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including to correct an error in previously issued financial\nstatements that is material to the previously issued financial statements, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period\nor left uncorrected in the current period.\n(b)“Covered Officer” shall mean:\n(i)for Incentive-Based Compensation, the Company’s president; chief executive officer; chief operating officer; principal financial officer; principal\naccounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller); any vice-president of the Company in charge of a principal business unit,\ndivision, or function (such as sales, administration, or finance); any other officer who performs a significant policy-making function; or any other person\nwho performs similar significant policy-making functions for the Company; and\n(ii)for Time-Based Compensation, one of the Company’s “named executive officers” as defined in Item 402 of Regulation S-K.\n(c)“Effective Date” shall mean the date of adoption of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5608(a).\n(d)“Erroneously Awarded Compensation” shall mean the excess of (i) the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation or Time-Based Compensation Received by a\nperson (A) after beginning service as a Covered Officer, (B) in the case of Incentive-Based Compensation, who served as a Covered Officer at any time during the\nperformance period for that Incentive-Based Compensation, (C) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national\nsecurities association and (D) during the Recovery Period; over (ii) the Recalculated Compensation.\n1 All incentive and time-based awards of compensation should explicitly reference this policy and state that by accepting such award, the individual is deemed to have\nconsented to the terms of the policy, as amended from time to time. Separation agreements should also require the executive reaffirm his or her obligations under this policy,\nand if there is a mutual release of claims (where the company is releasing the executive from all claims), the provisions of this policy should be excepted from the company’s\nrelease.\n(e)“Incentive-Based Compensation” shall mean any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a financial reporting\nmeasure. A financial reporting measure is a measure that is determined and presented in accordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company’s\nfinancial statements, and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from such measures, regardless of whether such measure is presented within the financial\nstatements or included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each of stock price and total shareholder return is a financial reporting measure. For\nthe avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation subject to this Policy does not include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units or similar equity-\nbased awards for which the grant is not contingent upon achieving any financial reporting measure performance goal and vesting is contingent solely upon completion\nof a specified employment period and/or attaining one or more non-financial reporting measures.\n(f)“Recalculated Compensation” shall mean the amount of Incentive-Based Compensation or Time-Based Compensation that otherwise would have been Received\nhad it been determined based on the restated amounts in the Accounting Restatement, computed without regard to any taxes paid. For Time-Based Compensation, and\nfor Incentive-Based Compensation based on stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of the Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to\nmathematical recalculation directly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the amount of the Recalculated Compensation must be based on a reasonable\nestimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the stock price or total shareholder return, as the case may be, on the Incentive Compensation Received. The\nCompany must maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable estimate and provide such documentation to the national securities exchange or\nassociation on which its securities are listed.\n(g)Incentive-Based Compensation is deemed “Received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the financial reporting measure specified in the award of such\nIncentive-Based Compensation is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period. Time-Based\nCompensation is “Received” in the year of payment or settlement.\n(h)“Recovery Period” shall mean the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately preceding the date the Company is required to prepare an Accounting\nRestatement; provided that the Recovery Period shall not begin before the Effective Date. For purposes of determining the Recovery Period, the Company is\nconsidered to be “required to prepare an Accounting Restatement” on the earlier to occur of: (i) the date the Company’s Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the\nCompany’s authorized officers conclude, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is required to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (ii) the date a\ncourt, regulator, or other legally authorized body directs the Company to prepare an Accounting Restatement. If the Company changes its fiscal year, then the\ntransition period within or immediately following such three completed fiscal years also shall be included in the Recovery Period, provided that if the transition period\nbetween the last day of the Company’s prior fiscal year end and the first day of its new fiscal year comprises a period of nine to 12 months, then such transition period\nshall instead be deemed one of the three completed fiscal years and shall not extend the length of the Recovery Period.\n(i)“Time-Based Compensation” shall mean any compensation that is paid pursuant to an equity-based award the amount of which is determined wholly or partially in\nrelation to the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock, that is granted, earned or vests based solely on the passage of time or on the basis of non-\nfinancial reporting measures, and that is not Incentive-Based Compensation.\n4.Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation will not be required to the extent a committee of the\nCompany’s independent directors responsible for executive compensation decisions (or a majority of the independent directors on the Company’s Board of Directors in the\nabsence of such a committee) has made a determination that such recovery would be impracticable and one of the following conditions have been satisfied:\n(a)The direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered; provided that, before concluding that it would be\nimpracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was Incentive-Based Compensation based on the expense of enforcement, the\nCompany must make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that\ndocumentation to the national securities exchange or association on which its securities are listed.\n(b)Recovery would violate home country law where, with respect to Incentive-Based Compensation, that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022; provided that,\nbefore concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that was Incentive-Based Compensation based on\nviolation of home country law, the Company must obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to the national securities exchange or association on which\nits securities are listed, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide such opinion to the exchange or association.\n(c)Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet\nthe requirements of 26 U.S.C. 401(a)(13) or 26 U.S.C. 411(a) and regulations thereunder.\n5.Manner of Recovery. In addition to any other actions permitted by law or contract, the Company may take any or all of the following actions to recover any Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation: (a) require the Covered Officer to repay such amount; (b) offset such amount from any other compensation owed by the Company or any of its\naffiliates to the Covered Officer, regardless of whether the contract or other documentation governing such other compensation specifically permits or specifically prohibits such\noffsets; and (c) subject to Section 4(c), to the extent the Erroneously Awarded Compensation was deferred into a plan of deferred compensation, whether or not qualified, forfeit\nsuch amount (as well as the earnings on such amounts) from the Covered Officer’s balance in such plan, regardless of whether the plan specifically permits or specifically\nprohibits such forfeiture. If the Erroneously Awarded Compensation consists of shares of the Company’s common stock, and the Covered Officer still owns such shares, then\nthe Company may satisfy its recovery obligations by requiring the Covered Officer to transfer such shares back to the Company.\n6.Other.\n(a)This Policy shall be administered and interpreted, and may be amended from time to time, by the Company’s Board of Directors or any committee to which the\nBoard may delegate its authority in its sole discretion in compliance with the applicable listing standards of the national securities exchange or association on which\nthe Company’s securities are listed, and the determinations of the board or such committee shall be binding on all Covered Officers.\n(b)The Company shall not indemnify any Covered Officer against the loss of Erroneously Awarded Compensation.\n(c)The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the Federal securities laws, including disclosure required\nby the Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\n(d)Any right to recovery under this Policy shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights of recovery that may be available to the Company."
