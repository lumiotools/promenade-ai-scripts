          "content": "NATIONAL RESEARCH CORPORATION\nCLAWBACK POLICY\n1. Introduction and Purpose\n1.1 Introduction. This document sets forth the National Research Corporation Clawback Policy (the “Policy”),\neffective December 1, 2023 (the “Effective Date”).\n1.2 Purpose. National Research Corporation (the “Company”) has established this Policy to appropriately align the\ninterests of the executives of the Company, who have been designated as Covered Executives, with those of the\nCompany and to provide for the recovery of (i) Erroneously Awarded Compensation from Section 16 Officers,\nand (ii) Recoverable Amounts from Covered Executives. This Policy is designed to comply with the applicable\nNasdaq Listing Rules (the “Nasdaq Rules”) and with Section 10D and Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange Act (“Rule\n10D-1”). All capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in Section 4.3 of this Policy.\n2. Mandatory Recovery as Required by the SEC and Nasdaq\n2.1 Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation due to an Accounting Restatement.\n(a) In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Board will reasonably promptly recover the Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation in accordance with the Nasdaq Rules and Rule 10D-1 as follows:\n(i) Upon the occurrence of an Accounting Restatement, the Committee shall determine the amount of any\nErroneously Awarded Compensation and shall promptly deliver a written notice to each Section 16\nOfficer containing the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation and a demand for repayment\nor return of such compensation, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, recovery of Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation is on a “no fault” basis, meaning that it will occur regardless of whether the\nSection 16 Officer engaged in misconduct or was otherwise directly or indirectly responsible, in whole\nor in part, for the Accounting Restatement.\nA. To determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation for Incentive-based\nCompensation that is based on a Financial Reporting Measure other than stock price or TSR, after\nan Accounting Restatement:\n1. The Company shall recalculate the applicable Financial Reporting Measure and the amount\nof Incentive-based Compensation that would have been Received based on such Financial\nReporting Measure; and\n2. The Company shall determine whether the Section 16 Officers Received a greater amount of\nIncentive-based Compensation than would have been Received applying the recalculated\nFinancial Reporting Measure, based on: (i) the originally calculated Financial Reporting\nMeasure, and (ii) taking into consideration any discretion that the Committee applied to\nreduce the amount originally received.\nB. To determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation for Incentive-based\nCompensation that is based on stock price or TSR, where the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the\napplicable Accounting Restatement:\n1. The amount to be repaid or returned shall be determined by the Committee based on a\nreasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the Company’s stock price\nor TSR upon which the Incentive-based Compensation was Received; and\n2. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of such reasonable estimate\nand provide the relevant documentation as required to Nasdaq.\n1\n(ii) The Committee shall have discretion to determine the appropriate means of recouping Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation hereunder based on the particular facts and circumstances which may include,\nwithout limitation:\nA. requiring reimbursement of cash Incentive-based Compensation previously paid;\nB. seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting, exercise, settlement, sale, transfer, or other\ndisposition of any equity-based awards;\nC. offsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company to the\nSection 16 Officer;\nD. canceling outstanding vested or unvested equity awards; and/or\nE. taking any other remedial and recovery action permitted by law, as determined by the Committee,\nin its sole discretion.\n(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing in Section 2.1(a)(ii), except as set forth in Section 2.1(b) below, in no\nevent may the Company accept an amount that is less than the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation in satisfaction of a Section 16 Officer’s obligations hereunder.\n(iv) To the extent that a Section 16 Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the\nCompany when due, the Company shall take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such\nErroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable Section 16 Officer. The applicable Section 16\nOfficer shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses reasonably incurred\n(including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in\naccordance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions\ncontemplated by Section 2.1(a) above if the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable and\nany of the following two conditions are met.\n(i) The Committee has determined that the direct expenses, such as reasonable legal expenses and\nconsulting fees, paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be\nrecovered. In order for the Committee to make this determination, the Company must make a reasonable\nattempt to recover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such attempt(s) to recover, and\nprovide such documentation to Nasdaq; or\n(ii) Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are\nbroadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13)\nor Section 411(a) of the Code.\n2.2 Mandatory Disclosure. The Company shall file this Policy and, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, will\ndisclose information related to such Accounting Restatement in accordance with applicable law, including, for\nthe avoidance of doubt, Rule 10D-1 and the Nasdaq Rules.\n2.3 Prohibition of Indemnification. The Company shall not be permitted to insure or indemnify any Section 16\nOfficer against (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is repaid, returned, or recovered\npursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Company’s enforcement of its rights under\nthis Policy. While Section 16 Officers subject to this Policy may purchase insurance to cover their potential\nrecovery obligations, the Company shall not be permitted to pay or reimburse the Section 16 Officer for premiums\nfor such an insurance policy. Further, the Company shall not enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive-\nbased Compensation that is granted, paid, or awarded to a Section 16 Officer from the application of this Policy\nor that waives the Company’s right to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall\nsupersede any such agreement (whether entered into before, on, or after the Effective Date of this Policy.)\n2\n2.4 Other Recoupment Rights. This Policy shall be binding and enforceable against all Section 16 Officers and, to\nthe extent required by applicable law or guidance from the SEC or Nasdaq, their beneficiaries, heirs, executors,\nadministrators, or other legal representatives. The Administrator intends that this Policy will be applied to the\nfullest extent required by applicable law. Any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory\nplan, or any other agreement or arrangement with a Section 16 Officer shall be deemed to include, as a condition\nto the grant of any benefit thereunder, an agreement by the Section 16 Officer to abide by the terms of this Policy.\nAny right of recovery under this Policy is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recovery\nthat may be available to the Company under applicable law, regulation, or rule pursuant to the terms of any policy\nof the Company or any provision in any employment agreement, equity award agreement, compensatory plan,\nagreement, or other arrangement.\n3. Recovery of Compensation at the Discretion of the Board\n3.1 Clawback Events.

In determining the appropriate action to take, the Board may consider such factors\nas it deems appropriate, including:\n(a) the associated costs and benefits of seeking the Recoverable Amounts;\n(b) the requirements of applicable law;\n(c) the extent to which the Covered Executive participated or otherwise bore responsibility for the Clawback\nEvent; and\n(d) the extent to which the Covered Executive’s current compensation may or may not have been impacted had\nthe Board or the Committee known about the Clawback Event.\nIn addition, the Board may, in its sole discretion, determine whether and to what extent additional action is\nappropriate to address the circumstances surrounding the Clawback Event so as to minimize the likelihood of any\nrecurrence and to impose such other discipline as it deems appropriate.\n3.3 Application and Method of Recovery. Nothing in this Policy will limit in any respect (i) the Company’s right\nto take or not to take any action with respect to any Covered Executive’s or any other person’s employment or\n(ii) the obligation of the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer to reimburse the Company in\naccordance with Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended. Any determination made pursuant\nto Section 3 of this Policy and any application and implementation thereof need not be uniform with respect to\neach Covered Executive, or payment recovered or forfeited under this Policy.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may seek to recoup Recoverable Amounts by all legal means\navailable, including but not limited to, by requiring any affected Covered Executive to repay such amount to the\nCompany, by set-off, by reducing future compensation of the affected Covered Executive, or by such other means\nor combination of means as the Board, in its sole discretion, determines to be appropriate.\n3.4 Disclosure of Clawback Events. If the Board determines that a Clawback Event has occurred that is subsequently\ndisclosed by the Company in a public filing required under the Exchange Act (a “Disclosed Event”), the Company\nwill disclose in the proxy statement relating to the year in which such determination is made (i) if any amount\nwas clawed back from a Covered Executive and the aggregate amount clawed back or (ii) if no amount was\n3\nclawed back from the Covered Executive as a result of the Disclosed Event, the fact that no amount was clawed\nback.\n4. Miscellaneous and Definitions\n4.1 Administration and Interpretation. This Policy shall be administered by Administrator, which shall have\nauthority to (i) exercise all of the powers granted to it under the Policy, (ii) construe, interpret, and implement\nthis Policy, (iii) make all determinations necessary or advisable in administering this Policy and for the\nCompany’s compliance with the Nasdaq Rules, Section 10D and Rule 10D-1, and any other applicable law,\nregulation, rule, or interpretation of the SEC or Nasdaq promulgated or issued in connection therewith, and (iv)\namend this Policy, including to reflect changes in applicable law or stock exchange regulation.

In addition to the guidelines presented in this\nCode, there are at least three other ways of determining if a behavior or activity is appropriate or should\nbe avoided:\n• Common sense. The appropriateness of a practice or activity should generally be\nguided by common sense and good business judgment. If it does not feel like the\nright thing to do, then it probably is not.\n• Public scrutiny. Take the public scrutiny test: If a reasonable person would not\nwant to read about your action or inaction on the front page of the newspaper,\nthen avoid such action or inaction.\n• When in doubt – ask! A supervisor, the Responsible Manager and the Secretary\nare resources available to help you do the appropriate thing.\nThe purpose of this Code is to deter wrongdoing and to promote: (i) honest and ethical conduct, including\nthe ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional\nrelationships; (ii) full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that\nthe Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public\ncommunications the Company makes; (iii) compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and\nregulations; (iv) the prompt internal reporting of violations of this Code to the appropriate persons; and\n(v) accountability for adherence to this Code.\nCompliance with the Laws\nThe Company’s business must be conducted in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\nFailure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations violates this Code and may subject both the\nCompany and individuals to criminal or civil liability, as well as disciplinary action by the Company, ranging\nfrom warnings to termination or removal.\nFair Dealings with Others\nThe Company promises to deal fairly with all Company associates and expects that its associates and\ndirectors will deal fairly with the Company’s customers, suppliers, competitors and external advisers. No\none should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged\ninformation, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice.\n6\nCompliance with Securities Laws\nYou are also required to comply with the Insider Trading Policy that applies to all associates and directors.\nCopies of the policy are distributed to all new associates and directors. You may contact the Company’s\nChief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or Secretary to request additional copies of the Insider\nTrading Policy or if you have questions about the policy.\nBecause the Company’s common stock is publicly traded, the Company discloses information regarding\nthe Company’s business activities and operations to the public on a regular basis. If you are aware of\n“Material non-public information”, you shall not share such information with any other person (except\nwhen such disclosure is necessary to fulfill a Company business objective and is disclosed in accordance\nwith NRC’s Policies). You must also refrain from trading or influencing the decisions of others to trade\nCompany securities until all such information is no longer material or has been broadly disseminated to\nthe public by the Company and the requisite time has elapsed to allow investors to react to the\ninformation. Material non-public information means: information that is material (i.e., a reasonable\ninvestor would consider the information important in making an investment decision (e.g., trading\nsecurities) or would view as having significantly altered the total mix of information available) and\nnonpublic (i.e., the information has not been disseminated in a manner making it generally available to\nthe investing public in a manner that complies with all applicable securities laws (e.g., by a broadly\ndisseminated press release or in a report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission))\nAlso, you must never trade or influence the decisions of others to trade in securities of the Company’s\ncompetitors and businesses associated with the Company based on material nonpublic information or\n“tips” relating to such competitors and business associates. It is a violation of this Code and of applicable\nsecurities laws for any associate or director to trade securities in another company based on material\nnonpublic information when that information was obtained in the course of employment with, or the\nperformance of services on or behalf of, NRC.\nA trade includes a broad range of transactions, including, without limitation, sales, purchases, hedging\ntransactions (such as puts or calls), elections or changes in election under a securities purchase plan, gifts,\ncharitable donations, or other dispositions, contributions or receipts of a security.\n7\nContacts with the Media, the Public or\nAttorneys\nPress releases and contact with news media, securities analysts or investment bankers with respect to\nCompany-related matters must be made only through or at the direction of the Company’s Chief Executive\nOfficer, Chief Financial Officer or Secretary, unless you are expressly authorized. If you are contacted by\nthe media, you shall immediately notify the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary or\nthe Responsible Manager. An associate shall never answer questions or supply documents to the media,\noutside attorneys, or securities analysts without express prior approval of Chief Executive Officer, Chief\nFinancial Officer or Secretary.\nIf an associate receives a summons, legal complaint, subpoena, or other similar legal document\nconcerning the Company, the associate shall immediately consult with the Chief Executive Officer, Chief\nFinancial Officer or Secretary in order to ensure that the Company responds appropriately.\n8\nConflicts of Interest\nAssociates and directors owe a duty of loyalty to the Company and the Company’s business interests.\nAssociates and directors are prohibited from engaging in business opportunities for personal gain where\nthe Company may be interested in such business opportunities.

Potential or suspected conflicts of interest must be appropriately disclosed to the\nResponsible Manager prior to engaging with such suspected conflict of interest for determination and\nhandling. Examples of conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to:\n• Giving Company business or prospective business to another company because a\nfamily member or personal friend works at that company\n• Outside activities that could influence an associate’s on-the-job ability to make\nobjective decisions that are in the Company’s best interests\n• Hiring or having a reporting relationship with a relative or significant other\n• Accepting cash or non-cash gifts, personal entertainment, favors or other\ngratuities from persons doing business or seeking to do business with the\nCompany (however, one-time gratuities of nominal value of less than $200, if\nconsistent with local business custom and practice, and are not in violation of any\napplicable law, are permissible)\n• Acceptance of cash from vendors, consultants or third parties for any reason is\nprohibited without express prior permission from the Responsible Manager,\nChief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or Secretary.\n• Accepting or providing business entertainment, unless such business\nentertainment is normal, customary, and otherwise consistent with the\nCompany’s travel and expense reimbursement policy\n9\nCompany Information\nCompany information and data are highly valuable assets.
