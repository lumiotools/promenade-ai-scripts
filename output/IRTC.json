The findings underscore iRhythm’s commitment to advancing ambulatory cardiac monitoring services to improve patient outcomes, enhance healthcare resource utilization, and provide access to affordable care, including for patients with chronic conditions.\n\nThe five studies presented by iRhythm span three focus areas for long-term continuous monitoring (LTCM): patient engagement and satisfaction through digital tools and patient-centered product enhancements, evaluating arrhythmia patterns during periods of sleep and activity, and assessing the potential healthcare resource and economic impact of early arrhythmia detection in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\n\"These new findings underscore iRhythm's commitment to rigorous scientific evidence,\" said Mintu Turakhia, MD, iRhythm's Chief Medical and Scientific Officer and EVP of Product Innovation. \"Our data demonstrates the significant health economic benefits of early arrhythmia detection in often-overlooked conditions like diabetes and COPD, highlights greater patient engagement through our patient-centered digital tools that complement our services, and reveals distinct arrhythmia patterns associated with sleep and activity.\"\n\n**LTCM Patient Engagement and Satisfaction Through Digital Tool and Product Enhancements** Two studies validated the impact of digital health tools on improving patient compliance with timely device return and demonstrate the value of using patient-centric feedback to guide enhancements in the latest Zio® monitor.\n\n  * “Digital Engagement With a Patient Smartphone App and Text Messaging is Associated with Increased Compliance in Patients Undergoing Long-Term Continuous Ambulatory Cardiac Monitoring”\n  * “Feasibility of Point-Of-Wear Patient Satisfaction Surveys to Validate Patient-Centered Product Enhancements: Results From Over 300,000 Patients for Long-Term Ambulatory Cardiac Monitoring”\n\n\n\n**Evaluating Sleep and Activity Arrhythmia Patterns Using LTCM** Two studies assessed the feasibility and clinical utility of using the Zio system to monitor arrhythmias in relation to sleep and activity patterns.1 Analyzing and classifying arrhythmia occurrences during sleep and physical exertion provides insights that may inform more personalized arrhythmia management.\n\n  * “Determining the Accuracy of Sleep and Activity Patterns in Patients Undergoing Long-Term Ambulatory ECG Monitoring”\n  * “Characterization of Arrhythmia Occurrence During Sleep and Activity in Patients Undergoing Long-Term Continuous Ambulatory ECG Monitoring”\n\n\n\n**Potential Healthcare Resource and Economic Value of Early Arrhythmia Detection in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**\n\nThis retrospective analysis of medical claims data examined the healthcare resource burden and medical costs of managing undiagnosed and untreated arrhythmias in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The analysis was conducted by Eversana (Overland Park, KS, USA) and the preliminary findings suggest that early detection with arrhythmia monitoring devices has the combined potential to help prevent serious outcomes like stroke and heart failure and significantly reduce acute care utilization and related costs in these populations.\n\n  * “Real World Evidence on Health Care Resources Utilization and Economic Burden of Arrhythmias in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)”\n\n\n\nThese data, presented at the American Heart Association’s 2024 Scientific Sessions, are part of iRhythm’s comprehensive clinical evidence program, encompassing over 100 original research publications2 and insights from over 1.5 billion hours of curated heartbeat data.2 This ongoing commitment reflects iRhythm's dedication to expanding clinical evidence that supports improved patient outcomes.\n\n**iRhythm’s AHA Presentations Details:**\n\n[**“**** _Digital engagement with a patient smartphone app and text messaging is associated with increased compliance in patients undergoing long-term continuous ambulatory cardiac monitoring_****”**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-iAn3Zxb1IdyM3r8GoaqErSkh1a5h_gpJEx8_3FYmS4M5CTcyHWuyYAlNRB_vOkNNqyAyE0olkT0BIG64mgmU2XK2AlqGaZBdfTa3CQfIQSHChKxAh3Njewhx6BVS5gEdav2Fy4NVRPPH9v1hGq9u9oAg-8NECkWwKa2Nbim9dM8XU3UkWHg_Im6DfvI95cJwode0ughleBPx-HTjToruHpqYs94mgrUyW1NbTNxGZ-H7oXVNPEP2WX9C2hFmyEN6OBe73tBvyXSIh-7SCyS2G8L24b5LdHaqThItv_tVvPzBT0BewamAeP-99LLaELi4KMQmmgArVzytHlttiO_9Zftrd6U5gf_KeYi9NdVWyTzew1YWXS_ZFgi59dcs4ahVVRIuX93vUWXOCJ7zSujHA-2G6Bj9Fiials8UjFJ6gSVNe-FQrXUXLIIMLkJf9vj)**study**\n\nThis study sought to determine if two optional direct-to-patient digital interventions, the MyZio smartphone app and short messages services (SMS) text notifications, impacts patient compliance (i.e., activation, wear, and device return within 45 days) in patients who self-applied and activated a Zio 14-day patch-based long-term continuous ambulatory monitoring (LTCM) device shipped directly to their home. Distribution of the use of digital tools and compliance outcomes was evaluated in 169,131 patients. Device activation, usage, and return compliance was highest (94.8%) when both the app and text messaging were used vs. 74.6% in cases where neither digital intervention was used. Opting in to SMS text was associated with compliance improvement vs. no digital intervention but was inferior to app use. These data support the use of patient digital health interventions in home-based diagnostics and underscore the importance of post-implementation evaluation of outcomes.\n\n[**“**** _Feasibility of point-of-wear patient satisfaction surveys to validate patient-centered product enhancements: results from over 300,000 patients for long-term ambulatory cardiac monitoring_****”**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=M4fVnvzXvAQYdgN-w4lY6SMb3Vs_-CAkBRB_kPZxV4XYCCy-iZzNpqUOfuAaZe92a0v5OkLuT4uA2l6Tq6W5MV3o2Jzuyoz-0UVHvGmSWzkQ1HlQ6UdjXPL0h_yf3WN6XpoQtj5wGVCF1Q-fYPkdwhQpcxVx4NPRR8tzSDbh4y_6Rad-hz_S18_XKZUr2rpmA5vRiGnhpnAk07YMkjP5nEn6Lkh2NPt6njgsOdfYbiLrr_n2so_w3AD0kjcAsC_p60tCKb5QVorjp7CnZaWfyE3Pa3GeBbUBigJQ36yrsAYO2Eb09ST_xgrhkA8-bgVn7k4msfMXnnPvUUt7F_J-p0Q3MiC-uHJ5VFBK4_BU05p8iJxgYTQSYXFZF8Wz4lFlEfEgkEYNzMGAiOSL8sLDU-EwSa7wpWIJ_3pwsz98iaQ_mt1zZHULwwwaqC-uMLMG)**survey**\n\nResearchers sought to understand the feasibility and value of collecting patient survey data at the point of care to assess quality improvements associated with use of a novel 14-day patch-based long-term continuous ambulatory ECG monitor (LTCM). Specifically, the study compared product experience and patient satisfaction associated with the prior generation LTCM (Zio® XT) to that of a next-generation, FDA-cleared LTCM product (Zio® monitor) designed with patient-centered features, including a more breathable adhesive, waterproof housing,3,4 thinner profile, and lighter weight.2 Among 334,054 respondents, the new LTCM was associated with a greater proportion of affirmative responses across all survey categories, including a 14-percentage point improvement in wear comfort as compared to the prior generation device (79.1% vs. 64.7%, p<0.001). The finding demonstrated patient survey data for post-market quality assessment is feasible for digital health technologies, in this case leading to over 300,000 total respondents in one year. Measures of patient satisfaction were higher with the new device, which may be due to patient-centered product enhancements.\n\n[**“**** _Determining the Accuracy of Sleep and Activity Patterns in Patients Undergoing Long-Term Ambulatory ECG Monitoring_****”**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=y4mKKI_r3YsCcter0HrO_FOPxK9T5Ium5X9ZNr-TQSrl1BbkWXzneWK5Enkku4No_ZPhFn2qFNJCWYJRTcXFgB54nxNX0G7VjvVRm2xi1u3DCdV1iasDbtNdUuyuKh57E3H-OgimLV2nsAePNaimTKP6GXt2JHH7Mkn_ExW25sN858NLSxvpZQ3qMCpuVQqWrhme224RrYMYmPmUxj-4soe1cdZTEOigWnLUzrp_jlOZRH-PEEDtbFvdSHPkc2oUbvwFGs5m9ANEidxNJa8qiqhBdxBiO62pE04GhsCHIowD7gBGgriYhjpWjmAzzzkuEH2kaDFSloYyH4uhUB7CxvZmAtkSkgKkdG9kSda2_rHQ0ViXtMn8jBO6ob76kw3Y)**study**\n\nResearchers sought to develop and assess performance of an algorithm to classify periods of sleep, activity (>2mph walking), and inactivity1 using a novel ambulatory ECG (AECG) patch (Zio® monitor) with embedded accelerometry. A prospective clinical study enrolled participants across four American Academy of Sleep Medicine- (AASM) qualified sleep centers to support algorithm training and validation. Eighty-one (81) study participants wore the Zio® monitor AECG patch and a commercially available actigraphy reference device simultaneously over a 14-day study period, which included in-clinic overnight polysomnography (PSG) sleep testing and a 6-minute walk test. Data acquired were split into training (n=40) and validation (n=41) sets. Feature and model selection utilized five-fold cross-validation on the training set, focusing on total activity and body angle. Algorithm sensitivity and specificity (assessed over 1-minute epochs vs. PSG reference) in sleep detection were 88.8% and 54.0%, respectively for the validation set. Sensitivity and specificity in activity detection were 97.0% and 100%, respectively. Study authors concluded the assessment of sleep and activity during AECG is feasible, with performance comparable to FDA-cleared actigraphy and consumer devices.5 This feature offers insights into patient wellness patterns, highlighting its potential for personalized healthcare monitoring.\n\n[**“**** _Characterization of Arrhythmia Occurrence During Sleep and Activity in Patients Undergoing Long-Term Continuous Ambulatory ECG Monitoring_****”**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CdkRk2ykhuGyqvrgatdVPVYw365rCXxU13LDNKSZ1immBl_Z7985WWAF9EQN6ij4I7qTtHmgyAZ-CUwjMZiu8EuEP6zZWyDGf6nb08GVboBG4V0B-lni3sZ0pwmU5gTE4S_fNlyo1ofAFowoajYuG3t5Ru7BkndDe4b6aNR306CPvzzTB66WqAEnWhZeh-K6PX8SUUBQoGWrnIb8kdFOv6BuedDUPbNUMo3tAaFK6QIo6LE5bU4HzgVOBwz154h1hd_ZSVQyisBWw3L86_kt9eH5IiQST4UXiFdXx8mnW5SOaBhnZyaUsCmsDBs9QcZ3QcF47IdzgODUQErRpEogP2ItAloZjPYvmfVsNhr8ivQNSWnMdYX0XSKHI61hUN3X)**study**\n\nResearchers sought to quantify the occurrence of arrhythmias detected by long-term (≤14 days) continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring (LTCM) during periods of sleep, activity and inactivity.1 The analysis is the largest study of its kind, and included 23,962 patients (57.7% female, age 60.9±18.0 years) who underwent monitoring with a next generation LTCM (Zio® monitor) device. An Al algorithm previously developed and validated was used to classify periods of sleep and activity using LTCM accelerometry data (see study _Accuracy of Sleep and Activity Patterns_ study described above). Rhythms were classified by an FDA-cleared deep learning algorithm,6 confirmed by a cardiographic technician and time-aligned to the algorithm-generated sleep/wake and activity/inactivity labels. Odds ratios (OR) associated with time in arrhythmia for sleep and activity periods were calculated by rhythm type. Among the rhythms having the highest association with sleep (vs. wake) were pause (OR=2.58; 95% CI 2.55-2.60) and 3rd degree heart block, (OR=1.37; 95% CI 1.37-1.37). Notably, the analysis identified ventricular tachycardia (VT) was among the arrhythmias least likely to occur during sleep (OR=0.51; 95% Cl 0.50-0.51). Ventricular tachycardia and 3rd degree heart block had the highest OR associated with periods of activity. Results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating sleep and activity labeling with LTCM findings and the potential to give context to arrhythmias, such onset or termination during sleep, wake, or exertion.\n\n[**“**** _Real World Evidence on Health Care Resources Utilization and Economic Burden of Arrhythmias in Patients with Diabetes and COPD”_**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0mmiy2rSZwiKQ1iN51UFE2DJOjqvWcnZqpsdt4bEA7a97MT-FLIy4H5aPbRHJIL8Ezsd78mozDUy93w2n8VhkkTRUbfeXI_7px6TNg1bm5U12_BYhCKo9aP9znAMcBJ0xYR3IwRxy66d9kJZ-ig8JTbNCpKcjSq5fuiFqQRdQTMPaMzb0_qzWEZYAXS4z-Sj_wbbmEmw3J8U47obBmGaiefw3B6JKy8_5xOo3zoV2BPkf7Y80i31EnsQaHjTiHJPyNTb7rLkVsl2CwslMX6mcEKxqHPs3JEbIqAt4rGFS3c-PDoaGzi9d4uBxLKWyNSm5goW0dFDjknJD7amoI3AhMC0yrWNLq5wEA29L8uD044BH_PpEePzvbgbnkOlDy9RgGjD8X8uTVJXbI4zRiasOQ==)**study**\n\nThis study examined healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and medical costs of managing arrhythmias in T2D and COPD, and the potential impact of early detection on the rate of hospitalization and ER visits. Research included a retrospective claims analysis using the Merative MarketScan and the Symphony Integrated Dataverse databases. Study participants were > 18 years with claims for T2D or COPD or both T2D and COPD (T2D-COPD) and assigned into groups: Target: patients without prior history of arrythmias, followed by arrythmias claims. Control: patients with either of the conditions, but without arrhythmia claims. Target and control were matched 1:1 on demographic, year of first episode of arrhythmia, risk (ECI, DSI, Goki criteria). HCRU and medical cost drivers over 24 months were analyzed. HCRU of patients with the primary comorbidity and an associated arrhythmia was compared to those without an arrhythmia. The total cost of care per patient / year was significantly higher for all target patients compared to control (T2D $34,171/ $18,687; COPD $37,719/$25,656: T2D COPD $46,484/$30,824). The per patient / year cost of hospitalization was higher in the target patient's vs control (T2D $28,316/$19,439; COPD $25,098/$17,906; T2D COPD $28,694/$19,352). Much of this cost difference was also higher in the target patient's vs control in the 30 days post index date (arrhythmia diagnosis) (T2D $18,414/$1,928; COPD $17,920/$3,278; T2D COPD $18,415/$4,162). ER cost per patient/year was 35%-50% higher in the target cohort. Arrhythmia patients were hospitalized more than 2x per 1,000 cohort patients per year than non-arrhythmia patients, and of the diabetes, COPD and combined cohorts, 49%, 68%, and 74% of the patients were hospitalized respectively. The length of stay increased by 2-5 days for arrhythmia patients, with the diabetes, COPD and combined cohorts having an average length of stay of 10, 13, and 16 days respectively. The rate of ER visits were more than 2x for the arrhythmia cohort relative to the non-arrhythmia cohort, and of the diabetes, COPD and combined cohorts, 66%, 83%, and 86% of the patients have been hospitalized respectively. The preliminary study findings suggest that arrythmias significantly increase HCRU and total cost for T2D and COPD, particularly in patients requiring ER visits and hospitalization, and that early detection with arrhythmia monitoring devices, could reduce the utilization of acute care and associated costs.\n\n**About iRhythm Technologies** iRhythm is a leading digital health care company that creates trusted solutions that detect, predict, and prevent disease.

We were also very pleased to be able to celebrate one million patients having been registered for Zio monitor - our newest generation, long-term continuous monitoring system - in October and have officially launched our first commercial account using Aura - Epic’s specialty diagnostics and devices suite.\"\n\n\"We also made tangible progress towards long-term initiatives to drive future growth. For the first time ever, we have achieved more than 10,000 billable registrations in a single quarter in the UK, and we are excited that we have begun receiving physician orders following commercial launch in four additional European countries. Furthermore, we have recently received a FDA 510(k) clearance for updates to our Zio AT device associated with our FDA remediation efforts, an ongoing and critical priority for our teams to demonstrate our commitment to quality, compliance and performance. With strong execution across multiple growth levers and with additional catalysts on the horizon, we could not be more excited about the future of iRhythm.\"\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results** Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $147.5 million, up 18% from $124.6 million during the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by growth in demand for Zio services.\n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $101.5 million, up 23% from $82.5 million during the same period in 2023, while gross margin was 68.8%, up from 66.2% during the same period in 2023. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to increased volume of Zio services provided due to higher demand. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to operational efficiencies as well as the absence of increased reserves for excess Zio XT printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) components that were incurred during the prior year.\n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $151.8 million, compared to $110.1 million for the same period in 2023. Adjusted operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $143.8 million, compared to $107.1 million during the same period in 2023. The increase in adjusted operating expenses was primarily driven by a $32.1 million charge for license consideration payable to BioIntelliSense that was recognized on iRhythm’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) expense during the third quarter of 2024. In alignment with SEC guidance around non-GAAP financial measures relating to acquired IPR&D expense, iRhythm does not exclude expenses related to acquired IPR&D from its non-GAAP results.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $46.2 million, or a diluted loss of $1.48 per share, compared with net loss of $27.1 million, or a diluted loss of $0.89 per share, for the same period in 2023. Adjusted net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $39.2 million, or a diluted loss of $1.26 per share, compared with an adjusted net loss of $24.1 million, or a diluted loss of $0.79 per share, for the same period in 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily driven by a $32.1 million charge for license consideration payable to BioIntelliSense that was recognized on iRhythm’s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as acquired IPR&D expense during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nUnrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $522.0 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n**2024 Annual Guidance** iRhythm projects revenue for the full year 2024 to grow approximately 18% to 19% compared to prior year results, ranging from approximately $582.5 million to $587.5 million. Gross margin for the full year 2024 is expected to range from 68.5% to 69.0%. iRhythm now expects adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year 2024 to range from approximately negative 2% to negative 1.5% of full year revenues. Adjusted EBITDA guidance includes license consideration payable to BioIntelliSense that is recognized on iRhythm’s consolidated statements of operations as acquired IPR&D expenses, including a charge of approximately $32 million of expense incurred during the third quarter of 2024. In alignment with SEC guidance around non-GAAP financial measures relating to acquired IPR&D expense, iRhythm will not exclude expenses related to acquired IPR&D from its non-GAAP results, which include adjusted EBITDA.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information** iRhythm’s management team will host a conference call today beginning at 1:30 p.m. PT/4:30 p.m. ET. Interested parties may access a live and archived webcast of the presentation on the “Events & Presentations” section of the company’s investor website at [investors.irhythmtech.com](http://investors.irhythmtech.com).\n\n**About iRhythm Technologies, Inc.** iRhythm is a leading digital health care company that creates trusted solutions that detect, predict, and prevent disease.

These reclassifications have no impact on previously reported results of operations or financial position.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures** We refer to certain financial measures that are not recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in this press release, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per share and adjusted operating expenses. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. See the schedules attached to this press release for additional information and reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures. We have not reconciled our adjusted operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA estimates for full year 2024 because certain items that impact these figures are uncertain or out of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of adjusted operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA estimates is not available without unreasonable effort.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash operating charges for stock-based compensation expense, changes in fair value of strategic investments, impairment and restructuring charges, business transformation costs, and loss on extinguishment of debt. Business transformation costs include costs associated with professional services, employee termination and relocation, third-party merger and acquisition, integration, and other costs to augment and restructure the organization, inclusive of both outsourced and offshore resources.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
