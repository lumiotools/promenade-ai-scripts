The change was due to a large, commercial produced water treatment project in North America which was expected to be delivered in Q3 2024 being delayed following the decision by the customer to change the physical location of the installation. The installation is now scheduled for the first half of 2025.\n  * Gross loss margin of (8.5)% compared to gross profit margin of 18.7% in Q3 2023.\n  * Net loss of $(2.8) million compared to $(1.4) million in Q3 2023.\n  * Ending cash balance of $4.5 million on September 30, 2024. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the Company closed on the second part of a private placement totaling $8.8 million, bringing the pro forma cash balance to $13.3 million.\n\n\n\n**Recent Operational Highlights**\n\n  * Entered into a joint venture with Jiangsu Industrial Technology Research Institute (\"JiTRI\") to develop and sell silicon carbide ceramic membrane-based water treatment equipment for marine ships in China.\n  * Received a pilot project order from a U.S. petrochemical company focused on microplastics removal.\n  * Delivered two swimming pool systems during the third quarter to Ireland and Spain.\n  * Successfully completed testing of a mini unit focused on lithium brine productionpretreatment in the U.S. which has led to a pilot unit order in November.\n  * Factory test of LiqTech Water Treatment Unit (WTU) for WIN DG dual-fuel engine has been conducted with satisfactory results. LiqTech WTU is now permitted to apply for the ships based on WIN DG dual-fuel engines.\n  * Implemented a cost reduction strategy aimed at lowering our break-even target, measured on an adjusted EBITDA basis, to a quarterly revenue of approximately $5.5 million. This includes a 10% reduction in headcount, a 10% reduction in base salaries for senior management in 2025, a 50% reduction in cash compensation for the board of directors in 2025, as well as other cost-saving initiatives.\n\n\n\n**Management****Commentary**\n\n\"The results of the quarter reflect the delay of a large, commercial produced water treatment project in the North America which was expected to be delivered in the third quarter but has been delayed following the decision by the customer to change the physical location of the installation. The installation is now scheduled for the first half of 2025,\" commented Fei Chen, CEO of LiqTech. \"While this delay is disappointing and impacted our third quarter financial results, we have more systems today at various phases of testing and piloting than at any point in our history. For instance, we recently received a pilot project order from a U.S. petrochemical company focused on microplastics removal and completed testing of a mini unit focused on lithium brine productionpretreatment in the U.S. This mini unit testing has led to a pilot unit order in the first week of November. Both of these are new areas of opportunity for LiqTech. For one of these two areas, we expect upcoming commercial project in 2025. We also established a joint venture with JiTRI, a strong innovation and technology institute in China, where we will leverage our water treatment solutions with JiTRI's unique capabilities and network within China, to expand our presence in the Chinese marine water treatment market. These new areas of focus, coupled with the large number of existing collaborations, tests and piloting programs we have ongoing leads me to believe we are on the right pathway to drive growth into the future.\"\n\n\"While our focus is on the growth and widespread adoption of our highly specialized filtration technologies, we recognize that there is a need to reach profitability in the near future. As such, we have enacted a series of cost reduction initiatives aimed at lowering our break-even target, measured on an adjusted EBITDA basis, to a quarterly revenue of approximately $5.5 million, down from the previous range of $6.5 -$7.0 million per quarter. These initiatives include a reduction in headcount, as well as a reduction in basic salary for senior management and reduction in cash compensation by board of directors.\"\n\n\"As we look to the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect revenue to be between $3.3 and $4.3 million, which would compare to $3.9 million in the year ago fourth quarter. With larger orders set to be delivered in early 2025, coupled with cost reduction initiatives, and an improved balance sheet following our recent private placement, we remain in a strong position to achieve our stated goals and drive shareholder value,\" Chen concluded.\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $2.5 million compared to $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing a decrease of 51%. The change was attributable to a decrease in deliveries of ceramic membranes, DPFs, liquid filtration systems, and aftermarket sales, partly offset by increased sales of plastics products and progress on an external R&D project to further strengthen our technology base. The decrease in deliveries of liquid filtration systems was primarily attributed to reduced deliveries of pool filtration systems and fewer deliveries of pilot systems for industrial applications. The decline in aftermarket sales was attributable to elevated remediation work and associated deliveries in the same period in 2023. The decrease in sales of ceramic membranes and DPFs reflects temporary market conditions, with customers awaiting potential interest rate cuts.\n\nGross loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $(0.2) million, reflecting a gross loss margin of (8.5)%, compared to a gross profit $0.9 million, or a gross profit margin of 18.7%, in the third quarter of 2023. This decline was primarily driven by the reduction in revenue and an unfavorable sales mix, which resulted in a lower proportion of high-margin products such as liquid filtration systems and ceramic membranes. This impact was partly offset by lower depreciation expenses.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $2.4 million compared to $2.6 million for the same period in 2023. Selling expenses decreased $0.4 million, is attributable a reduction in executive officers, as well as reductions in travel costs, investor relations, and expenses related to external sales consultancy services. G&A increased $0.2 million, attributable to the addition of new positions in supply chain and project management, as well as increased legal expenses and insurance costs. Additionally, one-time expenses were incurred for the relocation of our plastics production facility. R&D expenses decreased $0.2 million primarily attributed to a reduction in external costs associated to finalizing ongoing projects in the same period in 2023, as well as a decrease in the average number of employees engaged in research and development activity as the Company streamlined and centralized the R&D function.\n\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $(2.8) million, compared to $(1.4) million in the prior period.\n\nCash on hand (including restricted cash) on September 30, 2024 was $4.5 million compared to $5.5 million on June 30, 2024. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the Company closed on the second tranche of a private placement totaling $8.8 million, bringing the pro forma cash balance to $13.3 million.\n\n**Q4 2024 Outlook**\n\nThe Company expects revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be between $3.3 million and $4.3 million reflecting full year 2024 revenue of $14.5 million to $15.5 million.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\n**Date and Time:** Thursday, November 14, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. ET\n\n**Call-in Information:** Interested parties can access the conference call by dialing (833) 535-2206 or (412) 902-6741.\n\n**Webcast** : Interested parties can access the conference call via a live webcast, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at [https://www.liqtech.com/investor-relations/](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302020-1&h=2326512686&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.liqtech.com%2Finvestor-relations%2F&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.liqtech.com%2Finvestor-relations%2F) or at [https://app.webinar.net/56KGkZoWDXd](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4302020-1&h=1126982815&u=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.webinar.net%2F56KGkZoWDXd&a=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.webinar.net%2F56KGkZoWDXd).\n\n**Replay:** A teleconference replay of the call will be available until November 21, 2024, at (877) 344-7529 or (412) 317-0088, replay access code 1400391.

The broad adoption of electric vehicles requires a substantial increase in lithium production. To realize this electric future, traditional methods of lithium production must be replaced with new technology that can deliver higher rates of production while meeting basic environmental standards. Brine resources hold a substantial amount of the world's lithium, but until now, the lack of a scalable extraction technology has hindered their development. One of the suitable solutions for lithium brine extraction is ion exchange. LiqTech ultrafiltration (UF) membrane filtration technology shows the huge potential to be an excellent pre-treatment step for enhancing downstream ion exchange process.\n\n\"I am very excited with this commercial order. In the past months, we have conducted a couple of small-scale tests at customer sites in the U.S. and illustrated superior performance of our UF membrane filtration technology for lithium brine production,\" commented Fei Chen, CEO of LiqTech. \"This order provides a unique opportunity for LiqTech to demonstrate our UF technology robustness and efficiency in challenging onsite situations. We look forward to meeting the requirements of this customer within this new application, and to seeing the significant opportunity it can bring to both parties over time.\"\n\nThe new commercial system is scheduled to be delivered to the customer in the 4th quarter of 2024.\n\n**ABOUT LIQTECH INTERNATIONAL, INC.**\n\nLiqTech International, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is a high-tech filtration technology company that provides state-of-the-art ceramic silicon carbide filtration technologies for gas and liquid purification. LiqTech's silicon carbide membranes are designed to be used in the most challenging purification applications, and its silicon carbide filters are used to control diesel exhaust soot emissions.

These proxy materials are also available free of charge on the internet at www.proxyvote.com. Stockholders are invited to attend the Meeting to vote on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement. However, stockholders do not need to attend the Meeting to vote. Instead, stockholders may simply complete, sign and return the proxy card in the enclosed postage paid envelope, or vote online or over the telephone according to the instructions in the proxy card.\n\nWe will bear the expense of solicitation of proxies for the Meeting, including the printing and mailing of this Proxy Statement. We may request persons, and reimburse them for their expenses with respect thereto, who hold stock in their name or custody or in the names of nominees for others to forward copies of such materials to those persons for whom they hold Common Stock (as defined below) and to request authority for the execution of the proxies. In addition, some of our officers, directors and employees, without additional compensation, may solicit proxies on behalf of the Board personally or by mail, telephone or facsimile.\n\n**VOTING SECURITIES, VOTING AND PROXIES**\n\n**Record Date**\n\nOnly stockholders of record of the Company’s common stock, $0.001 par value (the “ _Common Stock_ ”), as of the close of business on September 26, 2022 (the “ _Record Date_ ”) are entitled to notice and to vote at the Meeting and any adjournment or adjournments thereof.\n\n**Voting Stock**\n\nAs of the Record Date, there were 43,896,871 shares of Common Stock outstanding. Each holder of Common Stock on the Record Date is entitled to one vote for each share then held on the matters to be voted at the Meeting. No other class of voting securities was then outstanding.\n\n**Quorum**\n\nThe presence at the Meeting of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Record Date, in person or by proxy, is required for a quorum. Should you submit a proxy, even though you abstain as to a proposal, or you are present in person at the Meeting, your shares shall be counted for the purpose of determining if a quorum is present.\n\n**Broker non-vote**\n\nBroker “non-votes” are included for the purposes of determining whether a quorum of shares is present at the Meeting. A broker “non-vote” occurs when a nominee holder, such as a brokerage firm, bank or trust company, holding shares of record for a beneficial owner, does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee holder does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. Proposals 1 and 3 are considered non-routine matters, and a broker or other nominee holder cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters. Consequently, we expect broker non-votes with respect to Proposals 1 and 3. Proposal 2 is considered a routine matter, and a broker or other nominee holder generally may vote on routine matters without instructions.\n\n4\n\n**Voting**\n\nThe election of directors requires the approval of a plurality of the votes cast at the Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1. Proposal 2 requires the approval of a majority of votes cast at the meeting. Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 2, and broker non-votes are not expected to occur with respect to Proposal 2. Proposal 3 requires the approval of a majority of votes cast at the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 3.\n\nIf you are the beneficial owner, but not the registered holder of our shares of Common Stock, you cannot directly vote those shares at the Meeting. You must provide voting instructions to your nominee holder, such as your brokerage firm or bank, by following the specific directions provided to you by your nominee holder.\n\nIf you wish to vote in person at the Meeting but you are not the record holder, you must obtain from your record holder a “legal proxy” issued in your name and bring it to the Meeting. At the Meeting, ballots will be distributed with respect to the proposals to each stockholder (or the stockholder’s proxy if not the management proxy holders) who is present and did not deliver a proxy to the management proxy holders or another person. The ballots shall then be tallied, one vote for each share owned of record as follows:\n\n● |  the votes on the election of directors being either “FOR”, “WITHHOLD ALL” or “FOR ALL EXCEPT” (where stockholders may withhold such vote by writing the names of such nominee(s) in a space provided on the ballot); and  \n---|---  \n● |  the votes on the ratification of the appointment of Sadler, Gibb & Associates, L.L.C., and the votes on the LiqTech International, Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan being either “FOR,” ”AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN”.  \n  \n**Proxies**\n\nThe form of proxy solicited by the Board affords you the ability to specify a choice among approval of, disapproval of, or abstention with respect to, the matters to be acted upon at the Meeting. Shares represented by the proxy will be voted, and where the solicited stockholder indicates a choice with respect to the matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted as specified. If no choice is given, a properly executed proxy will be voted in favor of the proposals.\n\n**Revocability of Proxies**\n\nEven if you execute a proxy, you retain the right to revoke it and change your vote by notifying us at any time before your proxy is voted. Such revocation may be effected by execution of a subsequently dated proxy, or by a written notice of revocation, sent to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer (the “ _CEO_ ”) of the Company at the address of the corporate headquarters of the Company set forth above in the Notice to this Proxy Statement or your attendance and voting at the Meeting. Unless so revoked, the shares represented by the proxies, if received in time, will be voted in accordance with the directions given therein.\n\nYou are requested, regardless of the number of shares you own or your intention to attend the Meeting, to sign the proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed envelope, or vote online or over the telephone according to the instructions in the proxy card.\n\n**Interests of Officers and Directors in Matters to Be Acted Upon**\n\nNo person who has been a director or executive officer of the Company at any time since the beginning of our fiscal year and no associate of any of the foregoing persons has any substantial interest, direct or indirect, in any matter to be acted upon.\n\n**Dissenters** ’**Rights of Appraisal**\n\nUnder the Nevada Revised Statutes and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, as amended, stockholders are not entitled to any appraisal or similar rights of dissenters with respect to any of the proposals to be acted upon at the Meeting.\n\n5\n\n**PROPOSAL ONE**\n\n**ELECTION OF DIRECTORS**\n\nThe Board is comprised of five (5) directors. Directors are elected annually at each annual meeting to serve until the next annual meeting or until their successors are duly elected and qualified, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. \n\nThe Board has recommended for election current directors Mark Vernon, Alexander Buehler, Peyton Boswell, Richard Meeusen and Fei Chen (each, a “ _Nominee_ ” and collectively, the “ _Nominees_ ”). Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Meeting. Shares represented by executed proxies will be voted, if authority to do so is not withheld, for the election of the Nominees. In the event that any Nominee should be unavailable for election as a result of an unexpected occurrence, such shares will be voted for the election of such substitute Nominee as the Board may propose. Each of the Nominees has agreed to serve if elected, and we have no reason to believe that they will be unable to serve.\n\nThe Nominees, their ages and current positions with the Company are as follows:\n\n**Name** |  ****Age**** |  **Title(s)**  \n---|---|---  \nMark Vernon | 69 |  Chairman of the Board  \nAlexander Buehler | 47 |  Director  \nPeyton Boswell | 51 |  Director  \nRichard Meeusen | 67 |  Director  \nFei Chen | 58 |  Director; Chief Executive Officer  \n  \nA brief biography of each Nominee is set forth below:\n\n**Mark Vernon.** Mr. Vernon has served as a Director of LiqTech International, Inc. since February 26, 2013 and as Chairman of the Board of Directors since July 2, 2018.

Proposal 1 is a “non-discretionary” or “non-routine” item, meaning that brokerage firms cannot vote shares in their discretion on behalf of a client if the client has not given voting instructions. Accordingly, if you hold your shares in street name and fail to instruct your broker to vote your shares, your shares will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1.\n\n7\n\n**THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE**\n\n**“FOR** ”\n\n**THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE NOMINEES AS DIRECTOR**\n\n8\n\n**PROPOSAL TWO**\n\n**RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS**\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board has appointed Sadler, Gibb & Associates, L.L.C. (“ _Sadler_ ”) as the Company’s independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. Although ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the appointment of Sadler to our stockholders for ratification because we value the views of our stockholders. In the event stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the appointment will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee and the Board. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. \n\nOur current principal independent registered public accountant is Sadler. During the Company’s two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, neither the Company nor anyone on its behalf consulted Sadler regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the consolidated financial statements of the Company, or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event as described above. Since December 31, 2020, and through the date hereof, there were no disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) with Sadler on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure for which disagreements, if not resolved to Sadler’s satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter in connection with their report on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for such periods. As used herein, the term “reportable event” means any of the items listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(v)(A)-(D) of Item 304 of Regulation S-K.\n\nThe Company does not expect a representative of Sadler to be present at the Meeting.\n\n**Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees & All Other Fees**\n\nAudit fees are the aggregate fees billed or expected to be billed by our independent auditors for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for the review of our quarterly financial statements. During 2021 and 2020, audit fees were $164,000 and $152,500, respectively. Our auditors did not provide any tax compliance, planning services or audit-related services for the Company. Our auditors did not provide any other services than those described above.\n\n**Audit Committee Pre-approval**\n\nThe policy of the Audit Committee is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent accountants. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax fees, and other services. Pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to certain committee members when expedition of services is necessary. The independent auditor and management are required to periodically report to the full Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent auditor in accordance with this pre-approval delegation and the fees for the services performed to date. The Audit Committee approved all of the services described above in advance during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. \n\n9\n\n**Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors**\n\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 with our management. The Audit Committee has discussed with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”). The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountants’ communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the accounting firm’s independence. Based on the foregoing, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nMembers of the Audit Committee:\n\nRichard Meeusen (chair)\n\nMark Vernon\n\nPeyton Boswell\n\nWe are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of Sadler as our independent registered public accountants.\n\nProposal 2 shall be approved if the majority of votes cast in person or by proxy are in favor of such action. Since Proposal 2 is considered a routine matter, we do not expect broker non-votes. Abstentions will not be treated as votes cast and will have no impact on the proposal.\n\n**THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE**\n\n**“FOR** ”\n\n**THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF SADLER, GIBB & ASSOCIATES, L.L.C.**\n\n**AS THE COMPANY** ’**S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2022.**\n\n10\n\n**PROPOSAL THREE**\n\n**APPROVAL OF THE LIQTECH INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2022 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN**\n\n**Background**\n\nOn September 8, 2022, the Board approved, subject to stockholder approval, the LiqTech International, Inc. 2022 Equity Incentive Plan (the “ _Plan_ ”). If the Plan is approved by our stockholders, 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock will be available for issuance under the Plan. Any awards outstanding under the 2013 LiqTech International, Inc. Share Incentive Plan (the “ _2013 Plan_ ”) on the date of stockholder approval of the Plan will remain subject to the terms of and will be issued or settled under the 2013 Plan.\n\nThe Board recommends that stockholders approve the Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to enhance the Company’s ability to attract and retain qualified officers, nonemployee directors, employees, consultants, and advisors, and to motivate those individuals to serve the Company and to improve the business results and earnings of the Company, by providing to such individuals an opportunity to acquire or increase a direct proprietary interest in the operations and future of the Company. The Plan also allows the Company to promote greater ownership in the Company by our service providers to align their interests more closely with the interests of the Company’s stockholders. Stockholder approval of the Plan will also enable the Company to grant incentive stock options (“ _ISOs_ ”) under the Plan that are designed to qualify for special tax treatment under Internal Revenue Code (the “ _Code_ ”) Section 422. All shares available for issuance under the Plan may be granted as ISOs.\n\nThe material features of the Plan are summarized below. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the specific provisions of the Plan, the full text of which is set forth as _Annex A_ to this Proxy Statement.\n\n11\n\n**Corporate Governance Aspects of Plan**\n\nThe Plan has been designed to include a number of provisions that promote sound corporate governance practices by reinforcing the alignment between incentive compensation arrangements for eligible plan participants and our stockholders’ interests. These provisions include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n● |  _Clawback_. Plan awards are subject to clawback under any applicable Company clawback policy and all applicable laws requiring the clawback of compensation.  \n---|---  \n● |  _Forfeiture upon Cause Termination_. All Plan awards held by a participant may be forfeited upon the participant’s termination for “cause” (as defined in the Plan).  \n● |  _No Discounted Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (_ “ _SARs_ ” _)_. Stock options and SARs generally may not be granted with exercise prices lower than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the grant date.  \n● |  _No Repricing without Stockholder Approval_. The Plan specifically prohibits the repricing of options or SARs without stockholder approval.  \n● |  _Limitation on Terms of Stock Options and SARs_. The maximum term of each stock option and SAR is 10 years.  \n● |  _No Transferability_. Awards generally may not be transferred, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, unless approved by the Compensation Committee.  \n● |  _No Evergreen Provision_. The Plan does not contain an “evergreen” feature pursuant to which the shares authorized for issuance will be automatically replenished.  \n● |  _No Automatic Grants_. The Plan does not provide for automatic grants to any participant.  \n● |  _No Tax Gross-Ups_. The Plan does not provide for any tax gross-ups.  \n● |  _No Single-Trigger Acceleration._ The Plan does not provide for automatic vesting upon a “change in control” (as defined in the Plan).  \n● |  _Dividends_. We do not pay dividends or dividend equivalents on stock options, SARs, or unearned performance awards under the Plan.  \n● |  _Multiple Award Types_. The Plan permits the issuance of non-qualified stock options, ISOs, SARs, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), restricted shares, and other types of equity grants, subject to the share limits of the Plan, as further described under “Types of Awards” below. This breadth of award types will enable the Compensation Committee to tailor awards in light of the accounting, tax, and other standards applicable at the time of grant. Historically, these standards have changed over time.  \n● |  _Independent Oversight_. The Plan is administered by a committee of independent Board members.  \n  \n**Summary of Plan**\n\nThe principal features of the Plan are summarized below. The following summary of the Plan does not purport to be a complete description of all of the provisions of the Plan. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Plan, which is attached to this proxy statement as _Annex A_.\n\n**_Eligibility_**\n\nAwards may be granted under the Plan to officers, employees, nonemployee directors, consultants, and advisors of the Company and its affiliates. ISOs may be granted only to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries. As of the Record Date, approximately 90 individuals would have been eligible to receive awards under the Plan (based on the flexible definition of eligible participant in the Plan), including 2 executive officers, approximately 84 employees or consultants and 4 nonemployee directors. However, the Company historically has granted awards under its equity compensation plans to a total of approximately 10 employees, consultants and directors, in the aggregate, in any given fiscal year.\n\n12\n\n**_Administration_**\n\nThe Plan may be administered by the Board or any committee or other person or persons designated by the Board to administer the Plan. The Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee the authority to administer the Plan. The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, selects the individuals to whom awards may be granted, the time or times at which such awards are granted, and the terms and conditions of such awards.\n\n**_Number of Authorized Shares_**\n\nThe number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Plan is 8,000,000 shares, representing 9.7% of the Common Stock on a fully diluted basis outstanding as of the Record Date. Stockholders will be approving this share limit as part of the approval of this Proposal 3. All shares available for issuance under the Plan may be granted as ISOs. Stockholders will be approving this ISO limit as part of the approval of this Proposal 3. The shares of Common Stock issuable under the Plan will consist of authorized and unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares purchased on the open market or otherwise.\n\nIf any award is cancelled, terminates, expires, or lapses for any reason prior to the issuance of shares or if shares are issued under the Plan and thereafter are repurchased by, forfeited to, or surrendered to the Company at no more than cost, the shares subject to such awards and the repurchased, forfeited, or surrendered shares will not count against the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available for grant under the Plan. In addition, the following items will not count against the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available for grant under the Plan: (1) the payment in cash of dividends or dividend equivalents under any outstanding award, (2) any award that is settled in cash rather than by issuance of shares of Common Stock, or (3) awards granted in assumption of or in substitution for awards previously granted by an acquired company. However, if shares issuable under an award are withheld by or surrendered to the Company in payment of the option price, purchase price, or taxes due in connection with the award, the withheld or surrendered shares will count against the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available for grant under the Plan.\n\n**_Adjustments_**\n\n_Changes in Common Stock._ If (i) the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is increased or decreased or the shares are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company on account of any recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, reverse split, combination of shares, exchange of shares, stock dividend or other distribution payable in capital stock, or other increase or decrease in the shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company occurring after the effective date of the Plan or (ii) there occurs any spin-off, split-up, extraordinary cash dividend, or other distribution of assets by the Company, then (A) the number and kinds of shares for which grants of Plan awards may be made, (B) the number and kinds of shares for which outstanding awards may be exercised or settled, and (C) the performance goals relating to outstanding awards will be equitably adjusted by the Company. In addition, in the event of any such increase or decrease in the number of outstanding shares or other transaction described in clause (ii) above, the purchase prices of outstanding options and SARs will be equitably adjusted.\n\n_Effect of a Change in Control._ In the event of a change in control (as defined in the Plan), the Compensation Committee may, but shall not be obligated to: (i) accelerate, vest or cause the restrictions to lapse with respect to all or any portion of any award; (ii) cancel awards and cause to be paid to the holders of such awards the value thereof, if any, as determined by the Compensation Committee; (iii) provide for the issuance of substitute awards or the assumption or replacement of such awards; (iv) provide written notice to grantees that for a period of at least ten days prior to the change in control, such awards shall be exercisable, to the extent applicable, and upon the occurrence of the change in control, any awards not so exercised shall terminate and be of no further force and effect; or (v) otherwise treat such awards in the manner set forth in the agreement pursuant to which the change in control is consummated.\n\n13\n\n**_Types of Awards_**\n\nThe Plan permits the granting of any or all of the following types of awards:\n\n_Stock Options_. Stock options entitle the holder to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock at a specified price (the exercise price), subject to the terms and conditions of the stock option grant. The Compensation Committee may grant either ISOs, which must comply with Code Section 422, or non-qualified stock options. The Compensation Committee sets exercise prices of stock options, except that options must be granted with an exercise price not less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant (excluding stock options granted in connection with assuming or substituting stock options in acquisition transactions). At the time of grant, the Compensation Committee also determines the other terms and conditions of stock options, including the quantity, vesting periods, term (which cannot exceed 10 years), and other conditions on exercise.\n\n_Stock Appreciation Rights_. The Compensation Committee may grant SARs as a right in tandem with the number of shares underlying stock options granted under the Plan or as a freestanding award. Upon exercise, SARs entitle the holder to receive payment per share in stock or cash, or in a combination of stock and cash, equal to the excess of the share’s fair market value on the date of exercise over the grant price of the SAR. The grant price of a tandem SAR is equal to the exercise price of the related stock option, and the grant price of a freestanding SAR is determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with the procedures described above for stock options. Exercise of a SAR issued in tandem with a stock option will reduce the number of shares underlying the related stock option to the extent of the SAR exercised. The term of a freestanding SAR cannot exceed 10 years, and the term of a tandem SAR cannot exceed the term of the related stock option.\n\n_Restricted Shares, RSUs, and Other Stock-Based Awards_. The Compensation Committee may grant restricted shares, which are shares of our common stock subject to specified restrictions, and RSUs, which represent the right to receive shares of our common stock in the future. These awards may be made subject to repurchase, forfeiture, or vesting restrictions at the Compensation Committee’s discretion. The restrictions may be based on continuous service with the Company or the attainment of specified performance goals, as determined by the Compensation Committee. RSUs may be paid in stock or cash or a combination of stock and cash, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may also grant other types of equity or equity-based awards subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and any other terms and conditions determined by the Compensation Committee.\n\n_Performance Awards_. The Compensation Committee may grant performance awards, which entitle participants to receive a payment from the Company, the amount of which is based on the attainment of performance goals established by the Compensation Committee over a specified award period. Performance awards may be denominated in shares of our common stock or in cash and may be paid in stock or cash or a combination of stock and cash, as determined by the Compensation Committee.\n\n**_Clawback_**\n\nAll awards granted under the Plan will be subject to all applicable laws regarding the recovery of erroneously awarded compensation, any implementing rules and regulations under such laws, any policies adopted by the Company to implement such requirements, and any other compensation recovery policies as may be adopted from time to time by the Company.\n\n**_Section 162(m)_**\n\nUnder Code Section 162(m), we may be prohibited from deducting compensation paid to certain of our executive officers in excess of $1 million per person in any year.\n\n**_Transferability_**\n\nAwards under the Plan are not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, except that in certain instances where approved by the Compensation Committee, transfers may be made to or for the benefit of designated family members of the participant for no value.\n\n14\n\n**_Term, Termination, and Amendment of the Plan_**\n\nUnless earlier terminated by the Board, the Plan will terminate on, and no further awards may be granted after, the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan. The Board may amend, suspend, or terminate the Plan at any time, except that, if required by applicable law, regulation, or stock exchange rule, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment. The amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan or the amendment of an outstanding award generally may not, without a participant’s consent, materially impair the participant’s rights under an outstanding award.\n\n**New Plan Benefits**\n\nIf the Plan is approved by our stockholders, there will be 8,000,000 shares available under the Plan for awards to officers, employees, nonemployee directors, consultants, and advisors. The benefits to be received by grantees in the normal course under the Plan cannot be determined at this time because grants under the Plan are made at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.\n\n**Equity Compensation Plan Table**\n\nThe following table presents information on the Company’s equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2021. All outstanding awards relate to our common stock.\n\n**Plan Category** |  **Number of** **Securities to** **Be Issued** **upon** **Exercise** **of** **Outstanding** **Options,** **Warrants,** **and Rights** |  **Weighted-** **Average** **Exercise** **Price of** **Outstanding** **Options,** **Warrants,** **and Rights** |  ********Number of******** ********Securities** **Remaining******** ********Available for** **Future Issuance******** ********under** **Equity******** ********Compensation** **Plans********  \n---|---|---|---  \nEquity compensation plans approved by security holders | — | —  \nEquity compensation plans not approved by security holders | — | — | 1,987,113 | (1 | )  \n**Total** | — | — | 1,987,113 | (1 | )  \n  \n(1) On August 21, 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the 2013 Plan. The 2013 Plan authorized awards that equal 10% of the total outstanding shares of Common Stock on an as-converted basis as of August 21, 2013, (612,788 shares of Common Stock), plus an increase of that number of shares of Common Stock to be added on each of the third, sixth and ninth anniversary of the 2013 Plan’s effectiveness. Accordingly, on August 21, 2022, 4,388,853 shares of Common Stock became authorized under the 2013 Plan.\n\n**Federal Income Tax Information**\n\nThe following is a brief summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Plan generally applicable to the Company and to participants in the Plan who are subject to U.S. federal taxes. The summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), applicable Treasury Regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date of this proxy statement, and is, therefore, subject to future changes in the law, possibly with retroactive effect. The summary is general in nature and does not purport to be legal or tax advice. Furthermore, the summary does not address issues relating to any U.S. gift or estate tax consequences or the consequences of any state, local, or foreign tax laws.\n\n_Non-qualified Stock Options_. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant or vesting of a non-qualified stock option with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and no additional deferral feature. Upon the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, a participant generally will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares underlying the stock option on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option. When a participant sells the shares, the participant will have a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, as the case may be, equal to the difference between the amount the participant received from the sale and the tax basis of the shares sold. The tax basis of the shares generally will be equal to the greater of the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date or the exercise price of the stock option.\n\n15\n\n_Incentive Stock Options_. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant of an ISO. If a participant exercises an ISO during employment or within three months after employment ends (12 months in the case of permanent and total disability), the participant will not recognize taxable income at the time of exercise for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes (although the participant generally will have taxable income for alternative minimum tax purposes at that time). If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of the shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO after the later of (1) one year from the date the participant exercised the option or (2) two years from the grant date of the option, the participant generally will recognize long-term capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount the participant received in the disposition and the exercise price of the stock option. If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO before these holding period requirements are satisfied, the disposition will constitute a “disqualifying disposition,” and the participant generally will recognize taxable ordinary income in the year of disposition equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price of the stock option (or, if less, the excess of the amount realized on the disposition of the shares over the exercise price of the stock option). The balance of the participant’s gain on a disqualifying disposition, if any, will be taxed as a short-term or long-term capital gain, as the case may be.\n\nWith respect to both non-qualified stock options and ISOs, special rules apply if a participant uses shares of common stock already held by the participant to pay the exercise price or if the shares received upon exercise of the stock option are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture by the participant.\n\n_Stock Appreciation Rights_. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant or vesting of a SAR with a grant price at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and no additional deferral feature. Upon the exercise of a SAR, a participant generally will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares underlying the SAR on the date of exercise and the grant price of the SAR.\n\n_Restricted Shares, RSUs, and Performance Awards_. A participant generally will not have taxable income upon the grant of restricted shares, RSUs, or performance awards. Instead, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of vesting or payout equal to the fair market value (on the vesting or payout date) of the shares or cash received minus any amount paid. For restricted shares only, a participant may instead elect to be taxed at the time of grant.\n\n_Other Stock-Based Awards_. The U.S. federal income tax consequences of other stock-based awards will depend upon the specific terms and conditions of each award.\n\n_Tax Consequences to the Company_. In the foregoing cases, we may be entitled to a deduction at the same time, and in the same amount, as a participant recognizes ordinary income, subject to certain limitations imposed under the Code (specifically, Code Section 162(m)).\n\n_Code Section 409A_. We intend that awards granted under the Plan will comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, Code Section 409A, but make no representation or warranty to that effect.\n\n_Tax Withholding_. We are authorized to deduct or withhold from any award granted or payment due under the Plan, or require a participant to remit to us, the amount of any withholding taxes due in respect of the award or payment and to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy all obligations for the payment of applicable withholding taxes. We are not required to issue any shares of common stock or otherwise settle an award under the Plan until all tax withholding obligations are satisfied.\n\n16\n\n**Vote Required**\n\nApproval of the Plan requires a number of “FOR” votes that is a majority of the shares of common stock represented at the meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on this Proposal 3. Proposal 3 is a “non-discretionary” or “non-routine” item, meaning that brokerage firms cannot vote shares in their discretion on behalf of a client if the client has not given voting instructions. Accordingly, if you hold your shares in street name and fail to instruct your broker to vote your shares, your shares will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 3.\n\n**THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE**\n\n**“FOR** ” **APPROVAL OF**\n\n**THE LIQTECH INTERNATIONAL, INC. 2022 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN**\n\n17\n\n**CORPORATE GOVERNANCE**\n\n**Committees of our Board of Directors**\n\n**_Committee Composition_**\n\nThe Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Governance and Nominating Committee. The following table sets forth the current membership of each of these committees:\n\n**Audit Committee** |  **Compensation Committee** |  **Governance and Nominating** **Committee**  \n---|---|---  \nRichard Meeusen* |  Richard Meeusen * |  Mark Vernon *  \nMark Vernon |  Peyton Boswell |  Richard Meeusen  \nPeyton Boswell |  Mark Vernon |  Peyton Boswell  \n  \n* Chairman of the committee\n\n**_Audit Committee_**\n\nThe Audit Committee consists of Richard Meeusen (Chairman), Mark Vernon, and Peyton Boswell, each of whom is an independent director as defined under the rules of The Nasdaq Capital Market and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ _SEC_ ”). Based upon past employment experience in finance and other business experience requiring accounting knowledge and financial sophistication, our Board has determined that Mr. Meeusen is an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K, and that each member of our Audit Committee is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements. We have implemented a written charter, available at _www.liqtech.com_ , for our Audit Committee, which provides that our Audit Committee is responsible for:\n\n● appointing, compensating, retaining, overseeing and terminating our independent auditors and pre-approving all audit and non-audit services permitted to be performed by the independent auditors;\n\n● discussing with management and the independent auditors our annual audited financial statements, our internal control over financial reporting, and related matters;\n\n● reviewing and approving any related party transactions;\n\n● meeting separately, periodically, with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors;\n\n● annually reviewing and reassessing the adequacy of our Audit Committee charter;\n\n● such other matters that are specifically delegated to our Audit Committee by our Board of Directors from time to time; and\n\n● reporting regularly to the Board of Directors.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Audit Committee met four times.\n\n18\n\n**_Compensation Committee_**\n\nOur Compensation Committee consists of Richard Meeusen (Chair), Mark Vernon and Peyton Boswell, each of whom is an independent director as defined under the NASDAQ rules, a “non-employee director” under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and an “outside director” for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code. We have implemented a written charter for our Compensation Committee, available at _www.liqtech.com_ , which provides that our Compensation Committee is responsible for:\n\n● reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding our compensation policies and forms of compensation provided to our directors and officers;\n\n● reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding bonuses for our executive officers;\n\n● reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding stock-based compensation for our directors and officers;\n\n● annually reviewing and reassessing the adequacy of the Compensation Committee Charter;\n\n● administering any stock option plans in accordance with the terms thereof; and\n\n● such other matters that are specifically delegated to the Compensation Committee by the Board from time to time.\n\nThe Compensation Committee has the principal responsibility for the compensation plans of the Company, particularly as applied to the compensation of executive officers and directors. The Compensation Committee Charter sets forth the authority and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee for the performance evaluation and compensation of the Company’s CEO, executive officers and directors, and significant compensation arrangements, plans, policies and programs of the Company. The Compensation Committee has authority to retain such outside counsel, experts and other advisors as it determines to be necessary to carry out its responsibilities, including the authority to approve an external advisor’s fees and other retention terms on behalf of the Company. Pursuant to the Compensation Committee Charter, the Company shall provide appropriate funding to the Compensation Committee, as determined by the Compensation Committee in its capacity as a Committee of the Board, for payment of compensation to any outside advisors engaged by the Compensation Committee.\n\nThe Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves the corporate goals and objectives relevant to CEO compensation and evaluates the CEO’s performance in light of such goals and objectives. Based on this evaluation the Compensation Committee makes and annually reviews decisions regarding: (i) salary paid to the CEO; (ii) the grant of all cash-based bonuses and equity compensation to the CEO; (iii) the entering into or amendment or extension of any employment contract or similar arrangement with the CEO; (iv) any CEO severance or change in control arrangement; and (v) any other CEO compensation matters as from time to time may be directed by the Board. In determining the long-term incentive component(s) of the CEO’s compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the Company’s performance and relative stockholder return, the value of similar incentive awards to chief executive officers at companies that the Compensation Committee determines comparable based on factors it selects and the incentive awards given to the Company’s CEO in prior years.\n\n19\n\nThe Compensation Committee also meets with the CEO within 90 days after the commencement of each fiscal year to discuss the compensation programs to be in effect for the Company’s executive officers for such fiscal year and to review and approve the corporate goals and objectives relevant to those programs. In light of these goals and objectives, the Compensation Committee makes and annually reviews decisions regarding: (i) salary paid to the executive officers; (ii) the grant of cash-based bonuses and equity compensation provided to the executive officers; (iii) performance targets for executive officers; (iv) the entering into or amendment or extension of any employment contract or similar arrangement with the executive officers; (v) executive officers’ severance or change in control arrangements; and (vi) any other executive officer compensation matters as from time to time may be directed by the Board. In determining the long-term incentive component(s) of the executive officer’s compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the Company’s performance and relative stockholder return, the value of similar incentive awards to executive officers at companies that the Compensation Committee determines comparable based on factors it selects and the incentive awards given to the Company’s executive officers in prior years.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Compensation Committee met three times.\n\n**_Governance and Nominating Committee_**\n\nOur Governance and Nominating Committee consists of Mark Vernon (Chair), Peyton Boswell and Richard Meeusen, each of whom is an independent director as defined under the NASDAQ rules. We have implemented corporate governance guidelines as well as a written charter for our Governance and Nominating Committee, available at _www.liqtech.com_ , which provides that our Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for:\n\n● overseeing the process by which individuals may be nominated to our Board of Directors;\n\n● identifying potential directors and making recommendations as to the size, functions and composition of our Board of Directors and its committees;\n\n● considering nominees proposed by our stockholders;\n\n● establishing and periodically assessing the criteria for the selection of potential directors;\n\n● making recommendations to the Board of Directors on new candidates for Board membership; and\n\n● overseeing corporate governance matters.\n\nIn making nominations, the Governance and Nominating Committee intends to submit candidates who have high personal and professional integrity, who have demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment and who are effective, in conjunction with the other nominees to the Board, in collectively serving the long-term interests of the stockholders. In evaluating nominees, the Governance and Nominating Committee intends to take into consideration attributes such as leadership, independence, interpersonal skills, financial acumen, business experiences and industry knowledge.\n\nOne of the primary responsibilities of the Governance and Nominating Committee is to make appropriate recommendations to the Board for the appointment or re-appointment of directors. The Company seeks to have directors who, in addition to relevant technical, commercial and securities expertise, meet the highest standards of personal integrity, judgment and critical thinking, and an ability to work in an open environment with other directors to further the interests of the Company and its stockholders. In recommending appointments to the Board, the Governance and Nominating Committee is mindful of the overall balance of the skills, knowledge and experience of Board members against the current and future requirements of the Company and of the benefits of diversity. The Company recognizes the importance of diversity at all levels of the Company as well as on the Board and considers overall Board balance and diversity when appointing new directors. Board appointments are, in the final analysis, made on merit.\n\nThe Company employs multiple strategies in identifying director nominees, including the obtaining of recommendations from security holders, recommendations from current directors, and from the Company’s corporate advisors. The Company also utilizes professional recruitment firms, as may be required, in seeking qualified director nominees. The qualifications of director nominees are evaluated by the Governance and Nominating Committee to determine if the director nominees have the requisite technical and commercial expertise to maintain a proper balance of skills required by the Board. There are no differences in the evaluation of director nominees recommended by security holders. Director nominees are interviewed in depth by the Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board to further qualify the director nominees and evaluate the personal integrity and character of the candidate.\n\n20\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the Governance and Nominating Committee met one time.\n\n**Director Independence**\n\nThe Board has determined that on the date of the Meeting, Messrs. Vernon, Buehler, Boswell, and Meeusen are independent as that term is defined in the listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market. Pursuant to the Nasdaq Rules, Mr. Buehler was not independent while serving as the Interim Chief Executive Officer, but such service on an interim basis did not disqualify him from being considered independent following such service, as the interim service did not last longer than one year. In addition, the compensation Mr. Buehler received for his CEO transition services after the termination of his service as Interim Chief Executive Officer was less than $120,000. In making its determinations, our Board has concluded that none of our independent directors has an employment, business, family or other relationship which, in the opinion of our Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. We expect that our independent directors will meet in executive session (without the participation of executive officers or other non-independent directors) at least two times each year, and Mark Vernon presides over such meetings of independent directors.\n\n**Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation**\n\nNone of our directors who currently serves as a member of our Compensation Committee is, or has at any time during the past year been, one of our officers or employees. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the Board or compensation committee of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board or Compensation Committee.\n\n**Board Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight**\n\nThe Board does not have a policy as to whether the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer should be separate or combined. Each year, the Governance and Nominating Committee assesses these roles and the board leadership structure to ensure the interests of the Company and its stockholders are best served. Currently, the independent non-executive Chairman position is held by Mark Vernon and the Chief Executive Officer is Fei Chen.\n\nThe Committees of the Board, each comprised entirely of independent directors, play an active role in risk management and oversight for the Company. The Audit Committee assists the Board with respect to risk assessment and risk management related to financial reporting and other matters that could affect the Company’s financial statements. The Governance and Nominating Committee is charged with assisting the Board in corporate governance matters, conflicts of interest, the Company’s Code of Conduct and Ethics and other risk mitigation activities. The Compensation Committee is charged with assisting the Board in reviewing the Company’s overall compensation policies and practices for all employees as they relate to the Company’s risk.\n\n**Director Qualifications**\n\nThe following is a brief description of the specific experience and qualifications, attributes or skills of each director that led to the conclusion that such person should serve as a director of the Company. Based on the attributes and skills of each director, the Company’s leadership structure is appropriate. The Board plays an active role in the risk oversight of the Company.\n\n21\n\nMr. Vernon’s extensive global experience in the industrial engineering industry provides the Board with valuable insight in the markets the Company serves, as well as proven management and public company Board expertise.\n\nMr. Buehler’s experience in general management and strategic planning as well as new product development, corporate development, mergers & acquisitions, operations management, manufacturing process optimization, sales management, and back-office administration provides the Board with valuable perspective across all corporate functions and relevant industries. Mr. Buehler has substantial experience in the global water, oil & gas, and manufacturing industries. Mr. Buehler has been determined by our Board to be an Audit Committee Financial Expert. \n\nMr. Boswell’s experience in establishing and growing a successful renewable energy clean tech business and prior experience in investment banking provides the Board with a unique perspective on corporate finance and strategic growth matters. Further, the Board has determined that he qualifies as an Audit Committee Financial Expert.\n\nMr. Meeusen’s prior experience in finance, operations, marketing and sales along with his leadership experience as a director of a publicly traded company and his long executive management responsibility in the water industry and in developing technology growth business distinguishes him as an integral part of the Company’s Board.\n\nMs. Chen’s substantial leadership experience with an emphasis on expansion and commercial scaling, and her particular industry knowledge of water treatment, chemical, and clean energy operations, make her a valuable member of the Board.\n\n**Board Meetings**\n\nThe Board held sixteen meetings during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Each incumbent director attended greater than seventy-five percent (75%) of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board (held during the period for which each director has been a director) and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which each director served (during the period for which each director has been a director).\n\nThe Board encourages all of its members to attend its Board meetings.\n\n**Board Diversity Matrix**\n\n**Total Number of Directors:** |  5  \n---|---  \nFemale |  Male |  Non-Binary |  Did Not Disclose Gender  \nDirectors’ Gender: |  1 |  4 |  - |  -  \n**Number of Directors who identify in any of the categories below:**  \nAfrican American or Black |  - |  - |  - |  -  \nAlaskan Native |  - |  - |  - |  -  \nAsian |  1 |  - |  - |  -  \nHispanic |  - |  - |  - |  -  \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander |  - |  - |  - |  -  \nWhite |  - |  3 |  - |  -  \nTwo or More Races or Ethnicities |  - |  1 |  - |  -  \nLGBTQ+ |  - |  - |  -  \nDid Not Disclose Demographic Background  \n  \n22\n\n**Code of Ethics**\n\nEffective January 1, 2012, the Board adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics with the purpose of assuring that all employees and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries understand and adhere to high ethical standards of conduct. The Code of Conducts and Ethics emphasizes employees’ obligations of civil responsibility, loyalty to the Company, compliance with applicable laws, non-disclosure of trade secrets, and abstinence from improper political payments and activity. A copy of the Code of Conduct and Ethics is available on the Company website at _https://liqtech.com/media/afijs2es/code_of_conduct_and_ethics.pdf_. \n\n**Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports**\n\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires a company’s officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent (10%) of a registered class of a company’s equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors, and greater than ten percent (10%) stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. \n\nTo our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us, we believe that all filing requirements applicable to our directors, executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock were complied with during 2021, except for the following filings:\n\n● |  Mr. Buehler filed a late Form 4 on January 14, 2021  \n---|---  \n● |  Mr, Vernon filed a late Form 4 on January 19, 2021  \n---|---  \n● |  Mr. Boswell filed a late Form 4 on January 22, 2021  \n---|---  \n● |  Mr. Boswell filed a late Form 4 on April 27, 2021  \n---|---  \n● |  Mr. Mathiesen filed a late Form 4 on October 8, 2021  \n---|---  \n● |  Mr. Stadil filed a late Form 3 on December 14, 2021.  \n---|---  \n  \n23\n\n**EXECUTIVE OFFICERS**\n\n**General**\n\nCertain information concerning our executive officers as of the date of this Proxy Statement is set forth below. Each officer of the Company shall be elected by the Board, may be classified by the Board as an executive officer or a non-executive officer (or as a non-officer) at any time, and shall serve at the pleasure of the Board. None of our executive officers or directors are related by blood, marriage or adoption.\n\nName |  Age |  Titles  \n---|---|---  \nFei Chen |  58 |  Director, Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer)  \nSimon Stadil |  39 |  Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer)  \n  \nA brief biography of the executive officer who is not also a Nominee is set forth below:\n\n**Simon Stadil.** Mr. Stadil, age 39, served as Director of Treasury & Investor Relations (2013-2016), Regional CFO Americas and Africa (2017-2019), and Vice President of Global Finance (2019-2021) of Welltec, an international provider of robotic well solutions for the oil and gas industry with approximately $250 million in annual revenue.

Subject to **Section** **3.2** , the Board shall have the right to make Awards in substitution or exchange for any other award under another plan of the Company, any Affiliate, or any business entity to be acquired by the Company or an Affiliate. In addition, Awards may be granted in lieu of cash compensation, including in lieu of cash amounts payable under other plans of the Company or any Affiliate, in which the value of Shares subject to the Award is equivalent in value to the cash compensation (for example, RSUs or Restricted Shares).\n\n9\n\n**7.** |  **AWARD AGREEMENT**  \n---|---  \n  \nEach Award shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement, in such form or forms as the Board shall from time to time determine. Without limiting the foregoing, an Award Agreement may be provided in the form of a notice that provides that acceptance of the Award constitutes acceptance of all terms and conditions of the Plan and the notice. Award Agreements granted from time to time or at the same time need not contain similar terms and conditions but shall be consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan. Each Award Agreement evidencing an Award of Options shall specify whether such Options are intended to be Nonstatutory Stock Options or Incentive Stock Options, and in the absence of such specification such options shall be deemed Nonstatutory Stock Options.\n\n**8.** |  **TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS**  \n---|---  \n**8.1.** |  **Option Price**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Option Price of each Option shall be fixed by the Board and stated in the related Award Agreement. Each Option shall be separately designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or Nonqualified Option. The Option Price of each Option shall be at least the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date. In the event that a Grantee is a Ten Percent Stockholder as of the Grant Date, the Option Price of an Option granted to such Grantee that is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall be not less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date. In no case shall the Option Price of any Option be less than the par value of a Share.\n\n**8.2.** |  **Vesting**  \n---|---  \n  \nSubject to **Section** **8.3** , each Option shall become exercisable at such times and under such terms and conditions (including performance requirements) as may be determined by the Board and stated in the Award Agreement. The Board may, but shall not be required to, provide for an acceleration of vesting and exercisability in the terms of any Award Agreement upon the occurrence of a specified event and at any time after the Grant Date of the Award.\n\n**8.3.** |  **Term**  \n---|---  \n  \nEach Option shall terminate, and all rights to purchase Shares thereunder shall cease, upon the expiration of a period not to exceed 10years from the Grant Date, or under such circumstances and on any date before 10 years from the Grant Date as may be set forth in the Plan or as may be fixed by the Board and stated in the related Award Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the Grantee is a Ten Percent Stockholder, an Option granted to such Grantee that is intended to be an Incentive Stock Option at the Grant Date shall not be exercisable after the expiration of five years from its Grant Date.\n\n10\n\n**8.4.** |  **Limitations on Exercise of Option**  \n---|---  \n  \nNotwithstanding any other term or condition of the Plan, in no event may any Option be exercised, in whole or in part, (i) prior to the date the Plan is approved by stockholders of the Company as provided herein, or (ii) after the occurrence of an event that results in termination of the Option.\n\n**8.5.** |  **Method of Exercise**  \n---|---  \n  \nAn Option that is exercisable may be exercised by the Grantee’s delivery of a notice of exercise to the Company, setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied by full payment for the Shares. To be effective, notice of exercise must be made in accordance with procedures established by the Company from time to time. No Option may be exercised for a fraction of a Share.\n\n**8.6.** |  **Rights of Holders of Options**  \n---|---  \n  \nUnless otherwise stated in the related Award Agreement, an individual holding or exercising an Option shall have none of the rights of a Stockholder (for example, the right to receive cash or dividend payments or distributions attributable to the subject Shares or to direct the voting of the subject Shares) until the Shares covered thereby are fully paid and issued to him. Except as provided in **Section 15** or the related Award Agreement, no adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions, or other rights for which the record date is before the date of such issuance.\n\n**8.7.** |  **Limitations on Incentive Stock Options**  \n---|---  \n  \nAn Option shall constitute an Incentive Stock Option only (i) if the Grantee of the Option is an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary; (ii) to the extent specifically provided in the related Award Agreement; and (iii) to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time the Option is granted) of the Shares with respect to which all Incentive Stock Options held by such Grantee become exercisable for the first time during any calendar year (under the Plan and all other plans of the Company and its Affiliates) does not exceed $100,000. This limitation shall be applied by taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted. No Option shall be treated as an Incentive Stock Option unless the Plan has been approved by the Stockholders in a manner intended to comply with the stockholder approval requirements of Code Section 422, _provided_ that any Option intended to be an Incentive Stock Option shall not fail to be effective solely on account of a failure to obtain such approval, but rather such Option shall be treated as a Nonstatutory Stock Option unless and until such approval is obtained.\n\n**8.8.** |  **Early Exercise**  \n---|---  \n  \nAn Option may include a term that allows the Grantee to elect at any time before the Grantee’s Separation from Service to exercise the Option as to any part or all of the Shares subject to the Option prior to the full vesting of the Option. Any unvested Shares so purchased shall be subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company and to any other restrictions the Board determines to be appropriate.\n\n11\n\n**9.** |  **TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SAR****s)**  \n---|---  \n**9.1.** |  **Right to Payment**  \n---|---  \n  \nA SAR shall confer on the Grantee a right to receive, upon exercise thereof, the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise over (ii) the SAR Exercise Price. The Award Agreement for a SAR (except those that constitute Substitute Awards) shall specify the SAR Exercise Price, which shall be fixed on the Grant Date as not less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on that date. SARs may be granted alone or in conjunction with all or part of an Option or at any subsequent time during the term of such Option or in conjunction with all or part of any other Award. A SAR granted in tandem with an outstanding Option after the Grant Date of such Option shall have a SAR Exercise Price that is equal to the Option Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that the SAR Exercise Price may not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date of the SAR to the extent required by Section 409A.\n\n**9.2.** |  **Other Terms**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Board shall determine at the Grant Date the time or times at which and the circumstances under which a SAR may be exercised in whole or in part (including based on achievement of performance goals and/or future service requirements), the time or times at which SARs shall cease to be or become exercisable after Separation from Service or upon other terms or conditions, the method of exercise, whether or not a SAR shall be in tandem or in combination with any other Award, and any other terms and conditions of any SAR.\n\n**9.3.** |  **Term of SARs**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe term of a SAR granted under the Plan shall be determined by the Board and stated in the related Award Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such term shall not exceed 10 years.\n\n**9.4.** |  **Payment of SAR Amount**  \n---|---  \n  \nUpon exercise of a SAR, a Grantee shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company (in cash or Shares) in an amount determined by multiplying:\n\n(i) the difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the SAR Exercise Price; by\n\n(ii) the number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.\n\n**10.** |  **TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED SHARES AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSU****s)**  \n---|---  \n**10.1.** |  **Restrictions**  \n---|---  \n  \nAt the time of grant, the Board may establish a period of time (a “**Restricted Period** ”) and any additional restrictions including the satisfaction of corporate or individual performance objectives applicable to an Award of Restricted Shares or RSUs in accordance with **Section** **12**. Each Award of Restricted Shares or RSUs may be subject to a different Restricted Period and additional restrictions. Neither Restricted Shares nor RSUs may be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, or otherwise encumbered or disposed of during the Restricted Period or before the satisfaction of any other applicable restrictions.\n\n12\n\n**10.2.** |  **Restricted Share Certificates**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company shall issue, in the name of each Grantee to whom Restricted Shares have been granted, stock certificates or other evidence of ownership representing the total number of Restricted Shares granted to the Grantee, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Grant Date. The Board may provide in an Award Agreement that either (i) the Secretary of the Company shall hold such certificates for the Grantee’s benefit until such time as the Restricted Shares are forfeited to the Company or the restrictions lapse, or (ii) such certificates shall be delivered to the Grantee; provided, however, that such certificates shall bear a legend or legends that comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and make appropriate reference to the restrictions imposed under the Plan and the Award Agreement.\n\n**10.3.** |  **Rights of Holders of Restricted Shares**  \n---|---  \n  \nUnless the Board otherwise provides in an Award Agreement and subject to**Section** **17.10** , holders of Restricted Shares shall have rights as Stockholders, including voting and dividend rights.\n\n**10.4.** |  **Rights of Holders of RSUs**  \n---|---  \n**10.4.1.** |  **Settlement of RSUs**  \n---|---  \n  \nRSUs may be settled in cash or Shares, as determined by the Board and set forth in the Award Agreement. The Award Agreement shall also set forth whether the RSUs shall be settled (i) within the time period specified for “short term deferrals” under Section 409A or (ii) otherwise within the requirements of Section 409A, in which case the Award Agreement shall specify upon which events such RSUs shall be settled.\n\n**10.4.2.** |  **Voting and Dividend Rights**  \n---|---  \n  \nUnless otherwise stated in the applicable Award Agreement and subject to **Section** **17.10** , holders of RSUs shall not have rights as Stockholders, including no voting or dividend or dividend equivalents rights.\n\n**10.4.3.** |  **Creditor** ’**s Rights**  \n---|---  \n  \nA holder of RSUs shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. RSUs represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, subject to the applicable Award Agreement.\n\n**10.5.** |  **Purchase of Restricted Shares**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Grantee shall be required, to the extent required by applicable law, to purchase Restricted Shares from the Company at a Purchase Price equal to the greater of (i) the aggregate par value of the Restricted Shares or (ii) the Purchase Price, if any, specified in the related Award Agreement. If specified in the Award Agreement, the Purchase Price may be deemed paid by services already rendered. The Purchase Price shall be payable in a form described in **Section** **11** or, if permitted by the Board, in consideration for past services rendered.\n\n13\n\n**10.6.** |  **Delivery of Shares**  \n---|---  \n  \nUpon the expiration or termination of any Restricted Period and the satisfaction of any other terms and conditions prescribed by the Board, the restrictions applicable to Restricted Shares or RSUs settled in Shares shall lapse, and, unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, a stock certificate for such Shares shall be delivered, free of all such restrictions, to the Grantee or the Grantee’s beneficiary or estate, as the case may be.\n\n**11.** |  **FORM OF PAYMENT FOR OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES**  \n---|---  \n**11.1.** |  **General Rule**  \n---|---  \n  \nPayment of the Option Price for an Option or the Purchase Price for Restricted Shares shall be made in (i) cash or cash equivalents, denominated in U.S. Dollars, (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, cash or cash equivalents, in Danish Krone, or (iii) cash or cash equivalents denominated in any other local currency as approved by the Committee, except as provided in this **Section** **11**. Notwithstanding any provision of this **Section 11** , during any period for which the Common Stock is publicly traded (i.e., the Common Stock is listed on any established stock exchange or a national market system) an exercise by a Non-Employee Director or officer that involves or may involve a direct or indirect extension of credit or arrangement of an extension of credit by the Company, directly or indirectly, in violation of Section 402(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 shall be prohibited with respect to any Award under this Plan.\n\n**11.2.** |  **Surrender of Shares**  \n---|---  \n  \nTo the extent the Award Agreement so provides, payment of the Option Price for an Option or the Purchase Price for Restricted Shares may be made all or in part through the tender to, or withholding by, the Company of Shares that shall be valued, for purposes of determining the extent to which the Option Price or Purchase Price for Restricted Shares has been paid thereby, at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise or surrender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the right to make payment in the form of already owned Shares may be authorized only at the time of grant.\n\n**11.3.** |  **Cashless Exercise**  \n---|---  \n  \nWith respect to an Option only (and not with respect to Restricted Shares), to the extent permitted by law and to the extent the Award Agreement so provides, payment of the Option Price may be made all or in part by delivery (on a form acceptable to the Company) of an irrevocable direction to a licensed securities broker acceptable to the Company to sell Shares and to deliver all or part of the sales proceeds to the Company in payment of the Option Price and any withholding taxes described in **Section** **17.3**.\n\n14\n\n**11.4.** |  **Other Forms of Payment**  \n---|---  \n  \nTo the extent the Award Agreement so provides, payment of the Option Price or the Purchase Price for Restricted Shares may be made in any other form that is consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and rules, including the Company’s withholding of Shares otherwise due to the exercising Grantee.\n\n**12.** |  **PERFORMANCE AWARDS**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe right of a Grantee to exercise or receive a grant or settlement of any Award, and the timing thereof, may be subject to such performance terms conditions as may be specified by the Board. The Board may use such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance terms or conditions.\n\n**13.** |  **OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS**  \n---|---  \n**13.1.** |  **Grant of Other Stock-based Awards**  \n---|---  \n  \nOther Stock-based Awards may be granted either alone or in addition to or in conjunction with other Awards. Other Stock-based Awards may be granted in lieu of other cash or other compensation to which a Service Provider is entitled from the Company or may be used in the settlement of amounts payable in Shares under any other compensation plan or arrangement of the Company. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Board shall determine the persons to whom and the time or times at which such Awards may be made, the number of Shares to be granted under such Awards, and all other terms and conditions of such Awards. Unless the Board determines otherwise, any such Award shall be confirmed by an Award Agreement, which shall contain such terms and conditions as the Board determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of the Plan with respect to such Award.\n\n**13.2.** |  **Terms of Other Stock-based Awards**  \n---|---  \n  \nAny Shares subject to Awards made under this **Section** **13** may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, or otherwise encumbered before the date on which the Shares are issued, or, if later, the date on which any applicable restriction, performance, or deferral period lapses.\n\n**14.** |  **REQUIREMENTS OF LAW**  \n---|---  \n**14.1.** |  **General**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company shall not be required to sell or issue any Shares under any Award if the sale or issuance of such Shares would constitute a violation by the Grantee, any other individual, or the Company of any law or regulation of any governmental authority, including any federal or state securities laws or regulations. If at any time the Company determines that the listing, registration, or qualification of any Shares subject to an Award upon any securities exchange or under any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a term or condition of, or in connection with, the issuance or purchase of Shares hereunder, no Shares may be issued or sold to the Grantee or any other individual exercising an Option unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any terms and conditions not acceptable to the Company, and any delay caused thereby shall in no way affect the date of termination of the Award. Specifically, in connection with the Securities Act, upon the exercise of any Option or the delivery of any Shares underlying an Award, unless a registration statement under such Act is in effect with respect to the Shares covered by such Award, the Company shall not be required to sell or issue such Shares unless the Board has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Grantee or any other individual exercising an Option may acquire such Shares under an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, register any securities covered hereby under the Securities Act. The Company shall not be obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the exercise of an Option or the issuance of Shares under the Plan to comply with any law or regulation of any governmental authority. As to any jurisdiction that expressly imposes the requirement that an Option shall not be exercisable until the Shares covered by such Option are registered or are exempt from registration, the exercise of such Option (under circumstances in which the laws of such jurisdiction apply) shall be deemed conditioned upon the effectiveness of such registration or the availability of such an exemption. The Board may require the Grantee to sign such additional documentation, make such representations, and furnish such information as the Board may consider appropriate in connection with the grant of Awards or issuance or delivery of Shares in compliance with applicable laws.\n\n15\n\n**14.2.** |  **Rule 16b-3**  \n---|---  \n  \nDuring any time when the Company has a class of equity security registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, it is the intent of the Company that Awards and the exercise of Options granted to officers and directors hereunder will qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. To the extent that any term or condition of the Plan or action by the Board does not comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3, it shall be deemed inoperative to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Board, and shall not affect the validity of the Plan. In the event that Rule 16b-3 is revised or replaced, the Board may modify the Plan in any respect necessary to satisfy the requirements of, or to take advantage of any features of, the revised exemption or its replacement.\n\n**14.3.** |  **California Grantees**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Plan is intended to comply with Section 25102(o) of the California Corporations Code, to the extent applicable. In that regard, to the extent required by Section 25102(o), (i) the terms of any Options or SARs, to the extent vested and exercisable upon a Grantee’s Separation from Service, shall include any minimum exercise periods following Separation from Service specified by Section 25102(o) and (ii) any repurchase right of the Company with respect to Issued Shares shall include the applicable notice requirement. Any Plan term that is inconsistent with Section 25102(o) shall, without further act or amendment by the Company or the Board, be reformed to comply with the requirements of Section 25102(o).\n\n**15.** |  **EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION**  \n---|---  \n**15.1.** |  **Changes in Common Stock**  \n---|---  \n  \nIf (i) the number of outstanding Shares is increased or decreased or the Shares are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company on account of any recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, reverse split, combination of shares, exchange of shares, stock dividend or other distribution payable in capital stock, or other increase or decrease in such Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company occurring after the Effective Date or (ii) there occurs any spin-off, split-up, extraordinary cash dividend, or other distribution of assets by the Company, (A) the number and kinds of shares for which grants of Awards may be made, (B) the number and kinds of shares for which outstanding Awards may be exercised or settled, and (C) the performance goals relating to outstanding Awards, shall be equitably adjusted by the Company; _provided_ that any such adjustment shall comply with Section 409A. In addition, in the event of any such increase or decease in the number of outstanding shares or other transaction described in clause (ii) above, the number and kind of shares for which Awards are outstanding and the Option Price per share of outstanding Options and SAR Exercise Price per share of outstanding SARs shall be equitably adjusted; _provided_ that any such adjustment shall comply with Section 409A.\n\n16\n\n**15.2.** |  **Effect of a Change in Control**  \n---|---  \n  \nIn the event of a Change in Control, the Committee may, but shall not be obligated to: (i) accelerate, vest or cause the restrictions to lapse with respect to all or any portion of any Award; (ii) cancel Awards and cause to be paid to the holders of vested Awards the value of such Awards, if any, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, it being understood that in the case of any Option with an Option Exercise Price, or SAR with a SAR Exercise Price, that equals or exceeds the price paid for a share of Common Stock in connection with the Change in Control, the Committee may cancel the Option or SAR without the payment of consideration therefor; (iii) provide for the issuance of substitute Awards or the assumption or replacement of such Awards; (iv) provide written notice to Grantees that for a period of at least ten days prior to the Change in Control, such Awards shall be exercisable, to the extent applicable, as to all shares of Common Stock subject thereto and upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, any Awards not so exercised shall terminate and be of no further force and effect; or (v) otherwise treat such Awards in the manner set forth in the agreement pursuant to which the Change in Control is consummated. The obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be binding upon any successor corporation or organization resulting from the merger, consolidation or other reorganization of the Company, or upon any successor corporation or organization succeeding to all or substantially all of the assets and business of the Company and its Affiliates, taken as a whole.\n\n**15.3.** |  **Adjustments**  \n---|---  \n  \nAdjustments under this **Section** **15** related to Shares or other securities of the Company shall be made by the Board. No fractional Shares or other securities shall be issued under any such adjustment, and any fractions resulting from any such adjustment shall be eliminated in each case by rounding downward to the nearest whole Share.\n\n**16.** |  **NO LIMITATIONS ON COMPANY**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe grant of Awards shall not affect or limit in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, or liquidate, or to sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.\n\n**17.** |  **TERMS APPLICABLE GENERALLY TO AWARDS**  \n---|---  \n**17.1.** |  **Disclaimer of Rights**  \n---|---  \n  \nNo term or condition of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be construed to confer upon any individual the right to remain in the employ or service of the Company or any Affiliate, or to interfere in any way with any contractual or other right or authority of the Company either to increase or decrease the compensation or other payments to any individual at any time, or to terminate any employment or other relationship between any individual and the Company. In addition, notwithstanding any other term or condition of the Plan, unless otherwise stated in the applicable Award Agreement, no Award shall be affected by any change of duties or position of the Grantee, so long as such Grantee continues to be a Service Provider. The obligation of the Company to pay any benefits under the Plan shall be interpreted as a contractual obligation to pay only those amounts described herein, in the manner and under the terms and conditions prescribed herein. The Plan shall in no way be interpreted to require the Company to transfer any amounts to a third party trustee or otherwise hold any amounts in trust or escrow for payment to any Grantee or beneficiary under the Plan.\n\n17\n\n**17.2.** |  **Nonexclusivity of the Plan**  \n---|---  \n  \nNeither the adoption of the Plan nor the submission of the Plan to the Stockholders for approval shall be construed as creating any limitations upon the right and authority of the Board to adopt such other incentive compensation arrangements (which arrangements may be applicable either generally to a class or classes of individuals or specifically to a particular individual or particular individuals), including the granting of Options as the Board determines desirable.\n\n**17.3.** |  **Withholding Taxes**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Company or an Affiliate, as the case may be, shall have the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to a Grantee any federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld (i) with respect to the vesting of or other lapse of restrictions applicable to an Award, (ii) upon the issuance of any Shares upon the exercise of an Option or SAR, or (iii) otherwise due in connection with an Award. At the time of such vesting, lapse, or exercise, the Grantee shall pay to the Company or the Affiliate, as the case may be, any amount that the Company or the Affiliate may reasonably determine to be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation. The Company or the Affiliate, as the case may be, may require or permit the Grantee to satisfy such obligations, in whole or in part, (A) by causing the Company or the Affiliate to withhold up to the maximum required number of Shares otherwise issuable to the Grantee as may be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation or (B) by delivering to the Company or the Affiliate Shares already owned by the Grantee. The Shares so delivered or withheld shall have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to such withholding obligations. The Fair Market Value of the Shares used to satisfy such withholding obligation shall be determined by the Company or the Affiliate as of the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. To the extent applicable, a Grantee may satisfy his or her withholding obligation only with Shares that are not subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting, or other similar requirements.\n\n**17.4.** |  **Other Terms and Conditions; Employment Agreements**  \n---|---  \n  \nEach Award Agreement may contain such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Board. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of an employment agreement and the Plan, the terms and conditions of the employment agreement shall govern.\n\n18\n\n**17.5.** |  **Severability**  \n---|---  \n  \nIf any term or condition of the Plan or any Award Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable by any court of law in any jurisdiction, the remaining terms and conditions hereof and thereof shall be severable and enforceable, and all terms and conditions shall remain enforceable in any other jurisdiction.\n\n**17.6.** |  **Governing Law**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Plan and all Award Agreements shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Nevada without regard to the principles of conflicts of law that could cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Nevada. For purposes of resolving any dispute that arises under the Plan, each Grantee, by virtue of receiving an Award, shall be deemed to have submitted to and consented to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of Nevada and to have agreed that any related litigation shall be conducted solely in the state courts of Nevada or the federal courts for the U.S. located in Reno, Nevada, where the Plan is made and to be performed, and no other courts. The Plan is not intended to be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n\n**17.7.** |  **Section** **409A**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A to the extent subject thereto, and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, the Plan shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith. Any payments described in the Plan that are due within the “short-term deferral period” as defined in Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable laws require otherwise. For purposes of Section 409A, each installment payment under the Plan shall be treated as a separate payment. Notwithstanding any other term or condition of the Plan, to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation or tax penalties under Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided under the Plan during the six-month period immediately after the Grantee’s Separation from Service shall instead be paid on the first payroll date after the six-month anniversary of the Grantee’s Separation from Service (or the Grantee’s death, if earlier). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor the Board shall have any obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of any additional tax or penalty on any Grantee under Section 409A and neither the Company nor the Board shall have any liability to any Grantee for such tax or penalty.\n\n**17.8.** |  **Separation from Service**  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Board shall determine the effect of a Separation from Service upon Awards, and such effect shall be set forth in the appropriate Award Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Board may provide in the Award Agreements at the time of grant, or any time thereafter with the consent of the Grantee, the actions that may be taken upon the occurrence of a Separation from Service, including accelerated vesting or termination, depending upon the circumstances surrounding the Separation from Service.\n\n19\n\n**17.9.** |  **Transferability of Awards and Issued Shares**  \n---|---  \n**17.9.1.** |  **Transfers in General**  \n---|---  \n  \nNo Award shall be assignable or transferable by the Grantee to whom it is granted, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and, during the lifetime of the Grantee, only the Grantee personally (or the Grantee’s personal representative) may exercise rights under the Plan.\n\n**17.9.2.** |  **Family Transfers**  \n---|---  \n  \nIf authorized in the applicable Award Agreement or otherwise approved by the Board, a Grantee may transfer, not for value, all or part of an Award (other than Incentive Stock Options) to any Family Member. For the purpose of this **Section** **17.9.2** , a “not for value” transfer is a transfer that is (i) a gift, (ii) a transfer under a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights; or (iii) a transfer to an entity in which more than 50% of the voting interests are owned by Family Members (or the Grantee) in exchange for an interest in that entity. After a transfer under this **Section** **17.9.2** , any such Award shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were applicable immediately before transfer. Subsequent transfers of transferred Awards are prohibited except to Family Members of the original Grantee in accordance with this **Section** **17.9.2** or by will or the laws of descent and distribution.\n\n**17.10.** |  **Dividend Equivalent Rights**  \n---|---  \n  \nIf specified in the Award Agreement, the recipient of an Award may be entitled to receive dividend equivalent rights with respect to the Shares or other securities covered by an Award. The terms and conditions of a dividend equivalent right may be set forth in the Award Agreement.

          "content": "LIQTECH INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nCODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS\nAdopted January 01, 2012\nAmended and Restated September 20, 2021\n1. INTRODUCTION\n1.1 The following Code of Conduct and Ethics (this “Code”) has been adopted by\nmanagement and approved by the Board of Directors of LiqTech International, Inc., a Nevada\ncorporation (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”), in order to:\n1.1.1. promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual\nor apparent conflicts of interest;\n1.1.2. promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports\nand documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the \"SEC\") and in other public communications made by the Company;\n1.1.3. promote compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and\nregulations;\n1.1.4. promote the protection of Company assets, including corporate\nopportunities and confidential information;\n1.1.5. promote fair dealing practices;\n1.1.6. deter wrongdoing; and\n1.1.7. ensure accountability for adherence to this Code.\n1.2 All directors, officers and employees are required to be familiar with this Code,\ncomply with its provisions and report any suspected violations as described below in Section [10],\nReporting and Enforcement.\n1.3 The Company has many detailed policies that address certain of the topics in this\ndocument. The specific issues discussed in this Code do not cover all situations where a law or\npolicy may apply. However, this Code should help clarify the general principles stated above. It\nis the responsibility of each director, officer, manager, and employee to understand and follow all\nCompany policies.\n2. HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT\n2.1 The Company's policy is to promote high standards of integrity by conducting its\naffairs honestly and ethically.\n3 10160632.2\n2.2 Each director, officer and employee must act with integrity and observe the highest\nethical standards of business conduct in his or her dealings with the Company's customers,\nsuppliers, partners, service providers, competitors, employees and anyone else with whom he or\nshe has contact in the course of performing his or her job.\n3. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n3.1 A conflict of interest occurs when an individual's private interest (or the interest of\na family member) interferes, or even appears to interfere, with the interests of the Company as a\nwhole. A conflict of interest can arise when an employee, officer or director (or a member of his\nor her family) takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work\nfor the Company objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise when an employee,\nofficer or director (or a member of his or her family) receives improper personal benefits as a\nresult of his or her position in the Company.\n3.2 It would be impossible to detail every situation in which a conflict of interest may\narise. However, below is a non-exhaustive list of types of conflicts all employees must avoid.\n3.2.1. Acquiring a material interest in any supplier, competitor or customer of the\nCompany;\n3.2.2. Accepting any personal consulting or employment relationship that is or\nmay be competitive with the Company;\n3.2.3. Engaging in any outside business activity that is or may be competitive with\nany of the Company’s businesses or interests;\n3.2.4. Accepting any outside employment which might affect the employee’s\nability to devote the appropriate amount of time and attention to his or her duties and\nresponsibilities with the Company;\n3.2.5. Receiving entertainment or anything of more than nominal value, whether\nas a gift or otherwise, from any individual or company with which the Company has a\nbusiness relationship (normal and customary business meals, gifts of nominal value and\ncustomary business entertainment being excepted);\n3.2.6. Serving as an officer, director or in any other capacity for any customer,\nsupplier or competitor of the Company unless approved by the Chief Executive Officer;\n3.2.7. Accepting loans from another business or individual if your position is one\nthat interacts with, or influences, the Company’s transactions with that business or\nindividual;\n3.2.8. Supervising, influencing, reviewing or having influence with respect to job\nevaluations, compensation or benefits for any “family member” who is an employee of\nthe Company; and\n3 10160632.2\n3.2.9. Taking personal advantage or obtaining personal gain from an opportunity\nlearned of or discovered during the course and scope of employment with the Company\nwhen that opportunity or discovery could be of benefit or interest to the Company (this\nincludes the invention or discovery of methods, formulas, flavors or techniques that are\nrelated to the employee’s duties or the business of the Company or outside opportunities\nin which the Company might be interested).\n3.3 Such conflicts of interest may not only present themselves to an employee but could\nalso present themselves to members of the employee’s family. For example, a conflict would\narise if the employee’s spouse were to receive a valuable gift from a supplier of the Company.\nFor the purpose of this Code, “family member” shall mean the employee’s spouse, children,\nparents, grandparents, parents-in-law, brothers, sisters, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law and the\nchildren of his or her brothers, sisters, brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law.\n3.4 Determining whether a conflict exists can be unclear. Conflicts of interest should\nbe avoided unless specifically authorized as described in Section 3.5.\n3.5 The Company’s policy in this area is not intended to restrict employees from\nparticipating in normal and customary business-related functions or events, or from engaging in\nthe exchange of corporate gifts of nominal value. Persons other than directors and executive\nofficers who have questions about a potential conflict of interest or who become aware of an\nactual or potential conflict should discuss the matter with, and seek a determination and prior\nauthorization or approval from the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer. A\n[manager] may not authorize or approve conflict of interest matters or make determinations as to\nwhether a problematic conflict of interest exists without first providing the Chief Executive\nOfficer with a written description of the activity and seeking the Chief Executive Officer's written\napproval. If the manager is himself involved in the potential or actual conflict, the matter should\ninstead be discussed directly with the Chief Executive Officer.1\n3.6 Directors and executive officers must seek determinations and prior authorizations\nor approvals of potential conflicts of interest exclusively from the [Audit Committee Chair].\n4. COMPLIANCE.\n4.1 Employees, officers and directors should comply, both in letter and spirit, with all\napplicable laws, rules and regulations in the cities, states and countries in which the Company\noperates.\n4.2 Although not all employees, officers and directors are expected to know the details\nof all applicable laws, rules and regulations, it is important to know enough to determine when to\nseek advice from appropriate personnel. Questions about compliance should be addressed to the\nCompany’s Chief Executive officer. The Chief Executive Officer shall consult legal counsel for\nissues related to compliance.\n4.3 Insider Trading.\n1 Note to Draft: Nasdaq/SEC do not prescribe any specific procedure here. The Company may use its discretion.\n3 10160632.2\n4.3.1. During the course of employment with the Company, employees may\nacquire information that is not generally known to the public. This may include financial\ninformation, forecasts, business plans and strategies, information on sales programs,\nproduct development, and other material information that is not known to individuals\noutside of the Company.\n4.3.2. No director, officer or employee may purchase or sell any Company\nsecurities while in possession of material nonpublic information regarding the Company,\nnor may any director, officer or employee purchase or sell another company's securities\nwhile in possession of material nonpublic information regarding that company. It is\nagainst Company policies and illegal for any director, officer or employee to use material\nnonpublic information regarding the Company or any other company to:\n4.3.2.1. obtain profit for himself or herself; or\n4.3.2.2. directly or indirectly \"tip\" others who might make an\ninvestment decision on the basis of that information.\n4.4 A violation of this policy, or the laws upon which this policy is based, could result\nnot only in the termination of employment with the Company, but also civil and criminal\nproceedings. All employees, officers, and directors must comply with the Company’s Insider\nTrading Policy.\n4.5 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n4.5.1. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) became U.S. federal law\nin 1977. It applies to U.S. individuals, companies and businesses, including their\ncontrolled international subsidiaries.\n4.5.2. The FCPA makes it unlawful for U.S. companies operating in the United\nStates or abroad and their employees to make direct or indirect payments to foreign\ngovernment officials or political parties or candidates for the purpose of obtaining or\nretaining business.\n4.5.3. Employees of the Company or others acting on its behalf may not offer,\npay, promise or authorize the payment of money or anything of value to: (a) foreign\ngovernment officials, (b) foreign political parties, party officials or political candidates,\nor (c) any person if it is known, or firmly believed that the money or thing of value will\nbe given or promised to a person described in (a) or (b) above, in order to obtain or retain\nbusiness.\n4.5.4. In addition, no payments may be made to these individuals for the purpose\nof influencing the action or decision of the recipient, inducing the recipient to do or refrain\nfrom doing any act in violation of his or her lawful duty or inducing the recipient to exert\ninfluence on any foreign government, or any department, agency or instrumentality of a\nforeign government.\n3 10160632.2\n4.5.5. Under the FCPA, the Company is required to keep books, records and\naccounts that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of its assets,\nand to maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable\nassurances that assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use, that corporate transactions\nconform to managerial authorizations and that records are accurate.\n4.6 Antitrust Laws. It is the policy of the Company to comply with the applicable\nantitrust laws of each nation in which the Company manufactures or sells products and services.\nThese laws generally limit business practices that restrict competition. Agreements with\ncompetitors or other market participants that fix prices, divide markets or limit outputs or business\nactivity are generally prohibited by the antitrust laws and criminal sanctions in the form of fines\nand imprisonment are frequently imposed.\n4.7 Improper Payments and Political Activity.\n4.7.1. No payment will be made by or on behalf of the Company either directly or\nindirectly to government officials, political candidates, political parties or officers or\nemployees of customers, suppliers or competitors if (a) the payment is designed to secure\nfavored treatment for the Company or (b) the payment would violate applicable laws.\n4.7.2. Improper payments include unearned commissions or refunds, the donation\nor loan of the Company’s property or services of the Company’s personnel, the incurring\nor paying of expenses on behalf of another and the reimbursing of officers, employees or\nagents of the Company for payments made by them on the Company’s behalf.\n4.7.3. This policy does not include lawful political contributions authorized by the\nChief Executive Officer or the Board of Directors, reasonable entertainment of customers\nor suppliers, potential customers or suppliers or others involved with the Company’s\nbusiness in a manner appropriate to the business relationship and the discussion of\nbusiness matters, gifts of sales promotion items, or, where the local custom requires,\npayment of small gratuities to minor governmental functionaries to secure the routine\nprocessing of paper work (for example, gratuities to minor customs officials for\nprocessing import documents) provided that such payments (a) are not either individually\nor in the aggregate significant in amount, (b) are fully disclosed in the Company’s records\nand (c) are approved by the manager of the local operation. While these transactions are\nnot prohibited by this policy, they must be accurately disclosed in the Company’s books\nof account.\n4.7.4. This policy does not affect the right of employees, acting in an individual\ncapacity and not as representatives of the Company, to support political parties or\ncandidates of the employee’s choice. Since violation of this policy can create public\nreporting and tax problems for the Company as well as expose the Company and its\nofficers, directors and the employee involved to civil and criminal sanctions, strict\nadherence is required. It is the responsibility of management at all levels to enforce this\npolicy and of all employees to report violations to, or, in doubtful cases, to seek advice\nfrom their managers or from the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.\n3 10160632.2\n4.8 Discrimination and Harassment. The Company observes a policy of equal\nemployment opportunity for all matters. The Company will not discriminate against any\nemployee or prospective employee on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin,\nhandicap or veteran status. The Company will provide a workplace free from harassment on the\nbasis of any of the above. The Company will also expect all of its employees, suppliers and\nrepresentatives to observe and further the goals of this policy.\n4.9 Environmental Matters. It is the policy of the Company to comply with all\napplicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment and the conservation of\nnatural resources. The Company believes that observing all such requirements is critical to the\ngoal of acting as a responsible business citizen while also reducing the exposure to liability\nassociated with even unintentional violation of environmental laws.

The Company is required to keep books, records and accounts that\naccurately and fairly reflect transactions and maintain an effective system of internal controls.\n8.2 Proper accounting for all transactions is essential to the Company’s control of its\naffairs and the accuracy of its financial reporting. To maintain the integrity of the accounting\nrecords, all cash funds, bank accounts and other accounts must be disclosed in the Company’s\nbooks of account and all entries in the Company’s books must be prepared carefully, timely and\nhonestly and must be supported by adequate documentation to provide a complete, accurate and\nauditable record of the transactions they describe.\n8.3 No false or misleading entries may be made for any reason and no employee may\nassist any other person in making such entries.\n8.4 Full and certain disclosure reinforces responsibility and acts as a powerful deterrent\nto wrongdoing. Therefore, it is vital that no fund, asset, liability, revenue or expense of the\nCompany be concealed or incompletely recorded in any situation for any purpose.

All employees must\ncooperate fully with the Company’s auditors.

Each director, officer\nand employee must cooperate fully with the Company's accounting and internal audit\ndepartments, as well as the Company's independent public accountants and counsel. Employees,\nofficers and directors should promptly report to the Chair of the Audit Committee any conduct\nthat the individual believes may impair the Company’s full, fair, accurate, timely and\nunderstandable disclosure in reports and documents that it files with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and in other public communications.\n9.5 The Company expects all of its personnel to take this disclosure responsibility very\nseriously and to provide prompt and accurate answers to inquiries related to the Company’s public\ndisclosure requirements.\n10.

It is critical that the secrecy of all such\nconfidential information and trade secrets be maintained and that employees take no action to\neither directly or indirectly allow such information to be released to individuals or businesses\noutside of the Company, or to be made public, except to the Company’s authorized advisers.]\n11.

DUTY OF LOYALTY; CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES.\n12.1 The Company expects its employees to adhere to high standards of business ethics\nand undivided loyalty to the Company.
