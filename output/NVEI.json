See “Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures”.\nProposed take private transaction\nAs previously announced, on April 1, 2024 the Company entered into a definitive arrangement\nagreement to be taken private by Advent International (“Advent”), one of the world’s largest and most\nexperienced global private equity investors, as well as a longstanding sponsor in the payments space,\nalongside existing Canadian shareholders Philip Fayer, certain investment funds managed by Novacap\nManagement Inc. and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, in an all-cash transaction which values\nthe Company at an enterprise value of approximately $6.3 billion (the “Proposed transaction”). Advent\nwill acquire all the issued and outstanding Subordinate Voting Shares and any Multiple Voting Shares\n(collectively the “Shares”) that are not Rollover Shares1, for a price of $34.00 per Share, in cash. This\nprice represents an attractive and significant premium of approximately 56% to the closing price of the\nSubordinate Voting Shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) on March 15, 2024, the last\ntrading day prior to media reports concerning a potential transaction involving the Company, and a\npremium of approximately 48% to the 90-day volume weighted average trading price per Subordinate\nVoting Share as of such date.\nThe Proposed transaction will be implemented by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the\nCanada Business Corporations Act. The Proposed transaction was approved by shareholders at a special\nmeeting held on June 18, 2024 and received court approval on June 20, 2024. The Proposed transaction\nremains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of key regulatory approvals (a\nmajority of which were received and/or for which the waiting period has expired as of the date hereof,\nwith a limited number of approvals remaining outstanding), is not subject to any financing condition and,\nassuming the timely receipt of all required key regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the fourth\nquarter of 2024.\nFollowing completion of the transaction, it is expected that the Subordinate Voting Shares will be\ndelisted from each of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq and that Nuvei will cease to be a\nreporting issuer in all applicable Canadian jurisdictions and will deregister the Subordinate Voting Shares\nwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nCash Dividend\nNuvei today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized and declared a cash dividend of $0.10\nper Subordinate Voting Share and Multiple Voting Share, payable on December 12, 2024 to shareholders\nof record on November 26, 2024. The aggregate amount of the dividend is expected to be approximately\n$14 million, to be funded from the Company’s existing cash on hand.]In accordance with the Plan of\narrangement, shareholders are entitled to dividends with a record date prior to the effective date of the\nProposed transaction. Should the Proposed transaction be completed before the record date, the\ndividend will not be paid. Accordingly, payment of the dividend will be made on December 12, 2024 if\nthe Proposed transaction is not completed prior to the record date of November 26, 2024.\nThe Company, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any similar provincial or territorial\nlegislation, designates the dividend declared for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and any future\ndividends, to be eligible dividends. The Company further expects to report such dividends as a dividend\n1 Philip Fayer, Novacap and CDPQ (together with entities they control directly or indirectly, collectively,\nthe \"Rollover Shareholders\") have agreed to roll approximately 95%, 65% and 75%, respectively, of their\nShares (the \"Rollover Shares\") and are expected to receive in aggregate approximately US$560 million in\ncash for the Shares sold on closing. Philip Fayer, Novacap and CDPQ are expected to indirectly own or\ncontrol approximately 24%, 18% and 12%, respectively, of the equity in the resulting private company.\nPercentages and amount of expected cash proceeds are based on current assumed cash position and are\nsubject to change as a result of cash generated before closing.\nto U.S. shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to applicable limitations, dividends\npaid to certain non-corporate U.S. shareholders may be eligible for taxation as “qualified dividend\nincome” and therefore may be taxable at rates applicable to long-term capital gains. A U.S. shareholder\nshould talk to its advisor regarding such dividends, including with respect to the “extraordinary dividend”\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code (US).\nThe declaration, timing, amount and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board\nof Directors, as more fully described under the heading “Forward-Looking Information” of this press\nrelease.\nConference Call, Financial Outlook and Growth Targets\nIn light of the Proposed transaction, Nuvei no longer holds earnings conference calls or provides a\nfinancial outlook or growth targets.\nAbout Nuvei\nNuvei (Nasdaq: NVEI) (TSX: NVEI) is the Canadian fintech company accelerating the business of clients\naround the world.

The information presented in this press release includes non-IFRS\nfinancial measures, non-IFRS financial ratios and supplementary financial measures, namely Adjusted\nEBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per basic share, Adjusted net income per diluted\nshare, Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and Total volume. These measures are not recognized\nmeasures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not\nbe comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided\nas additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our\nresults of operations from our perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in\nisolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s financial statements reported under IFRS.\nThese measures are used to provide investors with additional insight of our operating performance and\nthus highlight trends in Nuvei’s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS\nmeasures. We also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use\nthese non-IFRS and other financial measures in the evaluation of issuers. We also use these measures to\nfacilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating\nbudgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. We believe these\nmeasures are important additional measures of our performance, primarily because they and similar\nmeasures are used widely among others in the payment technology industry as a means of evaluating a\ncompany’s underlying operating performance.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA: We use Adjusted EBITDA as a means to evaluate operating performance, by\neliminating the impact of non-operational or non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income\n(loss) before finance costs (recovery), finance income, depreciation and amortization, income tax\nexpense, acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related payroll taxes,\nloss (gain) on foreign currency exchange, and legal settlement and other.\nAdjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures: We use Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures\n(which we define as acquisition of intangible assets and property and equipment) as a supplementary\nindicator of our operating performance.\nAdjusted net income: We use Adjusted net income as an indicator of business performance and\nprofitability with our current tax and capital structure. Adjusted net income is defined as net income\n(loss) before acquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related payroll\ntaxes, loss (gain) on foreign currency exchange, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and\nthe related income tax expense or recovery for these items. Adjusted net income also excludes change in\nredemption value of liability-classified common and preferred shares, change in fair value of share\nrepurchase liability and accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees and legal settlement and\nother.\nNon-IFRS Financial Ratios\nAdjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share: We use Adjusted net income per basic\nshare and per diluted share as an indicator of performance and profitability of our business on a per\nshare basis. Adjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share means Adjusted net income less\nnet income attributable to non-controlling interest divided by the basic and diluted weighted average\nnumber of common shares outstanding for the period, respectively. The number of share-based awards\nused in the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding in the Adjusted net income\nper diluted share calculation is determined using the treasury stock method as permitted under IFRS.\nSupplementary Financial Measures\nWe monitor the following key performance indicators to help us evaluate our business, measure our\nperformance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic\ndecisions. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner that differs from similar key\nperformance indicators used by other companies.\nTotal volume: We believe Total volume is an indicator of performance of our business. Total volume\nand similar measures are used widely among others in the payments industry as a means of evaluating a\ncompany’s performance. We define Total volume as the total dollar value of transactions processed in\nthe period by customers under contractual agreement with us. Total volume does not represent revenue\nearned by us. Total volume includes acquiring volume, where we are in the flow of funds in the\nsettlement transaction cycle, gateway/technology volume, where we provide our gateway/technology\nservices but are not in the flow of funds in the settlement transaction cycle, as well as the total dollar\nvalue of transactions processed relating to APMs and payouts. Since our revenue is primarily sales\nvolume and transaction-based, generated from merchants’ daily sales and through various fees for\nvalue-added services provided to our customers, fluctuations in Total volume will generally impact our\nrevenue.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis press release contains “forward-looking information” and “forward-looking statements”\n(collectively, “Forward-looking information”) within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

Nuvei is\nthe ultimate parent of the group and was incorporated on September 1, 2017 under the Canada Business\nCorporations Act (“CBCA”).\nThe Company's Subordinate Voting Shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") and on the\nNasdaq Global Select Market (\"Nasdaq\") both under the symbol \"NVEI\".\nProposed take private transaction\nOn April 1, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive arrangement agreement to be taken private by Advent\nInternational, alongside existing Canadian shareholders Philip Fayer, certain investment funds managed by\nNovacap Management Inc., and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, in an all-cash transaction at $34.00\nper Subordinate Voting Share and Multiple Voting Share (\"Proposed transaction\"). On June 20, 2024, final\ncourt approval was obtained following the shareholder approval obtained on June 18, 2024. The closing of\nthis transaction remains subject to key regulatory approvals. A termination fee of $150,000 would be payable\nby Nuvei in certain circumstances. A reverse termination fee of $250,000 would be payable to Nuvei if the\ntransaction is not completed in certain circumstances.\n2. Basis of preparation and consolidation\nThese Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) applicable to the preparation of interim financial\nstatements, including International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as issued\nby the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). Certain information and disclosures have been\nomitted or condensed. The accounting policies and methods of computation described in the audited annual\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 were applied consistently in the\npreparation of these condensed interim consolidated financial statements, with the exception of new\naccounting pronouncements effective January 1, 2024, described below. Accordingly, these Condensed\nInterim Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Company’s audited annual\nconsolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 were authorized for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on November 12, 2024.\nOperating segment\nThe Company has one reportable segment for the provision of payment technology solutions to merchants\nand partners.\nSeasonality of interim operations\nThe operations of the Company can be seasonal, and the results of operations for any interim period are not\nnecessarily indicative of operations for the full year or any future period.\nEstimates, judgments and assumptions\nThe preparation of these Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS\nrequires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the application of accounting\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The significant estimates,\n8\nNuvei Corporation\nNotes to Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n(in thousands of US dollars, except for share and per share amounts)\njudgments and assumptions made by management are the same as those applied and described in the\nCompany's audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n3. Material accounting policies and new accounting standards\nNew accounting standards and interpretations adopted\nThe following amendments were adopted on January 1, 2024:\nAmendments to liability classification\nOn October 31, 2022, the IASB issued new amendments to IAS 1 in addition to the previous amendment\nissued in 2020 that clarify requirements when classifying liabilities as non-current and extend the application\nperiod to January 1, 2024.\nWhen an entity classifies a liability arising from a loan arrangement as non-current and that liability is subject\nto the covenants which an entity is required to comply with within twelve months of the reporting date, this\namendment requires the entity to disclose information in the notes that enables users of financial statements\nto understand the risk that the liability could become repayable within twelve months of the reporting period,\nincluding:\n(a) the carrying amount of the liability;\n(b) information about the covenants;\n(c) facts and circumstances, if any, that indicate the entity may have difficulty complying with the\ncovenants. Such facts and circumstances could also include the fact that the entity would not have\ncomplied with the covenants based on its circumstances at the end of the reporting period.\nThe amendments described above had no impact on these Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nNew accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted\nThe IASB has issued new standards and amendments to existing standards which are applicable to the\nCompany in future periods.\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\nOn April 9, 2024 the IASB issued IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements to improve\nreporting of financial performance. IFRS 18 replaces IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. It carries\nforward many requirements from IAS 1 unchanged. IFRS 18 applies for annual reporting periods beginning on\nor after January 1, 2027. Earlier application is permitted.\nThe new Accounting Standard introduces significant changes to the structure of a company's income\nstatement and new principles for aggregation and disaggregation of information. The main impacts of the new\nAccounting Standard include:\n• introducing a newly defined \"operating profit\" subtotal and a requirement for all income and expenses\nto be allocated between three distinct categories based on the company's main business activities:\nOperating, investing and financing;\n• disclosure about management performance measures; and,\n9\nNuvei Corporation\nNotes to Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n(in thousands of US dollars, except for share and per share amounts)\n• adding new principles for aggregation and disaggregation of information.\n• requiring the cash flow statement to start with operating profit; and\n• removal of the accounting policy choice for presentation of dividend and interest.\nAmendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures\nIn May 2024, amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” and IFRS 7, “Financial Instruments:\nDisclosures” were issued. The main impacts of the amendments include:\n• clarification of the timing of recognition and derecognition for a financial asset or financial liability,\nincluding clarifying that a financial liability is derecognized on the settlement date. In addition to\nthese clarifications, the amendments introduce an accounting policy choice to derecognize financial\nliabilities settled using an electronic payment system before the settlement date, if criteria are met;\n• clarifications regarding the classification of financial assets, including those with features linked to\nenvironmental, social and corporate governance and contractual cash flows that are solely payments\nof principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding; and\n• additional disclosures are required for financial instruments with contingent features and\ninvestments in equity instruments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income.\nThese amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2026. Early\nadoption is permitted, with an option to early adopt only the amendments to the classification of financial\nassets.\nThe impact of adoption of these standards and amendments has not yet been determined.\n4.

Determination of fair values\nCertain of the Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value for both\nfinancial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or\ndisclosure purposes using the following methods.\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities\nIn establishing fair value, the Company uses a fair value hierarchy based on levels as defined below:\n• Level 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets.\n• Level 2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly\nobservable.\n• Level 3: defined as inputs that are based on little or no observable market data, therefore requiring\nentities to develop their own assumptions.\nThe Company has determined that, excluding the derivative financial instrument, the carrying amounts of its\ncurrent financial assets and financial liabilities approximate their fair value given the short-term nature of\nthese instruments.\nThe fair value of the variable interest rate non-current liabilities approximates the carrying amount as the\nliabilities bear interest at a rate that varies according to the market rate.\n20\nNuvei Corporation\nNotes to Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n(in thousands of US dollars, except for share and per share amounts)\nAs at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, financial instruments measured at fair value in the\nCondensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements of financial position were as follows:\nFair value September December 31,\nhierarchy 30, 2024 2023\n$ $\nAssets\nInvestments measured at fair value through profit or\nloss Level 1 1,306 1,255\nDerivative financial asset - Interest rate swap Level 2 692 677\nInvestments measured at fair value through profit or\nloss Level 3 2,245 2,444\nInvestments in equity instrument designated at fair\nvalue through other comprehensive income Level 3 27,844 25,862\nLiabilities\nDerivative financial liability - Interest rate swap Level 2 10,172 7,780\nContingent considerations Level 3 3,099 —\nInterest rate swaps\nIn August 2024, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement maturing August 31, 2027 with a\nnotional amount of $200,000 where the Company pays a fixed interest rate of 3.62% and receives Term SOFR\nin order to hedge a portion of its future variable interest payments.\nIn September 2023, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement maturing September 30, 2026\nwith a notional amount of $300,000 where the Company pays a fixed interest rate of 4.67% and receives Term\nSOFR in order to hedge a portion of its future variable interest payments.\nThe Company has elected to use hedge accounting for both interest rate swaps. These derivatives are carried\nat fair value and are presented in other current assets and liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the\nconsolidated statements of financial position.\nFair value of the interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.\nEstimated future cash flows are discounted using a yield curve which reflects the relevant benchmark\ninterbank rate used by market participants for this purpose when pricing interest rate swaps.\nLevel 3 fair value measurement items\nThe following table presents the changes in level 3 items for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nInvestments measured\nInvestments measured at fair value through\nat fair value through Contingent other comprehensive\nprofit or loss considerations income\n$ $ $\nBalance as at December 31, 2023 2,444 — 25,862\nAcquisition — 3,099 2,500\nDisposal (173) — —\nEffect of movements in exchange rates (26) — (518)\nBalance as at September 30, 2024 2,245 3,099 27,844\n21\nNuvei Corporation\nNotes to Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n(in thousands of US dollars, except for share and per share amounts)\nFair value remeasurement of level 3 instruments is recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nInvestments measured at fair value through profit and loss and through other comprehensive income are\nrecognized on the statement of financial position in other non-current assets. Below are the assumptions and\nvaluation methods used in the level 3 fair value measurements:\n• During July 2024, the Company entered into a distributor commission buyout agreement for a total\nconsideration of $1,335. In September 2024, the Company entered into a distributor commission buyout\nagreement with an independent sales organization. The agreement included an initial consideration of\n$75,000 CAD and a contingent consideration to be measured twelve months following the effective date. The\nfair value of the contingent consideration is determined using a formula specified in the purchase agreement.\nThe main assumption is the forecast of financial performance. Additionally, the agreement includes an\nattrition guarantee. The Company recognized a total amount of $59,491 as distributor commission buyout,\npresented in intangible assets in the consolidated statement of financial position, which includes the initial\nconsideration and variable consideration.\n• On March 15, 2023, the Company acquired an equity interest in a private company for a total cash\nconsideration of $25,000. The company designated this equity investment at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income. The fair value is estimated using a market approach, which is the revenue multiple.\n15. Related party transactions\nTransactions with key management personnel\nKey management personnel compensation comprises the following:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n$ $ $ $\nSalaries and short-term employee benefits 2,307 1,874 6,302 6,524\nShare-based payments 16,528 18,848 45,859 56,531\n18,835 20,722 52,161 63,055\nOther related party transactions\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n$ $ $ $\nExpenses – Travel (i) 228 269 1,367 1,216\n(i) In the normal course of operations, the Company receives services from a company owned by a\nshareholder of the Company.\n22\nNuvei Corporation\nNotes to Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023\n(in thousands of US dollars, except for share and per share amounts)\n16. Supplementary cash flow disclosure\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30\n2024 2023\n$ $\nChanges in non-cash working capital items:\nTrade and other receivables (25,849) (17,133)\nInventory (63) 97\nPrepaid expenses (2,995) (2,299)\nContract assets (1,911) (911)\nTrade and other payables 1,086 15,326\nOther current and non-current liabilities (1,777) 1,447\n(31,509) (3,473)\n17. Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of its\nbusiness. The Company is also exposed to possible uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions.\nManagement does not expect that the resolution of those matters, either individually or in the aggregate, will\nhave a material effect on the Company’s Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.\n18. Subsequent event\nOn October 30, 2024, the Company entered into an overdraft credit facility of $50,000 to fund interchange\nfees which are billed and collected from merchants monthly. This new facility replaces a service fee\narrangement previously in place. This new facility bears interest at Daily Simple SOFR rate plus 2.50% per\nannum.\n23"

For\nexample, customers may use disparate and varied systems for gateway services, payment processing, online fraud\nprevention, business intelligence and more, creating operational distractions and workflow challenges, which\nresult in additional costs and financial inefficiencies. In parallel, consumers expect a consistent and frictionless\ntransaction experience across all channels, whether from a mobile device or computer. As a result, we believe\nbusinesses increasingly seek payment providers such as Nuvei who have a unified approach and can offer end-to-\nend solutions to help them navigate this complex environment.\nWe distribute our products and technology through three channels: (i) Global Commerce, (ii) B2B,\nGovernment and Independent software vendors (“ISV”), and (iii) SMBs. Our approach to distribution is designed\nto enable us to efficiently market our payments and technology solutions at scale and is customized by both region\nand vertical to optimize sales. By relying on our local sales teams and partners who act as trusted technology\nproviders to our customers, we believe we are able to serve more customers globally and grow with them as they\ngrow their businesses and expand into new markets. We focus on the needs of our customers and how we can help\nthem grow their sales, and in turn our volume, with them. Due to the scalable nature of our business model and\nthe inherent operating leverage, increases in volume drive profitable revenue growth.\nOur revenue is primarily based on sales volume generated from our customers’ daily sales and through various\ntransaction and subscription-based fees for our modular technology. Examples of our modular technology include\ngateway, global processing, APMs, currency management, global payouts, risk management, card issuing, open\nbanking, data reporting, reconciliation tools, in addition to a long list of other value-added capabilities. Our\nrevenue is largely recurring due to the mission-critical nature of our product and service offerings and deep\nintegration of our payments technology into our customers’ ERP systems. We believe the depth and breadth of our\npayment capabilities help our customers establish and expand their presence in emerging commerce channels\nacross many markets. This enables us to develop long-standing relationships with our customers, which in turn\ndrive strong retention and significant cross-selling opportunities.\nFinancial Highlights for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to 2023:\n• Total volume(a) increased by 27% to $61.3 billion from $48.2 billion;\n• Revenue increased by 17% to $357.6 million from $304.9 million\n• Net income increased to $17.2 million from a net loss of $18.1 million;\n• Adjusted EBITDA(b) decreased by 2% to $108.8 million from $110.7 million;\n• Adjusted net income(b) decreased by 8% to $52.3 million from $56.8 million;\n• Net income per diluted share increased to $0.10 from a net loss per diluted share of $0.14;\n• Adjusted net income per diluted share(b) decreased by 13% to $0.34 from $0.39 ;\n• Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures(b) decreased to $92.6 million from $97.5 million.\nFinancial Highlights for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to 2023:\n• Total volume(a) increased by 30% to $183.1 billion from $141.2 billion;\n• Revenue increased 20% to $1,038.2 million from $868.4 million;\n• Net income increased to $17.8 million from a net loss of $14.8 million;\n• Adjusted EBITDA(b) increased by 7% to $340.4 million from $317.3 million;\n• Adjusted net income(b) decreased by 1% to $177.4 million from $179.3 million;\n• Net income per diluted share increased to $0.08 from a net loss per diluted share of $0.14;\n• Adjusted net income per diluted share(b) decreased by 4% to $1.16 from $1.21;\n• Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures(b)increased by 4% to $288.0 million from $277.0 million; and,\n• Cash dividends declared were $42.3 million.\n(a) Total volume does not represent revenue earned by the Company, but rather the total dollar value of transactions processed by merchants\nunder contractual agreement with the Company. See \"Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures\".\n(b) Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures are non-\nIFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have standardized\nmeanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. See “Non-IFRS and\nOther Financial Measures”.\n5\nProposed take private transaction\nOn April 1, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive arrangement agreement to be taken private by\nAdvent, alongside existing Canadian shareholders Philip Fayer, certain investment funds managed by Novacap\nManagement Inc., and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, in an all-cash transaction which values the\nCompany at an enterprise value of approximately $6.3 billion. Subject to certain conditions, Advent will acquire\nall the issued and outstanding Subordinate Voting Shares and any Multiple Voting Shares that are not Rollover\nShares (as defined in the “Risk Factors” section of this MD&A), for a price of $34.00 per share, in cash (“Proposed\ntransaction”). This price represents a premium of approximately 56% to the closing price of the Subordinate\nVoting Shares on the Nasdaq on March 15, 2024, the last trading day prior to media reports concerning a potential\ntransaction involving the Company, and a premium of approximately 48% to the 90-day volume weighted average\ntrading price1 per Subordinate Voting Share as of such date.\nThe Proposed transaction will be implemented by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the Canada\nBusiness Corporations Act. The Proposed transaction was approved by shareholders at a special meeting held on\nJune 18, 2024 and received court approval on June 20, 2024. The proposed transaction remains subject to\ncustomary closing conditions, including receipt of key regulatory approvals (a number of which were received\nand/or for which the waiting period has expired as of the date hereof, with a limited number of approvals\nremaining outstanding), is not subject to any financing condition and, assuming the timely receipt of all required\nkey regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe Arrangement Agreement (as defined in the “Risk Factors” section of this MD&A) provides for a non-\nsolicitation covenant on the part of Nuvei. Nuvei may in the future be required to pay a termination fee of US$150\nmillion in certain circumstances. A reverse termination fee of US$250 million would be payable to Nuvei if the\ntransaction is not completed in certain circumstances.\nFollowing completion of the transaction, it is expected that the Subordinate Voting Shares will be delisted\nfrom each of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq and that Nuvei will cease to be a reporting issuer in all\napplicable Canadian jurisdictions and will deregister the Subordinate Voting Shares with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”). Please see “Risk Factors” below.]\nTill Payments acquisition\nOn January 5, 2024, we acquired 100% of the shares of Till Payments, an ISV focused payment technology\ncompany headquartered in Sydney, Australia, for a total consideration of $36.9 million, comprised of $30.0\nmillion in cash and $6.9 million of a loan receivable that was considered part of the consideration transferred.\nQuarterly dividend\nOn November 12, 2024, the Board of Directors approved and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per\nSubordinate Voting Share and Multiple Voting Share payable on December 12, 2024 to shareholders of record on\nNovember 26, 2024.\nIn accordance with the Plan of Arrangement, shareholders are entitled to dividends with a record date prior to\nthe effective date of the Proposed transaction. Should the Proposed transaction be completed before the record\ndate, the dividend will not be paid. Accordingly, payment of the dividend will be made on December 12, 2024 if\nthe Proposed transaction is not completed prior to the record date of November 26, 2024.\n1 Based on Canadian composite (TSX and all Canadian marketplaces) and U.S. composite (Nasdaq and all U.S.\nmarketplaces).\n6\nNon-IFRS and Other Financial Measures\nOur Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS applicable to the preparation\nof interim financial statements, including IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting, as issued by the IASB. The\ninformation presented in this MD&A includes non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS financial ratios and\nsupplementary financial measures, namely Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per\nbasic share, Adjusted net income per diluted share, Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and Total volume.\nThese measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by\nIFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these\nmeasures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further\nunderstanding of our results of operations from our perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be\nconsidered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s financial statements reported under IFRS.\nThese measures are used to provide investors with additional insight of our operating performance and thus\nhighlight trends in Nuvei’s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures.\nWe also believe that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use these non-IFRS and\nother financial measures in the evaluation of issuers. We also use these measures to facilitate operating\nperformance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to\ndetermine components of management compensation. We believe these measures are important additional\nmeasures of our performance, primarily because they and similar measures are used widely among others in the\npayment technology industry as a means of evaluating a company’s underlying operating performance.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA: We use Adjusted EBITDA as a means to evaluate operating performance, by eliminating\nthe impact of non-operational or non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before finance\ncosts (recovery), finance income, depreciation and amortization, income tax expense, acquisition, integration and\nseverance costs, share-based payments and related payroll taxes, loss (gain) on foreign currency exchange, and\nlegal settlement and other.\nAdjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures: We use Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures (which\nwe define as acquisition of intangible assets and property and equipment) as a supplementary indicator of our\noperating performance.\nAdjusted net income: We use Adjusted net income as an indicator of business performance and\nprofitability with our current tax and capital structure. Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) before\nacquisition, integration and severance costs, share-based payments and related payroll taxes, loss (gain) on\nforeign currency exchange, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, and the related income tax\nexpense or recovery for these items. Adjusted net income also excludes change in redemption value of liability-\nclassified common and preferred shares, change in fair value of share repurchase liability and accelerated\namortization of deferred financing fees and legal settlement and other.\nNon-IFRS Financial Ratios\nAdjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share: We use Adjusted net income per basic\nshare and per diluted share as an indicator of performance and profitability of our business on a per share basis.\nAdjusted net income per basic share and per diluted share means Adjusted net income less net income\nattributable to non-controlling interest divided by the basic and diluted weighted average number of common\nshares outstanding for the period, respectively. The number of share-based awards used in the diluted weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding in the Adjusted net income per diluted share calculation is\ndetermined using the treasury stock method as permitted under IFRS.\n7\nSupplementary Financial Measures\nWe monitor the following key performance indicators to help us evaluate our business, measure our\nperformance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. Our\nkey performance indicators may be calculated in a manner that differs from similar key performance indicators\nused by other companies.\nTotal volume: We believe Total volume is an indicator of performance of our business. Total volume and\nsimilar measures are used widely among others in the payments industry as a means of evaluating a company’s\nperformance. We define Total volume as the total dollar value of transactions processed in the period by\ncustomers under contractual agreement with us. Total volume does not represent revenue earned by us. Total\nvolume includes acquiring volume, where we are in the flow of funds in the settlement transaction cycle, gateway/\ntechnology volume, where we provide our gateway/technology services but are not in the flow of funds in the\nsettlement transaction cycle, as well as the total dollar value of transactions processed relating to APMs and\npayouts. Since our revenue is primarily sales volume and transaction-based, generated from merchants’ daily sales\nand through various fees for value-added services provided to our customers, fluctuations in Total volume will\ngenerally impact our revenue.\n8\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Less Capital Expenditures to Net\nIncome\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures to net\nincome (loss) for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars) $ $ $ $\nNet income (loss) 17,235 (18,120) 17,776 (14,792)\nFinance cost 29,045 30,053 88,648 77,839\nFinance income (1,163) (2,713) (2,551) (9,049)\nDepreciation and amortization 39,105 36,544 113,940 100,125\nIncome tax expense 7,914 9,667 20,878 16,031\nAcquisition, integration and severance costs(a) 7,675 5,120 24,295 37,000\nShare-based payments and related payroll taxes(b) 15,416 34,102 70,158 106,423\nLoss (gain) on foreign currency exchange (6,572) 13,033 10,933 520\nLegal settlement and other(c) 131 3,014 (3,663) 3,192\nAdjusted EBITDA 108,786 110,700 340,414 317,289\nAcquisition of property and equipment, and intangible\nassets (16,233) (13,205) (52,375) (40,250)\nAdjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures 92,553 97,495 288,039 277,039\n(a) These expenses relate to:\n(i) professional, legal, consulting, accounting and other fees and expenses related to our acquisition and financing activities, including the\nexpenses related to the Proposed transaction.

While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they also pose\nimportant challenges, some of which are discussed below as well as in the section entitled “Risks Relating to Our\nBusiness and Industry” of our AIF for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in our other filings with the\nCanadian securities regulatory authorities and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which can be\nfound on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.\nGrowing with our Existing Customers. Our success is directly correlated with our customers’ success.\nWe focus on the high-growth markets within omnichannel payments and intend to grow alongside our existing\ncustomers as they grow their businesses and expand into new markets, including online retail, online\nmarketplaces, digital goods and services, regulated online gaming, social gaming, financial services, government,\nhealthcare, non-profit and travel. Key characteristics of these verticals are inherent growth, longevity and\npropensity to operate globally.\nIn addition, our existing customers represent a significant opportunity for us to cross-sell and up-sell products\nand services with limited incremental sales and marketing expenses. As our customers increase their business\nvolume, we can offer more solutions from our proprietary integrated modular platform. Our future revenue\ngrowth and the achievement and maintenance of profitability is dependent upon our ability to maintain existing\ncustomer relationships and to continue to expand our customers’ use of our comprehensive suite of solutions.\nAcquiring New Customers. Our future revenue growth will also depend upon the effectiveness of our\nsales and marketing efforts. We have significant sales and marketing experience in capturing and serving SMBs\nand third-party partners in North America and large enterprises in Europe. We intend to leverage this experience\nand enable customer base expansion by targeting large enterprises in North America and elsewhere. Key to our\nsuccess in achieving customer base expansion is continued investment in our direct sales team and further\nleveraging our broad and diversified network of partners.\nExpanding in Regions Internationally. We plan to expand and deepen our footprint in geographies\nwhere we have an emerging presence today, such as Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa and Latin America. Our\nexpansion has also been driven by the needs of our customers. For each new country where we seek to expand, we\nfocus on understanding the needs of the local market and invest to develop relationships, while gaining an\nappreciation for the appropriate local regulatory and compliance frameworks. We believe this will help our growth\nstrategy in achieving global presence and connectivity across all targeted markets.\nInvesting in our Technology and Product Portfolio. We believe our technology-first culture enables\nus to enhance our offerings to remain at the forefront of payments innovation. Specifically, our proprietary\nintegrated modular platform enables us to deliver comprehensive payments and technology solutions to power a\nconvenient and secure transaction experience for our customers and their customers. Further investment in our\nplatform is necessary to expand and keep our portfolio of services to our customers technologically current. Close\ncollaboration with our customers through an ongoing communication feedback loop is also key, as it enables a\nbetter design and delivery of solutions that meet their specific and evolving needs.\nMaintaining and Adding to our Acquiring Bank and Payment Network Relationships. We have\nbuilt strong relationships with acquiring banks, APM providers and payment networks globally. The maintenance\nand/or expansion of these relationships and strong collaboration will be a key enabler in the pursuit of our growth\nstrategies.\nAdding new use cases and verticals to our technology. We are adding new use cases and verticals to\nour technology. For example, with the acquisition of Paya at the beginning of Fiscal 2023, we expanded our\nexpertise to include under-penetrated verticals such as B2B, healthcare, government and non-profit. By adding\nthese use cases to our existing offering, we are growing our total addressable market.\n11\nAdapting to Regulatory Changes. The nature of our product and services offerings necessitates that we\nadhere to strict regulatory regimes in the countries where we operate. Our operational teams are fully versed in\nthe varying regulatory requirements applicable to our operations. As regulations change or as we enter new\nmarkets or launch new products and services with different regulatory requirements, we will continue to upskill\nand modify our compliance capabilities as appropriate, such as our customer underwriting, risk management,\nKYC and AML capabilities, in a manner to minimize disruption to our customers’ businesses.\nSelectively Pursuing and Successfully Executing Acquisitions. We have in the past augmented, and\nintend in the future to continue to augment, our capabilities and organic growth with strategic acquisitions.\nCritical to our success is continuing to be highly disciplined in integrating acquisitions into our Company in a\nmanner that allows us to fulfill the potential that these acquisitions bring.\nDigital assets and cryptocurrencies. We generate a small portion of our revenue from customers\noperating in the digital assets and cryptocurrencies industry. Cryptocurrencies have historically and currently\nexhibit significant price volatility that have and could continue to adversely affect the operations of our customers\nin that industry, and, in turn, our results of operations and profitability. As a result, the Company is exposed to\nvolatility in the cryptocurrency industry generally, including in sectors of the cryptocurrency industry that do not\ndirectly apply to the Company’s payment services business but that are integral to the cryptocurrency industry as a\nwhole. Cryptocurrency market prices depend, directly or indirectly, on the prices set on exchanges and other\ntrading venues, which are new and, in many cases, largely unregulated as compared to established, regulated\nexchanges for securities, derivatives and other currencies.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect our\nresults of operations. Our presentation currency is the US dollar. We derive the largest portions of our revenues\nand expenses in US dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have and may continue to negatively\naffect our revenue that is denominated in currency other than the US dollar. To the extent that we have significant\nrevenues denominated in foreign currencies, any strengthening of the US dollar would reduce our revenue and\nany weakening of the US dollar would increase our revenue as measured in US dollars.\nMiddle East conflict. The current Middle East conflict may affect our business as we conduct some of our\noperations (which excludes production) and have employees, including some technology personnel, in the region.\nSince the beginning of the conflict on October 7, 2023, we have not seen any impact to our ongoing operations and\nwe do not expect the situation to materially adversely affect our business. We will continue to monitor these\ndevelopments while supporting the safety and well-being of our employees.\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nMerchant Transaction and Processing Services. Revenues from our merchant transaction and\nprocessing services are derived primarily from eCommerce payment processing services, and stems from\nrelationships with individual customers. Additionally, transaction and processing services revenues stem from\ncontracts with financial service providers and other merchant acquirers. The contracts stipulate the types of\nservices and set forth how fees will be incurred and calculated. Merchant transaction and processing services\nrevenues are generated from processing electronic payment transactions for customers.\nOur transaction and processing services revenue is primarily comprised of (a) fees calculated based on a\npercentage of the monetary value of transactions processed; (b) fees calculated based on the number of\ntransactions processed; (c) service fees; or (d) some combination thereof that are associated with transaction and\nprocessing services.\nWe present revenue net of the interchange fees charged by the card issuing financial institutions and the fees\ncharged by the payment networks when it is determined that we are acting as an agent and do not have the ability\nto direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the benefits of these services.\nOther Revenue. We may sell hardware (“point-of-sale equipment”) as part of our contracts with customers.\nHardware consists of terminals or gateway devices. We do not manufacture hardware. We purchase hardware\nfrom third party vendors and hold the hardware in inventory until purchased by a customer.\nInterest revenue. We earn interest revenue on funds held on behalf of customers. While this is not revenue\nearned from contracts with customers, we present interest revenue on segregated funds in revenue since it is\nearned on customer funds that are held as part of our revenue generating activities.\n12\nFor more information on our revenue recognition policies, refer to Note 3 of the annual consolidated financial\nstatements for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCost of Revenue\nProcessing Costs. Processing costs consist of fees paid to processing suppliers. When we are the primary\nobligor providing payment processing services, we record processing fees paid to processing suppliers as a cost of\nrevenue. If we are not the primary obligor providing payment processing services, processing fees are netted from\nthe revenue recorded for such transactions and we do not record separate processing fees as a cost of revenue.\nProcessing costs also include losses resulting from our transaction guarantee solutions.\nCosts of Goods Sold. Costs of goods sold consist primarily of costs associated with selling point-of-sale\nequipment, such as the cost of acquiring the equipment, including purchase price, expenses associated with a\nthird-party fulfillment company, shipping, handling and inventory adjustments.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses primarily represent the amounts associated with\ncommissions, employee compensation, share-based payments, and depreciation and amortization.\nCommissions. Commissions are comprised of incentives paid to third party partners for referring\ncustomers.\nEmployee Compensation. Employee compensation consists of salaries, incentives and benefits (excluding\nshare-based payments which are disclosed separately) earned by our employees. Employee compensation includes\ncosts related to the various functions of the Company, including technology, sales and marketing, operations, as\nwell as various business support functions.\nShare-Based Payments. Share-based payments consist of our equity-settled share-based compensation\nearned by our employees, directors and consultants.\nDepreciation. Depreciation consists of depreciation of property and equipment, primarily point-of-sale\nequipment, office and computer equipment, furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements and right of use\nassets over buildings. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the useful life of the relevant\nasset or over the remaining lease term, as applicable.\nAmortization. Amortization consists primarily of amortization of intangible assets, which consist of\ninternally generated and externally purchased software that is used in providing processing services to customers.\nIt also includes trademarks, technologies, distributor commission buyouts and partner and merchant\nrelationships that are acquired by the Company. Distributor commission buyouts represent amounts paid to\nindependent sales organizations to buy out their rights to future residual commission payments. These intangible\nassets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the course of the relevant asset’s useful life.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses also consist of professional fees, transaction losses, contingent\nconsideration adjustments and other expenses.\nNet Finance Costs\nNet finance costs primarily represent amounts associated with:\nInterest on Loans and Borrowings. Interest expense consists primarily of interest incurred on term\nloans outstanding.\nChange in Fair Value of Share Repurchase Liability. When the Company enters into an automatic\nshare purchase plan, it recognizes a share repurchase liability. The share repurchase liability is a financial liability\naccounted for at fair value through profit or loss, and as such, is remeasured at fair market value until it is settled\nor upon termination of the agreement, with fair value changes being recognized in finance costs.\nAccelerated amortization of deferred financing fees. When the Company extinguishes or modifies a\nfinancial liability and the transaction is treated as a debt extinguishment, the Company recognizes unamortized\ndeferred financing fees and other related gains or losses in finance costs.\n13\nInterest Income. Interest income consists of interest received on cash and cash equivalents belonging to the\nCompany.\nLoss (Gain) on Foreign Currency Exchange\nLoss (gain) on foreign currency exchange results from monetary items that are held by the Company or its\nsubsidiaries in a currency different than its functional currency. These items are translated into the functional\ncurrency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions or when the items are re-measured at\nthe end of the reporting period. The resulting gains and losses subsequently being recognized are recorded in loss\n(gain) on foreign currency exchange.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit\nor loss except to the extent that they relate to a business combination, or items recognized directly in equity or in\nother comprehensive income (loss).\n14\nResults of Operations\nThe following table outlines our consolidated profit or loss and comprehensive income or loss information for\nthe three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree months ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30 September 30\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars except for share and per share\namounts) $ $ $ $\nRevenue 357,618 304,852 1,038,205 868,376\nCost of revenue 72,051 55,650 204,820 164,172\nGross profit 285,567 249,202 833,385 704,204\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 239,108 217,282 697,701 633,655\nOperating profit 46,459 31,920 135,684 70,549\nFinance income (1,163) (2,713) (2,551) (9,049)\nFinance cost 29,045 30,053 88,648 77,839\nNet finance cost 27,882 27,340 86,097 68,790\nLoss (gain) on foreign currency exchange (6,572) 13,033 10,933 520\nIncome (loss) before income tax 25,149 (8,453) 38,654 1,239\nIncome tax expense 7,914 9,667 20,878 16,031\nNet income (loss) 17,235 (18,120) 17,776 (14,792)\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\nForeign operations – foreign currency translation differences 8,483 1,257 11,097 (2,753)\nChange in fair value of financial instruments designated as\ncash flow hedges (7,187) (1,008) (628) (1,008)\nReclassification of change in fair value of financial\ninstruments designated as cash flow hedges to profit and loss (742) — (1,747) —\nComprehensive income (loss) 17,789 (17,871) 26,498 (18,553)\nNet income (loss) attributable to:\nCommon shareholders of the Company 15,364 (19,814) 11,966 (19,669)\nNon-controlling interest 1,871 1,694 5,810 4,877\n17,235 (18,120) 17,776 (14,792)\nComprehensive income (loss) attributable to:\nCommon shareholders of the Company 15,918 (19,565) 20,688 (23,430)\nNon-controlling interest 1,871 1,694 5,810 4,877\n17,789 (17,871) 26,498 (18,553)\nWeighted average number of common shares\noutstanding\nBasic 141,954,687 139,138,382 140,736,389 139,209,728\nDiluted 148,450,964 139,138,382 147,468,942 139,209,728\nNet income (loss) per share attributable to common\nshareholders of the Company\nBasic 0.11 (0.14) 0.09 (0.14)\nDiluted 0.10 (0.14) 0.08 (0.14)\n15\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nRevenue\nThree months ended\nChange\nSeptember 30\n2024 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars, except for percentages) $ $ $ %\nRevenue 357,618 304,852 52,766 17\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenue increased by $52.8 million or 17% as compared to\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023.

The cost was primarily due to the following items:\nInterest income. A decrease in finance income of $1.6 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nInterest on Loans and Borrowings. The decrease of $1.0 million was mainly due to lower loans and\nborrowings outstanding in the three months ended September 30, 2024 resulting from mandatory and voluntary\ndebt repayments in 2023 and 2024 as well as the reduction in interest expense due to the effect of interest rate\nswaps.\n17\nLoss (Gain) on Foreign Currency Exchange\nThree months ended\nChange\nSeptember 30\n2024 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars, except for percentages) $ $ $ %\nLoss (gain) on foreign currency exchange (6,572) 13,033 (19,605) n.m.\nGain on foreign currency exchange for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.6 million\ncompared to a loss of $13.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Net income for the three months\nended June 30, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023 reflects higher finance cost and loss (gain) on\nforeign currency exchange. Finance cost for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased sequentially,\nmainly reflecting the accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees of $15.1 million. Net income for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2024 includes a $4.0 million gain on business acquisition which partly offset a loss on\nforeign currency exchange. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024 were\nrespectively impacted by a loss and a gain on foreign currency exchange.\n22\nFinancial Position Data\nSeptember December\n30, 2024 31, 2023 Change\n(In thousands of US dollars, except for percentages) $ $ $ %\nTrade and other receivables 134,397 105,755 28,642 27\nIntangible assets 1,331,859 1,305,048 26,811 2\nGoodwill 1,989,858 1,987,737 2,121 —\nTotal Assets 5,222,557 5,135,267 87,290 2\nTrade and other payables 196,793 179,415 17,378 10\nLoans and borrowings 1,241,175 1,248,074 (6,899) (1)\nTotal Liabilities 3,126,867 3,091,052 35,815 1\nDeficit (255,226) (224,902) (30,324) 13\nTrade and other receivables and payables. The increase mainly reflects the contribution from the Till\nPayments acquisition.\nTotal liabilities and Total assets. The increase in total liabilities and total assets was mainly due to the Till\nacquisition.\nDeficit. The increase in deficit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $30.3 million is primarily the\nresult of dividends declared totaling $42.3 million, partly offset by the net income attributable to shareholders of\n$12.0 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur financial condition and liquidity are and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including:\n• Our ability to generate cash flows from our operations;\n• The level of our outstanding indebtedness and the interest we are obligated to pay on this indebtedness;\nand\n• Our capital expenditure requirements.\nThe general objectives of our capital management strategy are to ensure sufficient liquidity to pursue our\norganic growth strategy and undertake selective acquisitions, while maintaining a strong credit profile and a\ncapital structure that maintains total leverage ratio within the limits set in the credit facilities.\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash from operations, debt and equity financing. Our principal liquidity\nneeds include investment in product and technology, operations, selling, general and administrative expenses and\ndebt service, as well as our selective acquisitions.\nOur capital is composed of net debt and shareholders’ equity. Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash\nequivalents. Our use of capital is for working capital requirements and capital expenditures, and to finance\nbusiness acquisitions. We fund those requirements with our internally generated cash flows and funds drawn from\nour long-term credit facilities or via equity financings.\n23\nThe primary measure we use to monitor our financial leverage is our total leverage ratio, defined as the ratio\nof consolidated net debt outstanding, calculated as long-term debt less unrestricted cash, to consolidated adjusted\nEBITDA, calculated in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. Under our amended and restated credit\nfacility, we must maintain a total leverage ratio of less than or equal to 5.00 : 1.00 as at September 30, 2024 and\nprior to March 31, 2025 (5.00 : 1.00 as at December 31, 2023), with the ratio decreasing thereafter every March\n31, until it reaches 4.00 : 1.00 for the period on and after March 31, 2028.\nAs at September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants.\nWe believe that the Company's available cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from operations,\nloans and borrowings will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for\nat least the next 12 months.\nCredit Facilities\nOur current Amended and Restated credit facility is comprised of $1,259 million of term loans. Outstanding\nprincipal of the term loans is payable quarterly at an annual rate of 1.00% and the remaining balance will be\npayable at maturity on December 19, 2030. The Company also has a revolving credit facility of $800 million which\nwas undrawn as of September 30, 2024. The maturity of the revolving credit facility is December 19, 2028.\nThe term loan bears interest, at our option, at either (a) Term SOFR (in addition to a 0.10% credit spread\nadjustment) plus a margin of 3.00% or (b) an alternate base rate plus a margin of 4.00%. The borrowings under\nthe revolving credit facility bear interest, at our option, at either (a) Term SOFR plus a margin ranging from 2.25%\nto 2.75% or (b) an alternate base rate plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%, in each case, based on a total\nleverage ratio.\nOn May 10, 2024, the Company entered into a daylight overdraft credit facility of $30,000 Canadian dollars\n(or US dollar equivalent) to assist with intraday merchant settlement requirements. This facility bears interest at\nCA prime rate plus 3.00% per annum on Canadian dollar overdrafts or US Base rate plus 3.00% per annum on US\ndollar overdrafts. As of June 30, 2024, the credit facility was undrawn.\nAs at September 30, 2024, we had letters of credit issued totaling $58.4 million ($56.2 million as at\nDecember 31, 2023). Letters of credit do not reduce the amount that can be drawn on our revolving credit facility.\nFor more information on the Company's loans and borrowings, refer to Note 7 in our annual consolidated\nfinancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 7 of our condensed interim financial\nstatements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nCash Flows\nNine months ended\nChange\nSeptember 30\n2024 2023\n(In thousands of US dollars, except for percentages) $ $ $ %\nCash flow from (used in):\nOperating Activities 171,268 182,276 (11,008) (6)\nInvesting Activities (106,324) (1,471,324) 1,365,000 (93)\nFinancing Activities (97,097) 658,324 (755,421) n.m.\nEffect of movements in exchange rates on cash (255) 37 (292) n.m.\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents (32,408) (630,687) 598,279 (95)\nCash and cash equivalents – Beginning of period 170,435 751,686 (581,251) (77)\nCash and cash equivalents – End of period 138,027 120,999 17,028 14\n24\nCash flows from operating activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, $171.3 million of cash was generated from operating\nactivities compared to $182.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was mainly\ndriven by higher non-cash working capital items in the first quarter of 2024 related to the timing of payment\nprocessing cutoff dates.\nCash flows used in investing activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, $106.3 million of cash was used in investing activities. This\nresulted primarily from the acquisition of $56.7 million of distributor commissions and $40.4 million of\nintangible assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, $1,471.3 million of cash was used in investing\nactivities. This resulted primarily from the cash consideration, net of cash acquired, for the Paya acquisition of\n$1,379.8 million.\nCash flows from (used in) financing activities\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, $97.1 million of cash was used in financing activities, mainly\nreflecting the repayment of the credit facility assumed upon the acquisition of Till Payments as well as $42.3\nmillion of dividends paid to shareholders. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, $658.3 million of cash\nwas generated from financing activities mainly reflecting borrowings and repayments under the reducing\nrevolving credit facility, and was partially offset by $56.0 million used to repurchase and cancel approximately 1.4\nmillion Subordinate Voting Shares under the Normal Course Issuer Bid.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future\nmaterial effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or\ncapital resources. We may, from time to time, be contingently liable with respect to litigation and claims that arise\nin the normal course of operations.\nRelated Party Transactions and Executive Compensation\nWe have no related party transactions other than those presented in Note 15 in the Interim Financial\nStatements.\nFinancial Instruments and Other Instruments\nIn the ordinary course of our business activities, we are exposed to various market risks that are beyond our\ncontrol, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, and that may have an adverse effect on\nthe value of Nuvei's financial assets and liabilities, future cash flows and profit. Our policy with respect to these\nmarket risks is to assess the potential of experiencing losses and the consolidated impact thereof, and to mitigate\nthese market risks as is deemed appropriate. A more detailed description of these risks and how the Company\nmanages them, is provided in the section entitled “Financial Instruments and Other Instruments” of the\nCompany's 2023 Annual MD&A. The Company’s exposure to and management of these risks have not changed\nmaterially since December 31, 2023, other than as noted within this MD&A. Please refer to the “Risks Relating to\nOur Business and Industry” section of the AIF for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional information\nabout the material risks we face in our business.\nCredit and Concentration Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument\nfails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk arises principally from the Company’s cash, segregated funds,\ntrade and other receivables, other current assets and processor and other deposits. The carrying amounts of these\nfinancial assets represent the maximum credit exposure.\nCash, Segregated Funds and Processor Deposits\nThe credit risk related to financial institutions that hold cash and cash equivalents, segregated funds and\nprocessor deposits is managed as we seek to maintain funds with a diversified group of highly-rated financial\ninstitutions.\n25\nTrade and Other Receivables\nWe provide credit to our customers in the normal course of business. We evaluate the creditworthiness of the\ncorresponding counterparties at least at the end of each reporting period and on a specific circumstance basis. Our\nextension of credit to customers involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of each customer’s\nfinancial condition and credit history. We have established various internal controls designed to mitigate credit\nrisk, including credit limits and payment terms that are reviewed and approved by the Company. Any impaired\ntrade receivables are mostly due from customers that are experiencing financial difficulties.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to the financial risk related to the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates and the degrees of\nvolatility of those rates. Foreign currency risk is limited to the portion of our business transactions denominated\nin currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations related to foreign exchange rates could cause unforeseen\nfluctuations in our operating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate\nbecause of changes in market rates. We do not account for any fixed interest-rate financial assets or financial\nliabilities at fair value through profit and loss.\nAll loans and borrowings bear interest at floating rates, and the Company is therefore exposed to the cash flow\nrisk resulting from interest rate fluctuations. This risk is partially offset by the Company's cash balance and\nsegregated funds which also bears interest at floating rates. We also entered into interest rate swap agreements to\nhedge a portion of the Company's future floating rate interest payments. For more information on the Company's\ninterest rate swap, refer to Note 21 in our annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December\n31, 2023 and Note 14 of our Interim Financial Statements .\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the Interim Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires us to make estimates,\njudgments and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates, judgments and\nassumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and other factors, including\nexpectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized prospectively.\nCritical judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts\nrecognized in the Interim Financial Statements include the following:\nRevenue Recognition. The identification of revenue-generating contracts with customers, the\nidentification of performance obligations, the determination of the transaction price and allocations between\nidentified performance obligations, the use of appropriate revenue recognition methods for each performance\nobligation and the measure of progress for performance obligations satisfied over time are the main aspects of the\nrevenue recognition process, all of which require the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions. In addition, we\nhave applied judgment in assessing the principal versus agent considerations for our transaction and processing\nservices.\nFair Value of Share-based Payment Transactions. We recognized compensation expense as a result\nof equity-settled share-based payment transactions which are valued by reference to the fair value of the related\ninstruments. Fair value of options granted that did not contain a market performance condition was estimated\nusing the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero\ncoupon U.S. government security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the\ngrant. The assumption of expected volatility is based on the average historical volatility of comparable companies\nfor the period immediately preceding the option grant. We use an expected dividend yield in the option-pricing\nmodel.\n26\nWhen granting share-based payment compensation with performance conditions, we assess whether those\nperformance conditions are market or non-market conditions. Market conditions are taken into account in the fair\nvalue estimate on the grant date, using a Monte Carlo simulation and this fair value is not revised subsequently.\nFor non-market conditions, we estimate the expected outcome of the performance targets and revise those\nestimates and related expense until the final outcome is known.\nWhen issuing share-based payments in exchange for services rendered by an external party, the Company\nestimates the fair value of the instruments granted by reference to the fair value of services rendered by the\nexternal party, if the services can be measured reliably, instead of the fair value of the equity instrument granted.\nProvisions for Losses on Merchant Accounts. Disputes between a cardholder and a merchant arise\nperiodically, primarily as a result of customer dissatisfaction with merchandise quality or merchant services. Such\ndisputes may not be resolved in the merchant’s favor. In these cases, the transaction amount is refunded to the\ncustomer by the card issuing financial institution, but the financial institution is refunded by us. We then charge\nback to the merchant the amount refunded to the financial institution. As such, we are exposed to credit risk in\nrelation to the merchant since we assume the repayment to the merchant’s customer for the full amount of the\ntransaction even if the merchant has insufficient funds to reimburse us. A provision for losses on merchant\naccounts is maintained to absorb unrecoverable chargebacks for merchant transactions that have been previously\nprocessed and on which revenues have been recorded. The provision for losses on merchant accounts specifically\ncomprises identifiable provisions for merchant transactions for which losses can be estimated. We evaluate the\nrisk for such transactions and estimate the loss for disputed transactions based primarily on historical experience\nand other relevant factors. We analyze the adequacy of the provision for losses on merchant accounts in each\nreporting period.\nDetermining the Fair Value of Identifiable Intangible Assets Following a Business\nCombination. We use valuation techniques to determine the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired\nin a business combination, which are generally based on a discounted cash flow model. We develop assumptions\nrelated to revenue and EBITDA margin forecasts, partner and merchant attrition rates, royalty rates and discount\nrates. These valuations are linked closely to the assumptions made by management regarding the future\nperformance of the related assets and the discount rate applied as it would be assumed by a market participant.\nRecoverable Amount of Goodwill. Our impairment test for goodwill is based on the fair value less costs\nto sell method, estimated using an income approach and uses valuation models such as the discount cash flows\nmodel. The key assumptions for the fair value less costs to sell method include estimated revenue, EBITDA margin\nforecasts in determining future forecasted cash flows, as well as discount rates applied to forecasted cash flows.\nThese estimates, including the methodology used, can have a material impact on the respective values and\nultimately the amount of any goodwill impairment.\nRecoverable Amount of Tax Balances for Recognition of Tax Assets. Deferred income tax assets\nreflect our estimate of operations of future fiscal years, timing of reversal of temporary differences and tax rates on\nthe date of reversals, which may change depending on governments’ fiscal policies. We must also assess whether it\nis more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will be realized and determine whether a valuation\nallowance is required on all or a portion of deferred income tax assets.\nNew Accounting Standards and Interpretations Adopted\nThe following amendments were adopted on January 1, 2024:\nAmendments to liability classification\nOn October 31, 2022, the IASB issued new amendments to IAS 1 in addition to the previous amendment\nissued in 2020 that clarify requirements when classifying liabilities as non-current and extend the application\nperiod to January 1, 2024.\nWhen an entity classifies a liability arising from a loan arrangement as non-current and that liability is subject\nto the covenants which an entity is required to comply with within twelve months of the reporting date, this\namendment requires the entity to disclose information in the notes that enables users of financial statements to\nunderstand the risk that the liability could become repayable within twelve months of the reporting period,\nincluding:\n(a) the carrying amount of the liability;\n27\n(b) information about the covenants;\n(c) facts and circumstances, if any, that indicate the entity may have difficulty complying with the covenants.\nSuch facts and circumstances could also include the fact that the entity would not have complied with the\ncovenants based on its circumstances at the end of the reporting period.\nThe amendments described above had no impact on the Interim Financial Statements.\nNew Accounting Standards and Interpretations Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nThe IASB has issued new standards and amendments to existing standards which are applicable to the\nCompany in future periods.\nOn April 9, 2024 the IASB issued IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements to improve\nreporting of financial performance. IFRS 18 replaces IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements. It carries forward\nmany requirements from IAS 1 unchanged. IFRS 18 applies for annual reporting periods beginning on or after\nJanuary 1, 2027. Earlier application is permitted.\nThe new Accounting Standard introduces significant changes to the structure of a company's income\nstatement and new principles for aggregation and disaggregation of information. The main impacts of the new\nAccounting Standard include:\n• introducing a newly defined \"operating profit\" subtotal and a requirement for all income and expenses\nto be allocated between three distinct categories based on the company's main business activities:\nOperating, investing and financing;\n• disclosure about management performance measures;\n• adding new principles for aggregation and disaggregation of information;\n• requiring the cash flow statement to start with operating profit and;\n• removal of the accounting policy choice for presentation of dividend and interest.\nIn May 2024, amendments to IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” and IFRS 7, “Financial Instruments:\nDisclosures” were issued. The main impacts of the amendments include:\n• clarification the timing of recognition and derecognition for a financial asset or financial liability,\nincluding clarifying that a financial liability is derecognized on the settlement date. In addition to\nthese clarifications, the amendments introduce an accounting policy choice to derecognize financial\nliabilities settled using an electronic payment system before the settlement date, if criteria are met;\n• clarifications regarding the classification of financial assets, including those with features linked to\nenvironmental, social and corporate governance and contractual cash flows that are solely payments\nof principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding; and\n• additional disclosures are required for financial instruments with contingent features and\ninvestments in equity instruments classified at fair value through other comprehensive income.\nThese amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2026. Early\nadoption is permitted, with an option to early adopt only the amendments to the classification of financial assets.\nThe impact of adoption of these standards and amendments has not yet been determined.\nOutstanding Share Data\nAs of November 8, 2024, our authorized share capital consists of (i) an unlimited number of Subordinate\nVoting Shares, of which 66,056,014 were issued and outstanding, (ii) an unlimited number of Multiple Voting\nShares, of which 76,064,619 were issued and outstanding, and (iii) an unlimited number of Preferred Shares,\nissuable in series, none of which were outstanding. The Subordinate Voting Shares are “restricted securities”\nwithin the meaning of such term under applicable securities laws in Canada.\nAs of November 8, 2024, there were 617,780 stock options outstanding under the Company’s legacy stock\noption plan dated September 21, 2017, 5,292,983 stock options outstanding under the Company’s Omnibus Plan\nand 141,597 stock options outstanding under the Company's Paya Equity Plan.\n28\nAs of November 8, 2024, there were 143,644 Deferred Share Units, 7,118,114 Restricted Share Units and\n1,629,045 Performance Share Units (\"PSUs\") outstanding under the Company’s Omnibus Plan, as well as 288,351\nRestricted Share Units outstanding under the Company's Paya Equity Plan.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to all other information set out in this MD&A, our Interim Financial Statements, and our audited\nannual consolidated financial statements and notes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the specific\nrisk factors that could materially adversely affect us and/or our business, financial condition and results of\noperations are disclosed under \"Risk Factors\" in our AIF dated March 5, 2024, except for the risks identified\nbelow in respect of the proposed take private transaction. Other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently\nconsider to be material, or of which we are not presently aware, may also become important factors that affect our\nfuture business, financial condition and results of operations. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially\nand adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nIn addition to the specific risk factors disclosed under “Risk Factors” in our AIF dated March 5, 2024, the\nfollowing risk factors could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the\ncontext of a statutory plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”) involving the Company and Neon Maple\nPurchaser Inc. (the “Purchaser”), a newly-formed entity controlled by Advent, pursuant to the provisions of the\nCanada Business Corporations Act, dated April 1, 2024, as it may be amended, modified or supplemented from\ntime to time in accordance with its terms (the “Arrangement Agreement”).\nRisks related to Nuvei\nIf the Arrangement is not completed, Nuvei will continue to face the risks that it currently faces with respect to\nits affairs, business and operations and future prospects. Such risk factors are set forth and described in Nuvei’s\nAIF and the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, which have been filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and/or on EDGAR\nunder Nuvei’s profile at www.sec.gov.\nRisks related to the Arrangement\nConditions Precedent and Required Approvals\nThe completion of the Arrangement is subject to a number of conditions precedent, some of which are outside\nthe control of the Company and the Purchaser, including receipt of key regulatory approvals and other customary\nclosing conditions. Moreover, a substantial delay in obtaining satisfactory approvals and/or the imposition of\nunfavourable terms or conditions in the approvals to be obtained could have an adverse effect on the business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations of the Company or could result in the termination of the Arrangement\nAgreement.\nThe Arrangement Agreement also contains a number of additional conditions for the benefit of the Purchaser\nincluding compliance, in all material respects, with covenants by the Company, the truth and correctness, subject\nin most cases to certain qualifications, of the representations and warranties made by the Company in the\nArrangement Agreement as at the date of the Arrangement Agreement and as at closing, and no material adverse\neffect having occurred between the date of the Arrangement Agreement and closing of the Arrangement. There\ncan be no certainty, nor can the Company or the Purchaser provide any assurance, that these conditions will be\nsatisfied or waived or, if satisfied or waived, when they will be satisfied or waived.\nIf the Arrangement is not completed for any reason, there are risks that the announcement of the\nArrangement and the dedication of substantial resources of the Company to the completion thereof could have a\nnegative impact on the Company’s current business relationships, including with future and prospective\nemployees, customers, suppliers and partners, and could have a material adverse effect on the current and future\noperations, financial condition and prospects of the Company. In addition, failure to complete the Arrangement\nfor any reason could have a material negative impact on the trading price of the Subordinate Voting Shares. If the\nArrangement is not completed and the Board decides to seek an alternative transaction, there can be no assurance\nthat the Rollover Shareholders would be willing to accept or support an alternative transaction, or that it will be\nable to find a party willing to pay an equivalent or more attractive price than the Consideration to be paid\npursuant to the Arrangement.\n29\nCertain costs related to the Arrangement, such as legal, accounting and certain financial advisor fees, must be\npaid by the Company even if the Arrangement is not completed.\nIn addition, since the completion of the Arrangement is subject to uncertainty, officers and employees of the\nCompany may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company. This may adversely affect the\nCompany’s ability to attract or to retain key management and personnel in the period until the Arrangement is\ncompleted or terminated.\nTermination in Certain Circumstances and Termination Fee\nEach of the Company and the Purchaser has the right, in certain circumstances, to terminate the Arrangement\nAgreement. Accordingly, there can be no certainty, nor can the Company provide any assurance, that the\nArrangement Agreement will not be terminated by either of the Company or the Purchaser prior to the completion\nof the Arrangement. Nuvei’s business, financial condition or results of operations could also be subject to various\nmaterial adverse consequences, including that the Company would remain liable for significant costs relating to\nthe Arrangement including, among others, legal, financial advisory, accounting and printing expenses.\nUnder the Arrangement Agreement, the Company is required to pay a termination fee of US$150 million in\ncertain circumstances.\nThe Conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments may not be Satisfied or Events may Occur Preventing\nthe Financing from Being Consummated\nAlthough the Arrangement Agreement does not contain a financing condition, there is a risk that the\nconditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter may not be satisfied or\nthat other events may arise which could prevent the Purchaser from consummating the Financing. If the\nPurchaser is unable to consummate the Debt Financing and/or the Equity Financing, the Company expects that\nthe Purchaser will be unable to fund the Consideration required to complete the Arrangement. In the event the\nArrangement cannot be completed due to the failure of the Purchaser to fund the Consideration, provided that all\nother conditions to closing of the Arrangement in favour of the Purchaser are and continue to be satisfied or\nwaived and that the Company is otherwise prepared to close the Arrangement, the Company may terminate the\nArrangement Agreement, and the Purchaser will be obligated to pay a reverse termination fee of US$250 million\nand shareholders of the Company will not receive the Consideration.\nOccurrence of a Material Adverse Effect\nThe completion of the Arrangement is subject to the condition that, among other things, on or after April 1,\n2024 (the date on which the Arrangement Agreement was entered into), there shall not have occurred a material\nadverse effect in respect of the Company. Although a material adverse effect excludes certain events, including\nevents in some cases that are beyond the control of the Purchaser, there can be no assurance that a material\nadverse effect will not occur prior to the closing of the Arrangement. If such a material adverse effect occurs and\nthe Purchaser does not waive same, the Arrangement would not proceed.\nUncertainty Surrounding the Arrangement\nAs the Arrangement is dependent upon satisfaction of a number of conditions precedent, its completion is\nuncertain. In response to this uncertainty, the Company’s customers may delay or defer decisions concerning the\nCompany. Any delay or deferral of those decisions by customers could adversely affect the business and operations\nof the Company, regardless of whether the Arrangement is ultimately completed. Similarly, uncertainty may\nadversely affect the Company’s ability to attract or retain key personnel. In the event the Arrangement Agreement\nis terminated, the Company’s relationships with future, prospective and current customers, suppliers, employees,\npartners and other stakeholders may be adversely affected. Changes in such relationships could adversely affect\nthe business, financial condition, or results of and operations of the Company.\nThe Significant Resources Dedicated in Connection with the Arrangement, Restrictions from Taking Specified\nActions while the Arrangement is Pending and Negative Impact of a Failure to Complete the Arrangement on\nthe Company’s Business\n30\nThe Arrangement Agreement restricts the Company from taking certain specified actions without the consent\nof the Purchaser until the Arrangement is completed or the Arrangement Agreement is terminated. These\nrestrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing certain opportunities that may arise prior to the completion\nof the Arrangement or preclude actions that would otherwise be advisable if the Company were to remain a\npublicly-traded issuer. Among other restrictions, the Arrangement Agreement restricts the ability of the Company\nto raise capital, acquire or sell, directly or indirectly, assets, properties, securities, interests or businesses, or make\nany capital expenditures or commitments, in each case, subject to the thresholds, limitations and other terms and\nconditions contained in the Arrangement Agreement.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to non-solicitation provisions under the Arrangement Agreement. If the\nArrangement is not completed for any reason, the announcement of the Arrangement, the dedication of the\nCompany’s resources to the completion thereof and the restrictions that were imposed on the Company under the\nArrangement Agreement may have an adverse effect on the current or future operations, financial condition and\nprospects of the Company.\nThe Possibility for the Company, the Purchaser or the Rollover Shareholders to Become the Target of Securities\nClass Actions, Oppression Claims and Derivative Lawsuits Which Could Result in Costs and May Delay or\nPrevent the Consummation of the Arrangement\nSecurities class actions and oppression and derivative lawsuits may be brought against companies that have\nentered into an agreement to acquire a public company or to be acquired. Shareholders and third parties may also\nattempt to bring claims against the Company, the Purchaser or the Rollover Shareholders seeking to restrain the\nArrangement or seeking monetary compensation or other remedies. Even when the lawsuits are without merit,\ndefending against these claims can result in costs and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if an\ninjunction prohibiting consummation of the Arrangement is obtained by a third party, such injunction may delay\nor prevent the Arrangement from being completed.\nThe Volatility of the Relative Trading Price of Shares prior to Closing\nMarket assessments of the benefits of the Arrangement and the likelihood that the Arrangement will be\nconsummated may impact the volatility of the market price of the Subordinate Voting Shares prior to the\nconsummation of the Arrangement.\nRights of Former Minority Shareholders after the Arrangement\nFollowing the completion of the Arrangement, the former shareholders of the Company (other than the\nRollover Shareholders) will cease to hold such shareholders’ Subordinate Voting Shares and will no longer have an\ninterest in the Company, its assets, revenues or profits. In the event that the value of the Company’s assets or\nbusiness, prior, at or after closing of the Arrangement, exceeds the implied value of the Company under the\nArrangement, the former shareholders (other than the Rollover Shareholders) will not be entitled to additional\nconsideration for their Subordinate Voting Shares.\nThe Diversion of the Attention of the Company’s Management\nThe pendency of the Arrangement could cause the attention of management to be diverted from the day-to-\nday operations of the Company and customers, suppliers or partners may seek to modify or limit their business\nrelationships with the Company. These disruptions could be exacerbated by any delay in the completion of the\nArrangement and could have an adverse effect on the business, operating results or prospects of the Company.\nThe Possibility that the Termination Fee provided under the Arrangement Agreement If the Arrangement\nAgreement is Terminated in Certain Circumstances May Discourage Other Parties from Proposing an\nAlternative Transaction\nUnder the Arrangement Agreement, the Company may in the future be required to pay a termination fee of\n$150 million in the event the Arrangement Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances. This termination\nfee, although considered reasonable by the Board, may discourage other parties from proposing an alternative\ntransaction, even if those parties would otherwise be willing to offer greater value than that offered under the\nArrangement.\nFor purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:\n“Consideration” means the consideration to be received by the shareholders of the Company (other than the\nRollover Shareholders) pursuant to the Arrangement, consisting of $34.00 in cash per share, without interest.\n31\n“Debt Commitment Letter” means the debt commitment letter delivered to the Company by the Purchaser\nconcurrently with the execution of the Arrangement Agreement.\n“Debt Financing” means the Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to which a syndicate of lenders have\ncommitted to provide to the Purchaser, subject to the terms and conditions therein, senior secured syndicated\ncredit facilities in an initial aggregate principal amount of $3,150 million.\n“Equity Commitment Letter” means the equity commitment letter delivered by the Purchaser concurrently\nwith the execution and delivery of the Arrangement Agreement.\n“Equity Financing” means the Equity Commitment Letter pursuant to which funds affiliated to and managed\nby Advent have committed, subject to the terms and conditions therein, to make available up to $1,775 million to\nthe Purchaser through a direct or indirect equity investment in the Purchaser at the closing of the Arrangement or\nthe purpose of financing the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement.\n“Financing” means, collectively, the Debt Financing and the Equity Financing.\n“Financing Commitments” means, collectively, the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment\nLetter.\n“Rollover Agreement” means each of the agreements entered into prior to closing of the Arrangement among,\ninter alia, the Purchaser and the Rollover Shareholders, for the transfer of Rollover Shares to the Purchaser in\nconnection with the Arrangement.\n“Rollover Shareholders” means the shareholders of the Company having entered into the Rollover Agreements\nwith the Purchaser.\n“Rollover Shares” means the Multiple Voting Shares and Subordinate Voting Shares held by a Rollover\nShareholder that are the subject of a Rollover Agreement and that are to be exchanged for the consideration set\nout therein pursuant to a Rollover Agreement as of the closing of the Arrangement.\nControls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining\ndisclosure controls and procedures (as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) in\nRule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) for the Company to ensure that material information relating to the\nCompany, including its consolidated subsidiaries, that is required to be made known to the Chief Executive Officer\nand Chief Financial Officer by others within the Company and disclosed by the Company in reports filed or\nsubmitted by it under securities legislation (including the Exchange Act) is (i) recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported within the time periods specified in securities legislation (including the Commission’s rules and\nforms); and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(the \"**Purchaser** \"), an entity formed by Advent International (\"**Advent** \"), acquired, directly or indirectly, all the issued and outstanding subordinate voting shares (the \"**Subordinate Voting Shares** \") and multiple voting shares (the \"**Multiple Voting Shares** \" and together with the Subordinate Voting Shares, the \"**Shares** \") of the Company for a price of US$34.00 per Share (the \"**Arrangement** \").\n\n[ ![Nuvei logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Nuvei\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2263426/Nuvei_logo_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2263426/Nuvei_logo_Logo.html)\n\nAs part of the Arrangement, Philip Fayer, certain investment funds managed by Novacap Management Inc. (collectively, \"**Novacap** \") and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (\"**CDPQ** \") (together with entities they control directly or indirectly, collectively, the \"**Rollover Shareholders** \") sold their Shares (the \"**Rollover Shares** \") in exchange for a combination of cash and shares in the capital of the Purchaser or an affiliate thereof, in accordance with the terms of the Plan of Arrangement and the applicable rollover agreement entered into with each Rollover Shareholder in connection with the Arrangement. As a result of the Arrangement, the Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Purchaser, of which Advent, Philip Fayer, Novacap and CDPQ hold or exercise control or direction over, directly or indirectly, approximately 46%, 24%, 18% and 12%, respectively.\n\nNuvei Founder & CEO Philip Fayer rolled approximately 95% of his Shares and will continue to be one of the largest shareholders in the Company. He will also continue to serve as Nuvei's Chair and Chief Executive Officer, leading the business in all aspects of its operations, along with Nuvei's current leadership team who have continued in their roles.\n\n\"We are excited to embark on a new chapter with Advent, Novacap and CDPQ, one focused on our long-term strategy and commitment to accelerating the revenue of our customers globally,\" said Fayer. \"For more than 20 years we have provided customers with mission-critical solutions they need to execute on their growth journeys. This commitment will remain the same as we continue to build deeper partnerships with our customers by providing them modern, flexible and purpose-built technology. A key part of this next phase will be the implementation of our Value Creation Plan, a comprehensive strategic exercise designed to optimize our operations as we execute on various opportunities for accelerated growth. Advent joins our long-standing investors, Novacap and CDPQ, who remain meaningful investors and believe in a dynamic and successful future for Nuvei,\" concluded Fayer.\n\n\"Since 2017, we have been privileged to support Nuvei's management in executing its ambitious global growth strategy. Together with a leadership team that continually drives innovation and builds meaningful partnerships across industries, Nuvei has established itself as a fintech leader in key verticals with sustainable, long-term growth potential. As the Company embarks on an exciting new chapter of expansion, we look forward to strengthening our collaboration and unlocking new opportunities to create lasting value for all stakeholders,\" said David Lewin, Lead Senior Partner at Novacap.\n\n_\"_ Ever since our first investment in Nuvei in 2017, CDPQ is proud to have supported this Québec fintech leader at every stage of its growth, particularly through acquisitions on a global scale. We are delighted to accompany Nuvei once again as it embarks on this new chapter of its history, alongside recognized partners such as Advent, as well as existing shareholders Philip Fayer and Novacap,\" said Kim Thomassin, Executive Vice-President and Head of Québec at CDPQ.\n\nBo Huang, Managing Director at Advent, said: \"We are excited to begin this partnership and support Nuvei's growth through investments and acquisitions to best serve its customers globally as a modern payments partner.\"\n\nConsideration for the Shares has been remitted by or on behalf of the Purchaser to TSX Trust Company as depositary under the Arrangement, and will be paid to former shareholders of the Company as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (or, in the case of registered shareholders, as soon as reasonably practicable after a properly completed and signed letter of transmittal is received by the depositary together with the share certificate(s) and/or DRS Advice(s) representing Shares formerly held by them).\n\nAs a result of the completion of the Arrangement, it is expected that the Subordinate Voting Shares will be de-listed from the Toronto Stock Exchange on or about November 18, 2024 and from the Nasdaq Global Select Market on or about November 25, 2024. The Company has applied to cease to be a reporting issuer under Canadian securities laws in all Canadian jurisdictions. The Company will also deregister the Subordinate Voting Shares under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n**Early Warning Reporting**\n\nFurther to the requirements of National Instrument 62-104 _Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids_ and National Instrument 62-103 _The Early Warning System and Related Take-Over Bid and Insider Reporting Issues_ , the Purchaser or an affiliate thereof and Philip Fayer and certain entities controlled by Philip Fayer will file an early warning report in accordance with applicable securities laws. A copy of each of the early warning reports will be made available under Nuvei's profile on SEDAR+ at [www.sedarplus.ca](http://www.sedarplus.ca).\n\nImmediately prior to closing of the Arrangement and the related transactions, AI Maple Aggregator, L.P. (\"**Maple Aggregator** \"), an entity formed by Advent with an indirect interest in the Purchaser, did not own, or exercise control or direction over, directly or indirectly, any Shares. Upon the completion of the Arrangement, Maple Aggregator, through its indirect interest in the Purchaser, controls 46% of the 66,096,274 Subordinate Voting Shares and 76,064,619 Multiple Voting Shares issued and outstanding in the capital of the Company. The consideration paid by the Purchaser for the Shares (excluding any Rollover Shares exchanged for shares in the capital of the Purchaser or an affiliate thereof) was US$34.00 per Share (equivalent to C$47.69). The Rollover Shares exchanged for shares in the capital of the Purchaser or an affiliate thereof had an implied value of US$34.00 (equivalent to C$47.69). All figures in this press release have been calculated using a US$:C$ exchange rate of 1.4027, being the daily US$:C$ exchange rate published by the Bank of Canada for November 14, 2024.\n\nImmediately prior to closing of the Arrangement and the related transactions, Philip Fayer and certain entities controlled by Philip Fayer beneficially owned and controlled 27,857,328 Multiple Voting Shares (representing 36.62% of the issued and outstanding Multiple Voting Shares) and 124,986 Subordinate Voting Shares (representing 0.2% of the issued and outstanding Subordinate Voting Shares).

Following completion of the Arrangement, Philip Fayer and an entity controlled by him became shareholders of the Purchaser's indirect parent company and no longer beneficially own or control any Shares. Mr. Fayer now indirectly owns or controls approximately 24% of the equity in the resulting private company.
