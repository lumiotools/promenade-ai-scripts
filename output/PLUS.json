(NASDAQ: PLUS), a leading provider of technology and financing solutions, today announced financial results for the three months and six months ended September 30, 2024, the second quarter of its 2025 fiscal year.\n\n**Management Comment**\n\n\"Our results in the second quarter reflect the ongoing evolution of the industry towards ratable and subscription revenue models and slower product sales, partially offset by the continued strength of our services-led approach,\" said Mark Marron, president and CEO of ePlus. \"Notably, we experienced a year on year increase in gross profit and gross margin on lower gross billings and net sales, driven by higher margin services revenues, which increased 46%, and strong financing revenues.\n\n\"During the quarter, we acquired Bailiwick Services, LLC, which will help us drive core to edge computing solutions for our enterprise customers. In addition, we continue to see a shift towards services and more software and subscription-based sales as a percentage of the whole, and these are often recognized ratably or on a net basis creating a net sales headwind. On the product front, artificial intelligence (AI) continues to progress, and our customers are exploring advantages to integrate AI into various aspects of their businesses.\"\n\nMr. Marron continued, \"We ended the quarter with a solid balance sheet. Our healthy cash position enabled us to fund the acquisition of Bailiwick in the quarter, with ample additional liquidity to support our capital allocation priorities as we work to deliver increased shareholder value.\"\n\n**Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Results**\n\nFor the second quarter ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the second quarter ended September 30, 2023:\n\nConsolidated net sales decreased 12.3% to $515.2 million, from $587.6 million.\n\nTechnology business net sales decreased 13.8% to $493.3 million, from $571.9 million as lower product sales were offset by higher service revenues. Technology business gross billings decreased 5.6% to $808.2 million from $856.5 million.\n\nProduct sales declined 22.2% to $389.6 million, from $500.9 million, due to lower demand combined with a shift in mix. Product margin was 22.9%, up from 20.9% last year due to a higher proportion of third-party maintenance, software subscriptions and services sold in the current quarter, which are recorded on a net basis.\n\nProfessional service revenues increased 61.7% from last year to $61.9 million, from $ 38.3 million, due in part to the acquisition of Bailiwick Services, LLC. Gross margins remained consistent at 41.3%.\n\nManaged service revenues increased 27.6% to $41.8 million due to ongoing growth in these offerings, including Enhanced Maintenance Support and Cloud services. Gross profit from managed services increased 21.0% from last year due to the increase in revenues. Managed service margins declined to 29.5% from 31.1%.\n\nFinancing business segment net sales increased 39.7% to $21.9 million, from $15.7 million, primarily due to increases in transactional gains. Gross profit in the financing business segment increased $7.1 million, from $13.6 million last year to $20.7 million this year, due to the increase in net sales.\n\nConsolidated gross profit increased 2.5% to $148.0 million, from $144.4 million. Consolidated gross margin was 28.7%, compared with last year's gross margin of 24.6%.\n\nConsolidated operating expenses were $105.3 million, up 5.8% from $99.5 million last year, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits from additional headcount, as well as increases in acquisition-related expenses of $1.0 million. Our headcount at the end of the quarter was 2,323, up 446 from a year ago. The acquisition of Bailiwick Services LLC on August 19, 2024 added 441 employees, and Peak Resources on January 27, 2024 added 24 employees. Of the 446 additional employees, 328 were customer facing employees.\n\nConsolidated operating income decreased 4.8% to $42.7 million and earnings before tax decreased 3.7% to $43.3 million. Other income was $0.6 million compared to $0.1 million last year, as higher interest income of $2.4 million was offset by foreign exchange losses of $1.8 million.\n\nOur effective tax rate for the current quarter was 27.7%, slightly higher than the prior year quarter of 27.4%.\n\nNet earnings decreased 4.1% to $31.3 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the technology business declined 17.3% and increased 68.9% in the financing business segment, and when combined, resulted in consolidated adjusted EBITDA decreasing 2.7% to $52.1 million.\n\nDiluted earnings per common share was $1.17 for the second quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared with $1.22 in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share was $1.36 for the second quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared with $1.40 last year.\n\n**First Half Fiscal Year 2025 Results**\n\nFor the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023:\n\nConsolidated net sales decreased 8.8% to $1,059.7 million, from $1,161.8 million.\n\nTechnology business net sales decreased 9.6% to $1,028.8 million, from $1,137.6 million due to lower product sales, offset by higher service revenues. Technology business gross billings decreased 3.3% to $1,641.9 million from $1,698.5 million.\n\nProduct sales decreased 15.2% to $846.9 million, from $999.1 million, due to declines in customer demand, as well as a shift in product mix. Gross profit from sales of product decreased 13.1% to $187.9 million due to lower sales combined with a shift in mix towards third-party maintenance and services, which are recorded on a net basis.\n\nProfessional service revenues increased 34.3% due in part to the acquisition of Bailiwick Services, LLC. Gross margins increased slightly to 41.4%, from 41.3% for the same period in the prior year.\n\nManaged service revenues increased 27.8% to $82.7 million, from $64.7 million, due to ongoing growth in these offerings, including Enhanced Maintenance Support, Cloud and Service Desk services. Gross profit from managed services increased 25.9% to $25.2 million, from $20.0 million, due to the increase in revenues. Gross margins declined slightly to 30.4% from 30.9% last year.\n\nFinancing business segment net sales increased 28.0% to $30.9 million, from $24.2 million, due to higher transactional gains and portfolio earnings offset by lower post-contract earnings. Gross profit in the financing business segment increased $8.4 million primarily due to the increase in sales.\n\nConsolidated gross profit decreased to $282.5 million from $286.6 million. Consolidated gross margin was 26.7%, compared with last year's gross margin of 24.7%, due to higher product margins.\n\nOperating expenses were $204.3 million, up 4.5% from $195.4 million last year, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits as a result of increases in personnel and acquisition related amortization and expenses from the acquisition of Bailiwick Services LLC and Peak Resources.\n\nConsolidated operating income decreased 14.3% to $78.2 million. Earnings before tax decreased 11.7% to $80.8 million. Other income was $2.7 million compared to $0.3 million last year, as higher interest income of $4.9 million was offset by foreign exchange losses of $2.3 million.\n\nOur effective tax rate for the current year period was 27.4%, slightly higher than last year's 27.3%.\n\nNet earnings decreased 11.8% to $58.6 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased 11.3% to $95.3 million.\n\nDiluted earnings per common share was $2.19 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $2.49 in the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share was $2.50 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $2.81 last year.\n\n**Balance Sheet Highlights**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents decreased to $187.5 million from $253.0 million as of March 31, 2024, due to the acquisition of Bailiwick Services, LLC, repurchases of our common stock, and working capital needs. Inventory decreased 32.8% to $93.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with $139.7 million as of March 31, 2024. Total stockholders' equity as of September 30, 2024 was $947.0 million, compared with $901.8 million as of March 31, 2024. Total shares outstanding were 26.8 million as of September 30, 2024, and 27.0 million as of March 31, 2024.\n\n**Fiscal Year Guidance**\n\nFiscal year 2025 net sales are now expected to be similar to fiscal year 2024. The adjusted EBITDA range is now expected to be $195 million to $205 million. ePlus cannot predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort, the ultimate outcome of unusual gains and losses, the occurrence of matters creating GAAP tax impacts, fluctuations in interest expense or interest income and share-based compensation, and acquisition-related expenses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to the ePlus' results computed in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, ePlus is unable to provide a reconciliation of GAAP net earnings to adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2025 forecast.\n\n**Summary and Outlook**\n\n\"While we've seen some softening in enterprise demand due to prior absorption of purchases and global economic uncertainty, our outlook continues to reflect our prioritized investments in key high-growth categories such as AI, security and related software and services to drive long-term sustainable growth.

AND SUBSIDIARIES****RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP INFORMATION**\n\nWe included reconciliations below for the following non-GAAP financial measures: (i) Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) Adjusted EBITDA for business segments, (iii) non-GAAP Net Earnings and (iv) non-GAAP Net Earnings per Common Share - Diluted.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings calculated in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted for the following: interest expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, provision for income taxes, and other income (expense). Adjusted EBITDA presented for the technology business segments and the financing business segment is defined as operating income calculated in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted for interest expense, share-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and depreciation and amortization. We consider the interest on notes payable from our financing business segment and depreciation expense presented within cost of sales, which includes depreciation on assets financed as operating leases, to be operating expenses. As such, they are not included in the amounts added back to net earnings in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation.\n\nNon-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP net earnings per common share – diluted are based on net earnings calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude other income (expense), share based compensation, and acquisition related amortization expense, and the related tax effects.\n\nWe use the above non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of our performance to gain insight into our operating performance and performance trends. We believe that such non-GAAP financial measures provide management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business and operating results by excluding items that management believes are not reflective of our underlying operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that such non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results.\n\nOur use of non-GAAP information as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP net earnings per common share or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,| Six Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nConsolidated  \nNet earnings| $31,310| $32,664| $58,649| $66,511  \nProvision for income taxes| 11,987| 12,316| 22,190| 24,991  \nShare based compensation| 2,597| 2,414| 5,452| 4,619  \nAcquisition related expenses| 1,043| -| 1,043| -  \nInterest and financing costs| -| 661| -| 1,211  \nDepreciation and amortization [1]| 5,765| 5,630| 10,584| 10,422  \nOther (income) expense, net [2]| (579)| (117)| (2,652)| (307)  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $52,123| $53,568| $95,266| $107,447  \nTechnology Business Segments  \nOperating income| $27,466| $35,883| $59,357| $79,381  \nShare based compensation| 2,530| 2,350| 5,321| 4,487  \nDepreciation and amortization [1] | 5,765| 5,602| 10,584| 10,366  \nAcquisition related expenses| 1,043| -| 1,043| -  \nInterest and financing costs| -| 661| -| 1,211  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $36,804| $44,496| $76,305| $95,445  \nFinancing Business Segment  \nOperating income| $15,252| $8,980| $18,830| $11,814  \nShare based compensation| 67| 64| 131| 132  \nDepreciation and amortization [1] | -| 28| -| 56  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $15,319| $9,072| $18,961| $12,002  \nThree Months Ended September 30,| Six Months Ended September 30,  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nGAAP: Earnings before taxes| $43,297| $44,980| $80,839| $91,502  \nShare based compensation| 2,597| 2,414| 5,452| 4,619  \nAcquisition related expenses| 1,043| -| 1,043| -  \nAcquisition related amortization expense [3]| 4,447| 4,023| 8,197| 7,492  \nOther (income) expense [2]| (579)| (117)| (2,652)| (307)  \nNon-GAAP: Earnings before provision for income taxes | 50,805| 51,300| 92,879| 103,306  \nGAAP: Provision for income taxes| 11,987| 12,316| 22,190| 24,991  \nShare based compensation| 730| 665| 1,529| 1,272  \nAcquisition related expenses| 293| -| 293| -  \nAcquisition related amortization expense [3]| 1,246| 1,106| 2,293| 2,058  \nOther (income) expense, net [2]| (163)| (32)| (743)| (84)  \nTax benefit (expense) on restricted stock| 184| 79| 492| 216  \nNon-GAAP: Provision for income taxes| 14,277| 14,134| 26,054| 28,453  \nNon-GAAP: Net earnings| $36,528| $37,166| $66,825| $74,853  \nThree Months Ended September 30,| Six Months Ended September 30,  \n2024| 2023| 2024| 2023  \nGAAP: Net earnings per common share – diluted| $1.17| $1.22| $2.19| $2.49  \nShare based compensation| 0.07| 0.07| 0.15| 0.13  \nAcquisition related expenses| 0.03| -| 0.03| -  \nAcquisition related amortization expense [3]| 0.12| 0.11| 0.22| 0.20  \nOther (income) expense, net [2]| (0.02)| -| (0.07)| -  \nTax benefit (expense) on restricted stock| (0.01)| -| (0.02)| (0.01)  \nTotal non-GAAP adjustments – net of tax| 0.19| 0.18| 0.31| 0.32  \nNon-GAAP: Net earnings per common share – diluted| $1.36| $1.40| $2.50| $2.81  \n  \n[1] Amount consists of depreciation and amortization for assets used internally.  \n---  \n[2] Interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.  \n[3] Amount consists of amortization of intangible assets from acquired businesses.  \n  \n### Contact\n\nKley Parkhurst, SVPePlus inc.kparkhurst@eplus.com703-984-8150\n\n## Ready to learn more?\n\nPreparation and success go hand in hand.

(NASDAQ NGS: [PLUS](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/plus) – [news](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/plus/news-headlines)) and Digital Realty today jointly announced a partnership to launch a state-of-the-art AI Experience Center to be hosted in Digital Realty’s Innovation Lab located in Ashburn, VA. As one of only 10 NVIDIA DGX-ready managed service providers (MSP) globally, ePlus focuses on accelerating the delivery of AI outcomes, as well as the ongoing optimization of those technologies, which are on full display in the AI Experience Center. [](#_msocom_1)Digital Realty is a leading global provider of cloud- and carrier-neutral data center, colocation and interconnection solutions, and ePlus is a leading technology provider whose AI Ignite portfolio helps organizations unlock the full potential of AI to drive meaningful business outcomes.\n\nDesigned to help accelerate an organization’s AI journey, the AI Experience Center will enable customers to experience AI technologies in data center facilities purpose-built for AI-optimized infrastructure. Customers may explore AI-specific requirements such as power, cooling, and advanced graphics processing unit (GPU) resources that may not be available in other data center facilities. Hosting the AI Experience Center inside of Digital Realty’s Innovation Lab enables customers easy access to public and private cloud environments via ServiceFabric™. Additionally, customers can orchestrate AI-specific workloads across Digital Realty’s [Private AI Exchange (AIPx).](https://www.digitalrealty.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/123268/digital-realty-unveils-advanced-high-density-deployment-support-for-liquid-to-chip-cooling)\n\nFor organizations focused on building AI-optimized infrastructure, the AI Experience Center will demonstrate deployment, management, and optimization of NVIDIA AI Enterprise technologies and the surrounding ecosystem of software and services that empowers AI outcomes.\n\nIn addition to the technology demonstrations at the facility, customers can also take advantage of the suite of ePlus AI Ignite assessments and workshops, which are designed to help them understand their level of AI maturity and what solutions best match their goals. These engagements help identify use cases, define success criteria, assess AI preparedness, and rapidly deploy proofs of concept (POCs).\n\n“Our vision for the AI Experience Center is to help all customers – whether just embarking on an AI journey or trying to scale an existing solution – to make informed decisions about their AI investments and unlock maximum value from their data,” said Darren Raiguel, chief operating officer at ePlus. “ePlus and Digital Realty’s combined expertise, partnerships and resources make us the go-to partner to help companies intelligently navigate this markedly new terrain in business and technology.”\n\n\"Part of the digital transformation journey is for enterprises to innovate and take advantage of new opportunities powered by AI. However, the solutions are all too often disjointed and complex,” says Chris Sharp, Chief Technology Officer at Digital Realty. \"Through our partnership with ePlus and its deep industry expertise, we are equipping IT and data science teams with the intelligence and understanding they need to make smart AI investments.”\n\n“We are excited to collaborate with ePlus and Digital Realty to bring the possibilities of AI to life for customer organizations looking to harness its power,” said Rob Cato, vice president North America Channel, ISO. “The infrastructure required to support AI is one of the most critical pieces to helping ensure its success, and that’s where Lenovo comes in. We’re pleased to work alongside ePlus and Digital Realty to provide customers with innovative technology and solutions to help deliver advanced outcomes.”\n\n“Pure Storage is delighted to contribute to the ePlus and Digital Realty AI Experience Center,” said Josh Felicetti, National Partners Director at Pure Storage. “This important initiative underscores our shared vision with ePlus and Digital Realty to empower organizations with modern technology, tools, and resources that guide them through each step of their AI journey. Together, we are committed to helping our customers future-proof their AI infrastructure, alleviate complexity, and set them up for impactful AI outcomes.”\n\n“Vertiv, ePlus and Digital Realty have a long-standing history in delivering critical digital infrastructure solutions to our customers, said Giordano Albertazzi, CEO of Vertiv. “I’m excited to extend these relationships through support of the ePlus and Digital Realty AI Experience Center, which showcases power, cooling and IT solutions to demonstrate AI deployment best practices. Our companies are dedicated to offering innovative technologies to improve time to market and drive scalability as customers prepare their infrastructure for the high-performance computing wave.”\n\n“With the right tools and training, the possibilities with AI are limitless. ePlus and Digital Realty’s new AI Experience Center will allow customers to conceptualize new and unique use cases that will maximize the value of their AI investments,” said Seann Gardiner, VP, Business Development at Weights & Biases. \"We’re excited to contribute Weights & Biases technology and resources to the initiative so customers can accelerate and advance AI innovation.” \n\nTo learn more about ePlus and Digital Realty’s AI Experience Center, please visit: <https://www.eplus.com/solutions/ai/AI-Experience-Center>.\n\n**About ePlus** **inc.**\n\nePlus is a customer-first, services-led, and results-driven industry leader offering transformative technology solutions and services to provide the best customer outcomes.

technology business net sales decreased 5.3% to $535.5 million; services revenues increased 15.8% to $78.2 million.\n  * Technology business gross billings decreased 1.0% to $833.7 million.\n  * Consolidated gross profit decreased 5.5% to $134.5 million.\n  * Consolidated gross margin was 24.7% as compared to last year's 24.8%.\n  * Net earnings decreased 19.2% to $27.3 million.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA decreased 19.9% to $43.1 million.\n  * Diluted net earnings per common share decreased 19.7% to $1.02 and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per common share decreased 19.9% to $1.13.\n\n\n\nHERNDON, Va., Aug. 6, 2024 -- ePlus inc. (NASDAQ: PLUS), a leading provider of technology and financing solutions, today announced financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2024, the first quarter of its 2025 fiscal year.\n\n**Management Comment**\n\n\"We continued to see strong growth in security and services overall with our managed services up 28%. For many years we have been building strong services and recurring revenue streams, in part to offset headwinds created by the increase in netted down revenues and ratable recognition of sales, both to build a more consistent financial model, but also to deliver the solutions that customers demand with today's advanced technologies,\" said Mark Marron, president and CEO of ePlus. We are seeing strong customer interest in our AI Ignite program and discovery services. While these create nominal current revenue, they also are key to locking in future business opportunities and securing customer mindshare in this fast moving technology solution.\n\n\"Given a hard compare, with last year's first quarter growth of 25% due to supply chain easing, our first quarter net sales were down 5.2% and gross billings were down 1%. Both the revenue and gross billings decline year over year is attributable to a more normalized supply chain, the absorption of prior purchases by our customers, product mix, and the ratable trend as noted above. We do not see any long-term diminished demand for our products and services and our full year guidance remains unchanged.\"\n\nMr. Marron continued, \"We ended the quarter with a strong cash position of $350 million, providing ePlus the resources to invest in organic growth initiatives, continue our track record of strategic acquisitions, and increase shareholder returns through share repurchases.\"\n\n**First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Results**\n\nFor the first quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to the first quarter ended June 30, 2023:\n\nConsolidated net sales decreased 5.2% to $544.5 million, from $574.2 million.\n\nTechnology business net sales decreased 5.3% to $535.5 million, from $565.7 million driven by lower product sales. Technology business gross billings decreased 1.0% to $833.7 million from $842.0 million. \n\nProduct sales decreased 8.2% to $457.3 million, from $498.2 million, due to decreases in net sales of cloud and networking products, offset by increases in net sales of collaboration and security products. Gross profit decreased 11.6% to $98.5 million, from $111.4 million last year, due to the reduction of product sales and a 90-bps decline in product margin to 21.5% from 22.4% last year, due to a shift in customer mix, offset by a larger proportion of third-party maintenance and services sold in the current quarter which are recorded on a net basis.\n\nProfessional service revenues increased 4.8% from last year to $37.3 million from $35.6 million. Gross profit increased 5.0% and gross margins increased 10 bps to 41.5% from 41.4% last year.\n\nManaged service revenues increased 28.0% to $40.9 million due to ongoing demand in these offerings, including Enhanced Maintenance Support, Cloud, and Service Desk services. Gross profit increased 31.0% from last year due to the scaled growth in these services resulting in a 70-bps gross margin improvement. \n\nFinancing business segment net sales increased 6.4% to $9.0 million, from $8.5 million due to increases in portfolio earnings. Gross profit in the financing business segment increased 20.8% to $7.7 million from $6.4 million last year.\n\nConsolidated gross profit decreased 5.5% to $134.5 million, from $142.3 million. Consolidated gross margin was 24.7%, down 10 bps from last year's 24.8%, due to lower product margin in our technology business.\n\nConsolidated operating expenses were $99.0 million, up 3.2% from $95.9 million last year, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits from additional headcount. Our headcount at the end of the quarter was 1,907, up 54 from a year ago, including 28 employees from PEAK Resources, Inc. (\"PEAK\") which we acquired in January 2024.\n\nConsolidated operating income decreased 23.4% to $35.5 million. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we had other income of $2.1 million from interest income of $2.6 million offset by foreign currency transaction loss of $0.5 million. Earnings before tax decreased 19.3% to $37.5 million.\n\nOur effective tax rate remained at 27.2% year over year.\n\nNet earnings decreased 19.2% to $27.3 million from $33.8 million.\n\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA decreased 19.9% to $43.1 million from $53.9 million.\n\nDiluted net earnings per common share was $1.02 for the first quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared with $1.27 for the first quarter ended June 30, 2023. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per common share was $1.13 for the first quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared with $1.41 for the first quarter ended June 30, 2023. \n\n**Balance Sheet Highlights**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $349.9 million, up from $253.0 million as of March 31, 2024, primarily due to improvements in working capital, offset by repurchases of our common stock. Inventory decreased 36.2% to $89.1 million compared with $139.7 million as of March 31, 2024. Total stockholders' equity was $921.9 million, compared with $901.8 million as of March 31, 2024. Total shares outstanding were 26.9 million and 27.0 million on June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.\n\n**Fiscal Year Guidance**\n\nePlus is maintaining fiscal year 2025 guidance for net sales growth over the prior fiscal year of between 3% and 6%, and an adjusted EBITDA range of $200.0 million to $215.0 million. ePlus cannot predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort, the ultimate outcome of unusual gains and losses, the occurrence of matters creating GAAP tax impacts, fluctuations in interest expense or interest income and share-based compensation, and acquisition-related expenses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to the ePlus' results computed in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, the ePlus is unable to provide a reconciliation of GAAP net earnings to adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2025 forecast.\n\n**Summary and Outlook**\n\n\"Looking ahead, as we add new products and services and benefit from recent acquisitions, ePlus continues to be positioned to achieve top-line growth. Our business is supported by deep customer and channel relationships. We have invested across the organization to strengthen our product and services offerings and to customize our solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Our teams continue to execute well and operate efficiently with an unwavering commitment to superior customer service. These factors support our confidence in the underlying fundamentals of our business and our ability to deliver on our 2025 financial outlook and objectives.\n\n\"Additionally, our strong financial position provides us with considerable capital allocation options to drive long-term shareholder value, including the ability to expand our product offerings, make larger accretive acquisitions, and continue to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. This flexibility, together with ongoing investments in differentiated capabilities, should enable us to build on our competitive advantage and advance our market positioning,\" concluded Mr. Marron.\n\n**Recent Corporate Developments/Recognitions**\n\nIn the month of July:\n\n  * Announced Storage-as-a-Service leveraging NetApp.\n  * IGXGlobal, a subsidiary of ePlus, began offering Storage-as-a-Service powered by Pure Storage.\n\n\n\nIn the month of June:\n\n  * Awarded the Lenovo U.S. Infrastructure Solutions Partner of the Year Award.\n  * Announced the launch of Azure Recover.\n  * Recognized as Juniper Networks 2023 Partner of the Year for Cloud Ready Data Center in both Worldwide and Americas Categories.\n\n\n\nIn the month of May:\n\n  * Named Growth Partner of the Year by Varonis.\n  * Earned a spot on CRN's 2024 Solution Provider 500 List.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nePlus will hold a conference call and webcast at 4:30 p.m. ET on August 6, 2024:\n\nDate: | August 6, 2024  \n---|---  \nTime: | 4:30 p.m. ET  \nAudio Webcast (Live & Replay): | https://events.q4inc.com/attendee/653117486  \nLive Call: | (888) 596-4144 (toll-free/domestic)  \n(646) 968-2525 (international)  \nArchived Call: | (800) 770-2030 (toll-free/domestic)  \n(609) 800-9909 (international)  \nConference ID: | 6593768# (live call and replay)  \n  \nA replay of the call will be available approximately two hours after the call through August 13, 2024.

AND SUBSIDIARIES****RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP INFORMATION**\n\nWe included reconciliations below for the following non-GAAP financial measures: (i) Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) Adjusted EBITDA for business segments, (iii) non-GAAP Net Earnings and (iv) non-GAAP Net Earnings per Common Share - Diluted.\n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings calculated in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted for the following: interest expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, provision for income taxes, and other income (expense). Adjusted EBITDA presented for the technology business segments and the financing business segment is defined as operating income calculated in accordance with US GAAP, adjusted for interest expense, share-based compensation, acquisition and integration expenses, and depreciation and amortization. We consider the interest on notes payable from our financing business segment and depreciation expense presented within cost of sales, which includes depreciation on assets financed as operating leases, to be operating expenses. As such, they are not included in the amounts added back to net earnings in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation.\n\nNon-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP net earnings per common share – diluted are based on net earnings calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude other income (expense), share based compensation, and acquisition related amortization expense, and the related tax effects.\n\nWe use the above non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of our performance to gain insight into our operating performance and performance trends. We believe that such non-GAAP financial measures provide management and investors a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business and operating results by excluding items that management believes are not reflective of our underlying operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that such non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results.\n\nOur use of non-GAAP information as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP net earnings per common share or similarly titled measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as comparative measures.\n\nThree Months Ended June 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nConsolidated  \nNet earnings| $27,339| $33,847  \nProvision for income taxes| 10,203| 12,675  \nDepreciation and amortization [1]| 4,819| 4,792  \nShare based compensation| 2,855| 2,205  \nInterest and financing costs| -| 550  \nOther expense, net [2]| (2,073)| (190)  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $43,143| $53,879  \nTechnology Business Segment  \nOperating income| $31,891| $43,498  \nDepreciation and amortization [1] | 4,819| 4,764  \nShare based compensation| 2,791| 2,137  \nInterest and financing costs| -| 550  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $39,501| $50,949  \nFinancing Business Segment  \nOperating income| $3,578| $2,834  \nDepreciation and amortization [1] | -| 28  \nShare based compensation| 64| 68  \nAdjusted EBITDA | $3,642| $2,930  \n  \nThree Months Ended June 30,  \n---  \n2024| 2023  \n(in thousands)  \nGAAP: Earnings before taxes| $37,542| $46,522  \nShare based compensation| 2,855| 2,205  \nAcquisition related amortization expense [3]| 3,750| 3,469  \nOther (income) expense [2]| (2,073)| (190)  \nNon-GAAP: Earnings before provision for income taxes | 42,074| 52,006  \nGAAP: Provision for income taxes| 10,203| 12,675  \nShare based compensation| 799| 607  \nAcquisition related amortization expense [3]| 1,047| 952  \nOther (income) expense, net [2]| (580)| (52)  \nTax benefit (expense) on restricted stock| 308| 137  \nNon-GAAP: Provision for income taxes| 11,777| 14,319  \nNon-GAAP: Net earnings| $30,297| $37,687  \nThree Months Ended June 30,  \n2024| 2023  \nGAAP: Net earnings per common share â diluted| $1.02| $1.27  \nShare based compensation| 0.08| 0.06  \nAcquisition related amortization expense [3]| 0.10| 0.09  \nOther (income) expense, net [2]| (0.06)| -  \nTax benefit (expense) on restricted stock| (0.01)| (0.01)  \nTotal non-GAAP adjustments â net of tax| 0.11| 0.14  \nNon-GAAP: Net earnings per common share â diluted| $1.13| $1.41  \n  \n[1] Amount consists of depreciation and amortization for assets used internally.  \n---  \n[2] Legal settlement, interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.  \n[3] Amount consists of amortization of intangible assets from acquired businesses.  \n  \n### Contact\n\nKley Parkhurst, SVPePlus inc.kparkhurst@eplus.com703-984-8150\n\n## Ready to learn more?\n\nPreparation and success go hand in hand.
