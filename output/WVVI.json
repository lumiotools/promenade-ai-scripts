(OTCBB: ORBN) (the “Company”), parent company of Willamette Valley Bank, reported net income for the third quarter of $1,017,000 and $0.41 per common share. The Company’s quarterly return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.9% and 5.6%, respectively. This compares to $801,000 in net income and $0.32 per common share outstanding for the quarter ending June 30, 2024. \n\nThe Company’s balance sheet expanded by $16.0 million in assets during the quarter. This was largely the result of a $31.8 million increase in deposits that improved balance sheet liquidity and reduced FHLB borrowings. The Company’s net interest margin also increased from 3.4% to 3.5% during the third quarter. Residential loan origination volume decreased during the quarter from $75 million to $63 million. Bank asset quality and capital remain strong and the Board of Directors distributed a $0.20 per share quarterly dividend on October 15, 2024. \n\nRyan Dempster, President and CEO, commented, “The Federal Reserve recently reduced interest rates as a result of positive reports on inflation and slowing labor market. This led to reduced borrowing rates and improved residential loan application volume. Overall, we are pleased with our quarterly financial results which are the best since the second quarter of 2023.” \n\n** About Oregon Bancorp, Inc. **\n\nOregon Bancorp, Inc. is the parent company of Willamette Valley Bank (Bank), a community bank headquartered in Salem, Oregon.

(OTCBB: ORBN) (the “Company”), parent company of Willamette Valley Bank, reported net income for the second quarter of $801,000 and $0.32 per common share. The Company’s quarterly return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.7% and 4.4%, respectively. This compares to $634,000 in net income and $0.26 per common share outstanding for the quarter ending March 31, 2024. \n\nThe Company’s balance sheet expanded by $82.3 million during the quarter. This was largely the result of a strategy to increase earnings through additional investment in securities issued by the United States government. Correspondingly, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that is designed to offset changes in the value of these securities. This investment has improved our net income but resulted in a decline in our net interest margin. The Company’s net interest margin decreased from 4.2% to 3.4% during the second quarter. Bank asset quality and capital remain strong, which permitted the Board of Directors to distribute a $0.20 per share quarterly dividend on July 15, 2024. \n\nRyan Dempster, President and CEO, commented, “Although the economy continues to remain stable, economic data related to employment and inflation is beginning to display some slowing, which has led to renewed speculation that the Federal Reserve may reduce interest rates later this year. This could lead to a welcome reduction in loan interest rates for borrowers.” \n\n** About Oregon Bancorp, Inc. **\n\nOregon Bancorp, Inc. is the parent company of Willamette Valley Bank (Bank), a community bank headquartered in Salem, Oregon.
