The consistent growth trend continued, with record Transactions, record revenue, and the highest revenue growth rate and highest adjusted EBITDA since going public. \n\n“Our strong third-quarter results highlight the transformative impact our platform is making in freight digitalization,” said Zvi Schreiber, CEO of Freightos. “We saw impressive growth in transaction volumes, driven by our expanding network of engaged buyers and sellers. The addition of Shipsta has further strengthened our solution portfolio and our customer base of enterprise shippers. We continued releasing product features at a high rate including AI-powered features that leverage our significant industry traction. These innovations underscore the growing reliance of the industry on digital solutions to bring transparency, efficiency, and resilience to global freight, a shift in which Freightos plays a pivotal role.”\n\n“Our third-quarter results once again exceeded expectations across all key metrics,” said Ran Shalev, CFO of Freightos. “We’re pleased not only with our strong performance in transactions, Gross Booking Value (GBV), revenue, and adjusted EBITDA, but also with our ability to update guidance for the final quarter of 2024. We are increasing Adjusted EBITDA guidance and expecting that revenue will be towards the top end of previous guidance. This performance reflects our continued commitment to growth and efficiency, further reinforcing our path toward achieving positive Adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2026 on existing cash reserves.”\n\n## Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights \n\n  * Revenue of $6.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 21% compared to $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * IFRS Gross Margin of 65.0%, up from 54.9% in the third quarter of 2023. Non-IFRS Gross Margin of 72.7%, up from 69.5% for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * IFRS operating loss of $4.9 million, compared to an operating loss of $9.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of negative $2.8 million, compared to negative $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Cash and cash equivalents and short term bank deposit amounting to $41.3 million as of September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n## Recent Business Highlights\n\n  * **Shipsta** : In the third quarter, Freightos successfully integrated Shipsta, a leading freight tender procurement platform serving dozens of Global 1000 enterprises, following its acquisition in August. The integration is progressing as planned, and the cross-introduction of Shipsta’s offerings to Freightos’ customer base – and vice versa – is already gaining promising traction.\n  * **Transactions Growth:** Freightos achieved a record 339.1 thousand Transactions in the third quarter of 2024, up 26% year over year. This was the 19th consecutive quarter of record Transactions. The Platform continues its consistent outperformance compared to the market growth: In the third quarter, global air cargo volumes (according to IATA data) grew 11% year on year, and global ocean shipping volumes (according to CTS) grew 4.2%.\n  * **Carrier Growth:** The number of carriers selling on the Platform, primarily on WebCargo, increased to 55 for the third quarter of 2024. Among the recent carrier additions are Qantas and Air India (via the GSA Euro Cargo Aviation). Freightos also recently announced the addition of Pacific Air Cargo and HNA Cargo to its platform.\n  * **Unique Buyer Users:** The number of Unique buyer users digitally booking freight services across the Freightos Platform grew by 14% compared to the third quarter of 2023, reaching 19.7 thousand. \n  * **Gross Booking Value Growth:** Gross Booking Value (GBV) was $217.5 million in the third quarter, up 35% compared to the third quarter of 2023, significantly exceeding management’s expectations. \n  * **Revenue Growth:** Revenue of $6.2 million reflected particularly strong growth from the WebCargo by Freightos platform, from customs clearance services, and from SaaS Solutions including Shipsta. Total Platform revenue in the third quarter was $2.3 million, up 29% from the third quarter of 2023, and Solutions revenue was $3.9 million, up 18% year over year. \n\n\n\n## Financial Outlook\n\n**Management Expectations**  \n---  \n**Q4 2024**| **FY 2024**  \nTransactions| 338.5 – 348.5| 1,289.5 – 1,300.0  \nYear over Year Growth|  _18% – 21%_| _26% – 27%_  \nGBV (m)| $ 257.0 – $ 265.0| $ 870.5 – $ 878.5  \nYear over Year Growth|  _37% – 41%_| _30% – 31%_  \nRevenue (m)| $ 6.4 – $ 6.5| $ 23.6 – $ 23.7  \nYear over Year Growth|  _21% – 24%_| _16% – 17%_  \nAdjusted EBITDA (m)| $ (3.2) – $ (3.1)| $ (12.7) – $ (12.6)  \n_This outlook assumes freight price levels and freight volumes as of Nov 15th, 2024_\n\n## Earnings Webcast\n\nFreightos’ management will host a webcast and conference call to discuss the results today, November 25 at 8:30 a.m. EST.

Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target” or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These statements, which include the financial outlook of Freightos, are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Freightos, and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are difficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Freightos. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including including Freightos’ ability to successfully integrate the Shipsta business without disruption to its business; the ongoing military conflict in the Middle East; Freightos’ ability to effectively execute its previously announced operational efficiency and cost reduction plan without undue disruption to its business; competition and the ability of Freightos to build and maintain relationships with carriers, freight forwarders and importers/exporters and retain its management and key employees; changes in applicable laws or regulations; any downturn or volatility in economic conditions whether related to inflation, armed conflict or otherwise; changes in the competitive environment affecting Freightos or its users, including Freightos’ ability to introduce new products or technologies; risks to Freightos’ ability to protect its intellectual property and avoid infringement by others, or claims of infringement against Freightos; and those additional factors discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Freightos’ annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024, and any other risk factors Freightos includes in any subsequent reports of foreign private issuer on Form 6-K furnished to the SEC. If any of these risks materializes or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be additional risks of which Freightos is not aware presently or that Freightos currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Freightos’ expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views as of the date of this press release. Freightos anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Freightos’ assessments to change. However, while Freightos may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Freightos specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Freightos’ assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.\n\n## Financial Information; Non-IFRS Financial Measures\n\nWhile certain financial figures included in this press release have been computed in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, this press release does not contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as defined in International Accounting Standards 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” nor a financial statement as defined by International Accounting Standards 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”. \n\nThis press release includes certain financial measures not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the IFRS including, but not limited to, Adjusted EBITDA. These non-IFRS measures differ from the most directly comparable measures determined under IFRS. For the historical non-IFRS results included herein, we have provided tables at the end of this press release providing a reconciliation of those results to our results achieved under the most directly comparable IFRS measures. For the forward-looking non-IFRS data included under “Financial outlook”, we have not included such a reconciliation, because the reconciliation of forward-looking data cannot be prepared without unreasonable effort. Our results and forecasts expressed as non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to revenue, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under IFRS. You should be aware that the presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. Freightos believes that Adjusted EBITDA and other non-IFRS measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating Freightos’ operating results because they provide supplemental measures of our core operating performance and offer consistency and comparability with both our own past financial performance and with corresponding financial information provided by peer companies. Certain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this press release have been subject to rounding adjustments, and therefore may not sum due to rounding.\n\nGlossary\n\nWe have provided below a glossary of certain terms used in this press release:\n\n  * **Transactions:** Number of bookings for freight services, and related services, placed by Buyers across the Freightos platform with third-party sellers and with Clearit. Sellers of Transactions include Carriers (that is, airlines, ocean liners and LCL consolidators) and also other providers of freight services such as trucking companies, freight forwarders, general sales agents, and air master loaders. The number of transactions booked on the Freightos platform in any given time period is net of transactions that were canceled prior to the end of the period. Transactions booked on white label portals hosted by Freightos are included if there is a transactional fee associated with them.\n  * **Carriers:** Number of unique air and ocean carriers, mostly airlines, that have been sellers of transactions. For airlines, we count booking carriers, which include separate airlines within the same carrier group. We do not count dozens of other airlines that operate individual segments of air cargo transactions, as we do not have a direct booking relationship with them. Carriers include ocean less-than-container load (LCL) consolidators. In addition, we only count carriers when more than five bookings were placed with them over the course of a quarter.\n  * **Unique buyer users:** Number of individual users placing bookings, typically counted based on unique email logins. The number of buyers, which counts unique customer businesses, does not reflect the fact that some buyers are large multinational organizations while others are small or midsize businesses. Therefore, we find it more useful to monitor the number of unique buyer users than the number of buyer businesses.\n  * **GBV:** Total value of transactions on the Freightos platform, which is the monetary value of freight and related services contracted between buyers and sellers on the Freightos platform, plus related fees charged to buyers and sellers, and pass-through payments such as duties. GBV is converted to U.S. dollars at the time of each transaction on the Freightos platform. This metric may be similar to what others call gross merchandise value (GMV) or gross services volume (GSV). We believe that this metric reflects the scale of the Freightos platform and our opportunities to generate platform revenue.\n  * **Adjusted EBITDA:** Loss before income taxes, finance income, finance expense, share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, operating expense settled by issuance of shares, share listing expense, change in fair value of warrants, transaction-related costs, non-recurring expenses associated with the business combination with Gesher I Acquisition Corp, acquisition-related costs and reorganization expenses.\n  * **Platform revenue:** Fees charged to buyers and sellers in relation to transactions executed on the Freightos platform. For bookings conducted by importers/exporters, our fees are typically structured as a percentage of booking value, depending on the mode and nature of the service. When freight forwarders book with carriers, the sellers often pay a pre-negotiated flat fee per transaction. When sellers transact with a buyer who is a new customer to the seller, we may charge a percentage of the booking value as a fee.\n  * **Solutions revenue:** Primarily subscription-based SaaS and data. It is typically priced per user or per site, per time period, with larger customers such as multinational freight forwarders or enterprise shippers often negotiating fixed, all-inclusive subscriptions. Revenue from our Solutions segment includes certain non-recurring revenue from services ancillary to our SaaS products, such as engineering, customization, configuration and go-live fees, and data services for digitizing offline data.\n\n\n\n## About Freightos\n\nFreightos® (NASDAQ: CRGO) is the leading vendor-neutral global freight booking platform.

Viewers of this\npresentation should make their own evaluation of Freightos and of the relevance and accuracy of the information contained herein and should make such other\ninvestigations as they deem necessary. This presentation does not constitute an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation to purchase any\nsecurity of Freightos, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or\nqualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. You should not construe the contents of this presentation as legal, tax, accounting or investment advice or\na recommendation. You should consult your own counsel and tax and financial advisors as to legal and related matters concerning the matters described herein, and, by\nviewing this presentation, you confirm that you are not relying upon the information contained herein to make any investment decision.\nFinancial Information; Non-IFRS (Non-GAAP) Financial Measures\nWhile certain financial figures included in this presentation have been computed in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the\nInternational Accounting Standards Board, this presentation does not contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as defined in International\nAccounting Standards 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” nor a financial statement as defined by International Accounting Standards 1 “Presentation of Financial\nStatements”. Not all of the financial information in this presentation has been audited.\nIn addition, this presentation includes revenue on a constant currency basis, a measure not presented in accordance with IFRS and, this presentation includes certain\nfinancial measures not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“IFRS”) including, but not limited to, Adjusted EBITDA. Therefore, these\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to revenue, net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or\nperformance under IFRS. You should be aware that the presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\nFreightos believes that revenue on a constant currency basis, EBITDA and other non-IFRS measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding\nand evaluating Freightos’ operating results because they provide supplemental measures of our core operating performance and offers consistency and comparability\nwith both past financial performance and with financial information of peer companies. Certain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included in this press\nrelease have been subject to rounding adjustments. Certain other amounts that appear in this presentation may not sum due to rounding.\n2\n01:25\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis presentation includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation\nReform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “will,” “expect,”\n“anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target” or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters.\nThese statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this press release, and on the current expectations of Freightos’ and are not\npredictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not\nbe relied on by any investor as, a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. Actual events and circumstances are\ndifficult or impossible to predict and will differ from assumptions. Many actual events and circumstances are beyond the control of Freightos. These\nforward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including competition and the ability of Freightos to build and maintain\nrelationships with carriers, freight forwarders and importers/exporters and retain its management and key employees; changes in applicable laws or regulations;\nany downturn or volatility in economic conditions whether related to inflation, armed conflict or otherwise; the effects of COVID-19 or other pandemics or\nepidemics; changes in the competitive environment affecting Freightos or its users, including Freightos’ inability to introduce new products or technologies; risks\nto Freightos’ ability to protect its intellectual property and avoid infringement by others, or claims of infringement against Freightos; the possibility that Freightos\nmay be adversely affected by other economic, business and/or competitive factors; risks related to the fact that Freightos is incorporated in the Cayman Islands\nand governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands; and those factors discussed in Freightos’ annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on March 30, 2023,\nunder the heading “Risk Factors,” and any other risk factors Freightos includes in any subsequent reports on Form 6-K furnished to the SEC. If any of these risks\nmaterialize or our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from the results implied by these forward-looking statements. There may be\nadditional risks that Freightos does not presently know or that Freightos currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those\ncontained in the forward-looking statements. In addition, forward-looking statements reflect Freightos’ expectations, plans or forecasts of future events and views\nas of the date of this press release. Freightos anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause Freightos’ assessments to change. However, while\nFreightos may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, Freightos specifically disclaims any obligation to do so. These\nforward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing Freightos’ assessments as of any date subsequent to the date of this press release.\nAccordingly, undue reliance should not be placed upon the forward-looking statements.\n3\n01:37\n4\n02:00\nAgenda\nPrepared Remarks\n● Business Overview\n● Financial Results\n● Q4 Guidance\nQ&A\nZvi Schreiber\nCEO\n5\n03:20\nMarket conditions have been a tailwind\nFreightos Air Index Global Benchmark Global Air Cargo Volumes\nSource: IATA\n04:02\nStrong consistent transactions growth reflects\nmarketplace network effect\n70% CAGR\n7\n05:10\nMarketplace buyers and sellers\nCarriers Unique Buyer Users\nUnique buyer users: Unique buyer users represent the number of individual users placing bookings, typically counted based on unique email logins. The number of buyers, which counts\nunique customer businesses, does not reflect the fact that some buyers are large multinational organizations while others are small or midsize businesses. Therefore, we find it more useful\nto monitor the number of unique buyer users than the number of buyer businesses.\nCarriers: Number of unique air and ocean carriers, mostly airlines, who have been sellers of transactions. For airlines, we count booking carriers, which include separate airlines within the same\ncarrier group. We do not count dozens of other airlines that operate individual segments of air cargo transactions, as we do not have a direct booking relationship with them. Carriers include ocean\nless-than-container load (LCL) consolidators. In addition, we only count carriers when more than five bookings were placed with them over the course of a quarter.\n8\n06:15\nStrong sustainable growth through the\nnetwork effects of a double marketplace flywheel\nBuyers attracts\nsellers\nCarrier Freight\nImport/exporters\ns forwarders\nSeller attracts\nAmplified bbyu...yers\nMore types More combinations More connectivity More aspects\nof transactions of buyer/seller to data / system of transactions\neg LTL, Temp. controlled eg forwarder delegation eg Dynamic pricing for eg LTL, Temp. controlled\nairlines, TMS\n9\n06:39\nFreightos really just had\nthe whole suite of\nthings that we were Megan Kelley\nVP Enterprise Applications\nlooking for with Crane Worldwide Logistics\ne-booking on the end\nIntegrated with\n[and] quoting on the\nfront…\nReally great technology.\n1100\n07:54\nContinuously enhancing our offering\n11\n08:57\nExpanding our Benchmarking Offering\n12\n09:15\nStrong cohort performance by both buyers and sellers\nTotal #Transactions of forwarder cohort as % of bookings Total #Transactions of carrier cohort as % of bookings\nplaced in first quarter placed in first quarter\n13\n11:10\nAgenda\nPrepared Remarks\n● Business Overview\n● Financial Results\n● Q4 Guidance\nRan Shalev\nCFO\nQ&A\n14\n11:12\nQ3 24 Actual vs. Guidance\nQ3 24 A Q3 24 G\n# Transactions 339.1 323.5 - 332.5\nGBV ($m) 217.5 198.0 - 203.5\nRevenue ($m) 6.2 5.9 - 6.0\nAdjusted EBITDA ($m) (2.8) (3.4) - (3.3)\n15\n11:50\nMonetizing the network value: SaaS-enabled\nmarketplace flywheel\nSolutions revenue is\nprimarily recurring\nsubscriptions for SaaS or\ndata\n↑17% y/y\nPlatform revenue = fees\nassociated with specific\nfreight-service\ntransactions booked\nbetween Buyers and\nSellers on our Platform\n↑29% y/y\n16\n12:34\nHighly capital-efficient growth\nNon-IFRS Gross Margins\n17\n13:06\nOn track to profitability with cash at hand\nAcquisition cash consideration of $4.9M (€4.5M) supports goal of\nreaching breakeven by end of 2026 with cash on hand\nAdjusted EBITDA ($K) Cash and Short term bank deposits ($M)\n-73%\n-81%\n-104%\n-121%\n18\n14:22\nQ4 & FY 2024 Guidance\nManagement Expectations\nQ4 2024 FY 2024\nTransactions 338.5 - 348.5 1,289.5 - 1,300.0\nYear over Year Growth 18% - 21% 26% - 27%\nGBV (m) $ 257.0 - $ 265.0 $ 870.5 - $ 878.5\nYear over Year Growth 37% - 41% 30% - 31%\nRevenue (m) $ 6.4 - $ 6.5 $ 23.6 - $ 23.7\nYear over Year Growth 21% - 24% 16% - 17%\nAdjusted EBITDA (m) $ (3.2) - $ (3.1) $ (12.7) - $ (12.6)\nThis outlook assumes freight price levels and freight volumes as of November 15, 2024\n19\n15:50\n?\nThanks!\nQuestions\n20\nReconciliation of IFRS Gross Margin to Non-IFRS\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(unaudited) (unaudited)\nIFRS gross profit $ 4,023 $ 2,802 $ 11,047 $ 8,530\nAdd:\nShare-based compensation 123 432 313 591\nDepreciation and amortization 349 315 972 871\nNon-IFRS gross profit $ 4,495 $ 3,549 $ 12,332 $ 9,992\nIFRS gross margin 65.0% 54.9% 64.2% 56.8%\nNon-IFRS gross margin 72.7% 69.5% 71.7% 66.5%\n21\nReconciliation of IFRS Operating Loss to Adjusted\nEBITDA\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(unaudited) (unaudited)\nOperating loss $ (4,862) $ (9,292) $ (14,910) $ (73,158)\nAdd:\nShare-based compensation 982 3,375 2,576 4,503\nDepreciation and amortization 803 719 2,213 2,081\nShare listing expense - - - 46,717\nNon-recurring expenses - - - 499\nTransaction-related costs - - - 3,703\nChanges in the fair value of contingent consideration - - - (642)\nAcquisition-related costs 283 - 283 -\nReorganization - 884 - 884\nOperating expense settled by issuance of shares - 184 351 184\nAdjusted EBITDA $ (2,794) $ (4,130) $ (9,487) $ (15,229)\nAdjusted EBITDA margins -45% -81% -55% -101%\n22\nLearn more at\nfreightos.com/investors\n23"

Air cargo rates and volumes\nin Q3 remained at similar levels to Q2 and elevated compared to Q3 last year.\nGlobal air cargo volumes increased 11% year on year and rates were 30% higher on China-US routes and 17% higher on China-EU routes, in part\ndue to an accelerated international direct-to-consumer e-commerce trend. Meanwhile, ocean rates remained elevated, given the ongoing Red Sea\ncrisis, although they have recently begun to ease as the peak season of shipping for the holidays comes to an end.\nAgainst this backdrop, let's turn to see how Freightos has performed this quarter. In my comments this quarter, we'll focus on our progress across\nthree areas: one is platform; two, solutions; and three, network. Platform and solutions are, of course, the two main ways we deliver our valuable\nproducts to our customers, and these are also the segments in which we report revenue. Network effects are how we ensure continued long-term\ncapital efficient growth.\nLet's start by discussing our platform growth. Our most important platform KPI remains the number of transactions. This quarter, we achieved\n339,000 transactions, a 26% increase compared to the same period last year and marking at least our 19th consecutive quarter of record transactions.\nAs a reminder, transactions are digital bookings placed between a buyer of freight services and a logistic service provider, a carrier or freight\nforwarder on our platform.\nThis consistent growth reflects the increasing adoption of Freightos' digital platform as an essential tool for global freight operations. We're a leader\nin digital, but digital is still only a small percentage of the total addressable market, so we expect to keep this consistent growth momentum going\nfor many years to come.\nOn the sell side of the platform, in Q3, we reached 55 carriers, among new airlines of Qantas, which adds transpacific capacity with both passenger\nplanes and freighter services across key US and Australian hubs. We also added Air India via their general sales agent or GSA Euro Cargo Aviation.\nProgress is ongoing with a couple of big carriers whose integration time lines were delayed earlier this year due to IT challenges on their side, as\nwe discussed on our last call. Those carriers remain on track to contribute to transaction volumes in 2025. And despite those delays, the transaction\nvolume exceeded guidance in Q3.\nOn the buy side of the platform, we increased unique buyer users to 19,700 in Q3, an increase of 14% year over year. This increase in both sellers\nand buyers contributed to a 35% year-over-year growth in the gross booking value, or GBV, which reached $217.5 million for the quarter. Higher\nfreight prices driven by the ongoing Red Sea crisis and international e-commerce also supported the strong GBV performance.\nFreightos has continued to focus on expanding the scope of transactions by integrating additional services such as trucking to provide a seamless\ndoor-to-door freight experience. In Q3, our less-than-truckload or LTL offerings, performed well, enhancing first-mile and last-mile solutions and\nhighlighting the value of our multimodal capabilities.\nWe continue to expand our integration to third-party solution providers as well. Last week, we announced an integration with e2open. e2open,\nticker symbol ETWO, is a large provider of supply chain software. This partnership embeds our air cargo pricing and booking directly into e2open's\nown transportation management system, or TMS, offering freight forwards instant access to dynamic air freight rates and real-time booking\ncapabilities. This drives real customer value, as you can see from this quote from Megan Kelley, VP of Enterprise Solutions at a large freight forwarder\ncustomer, Crane Worldwide Logistics.\n3\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

WebCargo continued its rapid expansion with high transaction volumes of freight forwarders booking with airlines.\nFreightos.com is where importers and exporters book with service providers. And although we're not investing in growing it this year, it still had\nits best quarter in some time, contributing a higher take rate per transaction by serving small importers and exporters seeking efficient freight\nsolutions.\nClearit, our digital customs broker also had a good quarter. Together, these platforms highlight Freightos' ability to capture value from digital\nbookings across diverse segments of the freight ecosystem.\nThe second pillar of Freightos' strategy is solutions. Here, we focus on growing recurring subscription revenue through SaaS and data products,\nour subscription-based solutions empower freight forwarders and importers and exporters to improve operational efficiency and make data-driven\ndecisions through cutting-edge digital tools.\nSolutions revenue in Q3 continued to grow steadily, supported by the integration of Shipsta, a leading procurement and tender management\nplatform which we acquired in August.As a reminder, Shipsta's capability align closely with Freightos' mission, to digitalize freight operations,\nenabling enterprise customers, primarily large shippers, to streamline complex procurement processes for long-term freight contracts. We've\nstarted to introduce Shipsta's capabilities to Freightos' customer base uncovering significant cross-selling opportunities, further validating the\nstrategic fit between the two solutions.\nMeanwhile, Shipsta continued to grow its customer base in Q3, winning deals with a global leader in elevator and escalator manufacturing, a top\nfive pharma company and a leading cosmetics brand. Sorry, I don't yet have permission to share the customer names.\nIn addition to Shipsta, Freightos introduced other new features to improve our data offering, Freightos Terminal. This included broader rates\nbenchmarking capabilities and experimenting with AI to automatically provide sophisticated, actionable insights for logistics decision-making.\nNow the third pillar of Freightos' strategy focuses on network or network effects, in which every customer strengthens the value of our network\nfor all the other customers. A great example is interlining, where airlines buy from airlines, and therefore, each new airline brings new value to\nother airlines on our network.\nSome big airline partners tell me that 15% of their bookings are interlining with other airlines. Just a few days ago, I visited a user who was the first\nto complete 1,000 interlining bookings. So we think that the interlining offering is finally set to really take off in 2025.\nRepeat usage amongst both freight forwarders and carriers remained high in Q3. Cohort analysis again proves that both freight forwarders and\ncarriers who joined the platform not only stay, but continue to grow their engagement over time.\nThis growth is driven by expanding network coverage and new platform features. The ongoing growing -- the ongoing growing engagement from\nboth buyers and sellers proves the buyer-brings-seller-brings-buyer network effects that drives that growth.\nAs an example of growing supply, over the 60 business days -- the last 60 business days in Q3 or the total 60 business days in Q3, we communicated\nover 50 launches and expansions of airline supply to our customers ranging from expanded geographies to new services from existing airlines. In\nother words, new airline capacity was added to our network almost every day, even if there wasn't a brand-new airline.\nOn another note, during Q3, Freightos again hosted our very own annual FreighTech conference near Barcelona. It's exciting to see that Freightos\ncan bring together leaders across the logistics industry to align on the industry vision and road map for digitalizing international freight. This event,\nof course, also fosters closer engagement with our customers at a top executive level.\nAnd now to provide more detail on our financial performance in Q3, I'll hand over to Ran.\n4\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Our third-quarter results surpassed expectations across all metrics. We exceeded our guidance for transaction and outperformed\non gross booking value, driven by high transaction volumes and elevated market rates.\nRevenue grew at the fastest pace since going public, highlighting the adoption of our platform and the strength of our execution. Operational\nimprovements and lower cost of goods sold also resulted in significant better-than-expected adjusted EBITDA, continuing the previous trend and\nkeeping us on track to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA by the end of 2026 and to get there with cash at hand.\nRevenue for Q3 '24 was $6.2 million, reflecting a 21% year-over-year increase, driven by strong performance across both transactional and subscription\nrevenue. Platform revenue grew by 29% year over year to $2.3 million, with WebCargo continuing to lead growth through high transaction volumes.\nSolutions revenue increased by 17% year over year to $3.9 million, supported by the steady expansion of SaaS offering and early contribution from\nthe Shipsta integration. These results reflect the growing adoption of Freightos' platform and our ability to scale effectively while meeting the\ndiverse needs of our customers.\nGross margins in Q3 again showed significant improvement with IFRS gross margins rising to 65% compared to 54.9% in Q3 of '23 and non-IFRS\ngross margins reaching 72.7%, up from 69.5% last year. These gains reflect Freightos' focus on scaling efficiently while maintaining a disciplined\napproach to cost management.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Q3 '24 improved significantly to negative $2.8 million, outperforming our guidance range of negative $3.4 million to $3.3\nmillion and representing a $1.3 million improvement year over year compared to negative $4.1 million in Q3 of '23.\nThis improvement was driven by a combination of revenue growth, improved gross margins and disciplined expense management. These results\nhighlight the scalability of our platform and our ability to maintain cost efficiency as we grow.\nDuring the quarter, we paid approximately $3.4 million in cash for the acquisition of Shipsta as well as some shares, reflecting the acquisition\nconsideration after closing adjustment but before holdbacks. Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, Freightos held $41.3 million in cash and short-term\ndeposits, providing a solid foundation to continue execution on our growth strategy. This strong cash position gives us the confidence to achieve\npositive adjusted EBITDA by the end of '26 without requiring additional funding.\nOur Q4 '24 guidance reflects continued strong momentum as we close out the year with several metrics adjusted upwards. Transactions are now\nexpected to range between 338,500 and 348,500. This guidance is narrowing upwards compared to previous expectations and reflecting year-over-year\ngrowth of 18% to 21%.\nGross booking value guidance has been increased to $257 million to $265 million, representing year-over-year growth of 37% to 41%. Revenue\nguidance has been narrowed upwards to $6.4 million to $6.5 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 21% to 24%.\nFinally, adjusted EBITDA guidance has been improved to a range of negative $3.2 million to negative $3.1 million, reflecting further operational\nefficiencies and disciplined cost management. We are very pleased to be able to improve the guidance on adjusted EBITDA despite the fact that\nwe will be consolidating Shipsta for the full quarter for the first time, together with some hiring done to support the year to come.\nWe're now finalizing budget planning and business planning for 2025, and we expect to continue to grow momentum of Q3 and Q4 throughout\n2025.\nAs Zvi mentioned, having built the Freightos financial operations to be a well-oiled machine and ensuring that the company is on a strong growth\npath and fully funded to breakeven, I feel it is an appropriate time for me to leave and pursue a new opportunity. It's been a privilege to work with\nZvi and the talented Freightos team, and I look forward to remaining a true supporter and shareholder of the company.\n5\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

I want to take a moment to recognize Ran's contributions to Freightos. Since joining in 2016, Ran has been instrumental in shaping\nFreightos' financial operations, including our public listing on Nasdaq, strategic acquisitions, and consistent growth. His leadership has left Freightos\nfinancially strong and well positioned for continued growth. Ran, thanks for your dedication and the impact you've had on Freightos' success. We\nwish you all the best in your next chapter.\nA search is underway for a replacement, and we have a strong finance team who will continue managing all operations during the transition. Ran\nis committed to be available and engaged as needed throughout Q1 as well. And I'm excited to bring some fresh talent and new ideas on to the\nexecutive team.\nWe're in the midst of 2025 planning and budgeting, and I can tell you that the team is very excited about the product road map and commercial\ninitiatives we're planning for 2025. And we look forward to sharing those during upcoming investor calls.\nAnd now, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\nAnat Earon-Heilborn - Freightos Ltd - Investor Relations\n(Operator Instructions) In the meantime, I will read a question that came in the chat. So I guess it goes to Ran. Why is EBITDA guidance down for\nQ4 over Q3 despite increased revenue?\nRan Shalev - Freightos Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Thanks, Anat. So it derives mainly from two things. One is --\nAnat Earon-Heilborn - Freightos Ltd - Investor Relations\nRan, we can't hear you.\nZvi Schreiber - Freightos Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nI hear Ran.\nRan Shalev - Freightos Ltd - Chief Financial Officer\nCan you hear me okay?\nZvi Schreiber - Freightos Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I hear you, Ran.\n6\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

Good. So I'll start from the beginning. So it mainly drives from two things. One is we are -- for the first time, we are consolidating Shipsta for\nthe whole quarter.\nI may remind you that we closed the deal in middle of August. So in Q3, we only consolidated them for half a quarter. This time, it's a full quarter.\nAs you all know, they are still burning some cash, and we are helping them, but they are supposed to be breaking even in 2025 and also giving us\nsome free cash flow already in 2025.\nSo the support that the Freightos Group gives them for Q4, together with the fact that we are doing some staffing, some hiring to support the\ngrowth expected in 2025 in sales and marketing mainly, those are the two elements that slightly increases the EBITDA in Q4.\nAnat Earon-Heilborn - Freightos Ltd - Investor Relations\nOkay. Our next call will come from the line of Jason Helfstein. Just a minute.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co Inc - Analyst\nThanks. Can you hear me okay?\nAnat Earon-Heilborn - Freightos Ltd - Investor Relations\nYes. All good.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co Inc - Analyst\nOkay. So a few questions. First, can you just give us some broad perspectives, like what does the Trump administration in your mind mean for the\nindustry? So just broadly.\nSecond, I know it's early, but if you have any initial thoughts about next year from a growth and a margin standpoint. Obviously, you've given us\nthe commentary on EBITDA.\nAnd then third, specifically around the guide. Basically, you're increasing this year's GBV by 8%, but you're keeping revenue guidance unchanged.\nSo just maybe talk about the dynamics there. Thank you.\nZvi Schreiber - Freightos Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Jason. Yeah, and I see on the chat that Mike asked the same as your first question about the Trump administration. So let me start with\nthat.\nLook, of course, we don't know fully. I can say a few comments to put it in context. First of all, during the first Trump administration, there were a\nlot of tariffs imposed. At that time, they did not in any way reduce the trade with China or with anywhere else. So that was the experience in the\nfirst Trump administration.\nOf course, we don't know if the tariffs are a lot higher, then perhaps this time, they will affect it. But our experience last time was that there wasn't\nan effect. It wasn't a dampening of trade or freight.\n7\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

So\nalthough we're the leaders in digital, certainly for air cargo and ocean is just getting started in a way, still 98% or something of the industry is offline.\nSo we have huge growth room here.\nNow if international trade and international freight goes up a few percent like it usually does, then great. If it goes down a few percent, it doesn't\nreally matter. It doesn't make a material difference to our opportunity because there's just so much to digitalize even if the industry trends down\nfor a little bit.\nHaving said that, world trade has been growing very strongly for decades. So I don't know if the Trump policies will dampen it somewhat, but I\nwouldn't bet against world trade in general, even if it goes down by a few percentage points for a while.\nRegarding your second question, so we're not putting out -- obviously, we'll put out guidance for 2025 next quarter, but I can say that we're very\nexcited about 2025. We hope and expect to grow faster in 2025 than we did this year.\nAnd in terms of EBITDA, you should see -- we've said that we expect to break even by the end of 2026. So you should see us in 2025 trending from\nwhere we are now to towards the roughly getting us halfway towards the zero. But that's very rough. We'll put out specific guidance in the Q1 call\nfor the year.\nJason, I'm sorry, I don't think I caught your third question. Could you repeat it?\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co Inc - Analyst\nSure. Yeah. So you raised the full-year gross bookings, I think it's by 8%, but you're not changing the guidance or the revenue guidance. So maybe\njust talk about the dynamic there.\nZvi Schreiber - Freightos Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I mean the reason is -- Ran, tell me if you want to add anything to this, but I'll say that a lot of -- as you probably know, Jason, the GBV went\nup, a, because transactions were performing strongly; and b, because the prices in the market are a little higher than we expected.\nAs I said earlier, that's partly due to the fact that the Suez Canal, believe it or not, has been virtually closed for more than a year and is still not\nfunctioning, plus some demand from e-commerce like Temu and SHEIN taking up some capacity on air.\nSo the rates are a bit higher. But a fair proportion of our transactional revenue, of our platform revenue is, in fact, flat fees per transaction. So a lot\nof it is not actually tied to the price. Some of it is. But that's why when prices in the market are higher than we expected, it only -- only to a limited\nextent flows through to our platform revenue.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co Inc - Analyst\nRight. Yeah. And just maybe one quick follow-up. If the canal was to reopen, like how do you think that impacts next year?\nZvi Schreiber - Freightos Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I think it would -- I think it would actually be good -- net good for us. I mean it would definitely cause -- almost certainly would cause the\nocean prices to ease, to go down, so that would have a small negative effect. But there would also be some good positive effects. It could probably\nincrease volumes in the industry to some extent. And it would free up some air cargo.\n8\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv.

So we'd be quite happy to see the air cargo patterns normalizing a bit.\nSo it would have a -- I think it would obviously be good for the world. But for us, it would have a mixed effect, probably a slight net positive, I would\nthink.\nJason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co Inc - Analyst\nAppreciate it. Thank you.\nZvi Schreiber - Freightos Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nAnat Earon-Heilborn - Freightos Ltd - Investor Relations\nOkay. Thanks. The next question will come from Logan Lillehaug. Please unmute.\nLogan Lillehaug - Craig-Hallum Capital Group - Analyst\nHey. Good morning, guys. This is Logan on for George. So yeah, my first question is on Shipsta. I'm just wondering if you can give us a little more\ninformation on what the early takeaways are as you try to go cross-sell that with your existing customers. I'm just curious what the response has\nbeen.\nAnd then the follow-up to that would be, I think you guys had said $800,000 was the contribution you expected in the remainder of this year. Is\nthat still a good number to use for Shipsta?\nZvi Schreiber - Freightos Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nSo the second question, I'll defer for Ran, and I don't know if we want to give an update on that because Shipsta is rapidly being integrated into\nour solutions segment. And so going forward, we're not planning to break out Shipsta revenue because the products are already getting tied\ntogether and sometimes we'll be doing more and more.\nI guess the answer to your first question is we'll be doing more and more joint deals. So it won't always make sense to break it out. So I'm not sure\nif we want to give an update on that specifically because it's becoming less and less relevant in a way.\nOverall, but going back to your first question, overall, it's going well. I mean it's only been -- we only closed it in August, so that's three months ago.\nAnd these are enterprise deals, so they take time. But already, Shipsta has closed several purchase orders on their own since we acquired them,\nwhich was good momentum.\nAnd we've already started several discussions of cross-selling in both directions, both us talking to -- us introducing our product to their customers\nand vice versa.\nI say there, but it's, of course, us -- it's all us now. So the cross-selling, there's already some concrete cross-selling opportunities. Given that these\nare enterprise deals, it will take some time to actually get purchase orders.\n9\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.

So far, it's living up to our expectations, and the customers definitely understand the enterprise shippers, the big importers\nand exporters definitely understand the value of how these products complement each other.\nLogan Lillehaug - Craig-Hallum Capital Group - Analyst\nOkay. Understood. And then just one other for me. On the e2open integration last week, I'm just curious what you think that maybe does to your\npipeline of carriers. I know you've talked about it being delayed a little bit with some of the internal projects that they have going, but do you think\nit could speed up the pipeline, I guess, at all?\nZvi Schreiber - Freightos Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So actually, to make a distinction, so e2open is -- they have products for freight forwarders and for shippers, in other words, importers and\nexporters. And we partnered with them on that side. They won't help us as far as I know with airlines specifically.\nAirlines are going well. Like I said, we launched Qantas, which is a big partner. We've been launching new -- you don't even see it -- we don't even\nput out press releases, but almost every day, we add new countries or new products. So that's going fine.\nAnd even those big airlines that are delayed, it's happening. They just had some delays on their IT projects. So airlines is going very well.\ne2open is specifically -- they're a fairly big player in software for supply chain. And specifically, some of the big freight forwarders that we work\nwith, one which has publicly mentioned it is Crane, are using them. And so it's part of our strategy. We've done integrations into other leading\nsoftware systems. We want to play nice with the ecosystem.\nOur customers want us -- want our Freightos product to work well with their suite of other products. And so it's part of an ongoing strategy, which\nI think we're doing well to make sure that our customers can use our software together with the other software that they have.\nLogan Lillehaug - Craig-Hallum Capital Group - Analyst\nGot it. Thank you.\nZvi Schreiber - Freightos Ltd - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Logan.\nAnat Earon-Heilborn - Freightos Ltd - Investor Relations\nOkay. That concludes the Q&A session. Thanks, everyone. Have a good week.\n10\nREFINITIV STREETEVENTS | www.refinitiv.com | Contact Us\n©2024 Refinitiv. All rights reserved.
