(NASDAQ: MRAM), the world’s leading developer and manufacturer of magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) persistent memory solutions, today announced preliminary unaudited financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“We are pleased to report third quarter revenue in-line with our guidance and GAAP net income per diluted share ahead of our guidance, driven by our new contract wins, and our cost containment efforts,” said Sanjeev Aggarwal, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We had new contracts during the quarter, showcasing the strength of our business and the extensive range of our product portfolio. We continue to have meaningful customer interactions, which we believe will turn into design wins for our PERSYST xSPI STT-MRAM products and begin to contribute to revenue in 2025 and beyond.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\n  * Total revenue of $12.1 million, compared to $16.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * MRAM product sales, which includes both Toggle and STT-MRAM revenue, of $10.4 million, compared to $13.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Licensing, royalty, patent, and other revenue of $1.7 million, compared to $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Gross margin of 49.2%, compared to 60.2% in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * GAAP operating expenses of $8.1 million, compared to $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * GAAP net income of $2.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $4.2 million, compared to $4.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n\n\n\n“We are pleased to end the quarter with a strong balance sheet and a return to profitability,” said Matt Tenorio, Everspin’s Interim Chief Financial Officer. “We remain focused on scaling our business and converting additional design wins to revenue.” \n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nFor the fourth quarter 2024, Everspin expects total revenue in a range of $12 million to $13 million and GAAP net income per diluted share to be between $0.00 and $0.05. \n\nThis outlook is dependent on Everspin's current expectations, which may be impacted by, among other things, evolving external conditions, such as pandemics or endemics, local safety guidelines, worsening impacts due to supply chain constraints or interruptions, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, instability in the Middle East, recent market volatility, semiconductor downturn and the other risk factors described in Everspin's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC during 2024, as well as in its subsequent filings with the SEC. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nEverspin supplements the reporting of its financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) with Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Everspin defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring costs (if any). \n\nEverspin’s management and board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA to understand and evaluate its operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve its annual budget and to develop short-term and long-term operating and financing plans. Accordingly, Everspin believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information for investors in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as superior to, or as a substitute for, net income reported in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently, which limits the usefulness of this measure for comparisons with such other companies. Everspin encourages investors to review its financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nEverspin will host a conference call for analysts and investors on Wednesday, October 30, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. \n\nDial-in details: To access the call by phone, please go to this [link](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fregister.vevent.com%2Fregister%2FBIef30d383b20d4d768a8f386408565ed1&esheet=54144878&newsitemid=20241030188457&lan=en-US&anchor=link&index=1&md5=30499716c97f088b4355200275a5e1f8) and you will be provided with dial-in details.
