Ultimately, we have never been more confident in our ability to translate our work into potential medicines for patients. These developments will drive additional value beyond the clinical trial catalysts we’ve seen in the last few months, including encouraging data from our Phase 2 trial in CCM, the first patient dosed in our Phase 2 trial in _C. difficile_ infection, and our IND clearance for a Phase 1/2 trial in biomarker-enriched solid tumors and lymphoma (Target RBM39).\"\n\n![Recursion's internal pipeline.](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/3213e888-501b-4736-adad-9672e8e8792a/revised.jpg)\n\n**Summary of Business Highlights**\n\n  * **Pipeline**\n    * **Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM) (REC-994):** In September, we announced that our Phase 2 SYCAMORE clinical trial, which is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of two doses of REC-994 in participants with CCM, met its primary endpoint of safety and demonstrated encouraging trends in objective MRI-based exploratory efficacy measures at the highest dose, seeing reductions in lesion volume and hemosiderin ring size. We plan to meet with the FDA and advance the development of REC-994 for the potential treatment of symptomatic CCM in subsequent studies. We also plan to present the Phase 2 data at a medical conference and publish results in a peer reviewed scientific journal.\n    * **Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) (REC-2282):** Our adaptive Phase 2/3 POPLAR clinical trial is an open label, two part study of REC-2282 in participants with progressive NF2-mutated meningiomas. Part 1 of the study explores two doses of REC-2282 in adult and pediatric participants. Enrollment of adult patients in Part 1 of the study is complete (n=24). We expect to share an update in Q4 2024.\n    * **Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) (REC-4881):** Our Phase 1b/2 TUPELO clinical trial is an open label, multicenter, two part study of REC-4881 in participants with FAP. Part 1 is complete and enrollment in Part 2 has commenced. We expect to share Phase 2 safety and preliminary efficacy data in H1 2025.\n    * **APC or AXIN1 Mutant Cancers (REC-4881):** Our Phase 2 LILAC clinical trial is an open label, multicenter study of REC-4881 in participants with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic cancer with AXIN1 or APC mutations. We expect to share Phase 2 safety and preliminary efficacy data in H1 2025.\n    * **_Clostridioides difficile_****Infection (REC-3964):** In October, we announced the first patient dosed in our Phase 2 clinical study of REC-3964, a potential first-in-class, oral, non-antibiotic small molecule for recurrent _Clostridioides difficile_ infection. Our Phase 2 ALDER clinical trial is an open-label, multicenter randomized study designed to evaluate rates of recurrence with REC-3964 at two doses compared with an observational cohort after patients have achieved initial cure with vancomycin. We expect a preliminary readout by the end of 2025.\n    * **Biomarker-Enriched Solid Tumors and Lymphoma, Target RBM39 (REC-1245):** In October, we announced FDA clearance of an IND for REC-1245, a potential first-in-class RBM39 degrader for biomarker-enriched solid tumors and lymphoma. RBM39 is a novel CDK12-adjacent target identified by the Recursion OS. We plan to initiate dosing of Phase 1/2 in Q4 2024 to evaluate REC-1245. Phase 1 data from the dose-escalation portion of the study is expected by the end of 2025.\n    * **Undisclosed Indication in Fibrosis, Target Epsilon:** We are advancing our lead candidate and expect an IND submission in early 2025.\n  * **Partnerships**\n    * **Transformational Collaborations:** We continue to advance efforts to discover potential new therapeutics with our strategic partners in the areas of undruggable oncology (Bayer) as well as neuroscience and a single indication in gastrointestinal oncology (Roche-Genentech). In August, our first neuroscience phenomap was optioned by Roche-Genentech for $30 million as part of a fee structure that could exceed a total of $500 million across multiple maps. In the near-term, there is the potential for option exercises associated with partnership programs and map building initiatives or data sharing.\n  * **Platform**\n    * **Google Cloud Collaboration: **We entered into an expanded collaboration with Google Cloud in order to leverage Google Cloud's technologies to support our drug discovery platform. This strategic partnership includes exploring generative AI capabilities, including Gemini models, to support the RecursionOS, drive improved search and access with BigQuery, and help scale compute resources. In addition, we will also explore making some of our AI models available on Google Cloud.\n\n\n\n**Additional Corporate Updates**\n\n  * **Combination with Exscientia: **A special shareholder meeting will be held on Nov 12, 2024 at 5:00 pm Eastern Time / 3:00 pm Mountain Time in order to vote on Recursion’s proposed combination with Exscientia. Shareholders may vote in advance of this meeting by telephone, mail, or online at [www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/​RXRX2024SM](http://www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/%E2%80%8BRXRX2024SM). Following this shareholder meeting, we expect the date of the scheme of arrangement to be Nov 20, 2024.\n  * **L(earnings) Call:** We will not host a L(earnings) Call in relation to the business updates and financials for the third quarter. Instead, we expect to host an Update Call around the date of the scheme of arrangement which is expected to be Nov 20, 2024. We will broadcast the live stream from Recursion’s X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and YouTube accounts and there will be opportunities to ask questions of the company.\n  * **Chief People & Impact Officer: **In October, Erica Fox joined Recursion as its Chief People & Impact Officer. Ms. Fox has over 20 years experience as a people and systems strategist having previously led various human resource functions at technology companies Primer.ai and Google.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * **Cash Position:** Cash and cash equivalents were $427.6 million as of September 30, 2024.\n  * **Revenue:** Total revenue was $26.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due to revenue recognized from our partnership with Roche & Genentech and the $30.0 million acceptance fee for the completion of a neuroscience phenomap.\n  * **Research and Development Expenses:** Research and development expenses were $74.6 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $70.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was driven by our platform and personnel costs as we continue to expand and upgrade our platform, including our chemical technology, machine learning, and transcriptomics platform.\n  * **General and Administrative Expenses:** General and administrative expenses were $37.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $29.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses compared to prior period was primarily driven by an increase in software and lease expense.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss was $95.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss of $93.0 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * **Net Cash :** Net cash used in operating activities was $59.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $72.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. The change in net cash used in operating activities compared to the same period last year was the net result of the $30.0 million acceptance fee received during the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by the higher operating costs incurred for research and development and general and administrative activities.\n\n\n\n**About Recursion**[Recursion](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=YJh0TfXTomQnc6dJi25AwK2r9r7MWeklVLFuuYz8hHaxDmd_P8su_xbsamih8FLXhmRVk_mLadc4TxIYzpaInw==) is a clinical stage TechBio company leading the space by decoding biology to industrialize drug discovery.
